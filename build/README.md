the build script ```build.sh``` shall use XeLaTeX from LaTeX package to build the generated sermonXYZ.tex

sermonXYZ.tex files are generated by ```../projects/generate_sermon.py```.

any manual modification in the tex source file here would be overwritten by the python script

so try to do changes in ```../projects/``` folder
