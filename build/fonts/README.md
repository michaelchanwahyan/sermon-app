### fonts folder from Talmudifier

thanks to Esther Alter's contribution in his
[talmudifier](https://github.com/subalterngames/talmudifier) project, the
afterword page could hugely benefit from his talmudified layout while chinese
characters' integration is referenced from the experience in another
[Bible](https://github.com/michaelchanwahyan/Bible.git) project.
