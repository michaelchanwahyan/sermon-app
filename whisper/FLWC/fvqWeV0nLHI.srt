1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 If he would love me, it would be easier for him to sacrifice than his Christian friend.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 I think so. It's true.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 Let's see if people would love you.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 I think I am okay.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 Okay, now I know that many of our Darling sisters would like to know what we, the Wooden Knight, usually talk about.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 We are going to tell you now.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 Today is the first episode of "Wooden Knight Talks".

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 I am so nervous.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 I am also nervous.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 We are going to talk about nonsense.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 We are going to talk about nonsense.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Although there is some meaning in our nonsense.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 There should be some meaning.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 I just said some professional terms.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 I don't know what it is.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 But many people would like to know what we usually talk about.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 So we have this program.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Let's listen to it.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 I want to ask if you have watched the episode of "The King and the Queen"?

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Have you watched it?

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 I am not going to say it. Have you watched it?

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Of course, I have.

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Sometimes there is an event like this.

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 You don't say it.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 I have seen that there are many condoms in the ruins.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 So I don't think it is as simple as "free hug, free kiss".

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 What did you see? You saw people in the ruins.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 I saw people in the ruins.

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 I didn't see anything.

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 Why don't you brief me what you saw?

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 You didn't see anything?

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 You are kidding.

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 You should go back and watch it.

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 I don't remember.

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 I watched a YouTuber.

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 I am not going to advertise for him.

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 He spent half an hour on this video.

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 He went to Kwan Bin when the ruins were being demolished.

39
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 Many girls and boys were sitting there.

40
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 He said that he could see "free kiss" and "free hug" on the phone.

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 He interviewed the young people.

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 He asked them what they were doing.

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 He interviewed the young people.

44
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 The youngest was 14 years old.

45
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 Was he 14 years old?

46
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 He was 17 years old.

47
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 He was 22 years old.

48
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 He sat there.

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 There was a store that was open 24 hours a day.

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 He was selling alcohol to the young people.

51
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 So you could sell alcohol to the young people?

52
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 I don't know.

53
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 I don't know.

54
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 They were drinking.

55
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 They were drinking.

56
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 He asked how many girls they had hugged.

57
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 A young man said that he had hugged 70 girls.

58
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 70 girls.

59
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 He asked how many girls he had kissed.

60
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 He said that he had kissed more than 10 girls.

61
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 The YouTuber asked him if he was happy to kiss more than 10 girls.

62
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 He said that he was happy.

63
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 I know that some people asked him.

64
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 He said that he was happy.

65
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 I didn't see this.

66
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Some people said that he was hiding it.

67
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 The young man said that he was happy to kiss more than 10 girls.

68
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 He said that he was happy to kiss more than 10 girls.

69
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 So the event was a competition?

70
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 No.

71
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 You are exaggerating.

72
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 I heard that there was a competition.

73
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 Where was it?

74
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 It was in Australia.

75
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 There was a competition in Hong Kong.

76
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 They gave you 300 dollars to support the youth.

77
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 No, it was not like that.

78
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 What was it?

79
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 I really don't know.

80
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 At first, I thought it was a free hug event.

81
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 They gave you the power to support.

82
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 It was a free hug.

83
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 They gave you the power to support.

84
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 I think that was not the event.

85
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 It was a free hug.

86
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 I think that was not the event.

87
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 I think that was not the event.

88
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 I think that was not the event.

89
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 I think that was not the event.

90
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 I think that was not the event.

91
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 I think that was not the event.

92
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 I think that was not the event.

93
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 I think that was not the event.

94
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 I think that was not the event.

95
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 I think that was not the event.

96
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 I think that was not the event.

97
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 I think that was not the event.

98
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 They gave you a free kiss and a hug.

99
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 You walked by and someone said you could come.

100
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 You walked by and someone said you could come.

101
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 They gave you a free kiss and a hug.

102
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 They gave you a free kiss and a hug.

103
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 I want to throw up.

104
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 Why?

105
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 Because I was 22 years old.

106
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 He said that he gave me a free kiss.

107
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 He said that he gave me a free kiss.

108
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 I want to throw up.

109
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 I want to throw up.

110
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 Some 14-year-old girls wrote that you could get a free kiss.

111
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 Some 14-year-old girls wrote that you could get a free kiss.

112
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 I don't know how the international rules work.

113
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 I don't know how the international rules work.

114
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 If I am wrong, I will be punished.

115
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 I think that was the event.

116
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 I came and I could kiss.

117
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 I came and I could kiss.

118
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 I don't know if I should hug or kiss.

119
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 I don't know if I should hug or kiss.

120
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 I don't know if I should hug or kiss.

121
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 I don't know if I should hug or kiss.

122
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 I don't know if I should hug or kiss.

123
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 I don't know if I should hug or kiss.

124
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 I don't know if I should hug or kiss.

125
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 I don't know if I should hug or kiss.

126
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 What do you want?

127
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 Or what do you accept?

128
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 They also said that if you feel right, you should go to the disabled.

129
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 They also said that if you feel right, you should go to the disabled.

130
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 That's what they meant.

131
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 I don't know if it's legal.

132
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 I don't know if it's legal.

133
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 Is it legal to go to the disabled?

134
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 Is it legal to go to the disabled?

135
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 It shouldn't be legal, right?

136
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 But the question is, how do I know what he's doing in the disabled?

137
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 But the question is, how do I know what he's doing in the disabled?

138
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 You can't just think about it.

139
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 You can't just think about it.

140
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 You can't just think about it.

141
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 If it's about money, it's not legal.

142
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 If it's not about money, it's not legal.

143
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 If it's not about money, it's not legal.

144
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 I don't know.

145
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 I don't know.

146
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 I think you should think about it personally.

147
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 You have a daughter.

148
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 You have a daughter and a son.

149
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 You are the same age.

150
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 You are the same age.

151
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 You are the same age.

152
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 Your daughter is only 14 years old.

153
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 Your daughter or son is playing at the beach.

154
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 Your daughter or son is playing at the beach.

155
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 How do you know?

156
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 Is he a participant or an event organizer?

157
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 Is he a participant or an event organizer?

158
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 Is he a participant or an event organizer?

159
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 Is he a participant or an event organizer?

160
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 Is he a participant or an event organizer?

161
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 Is he a participant or an event organizer?

162
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 Is he a participant or an event organizer?

163
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 Is he a participant or an event organizer?

164
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 Is he a participant or an event organizer?

165
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 Is he a participant or an event organizer?

166
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 The Gui Fang is a place for drinking alcohol.

167
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 The Gui Fang is a place for drinking alcohol.

168
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 But now it is a young generation version.

169
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 But now it is a young generation version.

170
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 It is not a place for drinking alcohol.

171
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 It is a place for drinking alcohol.

172
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 It is a place for drinking alcohol.

173
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 It is a place for drinking alcohol.

174
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 It is a place for drinking alcohol.

175
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 It is a place for drinking alcohol.

176
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 It is a place for drinking alcohol.

177
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 It is a place for drinking alcohol.

178
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 It is a place for drinking alcohol.

179
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 It is a place for drinking alcohol.

180

 Even though we are very positive,

756
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 even though we are very positive,

757
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 there is a very stingy person.

758
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 I think I will be suspicious.

759
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 You will be suspicious.

760
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 But you will be willing to...

761
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 I always talk about this witness.

762
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 When I was in middle school,

763
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 I had a classmate.

764
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 He has a very strong body.

765
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000

766
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 He is very fat.

767
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 Is he a boy or a girl?

768
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 He is a boy.

769
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 He has some physical problems.

770
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 He is a smelly person.

771
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 He is a very unhygienic person.

772
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000

774
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 He is very good at Chinese.

775
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 His Chinese is very bad and his face is very smelly.

776
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 If your classmate saw this,

777
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 he will know that you are talking about him.

778
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 Don't say that.

779
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 He has a bad temper.

780
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 He has a bad temper.

781
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 When he was in the class,

782
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 I was always in the queue.

783
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 I was in the queue.

784
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 I was sitting next to him.

785
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 I was sitting next to him.

786
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 I was sitting next to him.

787
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 Why did you sit next to him?

788
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 I was willing to sit next to him.

789
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 Did he feel you?

790
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 If you ask me to hug him,

791
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 I will do it.

792
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 I will do it.

793
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 I will do it.

794
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 You will always hug him?

795
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 I will always hug him.

796
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 I don't have a wife.

797
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 I don't have a wife.

798
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 I don't have a wife.

799
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 I will always hug him.

800
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 I will always hug him.

801
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 I will always hug him.

802
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 I will always hug him.

803
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 If you feel warm when you hug him,

804
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 If you feel warm when you hug him,

805
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 I think you can hug him.

806
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 But not for the official ceremony.

807
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 I don't know the purpose of the official ceremony.

808
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 I don't know the purpose of the official ceremony.

809
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 I don't know the purpose of the official ceremony.

810
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 I think it is a way to measure our life.

 What do you think?

868
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 I haven't thought about it.

869
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 You have to think about it.

870
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 You are 10 years old now.

871
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 I will think about it in middle school.

872
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 I haven't thought about it yet.

873
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 It is hard to think about it.

874
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 I will not think about it.

875
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 I think the older the church is,

876
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 the more people will leave the culture.

877
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 I don't know what they say.

878
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 I think about how they express their thoughts

879
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 I think about how they express their thoughts

880
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 I think about how they express their thoughts

881
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 I used to be a middle school student.

882
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 I used to be a middle school student.

883
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 I used to be a middle school student.

884
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 If I am still working as a middle school student,

885
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 If I am still working as a middle school student,

886
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 I think their difficulties are big.

887
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 I think their difficulties are big.

888
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 You will understand this culture.

889
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 You will understand this culture.

890
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 But in my belief,

891
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 I think we should protect ourselves.

892
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 I think we should protect ourselves.

893
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 We should not be so easy to be hurt.

894
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 Now, everyone says

895
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 you should not protect yourself,

896
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 you should choose.

897
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 Because they have no belief.

898
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 Because they have no belief.

899
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 They don't care if it is a no.

900
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 They don't care if it is a no.

901
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 The government is forcing you to do something

902
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 The government is forcing you to do something

903
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 It is meaningless.

904
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 When the youth tell you to make a choice,

905
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 you have to make the choice.

906
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 You know the consequences,

907
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 you have to bear the consequences.

 you have to bear the consequences.

922
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 You have to bear the consequences.

 (Cantonese)

 We really need to talk about this and find some ideas.

 No, no. Let's talk about next month. We have some forecasts.

 Next month we have to listen to some romantic stories.

971
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 Are you going to send me a kidnapping notice?

972

 No!

973
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 I really want to send you a kidnapping notice!

974
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 Who's story is it?

975
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 You!

976
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 Me?

977
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 I can tell you.

978
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 I'm also ready to talk about it.

979
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 Oh, you aren't ready?

980
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 You have four women's hands.

981
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 One of them is me.

982
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 Yes!

983

 Yes, yes.

989
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 We have prepared a lot for you.

990
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 Not for 3 years.

991
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 It's good.

992
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 We can keep you in the loop.

993
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 Yes, not for 3 years.

994
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 And you can leave us a message if you have any questions.

995

 You can ask us.

996
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 She wants to smoke.

997
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 You can ask her.

998
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 You can ask her by her name.

999
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 Of course, we have this show.

1000
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 It's called "The Story of a Lover's Dream".

1001
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 "The Story of a Lover's Dream" about your love story.

1002
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 Not me.

1003
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 It's us.

1004
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 We want to know more about you.

1005
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 I have told you.

1006
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 No, you haven't told us.

1007
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 Who have you told?

1008
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000

1012
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 God saved me.

1013
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000

 Don't tell us now.

1017
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 Tell us next month.

1018
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000

 I have told you.

1024
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 Where have you told?

1025
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 Who have you told?

1026
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 What?

1027
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 I have told.

1028
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 I have told in the beginning.

1029
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 No, you have told when you were talking with the pastor.

1030
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 No, no.

1031
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 I have not told now.

1032
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 I have not told.

1033
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 I have told publicly to the whole world.

1034
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 No one has heard.

1035
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 Anyway, next month, please continue to pay attention to our "The Story of a Lover's Dream".

1036
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 It's almost time.

00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 You can search for "The Story of a Lover's Dream" on the Internet.

1038
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 I have to read it again.

00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 You have read it completely.

1040
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 You have read it completely.

1041
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 I have read it for the first 10 minutes.

1042
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 I don't know what you are talking about.

1043
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 I really don't know what happened.

1044
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 Yes, it's not at all the same as that time.

1045
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 So, we as YouTubers also have to say "like", "share", "subscribe" and "subscribe".

1046
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 We have a Q&A session.

1047
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 You can continue to dedicate it to us.

1048
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 Okay, we will talk again next time.

1049
