[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   If he would love me, it would be easier for him to sacrifice than his Christian friend.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   I think so. It's true.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Let's see if people would love you.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   I think I am okay.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   Okay, now I know that many of our Darling sisters would like to know what we, the Wooden Knight, usually talk about.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   We are going to tell you now.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   Today is the first episode of "Wooden Knight Talks".
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   I am so nervous.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   I am also nervous.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   We are going to talk about nonsense.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   We are going to talk about nonsense.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   Although there is some meaning in our nonsense.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   There should be some meaning.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   I just said some professional terms.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   I don't know what it is.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   But many people would like to know what we usually talk about.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   So we have this program.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   Let's listen to it.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   I want to ask if you have watched the episode of "The King and the Queen"?
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   Have you watched it?
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   I am not going to say it. Have you watched it?
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   Of course, I have.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Sometimes there is an event like this.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   You don't say it.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   I have seen that there are many condoms in the ruins.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   So I don't think it is as simple as "free hug, free kiss".
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   What did you see? You saw people in the ruins.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   I saw people in the ruins.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   I didn't see anything.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Why don't you brief me what you saw?
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   You didn't see anything?
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   You are kidding.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   You should go back and watch it.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   I don't remember.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   I watched a YouTuber.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   I am not going to advertise for him.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   He spent half an hour on this video.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   He went to Kwan Bin when the ruins were being demolished.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Many girls and boys were sitting there.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   He said that he could see "free kiss" and "free hug" on the phone.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   He interviewed the young people.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   He asked them what they were doing.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   He interviewed the young people.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   The youngest was 14 years old.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Was he 14 years old?
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   He was 17 years old.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   He was 22 years old.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   He sat there.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   There was a store that was open 24 hours a day.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   He was selling alcohol to the young people.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   So you could sell alcohol to the young people?
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   I don't know.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   I don't know.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   They were drinking.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   They were drinking.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   He asked how many girls they had hugged.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   A young man said that he had hugged 70 girls.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   70 girls.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   He asked how many girls he had kissed.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   He said that he had kissed more than 10 girls.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   The YouTuber asked him if he was happy to kiss more than 10 girls.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   He said that he was happy.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   I know that some people asked him.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   He said that he was happy.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   I didn't see this.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Some people said that he was hiding it.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   The young man said that he was happy to kiss more than 10 girls.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   He said that he was happy to kiss more than 10 girls.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   So the event was a competition?
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   No.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   You are exaggerating.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   I heard that there was a competition.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Where was it?
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   It was in Australia.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   There was a competition in Hong Kong.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   They gave you 300 dollars to support the youth.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   No, it was not like that.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   What was it?
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   I really don't know.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   At first, I thought it was a free hug event.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   They gave you the power to support.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   It was a free hug.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   They gave you the power to support.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   I think that was not the event.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   It was a free hug.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   I think that was not the event.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   I think that was not the event.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   I think that was not the event.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   I think that was not the event.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   I think that was not the event.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   I think that was not the event.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   I think that was not the event.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   I think that was not the event.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   I think that was not the event.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   I think that was not the event.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   I think that was not the event.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   I think that was not the event.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   They gave you a free kiss and a hug.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   You walked by and someone said you could come.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   You walked by and someone said you could come.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   They gave you a free kiss and a hug.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   They gave you a free kiss and a hug.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   I want to throw up.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Why?
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Because I was 22 years old.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   He said that he gave me a free kiss.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   He said that he gave me a free kiss.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   I want to throw up.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   I want to throw up.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   Some 14-year-old girls wrote that you could get a free kiss.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Some 14-year-old girls wrote that you could get a free kiss.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   I don't know how the international rules work.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   I don't know how the international rules work.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   If I am wrong, I will be punished.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   I think that was the event.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   I came and I could kiss.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   I came and I could kiss.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   I don't know if I should hug or kiss.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   I don't know if I should hug or kiss.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   I don't know if I should hug or kiss.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   I don't know if I should hug or kiss.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   I don't know if I should hug or kiss.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   I don't know if I should hug or kiss.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   I don't know if I should hug or kiss.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   I don't know if I should hug or kiss.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   What do you want?
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Or what do you accept?
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   They also said that if you feel right, you should go to the disabled.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   They also said that if you feel right, you should go to the disabled.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   That's what they meant.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   I don't know if it's legal.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   I don't know if it's legal.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Is it legal to go to the disabled?
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   Is it legal to go to the disabled?
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   It shouldn't be legal, right?
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   But the question is, how do I know what he's doing in the disabled?
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   But the question is, how do I know what he's doing in the disabled?
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   You can't just think about it.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   You can't just think about it.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   You can't just think about it.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   If it's about money, it's not legal.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   If it's not about money, it's not legal.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   If it's not about money, it's not legal.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   I don't know.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   I don't know.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   I think you should think about it personally.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   You have a daughter.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   You have a daughter and a son.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   You are the same age.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   You are the same age.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   You are the same age.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Your daughter is only 14 years old.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Your daughter or son is playing at the beach.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Your daughter or son is playing at the beach.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   How do you know?
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   Is he a participant or an event organizer?
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   Is he a participant or an event organizer?
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Is he a participant or an event organizer?

[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   Is he a participant or an event organizer?
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   The Gui Fang is a place for drinking alcohol.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   The Gui Fang is a place for drinking alcohol.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   But now it is a young generation version.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   But now it is a young generation version.

[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   Did he feel you?
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   If you ask me to hug him,
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   I will do it.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   I will do it.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   I will do it.

[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   I will always hug him.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   I don't have a wife.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   I don't have a wife.

[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   I will always hug him.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   If you feel warm when you hug him,
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   If you feel warm when you hug him,
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   I think you can hug him.

[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   You have to think about it.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   You are 10 years old now.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   I will think about it in middle school.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   I haven't thought about it yet.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   It is hard to think about it.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   I will not think about it.

[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   the more people will leave the culture.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   I don't know what they say.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   I think about how they express their thoughts
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   I think about how they express their thoughts
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   I think about how they express their thoughts
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   I used to be a middle school student.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   I used to be a middle school student.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   I used to be a middle school student.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   If I am still working as a middle school student,
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   If I am still working as a middle school student,
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   I think their difficulties are big.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   I think their difficulties are big.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   You will understand this culture.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   You will understand this culture.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   But in my belief,
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   I think we should protect ourselves.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   I think we should protect ourselves.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   We should not be so easy to be hurt.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   Now, everyone says
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   you should not protect yourself,
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   you should choose.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   Because they have no belief.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   Because they have no belief.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   They don't care if it is a no.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   They don't care if it is a no.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   The government is forcing you to do something
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   The government is forcing you to do something
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   It is meaningless.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   When the youth tell you to make a choice,
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   you have to make the choice.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   You know the consequences,
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   you have to bear the consequences.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   You know the consequences,
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   you have to bear the consequences.
