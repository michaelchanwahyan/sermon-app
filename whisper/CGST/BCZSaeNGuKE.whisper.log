[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.400]  (音樂)
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.520]  各位先生女士
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.440]  歡迎來到第二節
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.720]  Josephine So的文化與道德課程
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.240]  2023年
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.440]  由中國大學教學院主持
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.960]  本年我們的主題是《寫給我們聽的》
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.400]  The Old Testament as Christian Scripture
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.760]  Our keynote speaker is Reverend Dr. Christopher Wright
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.600]  the Global Ambassador and Ministry Director of Langham Partnership
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.400]  The two response speakers are Reverend Dr. Lawrence Koh
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.760]  and Dr. Johnson Yu
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.400]  Similar to the arrangement of the previous session
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.680]  there will be time for question and answer
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.000]  at the end of tonight's session
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.200]  Our ushers have memo pads ready for you
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.280]  to write down your questions
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.880]  or you can choose to come forward in person
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.880]  in the middle of the hall to ask
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.000]  Let me give you a little bit more introduction about Dr. Wright
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.760]  Dr. Wright is a messiologist
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.400]  He is an Anglican clergyman
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.880]  and also Old Testament scholar
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.920]  He has published extensively
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.520]  and two of his books
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.160]  namely 《宣教中的上帝》
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.560]  The Mission of God
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.120]  Unlocking the Bible's Grand Narrative
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.640]  and the other one
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.880]  《上帝子民的宣教使命》
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.600]  The Mission of God's People
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.080]  A Biblical Theology of the Church's Mission
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.440]  These two books have either been in the textbook
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.400]  or on the reading list
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.560]  of many of the mission-related courses
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.880]  taught here in CGST
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.360]  So it's a real pleasure to meet you in person, Dr. Wright
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.240]  and hear you lecture
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.840]  Earlier this afternoon
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.480]  Reverend Dr. Wright guided us
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.520]  in a reflection on how the Old Testament
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.240]  informs us about our Christian identity
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.080]  answering the question of who we are
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.920]  Upcoming in this session
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.320]  we'll be looking at what we are here for
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.000]  the Old Testament and Christian mission
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.120]  Mission to the Nations
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.760]  is not just a scholarly pursuit for Dr. Wright
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.280]  who is a missionary kid
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.800]  and had experience of teaching
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.840]  and living in India with his wife and kids
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.760]  as missionaries
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.000]  We are very much eager
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.280]  to hear his perspectives and findings
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.600]  It's very cold out there
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.000]  Let's extend a very warm welcome
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.240]  to Reverend Dr. Christopher Wright
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:57.440]  Thank you
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.680]  Thank you so much, Swans
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.000]  for that very warm welcome indeed
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.640]  Yes, actually this is the first time
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.440]  I've ever felt cold in Hong Kong
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.600]  I've been here many times
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.120]  but it's nearly always been very hot
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.280]  So it's actually quite a pleasure
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.680]  to be in a temperature a bit more like London
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.960]  where I left behind a few days ago
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.240]  Now in our first lecture
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.720]  we explored that theme
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.840]  as Professor Kwan said
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.360]  the theme of Christian identity
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.760]  And it was interesting that
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.400]  someone said to me just as we were going out
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.440]  that I kept on saying about identity
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.120]  is that who are we
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.360]  who are we as God's people
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.240]  And they said it's good to ask the question
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.360]  in that way rather than simply asking
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.960]  who am I
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.200]  Because so often that is the way we ask it
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.360]  as individuals
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.440]  we want our individual identity
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.120]  And just thinking about that
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.040]  Chance comment as we were leaving
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.320]  that of course who am I
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.400]  does depend as a Christian
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.320]  on who we are as the people of God
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.720]  But I argued then in that last lecture
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.160]  that we can't answer that question
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.720]  who are we as Christians as the church
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.840]  without going back to the texts
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.480]  and the images and the story
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.280]  and the metaphors of the Old Testament
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.280]  the scriptures of the Lord Jesus himself
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.880]  But there is a further dimension to that question
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.280]  asking that question who are we
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.400]  which has to do with the purpose
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.200]  of our existence as God's people in the world
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.120]  And there's some analogy here
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.800]  to things, human artifacts
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.760]  Because the only way to explain
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.720]  what something is
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.240]  if it's been manufactured
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.080]  is to understand what it's for
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.120]  You could have a clock
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.160]  and you could describe it
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.720]  I have a little one here
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.960]  It's a little box
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.320]  It's got a funny little face
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.080]  It's got numbers up to 12
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.880]  Why only 12?
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.880]  It's got two hands that go round and round
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.040]  But you haven't said what it is as a clock
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.680]  Until you say, ah, well, it's for telling the time
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.480]  That's its purpose of existence
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.320]  Is to help you know what time it is
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.880]  What is the purpose for which
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.600]  it's been designed and produced
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.000]  And so therefore we must ask
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.440]  if we claim that our identity
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.400]  is a people who are created by God
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.120]  as we said in our first lecture
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.800]  We have to further ask, yes, for what purpose
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.520]  What are we here for
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.720]  What is the reason for our existence
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:23.800]  and the purpose of being
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.160]  this unique people on the planet
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.320]  Or perhaps better to ask
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.800]  what was the purpose and goal
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.720]  objective of God himself
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.320]  the God of the Bible
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.640]  for which and within which
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.680]  he chose to create us as his people
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.360]  What is the mission of God
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.800]  to quote the title of a book
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.120]  that was just mentioned
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.960]  Well, the apostle Paul, of course, gives us
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.640]  what I think is perhaps the most
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.400]  succinct statement of the mission of God
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.640]  in Ephesians 1, verses 9 and 10
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:57.880]  where God says
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.120]  just a moment, I need to bring that on there, yes
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.800]  where God says this, I'm quoting
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.840]  or Paul says this, I'm quoting him
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.080]  he says, "God has made known to us
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.720]  the mystery of his will
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.120]  according to his good pleasure
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.640]  which he purposed in Christ"
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:12.640]  So when Paul's talking about
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:13.600]  the will of God there
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.440]  he doesn't mean his will for my life
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.800]  He's talking about God's great plan and purpose
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:18.880]  "to be put into effect
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.920]  when the times reach their fulfilment
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.240]  to bring unity to all things
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.760]  in heaven and on earth under Christ"
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.080]  And when Paul says
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.960]  all things in heaven and earth
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:30.600]  he means it
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.880]  He's talking about the whole creation
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.880]  And so God's plan, says Paul
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.280]  is to bring unity, reconciliation, healing
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.360]  to the whole creation
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.960]  in and through Christ
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.440]  That's the mission of God
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.960]  It's the redemption, the reconciliation
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.080]  of the creation that has been broken
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.400]  and fractured by sin and evil
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.840]  into the new creation
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.720]  which will be populated by the redeemed
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.480]  from every culture, tribe and nation
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.040]  through the cross and the resurrection
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.360]  of our Lord Jesus Christ
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.480]  I think that that
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.840]  that expression there in Ephesians 1
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.680]  is what Paul probably meant
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.120]  when he talked about in Acts 20
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.920]  about the whole counsel of God
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.360]  which he said he had preached
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.320]  to the people in Ephesus
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.360]  in Acts 20, verse 27
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.760]  He means the plan of God
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.000]  the purpose of God
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.440]  from what we would say
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.240]  from Genesis to Revelation
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.520]  the whole grand narrative of Scripture
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.360]  creation, fall, redemption
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.280]  and new creation
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:32.440]  all embraced and held together by Christ
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.160]  So the mission of God then
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.480]  is fundamentally the activity of God
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.320]  driving this story forward
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:39.520]  from its beginning
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.040]  through its multiple facets
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.640]  in the scriptural story
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.080]  bringing it to its conclusion
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.920]  Now that's the reason why
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.440]  some of you may know about
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:49.480]  the Lausanne movement
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.320]  I hope you do
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.480]  here at CGST
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.120]  and Billy Graham and John Stott
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:57.560]  and the first Lausanne Congress in 1974
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.200]  Well, at the third Lausanne Congress
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.880]  in South Africa in 2010
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:04.240]  we produced a statement
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.240]  which became known as
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:06.640]  the Cape Town Commitment
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:07.880]  which I dare say
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:08.840]  some of you would have heard of
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.400]  and I believe has also
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.040]  been translated into Chinese
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.200]  And here is how it defines mission
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.640]  Let me quote to you from it
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:19.680]  and it will come up
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:20.560]  on a couple of screens
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.360]  I hope you can read that
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:23.240]  It says this
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.640]  And as I read this
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.120]  please listen for the biblical echoes
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.160]  the echoes of the Scriptures
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.880]  that you, I hope, will discern through it
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:32.240]  It says
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.600]  We are committed to world mission
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.720]  because it is central
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.320]  to our understanding of God
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.880]  the Bible, the Church, human history
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.480]  and the ultimate future
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:41.600]  The whole Bible
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.400]  reveals the mission of God
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.920]  to bring all things in heaven and on earth
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.000]  into unity under Christ
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.160]  reconciling them through
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:50.720]  the blood of His cross
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.080]  There's Colossians
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.640]  In fulfilling His mission
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.640]  God will transform the creation
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.440]  broken by sin and evil
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.800]  into the new creation
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.200]  in which there is no more
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.200]  sin or curse
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.480]  God will fulfill His promise to Abraham
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.480]  to bless all nations on the earth
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.880]  through the gospel of Jesus
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:10.800]  the Messiah, the seed of Abraham
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.360]  God will transform
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.560]  this fractured world of nations
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.960]  that are scattered under the judgment of God
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.360]  into the new humanity
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.760]  that will be redeemed by the blood of Christ
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.880]  from every tribe, nation, tongue and language
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.280]  and will be gathered to worship
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:26.960]  our God and Savior
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.320]  God will destroy the reign of death
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.120]  corruption and violence
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.960]  when Christ returns to establish
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.360]  His eternal reign of life
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.280]  justice and peace
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.720]  And then God, Emmanuel
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.280]  will dwell with us
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.800]  and the kingdom of this world
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.640]  will become the kingdom of our Lord
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.000]  and of His Christ
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.040]  and He will reign forever
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.800]  I hope I might have heard an "amen"
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.080]  somewhere around the room
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.080]  I read that in Africa
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.560]  they go "Hallelujah!"
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:57.800]  but then you're Chinese
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:01.080]  so I don't suppose you'll do that
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:04.200]  Now what I hope is clear in that statement
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.920]  which I hope you heard the scriptural echoes
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.800]  is that God is the principal actor
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.880]  Although it begins with our mission
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.280]  that we are committed to
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.160]  it reminds us that it is God
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.080]  who has been driving this story forward
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.280]  from its beginning
[00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:20.480]  promise right through to its conclusion
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.000]  But within that story
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.160]  or that drama of the scripture
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.920]  God has chosen to have a partner
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.000]  He has chosen to bring together
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000]  those who will participate with Him
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.200]  in this great project
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.320]  As Paul puts it
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.680]  we are co-workers with God
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:43.160]  which is quite a remarkable expression
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:44.880]  And that covenant people of course
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.680]  is the people of Israel in the Old Testament
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.840]  and believers in the Messiah Jesus
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:52.680]  Jews and Gentiles in the New
[00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.520]  So what are we here for?
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:55.480]  What is our purpose?
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:58.520]  We are called to partner with God
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:01.520]  in the fulfillment of God's intentions
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.520]  for the world and for creation
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:06.560]  to do that within the course of human history
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.960]  and then to go on serving
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.400]  worshipping and glorifying God
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:12.840]  for all eternity
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:13.760]  in the world to come
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:14.760]  in the new creation
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.840]  God's new creation
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:19.240]  Now in our first lecture
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.360]  the one if you were here earlier this afternoon
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.640]  you'll remember that we surveyed
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:25.640]  a number of Old Testament texts
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:27.560]  that related to the story of Israel
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.240]  I want to do much the same thing again
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:33.640]  but this time to show the reflection of them
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:34.200]  in mission
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:38.000]  how they affect the purpose of God's people
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.960]  And I want to speak about four
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.320]  Blessing in a slightly different way
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.200]  from the first
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:47.760]  Blessing, priesthood, witness and servanthood
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.760]  So here is the Old Testament Christian mission
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.680]  and the first thing we want to think about
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:55.120]  is missional blessing
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.920]  Now when did the church begin?
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:58.520]  Well some people say the church began
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:11:59.960]  on the day of Pentecost
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:02.520]  I hope that at least after my first lecture
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:05.080]  you'll realize that the church didn't begin
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.040]  on the day of Pentecost
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:08.160]  but began right back with Abraham
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.880]  when God called the people into existence
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.840]  But just as the church didn't begin
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.560]  on the day of Pentecost
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.440]  Christian mission didn't begin
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.160]  on the Mount of Ascension only
[00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:21.520]  at the end of Matthew's Gospel
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.640]  The mission of God's people began
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:26.880]  when God announced his intention
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.320]  through Abraham
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.840]  to bless not only him and his people
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:33.360]  but all the nations on earth through him
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.720]  That's God's mission
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.200]  That's really where we trace it back to
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.880]  Let me remind you of those verses
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:41.640]  Genesis chapter 12 verses 1 to 3
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.480]  very quickly read them
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.360]  The Lord said to Abram
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.240]  Go from your country, your people
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:48.400]  and your father's household
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.240]  to the land that I will show you
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:52.240]  I will make you into a great nation
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.840]  and I will bless you
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:55.320]  I will make your name great
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:56.840]  and be a blessing
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.800]  or you will be a blessing
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.480]  I will bless those who curse you
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.280]  and whoever who bless you
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:05.280]  I will bless those who bless you
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:07.520]  and whoever curses you I will curse
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.320]  and bottom line
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:11.240]  all peoples on earth
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:13.640]  will be blessed through you
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:15.200]  Now it's not hard to hear
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.040]  what the key word in those verses are
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.520]  It's the word bless and blessing
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:20.600]  which shines through about five times
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:21.880]  in three verses
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:23.320]  And this is very good news
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:25.920]  because this is Genesis 12
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.800]  which comes after Genesis 11
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.240]  You need to know these things
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.480]  You don't get a PhD for nothing
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.480]  But it's not just the arithmetic
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.760]  because as I was saying this morning
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:38.960]  Genesis 11 is the sort of climax
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:40.840]  of the story of human fallenness
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:42.360]  and sin and rebellion
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.360]  coming to its climax
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:44.600]  in the Tower of Babel
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.520]  and the scattering of the nations
[00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:49.200]  Genesis 12 suddenly is good news
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.440]  all over again
[00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:51.920]  that God is going to bring blessing
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:53.200]  into the world
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.320]  So it's no wonder therefore
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:56.960]  the Apostle Paul quotes this text
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:58.480]  as what he calls
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.480]  in Galatians 3 verses 8 and 9
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:02.480]  the gospel in advance
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:03.520]  That's what he said
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:04.520]  that the scriptures
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:06.240]  preach the gospel in advance
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:07.880]  So Abraham saying
[00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:10.080]  through you all nations will be blessed
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.440]  The Greek literally is
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:14.040]  he pre-evangelized Abraham
[00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:15.800]  Here's God's great surprise
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:16.800]  good news
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.480]  that in spite of all that has happened
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.480]  in chapters 4, 3 to 11
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.080]  God still intends
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:24.440]  to bless the nations of the earth
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:26.160]  And he would launch this mission
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.160]  through Abraham and his people
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.880]  So therefore as we were thinking earlier
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:33.920]  there is a universal purpose
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:36.560]  to the existence of particular Israel
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.480]  Israel as a nation exists
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.360]  for the sake of God's ultimate purpose
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:43.400]  for the whole of humanity
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:47.120]  And this fundamentally missional intention
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.840]  of the election of Israel
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:50.080]  echoes on and on
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:51.800]  through the Old Testament
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.840]  Now you kindly referred to my book
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:54.640]  The Mission of God
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:56.040]  And there's a whole chapter on this
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:57.800]  in there looking at these texts
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.040]  But let me just read you
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.240]  two or three of them very quickly
[00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:03.480]  Verse Psalm 22 verse 27
[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:05.960]  All the ends of the earth
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.600]  will remember and turn to the Lord
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:10.000]  And all the families of the nations
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.080]  will bow down before him
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:14.080]  Isn't that an echo of Abraham?
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.920]  Psalm 47 verse 9
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:17.480]  The nobles of the nations
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:19.280]  assemble as the people
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.760]  of the God of Abraham
[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:22.000]  For the kings of the earth
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.200]  belong to God
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:24.600]  And he is greatly exalted
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:26.000]  Psalm 47
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.960]  Psalm 86 verse 9
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:30.280]  All the nations you have made
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:32.280]  will come and worship before you, Lord
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:34.760]  And bring glory to your name
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:37.040]  I sometimes wonder
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.440]  what was going through the mind
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:39.400]  of an Israelite
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:41.240]  when they sang those words
[00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.640]  Even just thinking of the nations
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:45.320]  that they knew about in their world
[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:46.360]  Mind you sometimes I wonder
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.720]  what's going through the mind of Christians
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:49.760]  when they sing our hymns and songs as well
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:50.600]  So it's not surprising
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:51.880]  But there it is in the text
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:53.320]  All the nations that God has made
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:56.080]  will ultimately worship him
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:58.120]  And turn to me and be saved
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.800]  All you ends of the earth
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.080]  For I am God and there is no other
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:04.800]  Says Isaiah 45 verse 22
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.360]  Many nations will be joined
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.520]  with the Lord in that day
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:09.360]  And will become my people
[00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:12.360]  Zechariah 2 verse 9 and so on
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:13.160]  Many many more
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:15.040]  Those are just a sampling
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.840]  So when we turn to the New Testament then
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:19.240]  It's fascinating isn't it?
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:22.280]  The very first verse of Matthew's Gospel
[00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.160]  Traces the ancestry of Jesus
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:26.520]  Not just back to David
[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:29.880]  Israel's messianic king in prophecy
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:31.840]  But to Abraham
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:35.800]  So Matthew begins with Abraham in the first verse
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:39.760]  And ends with a strongly Abrahamic word of Jesus
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:40.680]  In the Great Commission
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:41.840]  Where he tells his disciples
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:44.760]  To go and make disciples of all nations
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:46.200]  Rather like Paul who speaks about
[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:48.600]  The obedience of faith among all nations
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:51.280]  It's very Abrahamic
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:53.280]  Here's how a New Testament scholar
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.560]  Richard Baucom
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:56.200]  A very fine New Testament scholar
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.840]  Puts it on our quote
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:00.440]  He says Matthew frames
[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:02.560]  The whole story of Jesus
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.720]  Between the identification of him
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:06.560]  As a descendant of Abraham
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:08.640]  In the opening verse of the Gospel
[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:10.960]  And in the closing words of Jesus
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.400]  At the end of the Gospel
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:13.920]  With the commission to the disciples
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:16.120]  To make disciples of all nations
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:17.320]  For Matthew
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:18.640]  Jesus is the Messiah
[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.360]  Not only for Jews
[00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:22.640]  But also for Gentiles
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:24.640]  He is the descendant of Abraham
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:26.560]  Through whom God's blessing
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:29.240]  Will at least at last reach the nations
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:31.520]  So mission to the nations
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:32.600]  As we would put it
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:34.920]  Evangelization of the world and all of that
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:37.560]  Is not some kind of afterthought
[00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:38.840]  That occurred to Jesus
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:40.480]  On the Mount of Ascension
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:41.560]  When he suddenly thought
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:43.320]  Hey I'm going off back up to heaven
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:44.720]  What are these guys going to do
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:45.480]  With the rest of their life
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:46.760]  Hey why don't you go and be missionaries
[00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:47.880]  That's a good idea
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:49.400]  A sort of afterthought
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:50.520]  At the end of the Gospels
[00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:52.160]  No, it's the climax
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:52.880]  It's the point
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:55.440]  It's what the Gospel is all about
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.800]  That what God had now accomplished
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:01.000]  Through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.200]  Must now become the source of blessing
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:04.280]  To all nations
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:08.080]  So that God could keep his promise to Abraham
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:09.480]  So in other words therefore
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.680]  There's this theological affirmation
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:13.920]  That if we are in Christ
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:16.080]  Then not only as Paul says in Galatians
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:17.880]  Are we the seed of Abraham
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:20.000]  We share the blessing of Abraham
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.040]  We are also commissioned to spread
[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:25.120]  The blessing of Abraham
[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:28.240]  Indeed I would argue that there is something
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.200]  Great commission-ish
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:31.280]  That's a word
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:34.840]  About the Genesis 12 1-3
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:37.560]  I'm not suggesting that it's sort of exactly the same
[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:42.360]  But the language certainly bears that sort of flavour
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:45.040]  It starts with command go
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:47.080]  It also says be a blessing
[00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:50.160]  That middle line is actually an imperative
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.680]  Not just you will be a blessing
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:53.000]  But be a blessing
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:53.840]  And then it ends with
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:56.400]  All nations will be blessed through you
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:01.560]  So here is a kind of a dynamic impulse
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:03.600]  In which Abraham has launched into the world
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:06.240]  In order to become as it were the launch pad
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:09.400]  Of God bringing blessing into the world
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:12.200]  So the people whom God creates in Abraham
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.320]  Are not only a people for God
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.600]  Belonging to God as we were thinking earlier
[00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:19.280]  But also a people for the world
[00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:23.600]  Our identity is also our mission
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:26.680]  In other words Genesis 12 1-3
[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:29.320]  Is both ecclesiological
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:31.920]  It's the beginnings as it were of the people of God
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:34.160]  It's also missiological
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:35.840]  Because it describes the very purpose
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:38.880]  Through which they exist
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:42.160]  And this Abrahamic dimension of Christian mission
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:46.000]  Impacts not just that Gentile mission
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.200]  In the book of Acts
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:50.400]  Where Paul sees the moving out to the Gentiles
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.680]  As God keeping his promise to Abraham
[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:55.280]  But I would say would be the kind of mantra
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:58.520]  That one could put over all the following centuries
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:01.280]  Of Christian mission ever since
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:04.880]  You could argue that Christian mission at its simplest
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:09.320]  Is simply a matter of God keeping his promise to Abraham
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:11.160]  Which he began to do of course
[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:12.160]  In the book of Acts
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.360]  And then in the New Testament era
[00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:16.080]  So that the gospel went south
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:18.600]  Down to Africa with the Ethiopian eunuch
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:22.520]  It goes east according to the church in India
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:25.640]  With Thomas who brought the gospel to India
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:28.040]  And there's certainly documentary evidence
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:30.840]  Of Christianity in India from the second century
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:32.960]  It also of course went eastwards to Syria
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.360]  And then northeast
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:35.600]  And it was Syrian missionaries
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.200]  Who were bringing the gospel to China
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.480]  As I'm sure you know
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:40.240]  By the 6th to 8th century
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:42.040]  Went west with the apostle Paul
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:44.280]  Cross the Bosporus into Europe
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:47.200]  And eventually reached the very edges of the world
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.800]  Ireland where I come from
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:52.160]  On those little islands just off the edge
[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:54.040]  About to drop off the edge of the world
[00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:55.360]  And of course ever since
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:58.240]  Every time the gospel crosses a barrier
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.880]  Reaches new people
[00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:03.280]  God is keeping his promise to Abraham
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:04.960]  Bringing the blessing of salvation
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:07.600]  To new nation after new nation
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.600]  Until the day comes
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.200]  That we read about in Revelation
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:13.160]  Revelation 7 verse 9
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:13.920]  Where John says
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:15.320]  I saw a great multitude
[00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:16.720]  That no one could count
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:21.120]  From every tribe, nation, people and language
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:24.680]  Standing before the throne of God and the Lamb
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:28.360]  And I have a kind of mental picture of God
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:30.360]  Poking Abraham in the ribs and saying
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:33.320]  There you are, I kept my promise
[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:35.280]  All nations I said
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:37.280]  All nations it is
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:39.000]  Mission accomplished
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.840]  So that's the first, this missional blessing
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:45.240]  The Abrahamic dimension of Christian mission
[00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:47.560]  And there's a lot more about that of course
[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:49.440]  In my two books
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:51.360]  That leads us to the second theme
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:52.120]  That I wanted to bring
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:53.680]  Which is missional priesthood
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:56.160]  Moving on from Genesis to Exodus
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:57.800]  We won't go all the way through the Old Testament
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:01.600]  But at least we do the first two or three books
[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:05.040]  God's address to Israel at Mount Sinai
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:06.720]  Comes after the Exodus
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:08.200]  After they get out of Egypt
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:10.480]  In Exodus chapter 19
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:12.120]  And here again we pick up
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:14.800]  One of those identities of God's people
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:15.720]  We mentioned it
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:18.320]  I mentioned it in passing in the earlier lecture
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:20.160]  Of being God's priesthood
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:21.680]  But let me read these verses to you
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:24.200]  Exodus chapter 19 verses 3 to 6
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:27.560]  And the first two verses of the chapter
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:30.040]  Give us both the date and the location
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:32.520]  It says this was just three months
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:34.560]  After they had come out of Egypt
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:37.080]  When they had reached Mount Sinai
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:40.440]  And camped there at the foot of Mount Sinai
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:41.120]  And verse 3
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:42.960]  Then Moses went up to God
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:45.000]  And the Lord called to him from the mountain
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.480]  Mount Sinai and said
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:47.800]  This is what you are to say
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:49.320]  To the descendants of Jacob
[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:52.640]  And what you are to tell the people of Israel
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:56.320]  You yourselves have seen what I did to Egypt
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:58.400]  And how I carried you in eagles' wings
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.360]  And brought you to myself
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:03.040]  Now then if you will obey me fully
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:04.520]  And keep my covenant
[00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:06.480]  Then out of all nations
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:08.520]  You will be my treasured possession
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.800]  For the whole earth is mine
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.280]  And you will be for me
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:14.040]  A kingdom of priests
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:15.800]  And a holy nation
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:17.280]  These are the words you are to speak
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:18.600]  To the Israelites
[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:20.880]  End of quote from verse 6
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:22.880]  So the very first thing that God does here
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:25.160]  Is that he points to his own initiative
[00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:25.920]  In verse 4
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:28.600]  You have seen what I have done
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:30.360]  Says God in verse 4
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:32.960]  In other words this is the priority of God's grace
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:35.960]  As I said also earlier about election
[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:39.320]  God redeems his people out of Egypt
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:42.360]  And then talks about obeying him
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:43.720]  And keeping the covenant
[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:46.080]  Redemption, salvation comes first
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:47.680]  God's initiative of grace
[00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:50.120]  And then obedience as a response to that
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:51.960]  In the keeping of the law
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:55.120]  And so the motivating power for all that follows
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:57.320]  Including the Ten Commandments and the rest of the law
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:00.600]  Is always what God has done for them
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:02.320]  His redemption from slavery
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:04.760]  The Exodus becomes the motivating power
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:06.800]  Why should we keep this law
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:09.080]  Because God redeemed us out of Egypt
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:12.720]  That's the theme that flows through the rest of the law
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:16.680]  But then, and one could go on a lot about that point
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:19.480]  But then the text there in Exodus 19
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:22.640]  Moves on from that backward looking motivation
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:25.080]  What God had already done
[00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:28.280]  In 18 chapters of salvation
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:31.080]  Moves on to a forward looking motivation
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:33.880]  That is what God planned for Israel
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:36.080]  To be in the world
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:37.360]  In the midst of the nations
[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:40.280]  Here's my agenda for you
[00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:42.880]  This is what you will be for me
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:43.960]  This is a future
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:45.920]  This is a looking forward
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:50.200]  It is indeed what we might call a missional perspective
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:52.760]  Because God's plan for his people
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:56.200]  Is that they should be a priestly and holy people
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:25:00.480]  In the midst of all nations in the whole earth
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:01.920]  Verse 5
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:04.800]  Which as I hope you will detect by now
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:07.240]  Has a certain Abrahamic ring about it
[00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:08.360]  God had said to Abraham
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:11.720]  I'm going to bless all nations in the earth through you
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:14.160]  And here is Yahweh God as it were
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:15.920]  At the top of Mount Sinai
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:18.640]  Saying to the people of Israel so to speak
[00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:20.680]  From up here as it were in the top
[00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:23.040]  I can see the whole earth and it's all mine
[00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:25.440]  And all the nations of the earth belong to me
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:28.480]  But you will have a particular purpose
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:31.720]  A particular identity and agenda in that world
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:35.040]  To be a priestly and a holy people
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:38.080]  Now that identity of being priestly and holy
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:40.240]  Is something which echoes on
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:41.840]  Through other parts of the Old Testament
[00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:45.520]  And indeed is inherited by us as Peter says
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:48.880]  And will still be there in the book of Revelation
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:49.920]  But we need to ask
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:52.520]  What does it mean for Israel
[00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:56.600]  To be God's priesthood in relation to the nations
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:58.400]  And in order to understand that
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:25:59.760]  We need to ask
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:02.640]  Well what were Israel's priests for them
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:04.920]  How did the priests function
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:06.560]  And here is one way that I sometimes
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:08.800]  Try to illustrate that for you
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:11.520]  Priests basically were middle men
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:14.520]  They stood in between God on the one hand
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:17.120]  And all the rest of the people on the other
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:18.960]  Sometimes we use the word mediator
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:20.800]  Or in the middle
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:23.800]  And in that mediating position between God
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:25.920]  And the rest of the Israelites
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:28.760]  They had two main jobs
[00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:30.720]  One which we don't often think about
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.400]  Was that they were to be teachers
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.920]  Teachers of God's law to the people
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:36.960]  That's actually what is said about them
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:40.680]  Right at the very ordination of Aaron and his sons
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:41.800]  The Lord says to Aaron
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:45.120]  This is in Leviticus chapter 10
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:46.640]  He says they must distinguish
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:47.960]  Between the holy and the common
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:49.240]  The unclean and the clean
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:52.040]  So that you can teach the Israelites
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:54.480]  All the decrees that the Lord has given them
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:55.120]  Through Moses
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:56.760]  The priests were to be teachers
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:58.160]  So that the people would come to know
[00:26:58.160 --> 00:26:59.560]  The ways of God
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:02.280]  That's also there in the blessing of Moses
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:06.720]  On the tribe of Levi in Deuteronomy chapter 33
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:08.720]  Where it says about Levi
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:10.480]  Which was the Levites tribe
[00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:12.160]  That the priests came from
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:14.440]  He teaches your precepts to Jacob
[00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:16.160]  And your law to Israel
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:18.560]  And he offers incense before you
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:20.440]  And whole burnt offerings on your altar
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:23.600]  So the teaching function actually comes first
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:26.000]  That through the priests
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.040]  God would become known to the people
[00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:33.800]  Which is why when the people went so badly wrong
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:35.840]  In later life of Israel
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:37.520]  Who did the prophets blame?
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:38.760]  The priests
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.480]  That's what Hosea says very clearly
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:41.360]  He says the land
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:43.600]  There's no knowledge of God in the land
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:45.640]  The land is full of idolatry
[00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:49.280]  And stealing and robbery and murder and adultery
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:50.600]  And then he says
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:51.800]  Who is my quarrel with?
[00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:53.200]  Who am I accusing?
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:54.640]  He says it is you, O priest
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:57.680]  Because the priests were failing to teach the people
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:59.280]  So that's the first task
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:00.720]  Through the priests
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:03.560]  God would become known to the people
[00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:05.480]  And then the other direction of course
[00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:07.280]  That we're perhaps more familiar with
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:08.680]  Is that it was the job of the priests
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:11.640]  To bring the sacrifices of the people to God
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:14.800]  Which you read in the first seven chapters of Leviticus
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:16.640]  So you know this of course
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:18.240]  That if you're an Israelite
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:20.080]  And for some reason
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:22.840]  Whether some sin or some uncleanness
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:25.400]  That you were unable to come into the
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.320]  Worshipping community of God
[00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:29.720]  The temple and so on
[00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:30.640]  What would you do?
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:32.400]  Well you would bring an animal
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:35.000]  To the sanctuary as prescribed in the law
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.040]  You would lay your hand on its head
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:40.400]  The priest would be then slaughtered
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:42.120]  And the blood of the sacrifice
[00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:43.520]  Would be thrown against the altar
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:44.960]  Representing God
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:47.800]  And the priest would declare to you
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:50.280]  That your sin is atoned for
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:52.600]  Covered or possibly cleansed
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:55.720]  The word atoned has two possible meanings
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:57.520]  And so with the sin dealt with
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:58.720]  Through the sacrifice
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:00.320]  You could then come back
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:02.720]  Into covenant fellowship with God
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:04.600]  And if you offered a fellowship offering
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:05.520]  As it was called
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:07.480]  Then you're going to have a barbecue as well
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:10.680]  And enjoy a good family meal with the meat
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:12.960]  That was what it signified
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:15.000]  Was that you and I are back in fellowship
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.640]  With God and his people
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.840]  So you can see then that the job of the priest
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:19.720]  Was twofold
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:21.720]  It was bringing God to the people
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:23.840]  And bringing the people to God
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:26.520]  That was their role within Israel
[00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:30.520]  So it's very significant isn't it
[00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:32.240]  That God says to the Israelites
[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:33.720]  As a whole people
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:35.160]  As a community for him
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:37.840]  He said you will be for me
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:39.840]  To the rest of the nations
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:42.240]  What your priests are for you
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:45.160]  Through you my people Israel
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:47.640]  I will make myself known to the world
[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:49.840]  And through you ultimately
[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:52.840]  I will draw the world to myself
[00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:56.240]  That's what it meant for Israel to be God's priesthood
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:57.400]  In the midst of the nations
[00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:58.640]  At least that's part of the meaning
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:01.200]  There are other ways of thinking of it as well
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:04.920]  So as the people of Yahweh God in the Old Testament
[00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:06.640]  They would have this task of
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:09.360]  Bringing the knowledge of God to the nations
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:10.360]  Which they've done
[00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:12.320]  Because we've got this book
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:14.440]  Three quarters of which are the scriptures of Israel
[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:16.600]  Through whom we know the living God
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:19.560]  So God has made himself known as it were
[00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:20.960]  Through the priesthood of Israel
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:24.000]  Simply being the people that brought us the scriptures
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.360]  And of course we know
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:26.880]  That ultimately it was through Israel
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:28.120]  The Messiah of Israel
[00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:30.200]  The Lord Jesus Christ himself
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:32.600]  That God has drawn the nations to himself
[00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:33.960]  As Jesus put it
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:35.360]  That I if I be lifted up
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:37.680]  Will draw all men to myself
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:39.680]  In his revelation of God
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:42.760]  And in his atoning work at the cross
[00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:45.080]  God through the Messiah Jesus
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:46.400]  Has made himself known
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:49.000]  And has brought the world to himself
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.760]  So that's the priestly task of this people
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:54.360]  And even in exile
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:57.200]  Even when they were thrown out of their land
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:58.560]  Under God's judgment
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:00.000]  Jeremiah writes them a letter
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.280]  Do you remember in Jeremiah chapter 29
[00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:04.880]  And says that even in the midst of that calamity
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:07.240]  They were instructed to be a blessing
[00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:08.800]  To the nation where they were
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:11.000]  That is not the precise words he uses
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.600]  But it's by implication
[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:15.400]  Where Jeremiah says in chapter 29 verse 7
[00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:19.800]  Seek the shalom of the city to which I've carried you into exile
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:21.400]  Babylon their enemies
[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:23.080]  Pray to the Lord for it
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:26.800]  Because in its shalom is your shalom
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:28.920]  In other words you can be a blessing
[00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:31.000]  Even to the people who are your enemies
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.200]  In the midst of the nations
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.600]  So that's what I mean by saying
[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:37.400]  That it does seem to me that the priesthood of God's people
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:39.960]  Is a missional function
[00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:42.000]  Which stands in continuity
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.080]  With the Abrahamic election
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:46.600]  For the sake of the nations
[00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:49.400]  So the mission of God's people
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:51.080]  Then includes being this priesthood
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:52.280]  In and for the world
[00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:55.080]  And that fits exactly with the way
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:58.200]  One way in which the New Testament
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:00.600]  Speaks about our mission in the New Testament
[00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:03.400]  Certainly it's how the apostle Paul
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:06.000]  Saw his task
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000]  Here I'm quoting from Romans chapter 15
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.080]  Where Paul reminds the Romans
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:13.400]  He says I want to remind you
[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:15.600]  Of the grace that God gave to me
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.600]  To be a minister of the Messiah
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:19.600]  Christ Jesus to the Gentiles
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:20.200]  To the nations
[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:22.000]  So he's a minister of the Messiah
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.200]  To the nations
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:26.000]  He gave me the priestly duty
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.400]  Of proclaiming the gospel of God
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:29.800]  So that the Gentiles
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:30.600]  The nations
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:33.000]  Might become an offering acceptable to God
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.200]  Sanctified by the Holy Spirit
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:37.000]  It's a fascinating verse
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.400]  In fact it's the only verse in the New Testament
[00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:42.800]  Where anybody speaks about their personal work
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:45.000]  In priestly terms
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.400]  The pastors in the church
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:49.400]  They're called pastors or elders or shepherds
[00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:50.800]  But not specifically priests
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:54.600]  But Paul says he had a priestly job to do
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:57.400]  Now Paul could never have functioned as a priest
[00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:58.800]  In Jerusalem in the temple
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:01.000]  Because he was the wrong tribe wasn't he
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.400]  The soul of Tarsus was of the tribe of Benjamin
[00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:04.600]  Not of Levi
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:08.400]  But he says yes but I had a priestly job
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:11.200]  Not in some ordained function as it were
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:12.200]  Within the church
[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:14.800]  But precisely in his evangelistic work
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:16.200]  Among the nations
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:18.000]  He says through my role
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.400]  My lifetime's work
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:21.400]  Was to bring God to the nations
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:23.800]  In order to bring the nations to God
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:25.200]  That's a priestly function
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:27.000]  I don't know whether he had this verse
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.600]  Of Exodus in mind when he wrote that
[00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:29.800]  Or whether it was just as it were
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:33.200]  Part of the furniture and assumptions of his mind
[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:34.800]  That his evangelism
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:37.400]  Was effectively priestly work
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:38.600]  Bringing the knowledge of God
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:40.000]  The gospel to the nations
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.600]  So the nations could come to God
[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:43.400]  And we might think
[00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:44.400]  Wow that's all very well
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:46.000]  That was the apostle Paul
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.200]  He was an apostle
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:48.600]  He was a missionary
[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:50.600]  I'm just an ordinary Christian
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:53.000]  Well we don't get off quite so easily
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.200]  Because as the text says on the screen
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:58.200]  The apostle Peter applies precisely
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:00.200]  This very same verse
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:03.800]  Exodus 19 verse 6 to all believers
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:06.400]  Writing almost certainly to a mixture
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:09.400]  Of both Jewish and Gentile believers
[00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:11.600]  Who were scattered across the various provinces
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:13.000]  Of Asia Minor
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.400]  Where the churches were in his day
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:20.800]  And you notice how in 1 Peter 2 verses 9 to 12
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:23.400]  Peter combines a number of Old Testament references
[00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:26.000]  Including Exodus 19 verse 6
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.000]  And insists that this is how we
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.800]  We Christian believers
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:32.800]  Are to live among the nations
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:34.000]  They're fairly familiar verses
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.400]  But I'll read them anyway
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:36.800]  Peter says you
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:39.200]  Plural, you are a chosen people
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:40.600]  A royal priesthood
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:41.800]  A holy nation
[00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:43.000]  Is Exodus 19
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000]  God's special possession
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000]  That you may declare the praises of him
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.200]  Who called you out of darkness
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:51.000]  Into his wonderful light
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.200]  There's the Exodus imagery again
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:54.400]  Out of, into
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:56.200]  Once you were not a people
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:58.000]  Now you are the people of God
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:58.800]  That's Hosea
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.600]  Once you had not received mercy
[00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:02.400]  But now you have received mercy
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:04.000]  So therefore dear friends
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.400]  On the basis of that
[00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:08.400]  Unfortunately many of our English Bibles
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:10.000]  Put a paragraph division in there
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:10.800]  With another heading
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:11.600]  Which is a shame
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:13.800]  Because it spoils the flow of Peter's thought
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:15.800]  He says this is who you are
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:17.400]  This is what you've experienced
[00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:20.000]  Therefore I urge you as foreigners in exile
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.800]  To abstain from sinful desires
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:23.600]  Which war against your soul
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:25.800]  And to live such good lives
[00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:28.000]  Among the nations
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.400]  And again our English Bibles
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:31.000]  Sometimes say among the pagans
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.200]  Or the heathen or something
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:34.600]  But it is among entwise ethnic
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:35.800]  Among the nations
[00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:37.800]  It's Genesis language
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:40.400]  So that even though they accuse you of doing wrong
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:42.200]  They may see your good deeds
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:45.200]  And glorify God on the day he visits us
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:48.600]  Where Peter is echoing the Lord Jesus Christ himself
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:49.800]  You says Peter
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:52.600]  You are that priesthood
[00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:54.000]  You, we
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.600]  We are meant to be God's representatives
[00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:58.200]  Among the nations
[00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:01.600]  To be the living proof of the living God
[00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:03.400]  To bring God to people
[00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:05.200]  And to bring people to God
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:07.400]  That's our priestly mission
[00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:08.800]  And how do we do that
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:10.200]  Well of course we can only do that
[00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:13.400]  By the second phrase that Moses used
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:15.600]  That is not only by being a priestly kingdom
[00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:17.800]  But by being a holy people
[00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:20.000]  And that's what we will think of tomorrow
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.400]  If you can come back for lecture number three
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:25.000]  When we ask about how then should we live
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.800]  What are the ethical standards
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:29.000]  Of being a holy people
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.200]  So that's therefore missional blessing
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:33.600]  And missional priesthood
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:35.200]  I think there are just two other ones
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:37.600]  That I want to put before us
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:40.200]  And that is witnesses and servants
[00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:43.600]  They occur actually together in one verse
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:47.000]  In Isaiah chapter 43 verses 9 to 11
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:47.800]  This is what we read
[00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:49.800]  God says to the Israelites
[00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:52.200]  He says you are my witnesses
[00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:53.600]  Declares the Lord
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:56.800]  And my servant whom I have chosen
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:58.200]  And I just want us to think about
[00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:01.000]  Each of those two words
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.800]  Now the context of those verses there
[00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:06.200]  In Isaiah chapter 49 are of course
[00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:09.800]  That Israel had been in exile in Babylon
[00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:13.000]  And many of them had completely lost hope
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.400]  For any future for themselves
[00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:18.400]  Or indeed for the purposes of God
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:21.800]  You know from Ezekiel for example chapter 37
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:24.000]  That the Israelites in exile thought of themselves
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.800]  As dead bones in the grave
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:27.000]  We might as well be finished
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000]  There's no more future for us
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.200]  But God's word through these chapters of Isaiah
[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:34.600]  Repeatedly reassures them
[00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:37.200]  That God's purposes go on
[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:40.800]  And that God still has a place within them
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:45.400]  And that their mission was to bear witness
[00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:47.600]  To Yahweh the God of Israel
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:50.200]  As being the only true and living God
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:52.000]  That they were God's servant
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.600]  In order to bear witness to the living God
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:57.800]  So missional witness
[00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:00.000]  You see as again you probably know
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.400]  If you've done some old tests
[00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:04.600]  And study and read these chapters of Isaiah
[00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:07.200]  That there's a great kind of conflict going on
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:09.000]  In these chapters between
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.400]  Yahweh the God of Israel
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:13.800]  And the other nations and their gods
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:16.000]  It's like a kind of court case
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.600]  That's happening between them
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:20.800]  And in Isaiah chapter 43 verse 9
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:23.600]  There's a great assembly of the nations pictured
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:26.000]  It's like a sort of great court
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.200]  Here's Isaiah 43 verse 9
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:30.600]  All the nations gather together
[00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:32.800]  And the peoples assemble
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:37.000]  Which of their gods foretold all this
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.200]  And proclaimed to us the former things
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:42.400]  Now you see God has been saying earlier
[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:46.000]  That he was the God who had predicted the exile
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.400]  And he was the God who had explained it
[00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:50.800]  And interpreted it in the past
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:53.400]  So which of their gods did that
[00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:56.000]  Let them bring in their witnesses
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.400]  To prove that they were right
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:58.600]  So that others may hear and say
[00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:00.000]  Oh yeah yeah that's right
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000]  So there's this sense in which
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.200]  In this assembly of the nations with their gods
[00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:11.800]  Who and how will we decide which God or gods is real
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:13.600]  Which God is right
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:17.600]  Now Yahweh the God of Israel has made his claim
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:19.200]  To be the only true God
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:21.600]  In all the way through these earlier chapters
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:25.200]  By his ability precisely to predict the future
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:26.800]  To interpret the past
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:28.400]  And to explain the present
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:31.400]  That he's the sovereign God of all these things
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:33.000]  So the other nations then
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.800]  The other gods rather
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:38.000]  The other gods are invited to bring in their witnesses
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000]  If they can prove that they're any better
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.600]  Or even anywhere near as good
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:45.600]  Now who are the witnesses of the other gods
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:47.000]  Well the other nations
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.200]  But they don't say anything
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:50.800]  Because they've got nothing to say
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:53.400]  Because their gods are weak and powerless
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:55.200]  And less than nothing
[00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:57.200]  So then okay who's left
[00:39:57.200 --> 00:39:58.600]  Yahweh God
[00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:00.800]  So who will speak for him
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:04.800]  In this international court of nations and gods
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:07.800]  Who will testify to the power
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:11.200]  The existence the reality of Yahweh as God
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:12.600]  Who
[00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:14.200]  God says verse 10
[00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:16.000]  You
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.800]  You are my witnesses declares the Lord
[00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:20.000]  You Israelites
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.600]  You are my witnesses
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:23.800]  And my servant whom I have chosen
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:26.600]  In other words this is God saying to Israel
[00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:27.800]  You know you're in exile
[00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:30.000]  But you're still my witnesses
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.600]  In fact it's actually very surprising
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:35.400]  Because God had just described Israel
[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:36.800]  In the previous chapter
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:42.000]  The Israelites in exile as blind and deaf
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:45.200]  And is not with all due charity
[00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:48.400]  Not a lot of point bringing into a courtroom
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:49.800]  As a witness
[00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:51.600]  Someone who couldn't see anything
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:53.400]  And can't hear anything
[00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:55.400]  Blind and deaf is sort of precisely
[00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:58.800]  Not what you want in a witness
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:00.800]  And the reason of course why
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:02.400]  The Israelites were blind and deaf
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:04.600]  As it says in chapter 42
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:07.200]  Is because they had rejected God's words
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:08.800]  And his warnings in the past
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:11.400]  And he had had to drive them into judgment
[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:13.600]  But now by his restoring grace
[00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:15.400]  By the miracle of a new exodus
[00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:17.200]  Which was just around the corner
[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:18.600]  God says you're going back
[00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:21.400]  Back to your original Abrahamic mission
[00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:22.800]  In the midst of the nations
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:24.400]  And when I've restored you
[00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:26.000]  You will bear witness
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.600]  To the saving God of Israel once more
[00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:32.600]  God's people must be witnesses for their God
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:35.400]  That is a major missional responsibility
[00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:38.400]  You are my witnesses says God
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:41.800]  Now the word itself is a significant one
[00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:43.800]  In Old Testament Israel
[00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:46.400]  Just being a witness of anything
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:48.800]  Was a very serious responsibility
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:50.200]  Especially in a courtroom
[00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:52.600]  Or in the gate in the city
[00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:54.800]  Where the cases were discussed
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:56.200]  In fact there are a number of
[00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:59.200]  Significant laws in Old Testament law
[00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:02.000]  About the importance of being a truthful witness
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.800]  And how serious it was to be a false witness
[00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:08.000]  In fact one of the Ten Commandments
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:08.800]  Is exactly that
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:10.800]  You shall not bear false witness
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:12.600]  Another thing of course is that
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:14.000]  Bribery was hated
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.000]  Because bribery would twist people
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.400]  To tell untruths
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:19.600]  And indeed the Old Testament law
[00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:21.400]  Had about the most severe
[00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:24.000]  Perjury law anywhere in the world
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.400]  Even today
[00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:29.400]  If you gave false witness in court
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:32.000]  And it could then be proved that you had
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000]  Then you would be punished
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000]  With whatever punishment
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000]  The person that you were falsely accusing
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.200]  Would have got
[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:41.400]  If your witness had been believed
[00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:43.800]  Even up to the death penalty
[00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:46.600]  So if you mistakenly accused somebody
[00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:49.400]  Of something for which they could be executed
[00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:50.800]  And you were shown to have
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:52.800]  Told the untruth
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:54.000]  You would be executed
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.200]  Now that's pretty severe
[00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:57.000]  It's a very deterrent law
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.600]  It shows how seriously God took the importance
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:02.600]  Of being a true and truthful witness
[00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:05.400]  The integrity and the truthfulness of witness
[00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:08.600]  Was important in Old Testament society
[00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:10.600]  So here you see God is
[00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:13.200]  Calling the Israelites to exercise
[00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:17.400]  In the international arena of nations and gods
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:19.400]  A responsibility
[00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:23.400]  That was deeply rooted in their own social culture
[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:27.000]  The task of bearing witness
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.600]  Now what would it be
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:31.200]  That the Israelites were to bear witness to
[00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:34.200]  Well these verses that we are just starting on
[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:35.400]  Spell it out
[00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:36.400]  Let me now read to you
[00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:38.400]  What they were to bear witness to
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:41.000]  This is Isaiah chapter 43
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:42.400]  Verses 9 to 13
[00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:44.200]  You are my witnesses declared the Lord
[00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:46.000]  And my servant whom I have chosen
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.800]  So that you may know and believe me
[00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:49.200]  And understand that
[00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:51.000]  I am he
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.200]  I am God alone
[00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:55.600]  Before me no God was formed
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:57.800]  Nor will there be one after me
[00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:59.400]  I'm not a temporary God
[00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:00.000]  In other words
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000]  Alpha and omega kind of thing
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.400]  I even I am the Lord
[00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:07.800]  And apart from me there is no saviour
[00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:11.200]  I have revealed and saved and proclaimed
[00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:14.400]  I am not some foreign God among you
[00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:17.200]  So you are my witnesses declares the Lord
[00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:19.600]  That I am God
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:22.200]  It's a wonderful language
[00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:25.000]  Israel then is being called to bear witness
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:29.000]  To several great foundational truths
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.000]  About Yahweh the God of Israel
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.800]  All of which we will see in a moment
[00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:34.600]  Apply to Jesus Christ
[00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:36.400]  When you get to the New Testament
[00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:38.200]  And therefore help us to understand
[00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:42.400]  What it means for us to be witnesses to Jesus
[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:44.400]  The three things that are clear in this text are
[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:45.200]  First of all
[00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:46.600]  Israel was to bear witness
[00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:50.400]  That Yahweh alone is the transcendent eternal God
[00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:51.400]  I am he
[00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:52.600]  I am God
[00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:53.800]  There is no other God
[00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:57.800]  He is the transcendent eternal living God
[00:44:57.800 --> 00:44:59.800]  There is none before and none to come after
[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:02.400]  That's Old Testament monotheism
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:05.000]  It's not just saying there is only one God
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.000]  Doesn't really matter which God you have
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.000]  As long as you only got one
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.000]  No, this is saying
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.400]  Not only is there only one God
[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:12.200]  This is who he is
[00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:14.200]  It's the identity of the living God
[00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:15.000]  Secondly
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.200]  That Yahweh alone is in sovereign control of history
[00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:21.200]  I have revealed and saved and proclaimed
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:25.600]  This again is recollecting the story of the Exodus
[00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:27.600]  That God revealed it
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:29.000]  This is what he's going to do
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.400]  Then he did it
[00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:31.800]  Then he interpreted it
[00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:33.200]  Then he explained it
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:34.600]  And teaches his people
[00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:38.600]  And only the God who is in control of events
[00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:40.400]  Can do all of those things
[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:42.000]  Can say this is what's going to happen
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.000]  That's what just happened
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.200]  This is why it happened
[00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:45.800]  God interprets, explains
[00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:48.400]  It's the author of the story
[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:50.000]  Who controls the story
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.400]  God is sovereign in history
[00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:54.800]  And that Yahweh alone is not only God
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:57.400]  And sovereign but also saviour
[00:45:57.400 --> 00:45:59.200]  The I alone and the God who say
[00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:02.400]  There is no other saviour than the living God
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:04.000]  That indeed is his name
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:05.400]  He is the God then
[00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:09.600]  Whose righteousness had sent the Israelites into exile
[00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:11.000]  And it's the same God
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.400]  Whose righteousness will deliver them from exile
[00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:17.000]  There is no other saving God
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.000]  Because there is no other God
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.000]  Period
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.400]  You said God to the Israelites
[00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:29.200]  You are my witnesses that I am God
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:33.600]  You said Jesus twice to his disciples
[00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:36.600]  The risen Jesus to his disciples
[00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:40.000]  You will be my witnesses
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.200]  Luke makes that phrase by Jesus
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:46.000]  A kind of verbal velcro
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:47.800]  Between the end of his gospel
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:49.400]  And the beginning of Acts
[00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:51.200]  It's there in Luke chapter 24
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:53.200]  In the day of resurrection
[00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:54.600]  Where Jesus says
[00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:56.200]  You know what the scriptures have said
[00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:57.200]  This is what is written
[00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:59.000]  Messiah will come and suffer and rise again
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:00.200]  In the third day
[00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:02.600]  That repentance and forgiveness of sins
[00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:04.600]  Will be preached in his name to all the nations
[00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:07.400]  And you are witnesses of these things
[00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:09.400]  And then also in Acts chapter 1
[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:10.200]  Verse 8
[00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:12.000]  On the day of his ascension
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.400]  Where Jesus says to the disciples before he left
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:16.800]  You will be my witnesses
[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:18.200]  In Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:19.600]  And to the ends of the earth
[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:22.400]  And I have no doubt in my mind anyway
[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:26.600]  That Jesus was consciously echoing this text from Isaiah 43
[00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:30.200]  That just as Yahweh God of Israel had said to the Israelites
[00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:32.600]  You are my witnesses in the world of the nations
[00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:36.400]  So Jesus the risen Christ now calls his disciples
[00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:38.000]  To do the same task
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.600]  To bear witness to the living God among the nations
[00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:44.000]  Because after all
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.800]  What greater truth could there be in the universe
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:50.800]  Than the identity of Jesus of Nazareth
[00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:54.400]  As the living God who has come and lived among us
[00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:58.000]  The sovereignty of Jesus as Lord
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.400]  He is the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:03.200]  Not kurios kaisar, Caesar is Lord
[00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:04.600]  But Jesus is Lord
[00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:06.600]  They went out into the world to say
[00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:09.200]  And that he is the one and only saviour
[00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:12.600]  That there is no other name given among men under heaven
[00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:14.400]  By which we must be saved
[00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:16.200]  Than the name of Jesus himself
[00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:20.000]  So he alone is God and Lord and saviour
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.400]  And we are his witnesses
[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:27.400]  That's why it seems to me on the Mount of Ascension
[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:31.400]  That Jesus says these amazing words
[00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:33.800]  That Matthew records in Matthew 28
[00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:36.000]  He almost in his way
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.800]  Matthew tells us that when they came to Jesus
[00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:40.800]  At the Mount of Ascension they worshipped him
[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:42.400]  Though some doubted
[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:43.800]  He's very honest about that
[00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:45.400]  Not everybody was convinced
[00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:47.200]  But for those who worshipped Jesus
[00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:49.400]  This is Jesus, this is Jesus of Nazareth
[00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:50.600]  The carpenter's son
[00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:53.000]  The man they'd walked around with for three years
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:54.600]  And these were Jews who knew
[00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:57.200]  That they must not worship anybody or anything
[00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:58.800]  But the living God
[00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:01.800]  But before the risen crucified Jesus
[00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:02.800]  They worshipped him
[00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:04.400]  And Jesus accepts it
[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:06.600]  And he assumes the Yahweh position
[00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:09.600]  And claims all authority in heaven and on earth
[00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:11.200]  Has been given to me
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:14.000]  And those men and women who were there
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.200]  Would almost certainly have heard the echo of Deuteronomy again
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:19.200]  Acknowledge and take to heart this day
[00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:21.200]  That the Lord is God in heaven above
[00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:22.200]  And on the earth below
[00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:23.400]  There is no other
[00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:25.800]  Deuteronomy 4 verse 39
[00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:28.200]  It's as if Jesus is saying to his disciples
[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:31.200]  Look guys, now you know who I am
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:35.000]  That this God you worshipped all your lives
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:38.000]  Yahweh God, the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.000]  Has been walking among you
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.600]  In the flesh of Jesus of Nazareth
[00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:45.600]  And also that Jesus has accomplished
[00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:48.800]  All that Yahweh the God of Israel said he would accomplish
[00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:51.000]  To bring about the salvation of the world
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.400]  So you know that I am he
[00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:57.400]  And therefore you are my witnesses of these things
[00:49:57.400 --> 00:50:00.600]  Of my life, my teaching, my death
[00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:03.200]  My resurrection
[00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:05.800]  So how then will the nations come to know
[00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:08.400]  What God has done through the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:12.200]  How will the nations come to that Abrahamic blessing
[00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:15.200]  Of the saving knowledge of these truths
[00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:16.800]  About the living God
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:19.400]  You are my witnesses says Jesus
[00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:22.800]  You now stand in the place of Israel
[00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:25.800]  Bearing witness to the living God
[00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:28.000]  And his Son the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.200]  And all he has accomplished
[00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:32.200]  And so once again that seems to me
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:33.600]  That we seem that
[00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:35.800]  One of these primary dimensions
[00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:38.600]  Of what it means to be a Christian
[00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:41.400]  Namely that we are called to bear witness
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:43.000]  To the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.000]  Is deeply deeply rooted
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.600]  In the soil of Old Testament Israel
[00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:51.200]  And the identity and mission that was entrusted to them
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:54.400]  So blessing and priesthood and witness
[00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:57.000]  And last of all in the same verse
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.000]  Missional servanthood
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:03.800]  That's the other phrase that's there in Isaiah chapter 43 verse 9
[00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:07.000]  You will be my witnesses and my servant
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.400]  Whom I have chosen
[00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:11.600]  Now that word there in chapter 43
[00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:15.800]  Actually repeats what God had said to the Israelites
[00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:18.600]  In chapter 41 that's on the screen
[00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:20.600]  Where God had said to Israel
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:22.400]  Isaiah chapter 41
[00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:26.000]  You Israel my servant
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:27.600]  Jacob whom I have chosen
[00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:30.200]  You descendants of Abraham my friend
[00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:31.400]  Lovely word
[00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:33.200]  I took you from the ends of the earth
[00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:35.000]  From its farthest corners I called you
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.600]  And I said you are my servant
[00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:38.800]  I have chosen you
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:39.800]  I have not rejected you
[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:41.800]  So don't be afraid I'm with you and so on
[00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:44.600]  So back there in Isaiah 41
[00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:47.400]  Israel is identified as God's servant
[00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:49.800]  But there's a massive problem
[00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:51.600]  I referred to earlier for God
[00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:53.600]  Was that at this precise moment
[00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:57.000]  Israel was in exile under God's judgment
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:01.400]  A failed disobedient blind deaf servant
[00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:02.600]  As God says to them
[00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:03.800]  Hear you deaf
[00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:05.400]  Look you blind and see
[00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:07.400]  Who is blind but my servant
[00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:09.800]  And deaf like the messenger I send
[00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:13.200]  Who is blind like the one supposedly in covenant with me
[00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:15.200]  Blind like the servant of the Lord
[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:17.800]  And he goes on this is chapter 42
[00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:20.800]  Who handed over Jacob to become loot
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:22.600]  And Israel to the plunderers
[00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:25.800]  Was it not the Lord against whom we have sinned
[00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:27.800]  For they would not follow his ways
[00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:29.600]  They didn't obey his law
[00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:32.400]  So he poured out on them his burning anger
[00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:34.800]  And the violence of war and so on
[00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:36.400]  And so here is Israel
[00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:38.200]  Called to be the servant of God
[00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:40.600]  But languishing in exile
[00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:42.400]  But says God
[00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:46.600]  He introduces the servant of the Lord in chapter 42
[00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:48.400]  And as again you possibly know
[00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:50.000]  If you studied these chapters
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:53.200]  That theme of this servant of the Lord
[00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:54.600]  Flows through these chapters
[00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:56.600]  In a mysterious way
[00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:59.400]  As both being in a sense Israel
[00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:01.600]  But also being an individual
[00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:04.000]  Who has a mission to Israel
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.800]  And indeed through Israel for the nations
[00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:08.600]  Because in chapter 42
[00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:11.400]  He's going to bring justice to the nations
[00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:15.200]  But then that becomes not enough
[00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:17.200]  Because this is chapter 49
[00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:19.600]  The Lord says he who formed me in the womb
[00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:21.200]  To be his servant
[00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:23.600]  To bring Jacob back to him
[00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:25.800]  To gather Israel to himself
[00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:28.000]  So the servant of the Lord
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:30.400]  Has a mission to Israel
[00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:32.600]  To bring Israel back to God
[00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:34.800]  But in chapter 49
[00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:36.400]  The servant seems to be struggling
[00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:38.400]  Because he says I have laboured in vain
[00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:40.800]  I spent my strength for nothing at all
[00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:42.800]  He has this sense of frustration
[00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:45.000]  And it gets worse in chapter 50
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.400]  Where the servant experiences rejection
[00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:49.000]  And abuse and people are
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:50.800]  Plucking out his beard and stuff
[00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:52.200]  So it almost seems
[00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:54.000]  As if the servant's mission
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:57.200]  Is failing in frustration and opposition
[00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:58.800]  And then God answers him
[00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:00.000]  In chapter 49
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:01.600]  With a very startling word
[00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:03.000]  The Lord says to me
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.400]  In answer to that
[00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:08.200]  It's too small a thing for you to be my servant
[00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:10.200]  Just to restore the tribes of Jacob
[00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:12.600]  And to bring back those of Israel that I've kept
[00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:16.000]  I will also make you a light to the Gentiles
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.000]  To the nations that my salvation
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:20.600]  May reach the ends of the earth
[00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:21.800]  I don't know if you've ever had God
[00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:22.600]  Do that to you
[00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:23.600]  You know you complain to God
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:24.600]  This is far too hard
[00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:25.600]  I can't do this
[00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:26.600]  Because oh really
[00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:29.200]  Well let me give you something harder
[00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:30.400]  God sometimes does that
[00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:32.200]  That's what he does to the servant
[00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:34.200]  He's going to bring Israel back to God
[00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:39.400]  But also bring the salvation of God to the nations
[00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:40.600]  So to sum this up
[00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:42.000]  This servant language then
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:43.800]  Israel as a people
[00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:45.000]  Was a servant of God
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:46.800]  Chosen upheld by him
[00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:48.400]  In order to be a light to the nations
[00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:50.600]  But historically in exile
[00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:54.400]  Israel was failing in that role in that mission
[00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:56.800]  Israel as the servant was blind and deaf
[00:54:56.800 --> 00:54:58.000]  And under God's judgment
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.600]  So this individual servant figure
[00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:02.600]  Mysteriously in the prophet
[00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:06.800]  Is at one level distinct from Israel
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:09.000]  Because he has a mission to them
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:10.200]  And yet at another level
[00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:13.400]  Is somehow identified with Israel
[00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:15.800]  Same language is used of both
[00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:17.800]  So that the servant figure
[00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:22.600]  Will actually fulfill the original mission of Israel itself
[00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:24.600]  That is to bring the salvation
[00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:25.600]  The justice
[00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:27.000]  The liberation of God
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.400]  To the ends of the earth and to all the nations
[00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:33.000]  The universal purpose of the election of Israel
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:37.200]  Will be accomplished through the servant of Israel
[00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:41.200]  Now when we come to the New Testament
[00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:42.600]  There's abundant evidence
[00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:44.200]  Which I won't try to go into
[00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:47.200]  To suggest that Jesus saw himself
[00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:49.800]  In that identity as the servant of the Lord
[00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:51.600]  In the texts of Isaiah
[00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:52.800]  For example when he says
[00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:55.400]  I came not to be served but to serve
[00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:58.200]  Or I am among you as the one who serves
[00:55:58.200 --> 00:55:59.800]  And he quotes Isaiah 53
[00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:01.200]  At the Last Supper and so on
[00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:02.800]  I haven't time to go there
[00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:05.400]  But that mission of the servant
[00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:08.600]  In the Messiah Jesus which he quotes
[00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:11.800]  Doesn't end with Jesus himself
[00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:13.400]  Because what we then discover is that
[00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:16.200]  The Apostle Paul reflected very deeply on these texts
[00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:19.800]  Also in his mission to the nations
[00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:22.000]  He saw theologically a link between
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:25.800]  Jesus being the servant who was sent to Israel
[00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:27.200]  On the one hand
[00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:29.400]  And the ingathering of the nations
[00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:31.600]  With great rejoicing to the people of God
[00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:34.400]  On the other hand he saw them linked together
[00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:37.800]  That indeed is how he brings his letter to the Romans
[00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:39.000]  To a climax
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:41.000]  A climax which we sometimes ignore
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:44.400]  But it's actually very important in chapter 15
[00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:48.600]  Where Paul has been saying to the Jewish and Gentile believers
[00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:51.200]  In chapters 14 through to 15 7
[00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:52.200]  He's been telling them
[00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:53.800]  Jews and Gentiles in Christ
[00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:56.200]  That they must accept one another
[00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:57.000]  So he says
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:00.000]  I'm now quoting from Romans 15 verse 7
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.400]  Accept one another then
[00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:04.800]  Just as Christ Messiah accepted you
[00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:07.200]  In order to bring praise to God
[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:09.600]  For he says I tell you
[00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:13.400]  Christ the Messiah has become a servant
[00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:15.200]  The servant of the Jews
[00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:17.600]  On behalf of God's truth
[00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:19.000]  So that
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:20.000]  There's the purpose
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:23.000]  So that the promises made to the patriarchs
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:24.000]  I.e. to Abraham
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:25.400]  Might be confirmed
[00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:30.200]  Moreover that the nations might glorify God for his mercy
[00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:31.400]  As it is written
[00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:34.200]  And then he quotes four Old Testament texts
[00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:36.600]  Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles
[00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:38.000]  And sing praises of your name
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:40.600]  Again it says rejoice you Gentiles with his people
[00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:42.800]  And again praise the Lord all you Gentiles
[00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:44.200]  That all the peoples extol him
[00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:46.600]  And again Isaiah the root of Jesse will spring up
[00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:48.200]  And he will rule over the nations
[00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:50.200]  And in him the Gentiles will hope
[00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:53.600]  Four texts from the law the prophets and the writings
[00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:56.600]  All of them speaking about God's ultimate purpose
[00:57:56.600 --> 00:57:59.600]  That the nations the Gentiles will come to rejoice
[00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:01.000]  And praise God
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.400]  And Paul says all of that in a sense
[00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:05.600]  Is the fulfillment of the fact that
[00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:08.400]  Jesus became the servant of Israel
[00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:09.600]  He was the servant
[00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:11.800]  So that the glory of God
[00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:13.600]  And the praise of God could go to the nations
[00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:15.600]  That's how he ends Romans
[00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:17.800]  It's the climax he brings it to
[00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:19.800]  And of course Paul could do this
[00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:22.200]  Because this had been part of his calling
[00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:23.800]  At the very beginning
[00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:26.400]  In Acts chapter 26 verse 16
[00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:30.200]  He knew that he had been called to be a servant and a witness
[00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:33.200]  The very words that Jesus spoke to him echoed that
[00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:35.400]  Here's what Jesus said to Saul of Tarsus
[00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:37.400]  As he still was on the road to Damascus
[00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:39.400]  Get up stand on your feet
[00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:42.000]  I've appeared to you to appoint you
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:43.600]  Paul Saul of Tarsus
[00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:46.400]  As a servant and as a witness
[00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:49.200]  Of what you have seen and will see of me
[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:50.800]  I will rescue you from your own people
[00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:52.000]  And from the Gentiles
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:53.800]  I'm sending you to them
[00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:55.400]  The nation the Gentiles
[00:58:55.400 --> 00:58:58.000]  To open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:58:59.800]  And from the power of Satan to God
[00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:02.000]  So that they may receive forgiveness of sins
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:04.200]  And a place among those
[00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:06.000]  Who are sanctified by faith in me
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:07.800]  Paul himself
[00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:10.200]  Was commissioned to be servant and witness
[00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:11.800]  And that's why
[00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:13.800]  When Paul was in a synagogue
[00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:15.800]  In Pisidia in Antioch
[00:59:15.800 --> 00:59:18.400]  And he had given the whole history of Israel
[00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:19.800]  In about seven verses
[00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:20.800]  To the people there
[00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:23.400]  And led it from Abraham right up to Jesus
[00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:25.800]  And said this is what has now been fulfilled
[00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:27.800]  And some of the Jews believed him
[00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:28.800]  And some would not
[00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:30.400]  And the following Sabbath
[00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:33.200]  They came back and some of them opposed him
[00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:36.600]  And Paul what he does is that he takes this text
[00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:38.200]  From Isaiah
[00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:41.200]  Which of course he knew had been fulfilled by Jesus
[00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:43.200]  And he applies it to himself
[00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:45.800]  And his little band of missionary friends
[00:59:45.800 --> 00:59:49.600]  He moves from Jesus as the true son of David and Messiah
[00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:50.800]  And his resurrection
[00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:54.400]  Through to the God-fearing Gentiles in the audience
[00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:57.000]  This is his words, Acts 13
[00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:59.800]  We now turn to the Gentiles
[00:59:59.800 --> 01:00:03.800]  For this is what the Lord has commanded us, he says
[01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:07.000]  I have made you a light for the Gentiles
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.000]  That you may bring my salvation to the ends of the earth
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.000]  That's what God has commanded us, says Paul
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.000]  And we've been doing our exegesis and hermeneutics class
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.800]  We might say, just a minute Paul
[01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:21.200]  Isaiah actually said that about Old Testament Israel
[01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:22.800]  Paul said, yeah I know that
[01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:25.000]  And Jesus we understand
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.800]  Jesus applied the language of the servant to himself
[01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:29.200]  And Paul said, yeah I know that too
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:31.600]  I've just said it in chapter 15
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:33.200]  But here Paul says
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:36.600]  That this command of the servant to Israel through Jesus
[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:41.000]  Is now also explicitly the command for God's people
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.000]  And we are to be that servant people
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000]  Bringing the light of God to the nations
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.600]  It is a missional text for the church
[01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:52.000]  As the servant of the Lord bearing witness to him
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.200]  So there we are
[01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:56.400]  Once again I hope what we've seen is that
[01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:58.800]  In the scriptures of Israel and the Old Testament
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:01.400]  We find some essential understandings
[01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:03.000]  Of what it means not just to be
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.400]  The people of God
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:06.600]  But for the purpose for which we are
[01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:07.800]  The people of God
[01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:10.600]  Rooted in God's missional purpose for Israel
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:14.000]  Like them we are called in partnership with God
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.200]  For the nations and to the nations
[01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:19.000]  To be a blessing, to be a priesthood
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.400]  To be a witness and to be God's servant
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:24.600]  May God help us to do that
[01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:27.000]  For his name's sake, amen
[01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:27.800]  Thank you
