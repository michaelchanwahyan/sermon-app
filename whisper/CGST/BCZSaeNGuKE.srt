00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,520
各位先生女士

2023年

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,440
由中國大學教學院主持

7
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,960
本年我們的主題是《寫給我們聽的》

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,400
The Old Testament as Christian Scripture

9
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,760
Our keynote speaker is Reverend Dr. Christopher Wright

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,600
the Global Ambassador and Ministry Director of Langham Partnership

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,400
The two response speakers are Reverend Dr. Lawrence Koh

12
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,760
and Dr. Johnson Yu

13
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,400
Similar to the arrangement of the previous session

14
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,680
there will be time for question and answer

15
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,000
at the end of tonight's session

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,200
Our ushers have memo pads ready for you

17
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,280
to write down your questions

18
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,880
or you can choose to come forward in person

19
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:06,880
in the middle of the hall to ask

20
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,000
Let me give you a little bit more introduction about Dr. Wright

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,760
Dr. Wright is a messiologist

22
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,400
He is an Anglican clergyman

23
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,880
and also Old Testament scholar

24
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,920
He has published extensively

25
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,520
and two of his books

26
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,160
namely 《宣教中的上帝》

27
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,560
The Mission of God

28
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,120
Unlocking the Bible's Grand Narrative

29
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,640
and the other one

30
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,880
《上帝子民的宣教使命》

31
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,600
The Mission of God's People

32
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,080
A Biblical Theology of the Church's Mission

33
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,440
These two books have either been in the textbook

34
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,400
or on the reading list

35
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,560
of many of the mission-related courses

36
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,880
taught here in CGST

37
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,360
So it's a real pleasure to meet you in person, Dr. Wright

38
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,240
and hear you lecture

39
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,840
Earlier this afternoon

40
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,480
Reverend Dr. Wright guided us

41
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,520
in a reflection on how the Old Testament

42
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,240
informs us about our Christian identity

43
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,080
answering the question of who we are

44
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,920
Upcoming in this session

45
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,320
we'll be looking at what we are here for

46
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:23,000
the Old Testament and Christian mission

47
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,120
Mission to the Nations

48
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,760
is not just a scholarly pursuit for Dr. Wright

49
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,280
who is a missionary kid

50
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,800
and had experience of teaching

51
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,840
and living in India with his wife and kids

52
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,760
as missionaries

53
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,000
We are very much eager

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,280
to hear his perspectives and findings

55
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,600
It's very cold out there

56
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,000
Let's extend a very warm welcome

57
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,240
to Reverend Dr. Christopher Wright

58
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:57,440
Thank you

59
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,680
Thank you so much, Swans

60
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,000
for that very warm welcome indeed

61
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,640
Yes, actually this is the first time

62
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,440
I've ever felt cold in Hong Kong

63
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,600
I've been here many times

64
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,120
but it's nearly always been very hot

65
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,280
So it's actually quite a pleasure

66
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,680
to be in a temperature a bit more like London

67
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,960
where I left behind a few days ago

68
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,240
Now in our first lecture

69
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,720
we explored that theme

70
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,840
as Professor Kwan said

71
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,360
the theme of Christian identity

72
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,760
And it was interesting that

73
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,400
someone said to me just as we were going out

74
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,440
that I kept on saying about identity

75
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,120
is that who are we

76
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,360
who are we as God's people

77
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,240
And they said it's good to ask the question

78
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,360
in that way rather than simply asking

79
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,960
who am I

80
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,200
Because so often that is the way we ask it

81
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,360
as individuals

82
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,440
we want our individual identity

83
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,120
And just thinking about that

84
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,040
Chance comment as we were leaving

85
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,320
that of course who am I

86
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,400
does depend as a Christian

87
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,320
on who we are as the people of God

88
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,720
But I argued then in that last lecture

89
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,160
that we can't answer that question

90
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,720
who are we as Christians as the church

91
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,840
without going back to the texts

92
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,480
and the images and the story

93
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,280
and the metaphors of the Old Testament

94
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,280
the scriptures of the Lord Jesus himself

95
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,880
But there is a further dimension to that question

96
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,280
asking that question who are we

97
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,400
which has to do with the purpose

98
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,200
of our existence as God's people in the world

99
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,120
And there's some analogy here

100
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,800
to things, human artifacts

101
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,760
Because the only way to explain

102
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,720
what something is

103
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,240
if it's been manufactured

104
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,080
is to understand what it's for

105
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,120
You could have a clock

106
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,160
and you could describe it

107
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,720
I have a little one here

108
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,960
It's a little box

109
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,320
It's got a funny little face

110
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,080
It's got numbers up to 12

111
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,880
Why only 12?

112
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,880
It's got two hands that go round and round

113
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,040
But you haven't said what it is as a clock

114
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,680
Until you say, ah, well, it's for telling the time

115
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,480
That's its purpose of existence

116
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,320
Is to help you know what time it is

117
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,880
What is the purpose for which

118
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,600
it's been designed and produced

119
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,000
And so therefore we must ask

120
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,440
if we claim that our identity

121
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,400
is a people who are created by God

122
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,120
as we said in our first lecture

123
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,800
We have to further ask, yes, for what purpose

124
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,520
What are we here for

125
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,720
What is the reason for our existence

126
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,800
and the purpose of being

127
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,160
this unique people on the planet

128
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,320
Or perhaps better to ask

129
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,800
what was the purpose and goal

130
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,720
objective of God himself

131
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,320
the God of the Bible

132
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,640
for which and within which

133
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,680
he chose to create us as his people

134
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,360
What is the mission of God

135
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,800
to quote the title of a book

136
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,120
that was just mentioned

137
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,960
Well, the apostle Paul, of course, gives us

138
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,640
what I think is perhaps the most

139
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,400
succinct statement of the mission of God

140
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,640
in Ephesians 1, verses 9 and 10

141
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,880
where God says

142
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,120
just a moment, I need to bring that on there, yes

143
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,800
where God says this, I'm quoting

144
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,840
or Paul says this, I'm quoting him

145
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,080
he says, "God has made known to us

146
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,720
the mystery of his will

147
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,120
according to his good pleasure

148
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,640
which he purposed in Christ"

149
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,640
So when Paul's talking about

150
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,600
the will of God there

151
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,440
he doesn't mean his will for my life

152
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,800
He's talking about God's great plan and purpose

153
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,880
"to be put into effect

154
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,920
when the times reach their fulfilment

155
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,240
to bring unity to all things

156
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,760
in heaven and on earth under Christ"

157
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,080
And when Paul says

158
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,960
all things in heaven and earth

159
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,600
he means it

160
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,880
He's talking about the whole creation

161
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,880
And so God's plan, says Paul

162
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,280
is to bring unity, reconciliation, healing

163
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,360
to the whole creation

164
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,960
in and through Christ

165
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,440
That's the mission of God

166
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,960
It's the redemption, the reconciliation

167
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,080
of the creation that has been broken

168
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,400
and fractured by sin and evil

169
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,840
into the new creation

170
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,720
which will be populated by the redeemed

171
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,480
from every culture, tribe and nation

172
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,040
through the cross and the resurrection

173
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,360
of our Lord Jesus Christ

174
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,480
I think that that

175
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,840
that expression there in Ephesians 1

176
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,680
is what Paul probably meant

177
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,120
when he talked about in Acts 20

178
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,920
about the whole counsel of God

179
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,360
which he said he had preached

180
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,320
to the people in Ephesus

181
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,360
in Acts 20, verse 27

182
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,760
He means the plan of God

183
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,000
the purpose of God

184
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,440
from what we would say

185
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,240
from Genesis to Revelation

186
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,520
the whole grand narrative of Scripture

187
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,360
creation, fall, redemption

188
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,280
and new creation

189
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:32,440
all embraced and held together by Christ

190
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,160
So the mission of God then

191
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,480
is fundamentally the activity of God

192
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,320
driving this story forward

193
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,520
from its beginning

194
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,040
through its multiple facets

195
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,640
in the scriptural story

196
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,080
bringing it to its conclusion

197
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,920
Now that's the reason why

198
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,440
some of you may know about

199
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,480
the Lausanne movement

200
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,320
I hope you do

201
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,480
here at CGST

202
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,120
and Billy Graham and John Stott

203
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,560
and the first Lausanne Congress in 1974

204
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,200
Well, at the third Lausanne Congress

205
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,880
in South Africa in 2010

206
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,240
we produced a statement

207
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,240
which became known as

208
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,640
the Cape Town Commitment

209
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,880
which I dare say

210
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,840
some of you would have heard of

211
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,400
and I believe has also

212
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,040
been translated into Chinese

213
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,200
And here is how it defines mission

214
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,640
Let me quote to you from it

215
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,680
and it will come up

216
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,560
on a couple of screens

217
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,360
I hope you can read that

218
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,240
It says this

219
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,640
And as I read this

220
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,120
please listen for the biblical echoes

221
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,160
the echoes of the Scriptures

222
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,880
that you, I hope, will discern through it

223
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,240
It says

224
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,600
We are committed to world mission

225
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,720
because it is central

226
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,320
to our understanding of God

227
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,880
the Bible, the Church, human history

228
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,480
and the ultimate future

229
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,600
The whole Bible

230
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,400
reveals the mission of God

231
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,920
to bring all things in heaven and on earth

232
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,000
into unity under Christ

233
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,160
reconciling them through

234
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,720
the blood of His cross

235
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,080
There's Colossians

236
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,640
In fulfilling His mission

237
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,640
God will transform the creation

238
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,440
broken by sin and evil

239
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,800
into the new creation

240
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,200
in which there is no more

241
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,200
sin or curse

242
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,480
God will fulfill His promise to Abraham

243
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,480
to bless all nations on the earth

244
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,880
through the gospel of Jesus

245
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,800
the Messiah, the seed of Abraham

246
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,360
God will transform

247
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,560
this fractured world of nations

248
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,960
that are scattered under the judgment of God

249
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,360
into the new humanity

250
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,760
that will be redeemed by the blood of Christ

251
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,880
from every tribe, nation, tongue and language

252
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,280
and will be gathered to worship

253
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,960
our God and Savior

254
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,320
God will destroy the reign of death

255
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,120
corruption and violence

256
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,960
when Christ returns to establish

257
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,360
His eternal reign of life

258
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,280
justice and peace

259
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,720
And then God, Emmanuel

260
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,280
will dwell with us

261
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,800
and the kingdom of this world

262
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,640
will become the kingdom of our Lord

263
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,000
and of His Christ

264
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,040
and He will reign forever

265
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,800
I hope I might have heard an "amen"

266
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,080
somewhere around the room

267
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,080
I read that in Africa

268
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,560
they go "Hallelujah!"

269
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,800
but then you're Chinese

270
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,080
so I don't suppose you'll do that

271
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,200
Now what I hope is clear in that statement

272
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,920
which I hope you heard the scriptural echoes

273
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,800
is that God is the principal actor

274
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,880
Although it begins with our mission

275
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,280
that we are committed to

276
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,160
it reminds us that it is God

277
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,080
who has been driving this story forward

278
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,280
from its beginning

279
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,480
promise right through to its conclusion

280
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,000
But within that story

281
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,160
or that drama of the scripture

282
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:28,920
God has chosen to have a partner

283
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,000
He has chosen to bring together

284
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
those who will participate with Him

285
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,200
in this great project

286
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,320
As Paul puts it

287
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,680
we are co-workers with God

288
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,160
which is quite a remarkable expression

289
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,880
And that covenant people of course

290
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,680
is the people of Israel in the Old Testament

291
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,840
and believers in the Messiah Jesus

292
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,680
Jews and Gentiles in the New

293
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,520
So what are we here for?

294
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,480
What is our purpose?

295
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,520
We are called to partner with God

296
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,520
in the fulfillment of God's intentions

297
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,520
for the world and for creation

298
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,560
to do that within the course of human history

299
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,960
and then to go on serving

300
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,400
worshipping and glorifying God

301
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,840
for all eternity

302
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,760
in the world to come

303
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,760
in the new creation

304
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,840
God's new creation

305
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,240
Now in our first lecture

306
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,360
the one if you were here earlier this afternoon

307
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,640
you'll remember that we surveyed

308
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,640
a number of Old Testament texts

309
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,560
that related to the story of Israel

310
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,240
I want to do much the same thing again

311
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,640
but this time to show the reflection of them

312
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,200
in mission

313
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,000
how they affect the purpose of God's people

314
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,960
And I want to speak about four

315
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,320
Blessing in a slightly different way

316
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,200
from the first

317
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,760
Blessing, priesthood, witness and servanthood

318
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,760
So here is the Old Testament Christian mission

319
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,680
and the first thing we want to think about

320
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,120
is missional blessing

321
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,920
Now when did the church begin?

322
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,520
Well some people say the church began

323
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,960
on the day of Pentecost

324
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,520
I hope that at least after my first lecture

325
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,080
you'll realize that the church didn't begin

326
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,040
on the day of Pentecost

327
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,160
but began right back with Abraham

328
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,880
when God called the people into existence

329
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,840
But just as the church didn't begin

330
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,560
on the day of Pentecost

331
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,440
Christian mission didn't begin

332
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,160
on the Mount of Ascension only

333
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,520
at the end of Matthew's Gospel

334
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,640
The mission of God's people began

335
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,880
when God announced his intention

336
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,320
through Abraham

337
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,840
to bless not only him and his people

338
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,360
but all the nations on earth through him

339
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,720
That's God's mission

340
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,200
That's really where we trace it back to

341
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,880
Let me remind you of those verses

342
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,640
Genesis chapter 12 verses 1 to 3

343
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,480
very quickly read them

344
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,360
The Lord said to Abram

345
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,240
Go from your country, your people

346
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,400
and your father's household

347
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,240
to the land that I will show you

348
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,240
I will make you into a great nation

349
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,840
and I will bless you

350
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,320
I will make your name great

351
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,840
and be a blessing

352
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,800
or you will be a blessing

353
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,480
I will bless those who curse you

354
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,280
and whoever who bless you

355
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,280
I will bless those who bless you

356
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,520
and whoever curses you I will curse

357
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,320
and bottom line

358
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,240
all peoples on earth

359
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,640
will be blessed through you

360
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,200
Now it's not hard to hear

361
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,040
what the key word in those verses are

362
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,520
It's the word bless and blessing

363
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,600
which shines through about five times

364
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,880
in three verses

365
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,320
And this is very good news

366
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,920
because this is Genesis 12

367
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,800
which comes after Genesis 11

368
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,240
You need to know these things

369
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,480
You don't get a PhD for nothing

370
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,480
But it's not just the arithmetic

371
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,760
because as I was saying this morning

372
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,960
Genesis 11 is the sort of climax

373
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,840
of the story of human fallenness

374
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,360
and sin and rebellion

375
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,360
coming to its climax

376
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,600
in the Tower of Babel

377
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,520
and the scattering of the nations

378
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,200
Genesis 12 suddenly is good news

379
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,440
all over again

380
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,920
that God is going to bring blessing

381
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,200
into the world

382
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,320
So it's no wonder therefore

383
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,960
the Apostle Paul quotes this text

384
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,480
as what he calls

385
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,480
in Galatians 3 verses 8 and 9

386
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,480
the gospel in advance

387
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,520
That's what he said

388
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,520
that the scriptures

389
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,240
preach the gospel in advance

390
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,880
So Abraham saying

391
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,080
through you all nations will be blessed

392
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,440
The Greek literally is

393
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,040
he pre-evangelized Abraham

394
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,800
Here's God's great surprise

395
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,800
good news

396
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,480
that in spite of all that has happened

397
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,480
in chapters 4, 3 to 11

398
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,080
God still intends

399
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,440
to bless the nations of the earth

400
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,160
And he would launch this mission

401
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,160
through Abraham and his people

402
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,880
So therefore as we were thinking earlier

403
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,920
there is a universal purpose

404
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,560
to the existence of particular Israel

405
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,480
Israel as a nation exists

406
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,360
for the sake of God's ultimate purpose

407
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,400
for the whole of humanity

408
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,120
And this fundamentally missional intention

409
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,840
of the election of Israel

410
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,080
echoes on and on

411
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,800
through the Old Testament

412
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,840
Now you kindly referred to my book

413
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,640
The Mission of God

414
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,040
And there's a whole chapter on this

415
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,800
in there looking at these texts

416
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,040
But let me just read you

417
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,240
two or three of them very quickly

418
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,480
Verse Psalm 22 verse 27

419
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,960
All the ends of the earth

420
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,600
will remember and turn to the Lord

421
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,000
And all the families of the nations

422
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,080
will bow down before him

423
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,080
Isn't that an echo of Abraham?

424
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,920
Psalm 47 verse 9

425
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,480
The nobles of the nations

426
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,280
assemble as the people

427
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,760
of the God of Abraham

428
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,000
For the kings of the earth

429
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,200
belong to God

430
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,600
And he is greatly exalted

431
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,000
Psalm 47

432
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,960
Psalm 86 verse 9

433
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,280
All the nations you have made

434
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,280
will come and worship before you, Lord

435
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,760
And bring glory to your name

436
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,040
I sometimes wonder

437
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,440
what was going through the mind

438
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,400
of an Israelite

439
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,240
when they sang those words

440
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,640
Even just thinking of the nations

441
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,320
that they knew about in their world

442
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,360
Mind you sometimes I wonder

443
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,720
what's going through the mind of Christians

444
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,760
when they sing our hymns and songs as well

445
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,600
So it's not surprising

446
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,880
But there it is in the text

447
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,320
All the nations that God has made

448
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,080
will ultimately worship him

449
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,120
And turn to me and be saved

450
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,800
All you ends of the earth

451
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,080
For I am God and there is no other

452
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,800
Says Isaiah 45 verse 22

453
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,360
Many nations will be joined

454
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,520
with the Lord in that day

455
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,360
And will become my people

456
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,360
Zechariah 2 verse 9 and so on

457
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,160
Many many more

458
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,040
Those are just a sampling

459
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,840
So when we turn to the New Testament then

460
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,240
It's fascinating isn't it?

461
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,280
The very first verse of Matthew's Gospel

462
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,160
Traces the ancestry of Jesus

463
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,520
Not just back to David

464
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,880
Israel's messianic king in prophecy

465
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,840
But to Abraham

466
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,800
So Matthew begins with Abraham in the first verse

467
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,760
And ends with a strongly Abrahamic word of Jesus

468
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,680
In the Great Commission

469
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,840
Where he tells his disciples

470
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,760
To go and make disciples of all nations

471
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,200
Rather like Paul who speaks about

472
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,600
The obedience of faith among all nations

473
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,280
It's very Abrahamic

474
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,280
Here's how a New Testament scholar

475
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,560
Richard Baucom

476
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,200
A very fine New Testament scholar

477
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,840
Puts it on our quote

478
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,440
He says Matthew frames

479
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,560
The whole story of Jesus

480
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,720
Between the identification of him

481
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,560
As a descendant of Abraham

482
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,640
In the opening verse of the Gospel

483
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,960
And in the closing words of Jesus

484
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,400
At the end of the Gospel

485
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,920
With the commission to the disciples

486
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,120
To make disciples of all nations

487
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,320
For Matthew

488
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,640
Jesus is the Messiah

489
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,360
Not only for Jews

490
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,640
But also for Gentiles

491
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,640
He is the descendant of Abraham

492
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,560
Through whom God's blessing

493
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,240
Will at least at last reach the nations

494
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,520
So mission to the nations

495
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,600
As we would put it

496
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,920
Evangelization of the world and all of that

497
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,560
Is not some kind of afterthought

498
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,840
That occurred to Jesus

499
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,480
On the Mount of Ascension

500
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,560
When he suddenly thought

501
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,320
Hey I'm going off back up to heaven

502
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,720
What are these guys going to do

503
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,480
With the rest of their life

504
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,760
Hey why don't you go and be missionaries

505
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,880
That's a good idea

506
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,400
A sort of afterthought

507
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,520
At the end of the Gospels

508
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,160
No, it's the climax

509
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:52,880
It's the point

510
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,440
It's what the Gospel is all about

511
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,800
That what God had now accomplished

512
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,000
Through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ

513
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,200
Must now become the source of blessing

514
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,280
To all nations

515
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,080
So that God could keep his promise to Abraham

516
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,480
So in other words therefore

517
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,680
There's this theological affirmation

518
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,920
That if we are in Christ

519
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,080
Then not only as Paul says in Galatians

520
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,880
Are we the seed of Abraham

521
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,000
We share the blessing of Abraham

522
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,040
We are also commissioned to spread

523
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,120
The blessing of Abraham

524
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,240
Indeed I would argue that there is something

525
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,200
Great commission-ish

526
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,280
That's a word

527
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,840
About the Genesis 12 1-3

528
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,560
I'm not suggesting that it's sort of exactly the same

529
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:42,360
But the language certainly bears that sort of flavour

530
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,040
It starts with command go

531
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,080
It also says be a blessing

532
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,160
That middle line is actually an imperative

533
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,680
Not just you will be a blessing

534
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,000
But be a blessing

535
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,840
And then it ends with

536
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,400
All nations will be blessed through you

537
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,560
So here is a kind of a dynamic impulse

538
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,600
In which Abraham has launched into the world

539
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,240
In order to become as it were the launch pad

540
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,400
Of God bringing blessing into the world

541
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,200
So the people whom God creates in Abraham

542
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,320
Are not only a people for God

543
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,600
Belonging to God as we were thinking earlier

544
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,280
But also a people for the world

545
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,600
Our identity is also our mission

546
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,680
In other words Genesis 12 1-3

547
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,320
Is both ecclesiological

548
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,920
It's the beginnings as it were of the people of God

549
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,160
It's also missiological

550
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,840
Because it describes the very purpose

551
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,880
Through which they exist

552
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,160
And this Abrahamic dimension of Christian mission

553
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,000
Impacts not just that Gentile mission

554
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,200
In the book of Acts

555
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,400
Where Paul sees the moving out to the Gentiles

556
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,680
As God keeping his promise to Abraham

557
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,280
But I would say would be the kind of mantra

558
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,520
That one could put over all the following centuries

559
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,280
Of Christian mission ever since

560
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,880
You could argue that Christian mission at its simplest

561
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,320
Is simply a matter of God keeping his promise to Abraham

562
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,160
Which he began to do of course

563
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,160
In the book of Acts

564
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,360
And then in the New Testament era

565
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,080
So that the gospel went south

566
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,600
Down to Africa with the Ethiopian eunuch

567
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,520
It goes east according to the church in India

568
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,640
With Thomas who brought the gospel to India

569
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,040
And there's certainly documentary evidence

570
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,840
Of Christianity in India from the second century

571
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,960
It also of course went eastwards to Syria

572
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,360
And then northeast

573
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,600
And it was Syrian missionaries

574
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,200
Who were bringing the gospel to China

575
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,480
As I'm sure you know

576
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,240
By the 6th to 8th century

577
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,040
Went west with the apostle Paul

578
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,280
Cross the Bosporus into Europe

579
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:47,200
And eventually reached the very edges of the world

580
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,800
Ireland where I come from

581
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,160
On those little islands just off the edge

582
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,040
About to drop off the edge of the world

583
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,360
And of course ever since

584
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,240
Every time the gospel crosses a barrier

585
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,880
Reaches new people

586
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,280
God is keeping his promise to Abraham

587
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,960
Bringing the blessing of salvation

588
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,600
To new nation after new nation

589
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,600
Until the day comes

590
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,200
That we read about in Revelation

591
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,160
Revelation 7 verse 9

592
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:13,920
Where John says

593
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,320
I saw a great multitude

594
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,720
That no one could count

595
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,120
From every tribe, nation, people and language

596
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,680
Standing before the throne of God and the Lamb

597
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:28,360
And I have a kind of mental picture of God

598
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,360
Poking Abraham in the ribs and saying

599
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,320
There you are, I kept my promise

600
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,280
All nations I said

601
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,280
All nations it is

602
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,000
Mission accomplished

603
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,840
So that's the first, this missional blessing

604
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,240
The Abrahamic dimension of Christian mission

605
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,560
And there's a lot more about that of course

606
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,440
In my two books

607
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,360
That leads us to the second theme

608
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,120
That I wanted to bring

609
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,680
Which is missional priesthood

610
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,160
Moving on from Genesis to Exodus

611
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,800
We won't go all the way through the Old Testament

612
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,600
But at least we do the first two or three books

613
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,040
God's address to Israel at Mount Sinai

614
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,720
Comes after the Exodus

615
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,200
After they get out of Egypt

616
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,480
In Exodus chapter 19

617
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,120
And here again we pick up

618
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,800
One of those identities of God's people

619
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,720
We mentioned it

620
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,320
I mentioned it in passing in the earlier lecture

621
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,160
Of being God's priesthood

622
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,680
But let me read these verses to you

623
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,200
Exodus chapter 19 verses 3 to 6

624
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,560
And the first two verses of the chapter

625
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,040
Give us both the date and the location

626
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,520
It says this was just three months

627
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,560
After they had come out of Egypt

628
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,080
When they had reached Mount Sinai

629
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,440
And camped there at the foot of Mount Sinai

630
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,120
And verse 3

631
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,960
Then Moses went up to God

632
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,000
And the Lord called to him from the mountain

633
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,480
Mount Sinai and said

634
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,800
This is what you are to say

635
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,320
To the descendants of Jacob

636
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,640
And what you are to tell the people of Israel

637
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,320
You yourselves have seen what I did to Egypt

638
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,400
And how I carried you in eagles' wings

639
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,360
And brought you to myself

640
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,040
Now then if you will obey me fully

641
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,520
And keep my covenant

642
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,480
Then out of all nations

643
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,520
You will be my treasured possession

644
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,800
For the whole earth is mine

645
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,280
And you will be for me

646
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,040
A kingdom of priests

647
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,800
And a holy nation

648
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,280
These are the words you are to speak

649
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,600
To the Israelites

650
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,880
End of quote from verse 6

651
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,880
So the very first thing that God does here

652
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,160
Is that he points to his own initiative

653
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:25,920
In verse 4

654
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,600
You have seen what I have done

655
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,360
Says God in verse 4

656
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,960
In other words this is the priority of God's grace

657
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,960
As I said also earlier about election

658
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:39,320
God redeems his people out of Egypt

659
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,360
And then talks about obeying him

660
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,720
And keeping the covenant

661
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,080
Redemption, salvation comes first

662
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,680
God's initiative of grace

663
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,120
And then obedience as a response to that

664
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,960
In the keeping of the law

665
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,120
And so the motivating power for all that follows

666
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,320
Including the Ten Commandments and the rest of the law

667
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,600
Is always what God has done for them

668
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,320
His redemption from slavery

669
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,760
The Exodus becomes the motivating power

670
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,800
Why should we keep this law

671
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,080
Because God redeemed us out of Egypt

672
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,720
That's the theme that flows through the rest of the law

673
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,680
But then, and one could go on a lot about that point

674
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,480
But then the text there in Exodus 19

675
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,640
Moves on from that backward looking motivation

676
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,080
What God had already done

677
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,280
In 18 chapters of salvation

678
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:31,080
Moves on to a forward looking motivation

679
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,880
That is what God planned for Israel

680
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,080
To be in the world

681
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,360
In the midst of the nations

682
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,280
Here's my agenda for you

683
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,880
This is what you will be for me

684
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,960
This is a future

685
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,920
This is a looking forward

686
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:50,200
It is indeed what we might call a missional perspective

687
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,760
Because God's plan for his people

688
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:56,200
Is that they should be a priestly and holy people

689
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,480
In the midst of all nations in the whole earth

690
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,920
Verse 5

691
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,800
Which as I hope you will detect by now

692
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,240
Has a certain Abrahamic ring about it

693
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,360
God had said to Abraham

694
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:11,720
I'm going to bless all nations in the earth through you

695
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,160
And here is Yahweh God as it were

696
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,920
At the top of Mount Sinai

697
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,640
Saying to the people of Israel so to speak

698
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,680
From up here as it were in the top

699
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,040
I can see the whole earth and it's all mine

700
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,440
And all the nations of the earth belong to me

701
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,480
But you will have a particular purpose

702
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,720
A particular identity and agenda in that world

703
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:35,040
To be a priestly and a holy people

704
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,080
Now that identity of being priestly and holy

705
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,240
Is something which echoes on

706
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,840
Through other parts of the Old Testament

707
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,520
And indeed is inherited by us as Peter says

708
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,880
And will still be there in the book of Revelation

709
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,920
But we need to ask

710
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,520
What does it mean for Israel

711
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:56,600
To be God's priesthood in relation to the nations

712
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,400
And in order to understand that

713
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,760
We need to ask

714
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,640
Well what were Israel's priests for them

715
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,920
How did the priests function

716
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,560
And here is one way that I sometimes

717
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,800
Try to illustrate that for you

718
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,520
Priests basically were middle men

719
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,520
They stood in between God on the one hand

720
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,120
And all the rest of the people on the other

721
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,960
Sometimes we use the word mediator

722
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,800
Or in the middle

723
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,800
And in that mediating position between God

724
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,920
And the rest of the Israelites

725
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,760
They had two main jobs

726
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,720
One which we don't often think about

727
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,400
Was that they were to be teachers

728
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,920
Teachers of God's law to the people

729
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,960
That's actually what is said about them

730
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,680
Right at the very ordination of Aaron and his sons

731
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,800
The Lord says to Aaron

732
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,120
This is in Leviticus chapter 10

733
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,640
He says they must distinguish

734
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,960
Between the holy and the common

735
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,240
The unclean and the clean

736
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,040
So that you can teach the Israelites

737
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,480
All the decrees that the Lord has given them

738
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,120
Through Moses

739
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,760
The priests were to be teachers

740
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,160
So that the people would come to know

741
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,560
The ways of God

742
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,280
That's also there in the blessing of Moses

743
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:06,720
On the tribe of Levi in Deuteronomy chapter 33

744
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,720
Where it says about Levi

745
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,480
Which was the Levites tribe

746
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,160
That the priests came from

747
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,440
He teaches your precepts to Jacob

748
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,160
And your law to Israel

749
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,560
And he offers incense before you

750
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,440
And whole burnt offerings on your altar

751
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,600
So the teaching function actually comes first

752
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,000
That through the priests

753
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,040
God would become known to the people

754
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,800
Which is why when the people went so badly wrong

755
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,840
In later life of Israel

756
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,520
Who did the prophets blame?

757
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,760
The priests

758
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,480
That's what Hosea says very clearly

759
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,360
He says the land

760
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,600
There's no knowledge of God in the land

761
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,640
The land is full of idolatry

762
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,280
And stealing and robbery and murder and adultery

763
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,600
And then he says

764
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,800
Who is my quarrel with?

765
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,200
Who am I accusing?

766
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,640
He says it is you, O priest

767
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,680
Because the priests were failing to teach the people

768
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,280
So that's the first task

769
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,720
Through the priests

770
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,560
God would become known to the people

771
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,480
And then the other direction of course

772
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,280
That we're perhaps more familiar with

773
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,680
Is that it was the job of the priests

774
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,640
To bring the sacrifices of the people to God

775
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,800
Which you read in the first seven chapters of Leviticus

776
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,640
So you know this of course

777
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,240
That if you're an Israelite

778
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,080
And for some reason

779
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,840
Whether some sin or some uncleanness

780
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,400
That you were unable to come into the

781
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,320
Worshipping community of God

782
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,720
The temple and so on

783
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,640
What would you do?

784
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,400
Well you would bring an animal

785
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,000
To the sanctuary as prescribed in the law

786
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,040
You would lay your hand on its head

787
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,400
The priest would be then slaughtered

788
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,120
And the blood of the sacrifice

789
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,520
Would be thrown against the altar

790
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,960
Representing God

791
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,800
And the priest would declare to you

792
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,280
That your sin is atoned for

793
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,600
Covered or possibly cleansed

794
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,720
The word atoned has two possible meanings

795
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,520
And so with the sin dealt with

796
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,720
Through the sacrifice

797
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,320
You could then come back

798
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,720
Into covenant fellowship with God

799
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,600
And if you offered a fellowship offering

800
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,520
As it was called

801
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,480
Then you're going to have a barbecue as well

802
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,680
And enjoy a good family meal with the meat

803
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,960
That was what it signified

804
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,000
Was that you and I are back in fellowship

805
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,640
With God and his people

806
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,840
So you can see then that the job of the priest

807
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,720
Was twofold

808
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,720
It was bringing God to the people

809
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,840
And bringing the people to God

810
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,520
That was their role within Israel

811
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:30,520
So it's very significant isn't it

812
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,240
That God says to the Israelites

813
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,720
As a whole people

814
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,160
As a community for him

815
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,840
He said you will be for me

816
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,840
To the rest of the nations

817
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,240
What your priests are for you

818
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,160
Through you my people Israel

819
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,640
I will make myself known to the world

820
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,840
And through you ultimately

821
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,840
I will draw the world to myself

822
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,240
That's what it meant for Israel to be God's priesthood

823
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,400
In the midst of the nations

824
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,640
At least that's part of the meaning

825
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,200
There are other ways of thinking of it as well

826
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,920
So as the people of Yahweh God in the Old Testament

827
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,640
They would have this task of

828
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,360
Bringing the knowledge of God to the nations

829
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,360
Which they've done

830
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,320
Because we've got this book

831
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,440
Three quarters of which are the scriptures of Israel

832
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,600
Through whom we know the living God

833
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,560
So God has made himself known as it were

834
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,960
Through the priesthood of Israel

835
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,000
Simply being the people that brought us the scriptures

836
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,360
And of course we know

837
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,880
That ultimately it was through Israel

838
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,120
The Messiah of Israel

839
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,200
The Lord Jesus Christ himself

840
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,600
That God has drawn the nations to himself

841
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,960
As Jesus put it

842
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,360
That I if I be lifted up

843
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,680
Will draw all men to myself

844
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,680
In his revelation of God

845
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,760
And in his atoning work at the cross

846
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,080
God through the Messiah Jesus

847
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,400
Has made himself known

848
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,000
And has brought the world to himself

849
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,760
So that's the priestly task of this people

850
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,360
And even in exile

851
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,200
Even when they were thrown out of their land

852
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,560
Under God's judgment

853
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,000
Jeremiah writes them a letter

854
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,280
Do you remember in Jeremiah chapter 29

855
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,880
And says that even in the midst of that calamity

856
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,240
They were instructed to be a blessing

857
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,800
To the nation where they were

858
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,000
That is not the precise words he uses

859
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,600
But it's by implication

860
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,400
Where Jeremiah says in chapter 29 verse 7

861
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:19,800
Seek the shalom of the city to which I've carried you into exile

862
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,400
Babylon their enemies

863
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,080
Pray to the Lord for it

864
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:26,800
Because in its shalom is your shalom

865
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,920
In other words you can be a blessing

866
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,000
Even to the people who are your enemies

867
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,200
In the midst of the nations

868
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,600
So that's what I mean by saying

869
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,400
That it does seem to me that the priesthood of God's people

870
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,960
Is a missional function

871
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,000
Which stands in continuity

872
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,080
With the Abrahamic election

873
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,600
For the sake of the nations

874
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,400
So the mission of God's people

875
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,080
Then includes being this priesthood

876
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,280
In and for the world

877
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:55,080
And that fits exactly with the way

878
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,200
One way in which the New Testament

879
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,600
Speaks about our mission in the New Testament

880
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,400
Certainly it's how the apostle Paul

881
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,000
Saw his task

882
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Here I'm quoting from Romans chapter 15

883
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,080
Where Paul reminds the Romans

884
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,400
He says I want to remind you

885
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,600
Of the grace that God gave to me

886
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,600
To be a minister of the Messiah

887
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,600
Christ Jesus to the Gentiles

888
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,200
To the nations

889
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,000
So he's a minister of the Messiah

890
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,200
To the nations

891
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,000
He gave me the priestly duty

892
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,400
Of proclaiming the gospel of God

893
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,800
So that the Gentiles

894
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,600
The nations

895
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,000
Might become an offering acceptable to God

896
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,200
Sanctified by the Holy Spirit

897
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,000
It's a fascinating verse

898
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,400
In fact it's the only verse in the New Testament

899
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,800
Where anybody speaks about their personal work

900
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,000
In priestly terms

901
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,400
The pastors in the church

902
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,400
They're called pastors or elders or shepherds

903
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,800
But not specifically priests

904
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:54,600
But Paul says he had a priestly job to do

905
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,400
Now Paul could never have functioned as a priest

906
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,800
In Jerusalem in the temple

907
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,000
Because he was the wrong tribe wasn't he

908
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,400
The soul of Tarsus was of the tribe of Benjamin

909
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,600
Not of Levi

910
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:08,400
But he says yes but I had a priestly job

911
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,200
Not in some ordained function as it were

912
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,200
Within the church

913
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,800
But precisely in his evangelistic work

914
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,200
Among the nations

915
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,000
He says through my role

916
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,400
My lifetime's work

917
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,400
Was to bring God to the nations

918
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,800
In order to bring the nations to God

919
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,200
That's a priestly function

920
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,000
I don't know whether he had this verse

921
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,600
Of Exodus in mind when he wrote that

922
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,800
Or whether it was just as it were

923
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,200
Part of the furniture and assumptions of his mind

924
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,800
That his evangelism

925
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,400
Was effectively priestly work

926
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,600
Bringing the knowledge of God

927
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,000
The gospel to the nations

928
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,600
So the nations could come to God

929
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,400
And we might think

930
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,400
Wow that's all very well

931
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,000
That was the apostle Paul

932
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,200
He was an apostle

933
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,600
He was a missionary

934
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,600
I'm just an ordinary Christian

935
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,000
Well we don't get off quite so easily

936
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,200
Because as the text says on the screen

937
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,200
The apostle Peter applies precisely

938
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,200
This very same verse

939
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,800
Exodus 19 verse 6 to all believers

940
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,400
Writing almost certainly to a mixture

941
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,400
Of both Jewish and Gentile believers

942
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,600
Who were scattered across the various provinces

943
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,000
Of Asia Minor

944
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,400
Where the churches were in his day

945
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:20,800
And you notice how in 1 Peter 2 verses 9 to 12

946
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,400
Peter combines a number of Old Testament references

947
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,000
Including Exodus 19 verse 6

948
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
And insists that this is how we

949
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,800
We Christian believers

950
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,800
Are to live among the nations

951
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,000
They're fairly familiar verses

952
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,400
But I'll read them anyway

953
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,800
Peter says you

954
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,200
Plural, you are a chosen people

955
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,600
A royal priesthood

956
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,800
A holy nation

957
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,000
Is Exodus 19

958
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
God's special possession

959
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
That you may declare the praises of him

960
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,200
Who called you out of darkness

961
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,000
Into his wonderful light

962
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,200
There's the Exodus imagery again

963
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,400
Out of, into

964
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,200
Once you were not a people

965
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,000
Now you are the people of God

966
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,800
That's Hosea

967
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,600
Once you had not received mercy

968
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,400
But now you have received mercy

969
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,000
So therefore dear friends

970
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,400
On the basis of that

971
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,400
Unfortunately many of our English Bibles

972
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,000
Put a paragraph division in there

973
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,800
With another heading

974
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,600
Which is a shame

975
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,800
Because it spoils the flow of Peter's thought

976
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,800
He says this is who you are

977
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,400
This is what you've experienced

978
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,000
Therefore I urge you as foreigners in exile

979
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,800
To abstain from sinful desires

980
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,600
Which war against your soul

981
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,800
And to live such good lives

982
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,000
Among the nations

983
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,400
And again our English Bibles

984
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,000
Sometimes say among the pagans

985
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,200
Or the heathen or something

986
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,600
But it is among entwise ethnic

987
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,800
Among the nations

988
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,800
It's Genesis language

989
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,400
So that even though they accuse you of doing wrong

990
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,200
They may see your good deeds

991
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,200
And glorify God on the day he visits us

992
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,600
Where Peter is echoing the Lord Jesus Christ himself

993
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,800
You says Peter

994
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,600
You are that priesthood

995
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,000
You, we

996
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,600
We are meant to be God's representatives

997
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,200
Among the nations

998
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,600
To be the living proof of the living God

999
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,400
To bring God to people

1000
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,200
And to bring people to God

1001
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,400
That's our priestly mission

1002
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,800
And how do we do that

1003
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,200
Well of course we can only do that

1004
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,400
By the second phrase that Moses used

1005
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,600
That is not only by being a priestly kingdom

1006
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,800
But by being a holy people

1007
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,000
And that's what we will think of tomorrow

1008
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,400
If you can come back for lecture number three

1009
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,000
When we ask about how then should we live

1010
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,800
What are the ethical standards

1011
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,000
Of being a holy people

1012
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,200
So that's therefore missional blessing

1013
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,600
And missional priesthood

1014
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,200
I think there are just two other ones

1015
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,600
That I want to put before us

1016
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,200
And that is witnesses and servants

1017
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,600
They occur actually together in one verse

1018
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:47,000
In Isaiah chapter 43 verses 9 to 11

1019
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:47,800
This is what we read

1020
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,800
God says to the Israelites

1021
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,200
He says you are my witnesses

1022
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,600
Declares the Lord

1023
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,800
And my servant whom I have chosen

1024
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,200
And I just want us to think about

1025
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:01,000
Each of those two words

1026
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,800
Now the context of those verses there

1027
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,200
In Isaiah chapter 49 are of course

1028
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,800
That Israel had been in exile in Babylon

1029
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,000
And many of them had completely lost hope

1030
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,400
For any future for themselves

1031
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,400
Or indeed for the purposes of God

1032
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,800
You know from Ezekiel for example chapter 37

1033
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,000
That the Israelites in exile thought of themselves

1034
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,800
As dead bones in the grave

1035
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,000
We might as well be finished

1036
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
There's no more future for us

1037
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,200
But God's word through these chapters of Isaiah

1038
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,600
Repeatedly reassures them

1039
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,200
That God's purposes go on

1040
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,800
And that God still has a place within them

1041
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:45,400
And that their mission was to bear witness

1042
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,600
To Yahweh the God of Israel

1043
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,200
As being the only true and living God

1044
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,000
That they were God's servant

1045
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,600
In order to bear witness to the living God

1046
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,800
So missional witness

1047
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,000
You see as again you probably know

1048
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,400
If you've done some old tests

1049
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,600
And study and read these chapters of Isaiah

1050
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,200
That there's a great kind of conflict going on

1051
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,000
In these chapters between

1052
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,400
Yahweh the God of Israel

1053
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,800
And the other nations and their gods

1054
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,000
It's like a kind of court case

1055
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,600
That's happening between them

1056
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,800
And in Isaiah chapter 43 verse 9

1057
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,600
There's a great assembly of the nations pictured

1058
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,000
It's like a sort of great court

1059
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,200
Here's Isaiah 43 verse 9

1060
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,600
All the nations gather together

1061
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,800
And the peoples assemble

1062
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:37,000
Which of their gods foretold all this

1063
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,200
And proclaimed to us the former things

1064
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,400
Now you see God has been saying earlier

1065
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,000
That he was the God who had predicted the exile

1066
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,400
And he was the God who had explained it

1067
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,800
And interpreted it in the past

1068
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,400
So which of their gods did that

1069
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,000
Let them bring in their witnesses

1070
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,400
To prove that they were right

1071
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,600
So that others may hear and say

1072
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,000
Oh yeah yeah that's right

1073
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
So there's this sense in which

1074
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,200
In this assembly of the nations with their gods

1075
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:11,800
Who and how will we decide which God or gods is real

1076
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,600
Which God is right

1077
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:17,600
Now Yahweh the God of Israel has made his claim

1078
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,200
To be the only true God

1079
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,600
In all the way through these earlier chapters

1080
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,200
By his ability precisely to predict the future

1081
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,800
To interpret the past

1082
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,400
And to explain the present

1083
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,400
That he's the sovereign God of all these things

1084
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,000
So the other nations then

1085
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,800
The other gods rather

1086
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,000
The other gods are invited to bring in their witnesses

1087
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
If they can prove that they're any better

1088
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,600
Or even anywhere near as good

1089
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,600
Now who are the witnesses of the other gods

1090
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,000
Well the other nations

1091
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,200
But they don't say anything

1092
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,800
Because they've got nothing to say

1093
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,400
Because their gods are weak and powerless

1094
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,200
And less than nothing

1095
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,200
So then okay who's left

1096
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,600
Yahweh God

1097
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,800
So who will speak for him

1098
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,800
In this international court of nations and gods

1099
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,800
Who will testify to the power

1100
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:11,200
The existence the reality of Yahweh as God

1101
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,600
Who

1102
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,200
God says verse 10

1103
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,000
You

1104
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,800
You are my witnesses declares the Lord

1105
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,000
You Israelites

1106
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,600
You are my witnesses

1107
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,800
And my servant whom I have chosen

1108
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,600
In other words this is God saying to Israel

1109
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,800
You know you're in exile

1110
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,000
But you're still my witnesses

1111
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,600
In fact it's actually very surprising

1112
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,400
Because God had just described Israel

1113
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,800
In the previous chapter

1114
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:42,000
The Israelites in exile as blind and deaf

1115
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,200
And is not with all due charity

1116
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,400
Not a lot of point bringing into a courtroom

1117
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,800
As a witness

1118
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,600
Someone who couldn't see anything

1119
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,400
And can't hear anything

1120
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,400
Blind and deaf is sort of precisely

1121
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,800
Not what you want in a witness

1122
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,800
And the reason of course why

1123
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,400
The Israelites were blind and deaf

1124
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,600
As it says in chapter 42

1125
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,200
Is because they had rejected God's words

1126
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,800
And his warnings in the past

1127
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,400
And he had had to drive them into judgment

1128
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,600
But now by his restoring grace

1129
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,400
By the miracle of a new exodus

1130
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,200
Which was just around the corner

1131
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,600
God says you're going back

1132
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,400
Back to your original Abrahamic mission

1133
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,800
In the midst of the nations

1134
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,400
And when I've restored you

1135
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,000
You will bear witness

1136
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,600
To the saving God of Israel once more

1137
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:32,600
God's people must be witnesses for their God

1138
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,400
That is a major missional responsibility

1139
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,400
You are my witnesses says God

1140
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,800
Now the word itself is a significant one

1141
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,800
In Old Testament Israel

1142
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,400
Just being a witness of anything

1143
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,800
Was a very serious responsibility

1144
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,200
Especially in a courtroom

1145
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,600
Or in the gate in the city

1146
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,800
Where the cases were discussed

1147
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,200
In fact there are a number of

1148
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:59,200
Significant laws in Old Testament law

1149
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,000
About the importance of being a truthful witness

1150
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,800
And how serious it was to be a false witness

1151
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,000
In fact one of the Ten Commandments

1152
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,800
Is exactly that

1153
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,800
You shall not bear false witness

1154
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,600
Another thing of course is that

1155
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,000
Bribery was hated

1156
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Because bribery would twist people

1157
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,400
To tell untruths

1158
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,600
And indeed the Old Testament law

1159
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,400
Had about the most severe

1160
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,000
Perjury law anywhere in the world

1161
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,400
Even today

1162
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:29,400
If you gave false witness in court

1163
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:32,000
And it could then be proved that you had

1164
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Then you would be punished

1165
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
With whatever punishment

1166
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
The person that you were falsely accusing

1167
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,200
Would have got

1168
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,400
If your witness had been believed

1169
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,800
Even up to the death penalty

1170
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,600
So if you mistakenly accused somebody

1171
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,400
Of something for which they could be executed

1172
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,800
And you were shown to have

1173
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,800
Told the untruth

1174
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,000
You would be executed

1175
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,200
Now that's pretty severe

1176
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,000
It's a very deterrent law

1177
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,600
It shows how seriously God took the importance

1178
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,600
Of being a true and truthful witness

1179
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,400
The integrity and the truthfulness of witness

1180
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:08,600
Was important in Old Testament society

1181
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,600
So here you see God is

1182
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:13,200
Calling the Israelites to exercise

1183
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:17,400
In the international arena of nations and gods

1184
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,400
A responsibility

1185
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:23,400
That was deeply rooted in their own social culture

1186
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:27,000
The task of bearing witness

1187
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,600
Now what would it be

1188
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:31,200
That the Israelites were to bear witness to

1189
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,200
Well these verses that we are just starting on

1190
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,400
Spell it out

1191
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,400
Let me now read to you

1192
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,400
What they were to bear witness to

1193
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,000
This is Isaiah chapter 43

1194
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,400
Verses 9 to 13

1195
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,200
You are my witnesses declared the Lord

1196
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,000
And my servant whom I have chosen

1197
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,800
So that you may know and believe me

1198
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,200
And understand that

1199
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,000
I am he

1200
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,200
I am God alone

1201
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,600
Before me no God was formed

1202
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,800
Nor will there be one after me

1203
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,400
I'm not a temporary God

1204
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,000
In other words

1205
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Alpha and omega kind of thing

1206
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,400
I even I am the Lord

1207
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,800
And apart from me there is no saviour

1208
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:11,200
I have revealed and saved and proclaimed

1209
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:14,400
I am not some foreign God among you

1210
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,200
So you are my witnesses declares the Lord

1211
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,600
That I am God

1212
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,200
It's a wonderful language

1213
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:25,000
Israel then is being called to bear witness

1214
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
To several great foundational truths

1215
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
About Yahweh the God of Israel

1216
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,800
All of which we will see in a moment

1217
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,600
Apply to Jesus Christ

1218
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,400
When you get to the New Testament

1219
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,200
And therefore help us to understand

1220
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:42,400
What it means for us to be witnesses to Jesus

1221
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,400
The three things that are clear in this text are

1222
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,200
First of all

1223
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,600
Israel was to bear witness

1224
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:50,400
That Yahweh alone is the transcendent eternal God

1225
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,400
I am he

1226
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:52,600
I am God

1227
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:53,800
There is no other God

1228
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:57,800
He is the transcendent eternal living God

1229
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,800
There is none before and none to come after

1230
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,400
That's Old Testament monotheism

1231
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,000
It's not just saying there is only one God

1232
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Doesn't really matter which God you have

1233
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
As long as you only got one

1234
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
No, this is saying

1235
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,400
Not only is there only one God

1236
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,200
This is who he is

1237
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,200
It's the identity of the living God

1238
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,000
Secondly

1239
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,200
That Yahweh alone is in sovereign control of history

1240
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:21,200
I have revealed and saved and proclaimed

1241
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:25,600
This again is recollecting the story of the Exodus

1242
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,600
That God revealed it

1243
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,000
This is what he's going to do

1244
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,400
Then he did it

1245
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,800
Then he interpreted it

1246
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,200
Then he explained it

1247
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,600
And teaches his people

1248
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:38,600
And only the God who is in control of events

1249
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,400
Can do all of those things

1250
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,000
Can say this is what's going to happen

1251
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
That's what just happened

1252
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,200
This is why it happened

1253
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,800
God interprets, explains

1254
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:48,400
It's the author of the story

1255
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,000
Who controls the story

1256
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,400
God is sovereign in history

1257
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,800
And that Yahweh alone is not only God

1258
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,400
And sovereign but also saviour

1259
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,200
The I alone and the God who say

1260
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,400
There is no other saviour than the living God

1261
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,000
That indeed is his name

1262
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,400
He is the God then

1263
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:09,600
Whose righteousness had sent the Israelites into exile

1264
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,000
And it's the same God

1265
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,400
Whose righteousness will deliver them from exile

1266
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,000
There is no other saving God

1267
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Because there is no other God

1268
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Period

1269
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,400
You said God to the Israelites

1270
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:29,200
You are my witnesses that I am God

1271
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:33,600
You said Jesus twice to his disciples

1272
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:36,600
The risen Jesus to his disciples

1273
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:40,000
You will be my witnesses

1274
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,200
Luke makes that phrase by Jesus

1275
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:46,000
A kind of verbal velcro

1276
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,800
Between the end of his gospel

1277
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,400
And the beginning of Acts

1278
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,200
It's there in Luke chapter 24

1279
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,200
In the day of resurrection

1280
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,600
Where Jesus says

1281
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,200
You know what the scriptures have said

1282
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,200
This is what is written

1283
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,000
Messiah will come and suffer and rise again

1284
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,200
In the third day

1285
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,600
That repentance and forgiveness of sins

1286
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,600
Will be preached in his name to all the nations

1287
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:07,400
And you are witnesses of these things

1288
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,400
And then also in Acts chapter 1

1289
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:10,200
Verse 8

1290
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,000
On the day of his ascension

1291
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,400
Where Jesus says to the disciples before he left

1292
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,800
You will be my witnesses

1293
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,200
In Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria

1294
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:19,600
And to the ends of the earth

1295
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:22,400
And I have no doubt in my mind anyway

1296
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:26,600
That Jesus was consciously echoing this text from Isaiah 43

1297
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:30,200
That just as Yahweh God of Israel had said to the Israelites

1298
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,600
You are my witnesses in the world of the nations

1299
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:36,400
So Jesus the risen Christ now calls his disciples

1300
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,000
To do the same task

1301
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,600
To bear witness to the living God among the nations

1302
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,000
Because after all

1303
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,800
What greater truth could there be in the universe

1304
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:50,800
Than the identity of Jesus of Nazareth

1305
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,400
As the living God who has come and lived among us

1306
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:58,000
The sovereignty of Jesus as Lord

1307
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,400
He is the Lord Jesus Christ

1308
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,200
Not kurios kaisar, Caesar is Lord

1309
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,600
But Jesus is Lord

1310
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,600
They went out into the world to say

1311
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:09,200
And that he is the one and only saviour

1312
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:12,600
That there is no other name given among men under heaven

1313
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,400
By which we must be saved

1314
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,200
Than the name of Jesus himself

1315
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:20,000
So he alone is God and Lord and saviour

1316
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,400
And we are his witnesses

1317
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:27,400
That's why it seems to me on the Mount of Ascension

1318
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:31,400
That Jesus says these amazing words

1319
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,800
That Matthew records in Matthew 28

1320
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,000
He almost in his way

1321
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,800
Matthew tells us that when they came to Jesus

1322
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,800
At the Mount of Ascension they worshipped him

1323
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,400
Though some doubted

1324
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,800
He's very honest about that

1325
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,400
Not everybody was convinced

1326
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,200
But for those who worshipped Jesus

1327
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,400
This is Jesus, this is Jesus of Nazareth

1328
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:50,600
The carpenter's son

1329
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:53,000
The man they'd walked around with for three years

1330
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,600
And these were Jews who knew

1331
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:57,200
That they must not worship anybody or anything

1332
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,800
But the living God

1333
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,800
But before the risen crucified Jesus

1334
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:02,800
They worshipped him

1335
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,400
And Jesus accepts it

1336
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,600
And he assumes the Yahweh position

1337
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:09,600
And claims all authority in heaven and on earth

1338
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,200
Has been given to me

1339
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,000
And those men and women who were there

1340
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,200
Would almost certainly have heard the echo of Deuteronomy again

1341
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,200
Acknowledge and take to heart this day

1342
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,200
That the Lord is God in heaven above

1343
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,200
And on the earth below

1344
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:23,400
There is no other

1345
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,800
Deuteronomy 4 verse 39

1346
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:28,200
It's as if Jesus is saying to his disciples

1347
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:31,200
Look guys, now you know who I am

1348
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:35,000
That this God you worshipped all your lives

1349
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Yahweh God, the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel

1350
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Has been walking among you

1351
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,600
In the flesh of Jesus of Nazareth

1352
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,600
And also that Jesus has accomplished

1353
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:48,800
All that Yahweh the God of Israel said he would accomplish

1354
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,000
To bring about the salvation of the world

1355
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,400
So you know that I am he

1356
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:57,400
And therefore you are my witnesses of these things

1357
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:00,600
Of my life, my teaching, my death

1358
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:03,200
My resurrection

1359
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,800
So how then will the nations come to know

1360
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,400
What God has done through the Lord Jesus Christ

1361
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:12,200
How will the nations come to that Abrahamic blessing

1362
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:15,200
Of the saving knowledge of these truths

1363
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,800
About the living God

1364
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,400
You are my witnesses says Jesus

1365
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,800
You now stand in the place of Israel

1366
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,800
Bearing witness to the living God

1367
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:28,000
And his Son the Lord Jesus Christ

1368
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,200
And all he has accomplished

1369
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,200
And so once again that seems to me

1370
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:33,600
That we seem that

1371
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:35,800
One of these primary dimensions

1372
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:38,600
Of what it means to be a Christian

1373
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:41,400
Namely that we are called to bear witness

1374
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,000
To the Lord Jesus Christ

1375
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Is deeply deeply rooted

1376
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,600
In the soil of Old Testament Israel

1377
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:51,200
And the identity and mission that was entrusted to them

1378
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,400
So blessing and priesthood and witness

1379
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,000
And last of all in the same verse

1380
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Missional servanthood

1381
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,800
That's the other phrase that's there in Isaiah chapter 43 verse 9

1382
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:07,000
You will be my witnesses and my servant

1383
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,400
Whom I have chosen

1384
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,600
Now that word there in chapter 43

1385
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:15,800
Actually repeats what God had said to the Israelites

1386
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,600
In chapter 41 that's on the screen

1387
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:20,600
Where God had said to Israel

1388
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,400
Isaiah chapter 41

1389
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:26,000
You Israel my servant

1390
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,600
Jacob whom I have chosen

1391
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:30,200
You descendants of Abraham my friend

1392
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,400
Lovely word

1393
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,200
I took you from the ends of the earth

1394
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,000
From its farthest corners I called you

1395
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,600
And I said you are my servant

1396
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:38,800
I have chosen you

1397
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:39,800
I have not rejected you

1398
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,800
So don't be afraid I'm with you and so on

1399
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,600
So back there in Isaiah 41

1400
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:47,400
Israel is identified as God's servant

1401
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,800
But there's a massive problem

1402
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,600
I referred to earlier for God

1403
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,600
Was that at this precise moment

1404
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:57,000
Israel was in exile under God's judgment

1405
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,400
A failed disobedient blind deaf servant

1406
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:02,600
As God says to them

1407
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:03,800
Hear you deaf

1408
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:05,400
Look you blind and see

1409
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,400
Who is blind but my servant

1410
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,800
And deaf like the messenger I send

1411
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:13,200
Who is blind like the one supposedly in covenant with me

1412
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,200
Blind like the servant of the Lord

1413
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,800
And he goes on this is chapter 42

1414
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:20,800
Who handed over Jacob to become loot

1415
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,600
And Israel to the plunderers

1416
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:25,800
Was it not the Lord against whom we have sinned

1417
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:27,800
For they would not follow his ways

1418
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,600
They didn't obey his law

1419
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:32,400
So he poured out on them his burning anger

1420
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,800
And the violence of war and so on

1421
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,400
And so here is Israel

1422
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,200
Called to be the servant of God

1423
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,600
But languishing in exile

1424
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,400
But says God

1425
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:46,600
He introduces the servant of the Lord in chapter 42

1426
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:48,400
And as again you possibly know

1427
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,000
If you studied these chapters

1428
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,200
That theme of this servant of the Lord

1429
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,600
Flows through these chapters

1430
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,600
In a mysterious way

1431
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:59,400
As both being in a sense Israel

1432
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,600
But also being an individual

1433
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:04,000
Who has a mission to Israel

1434
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,800
And indeed through Israel for the nations

1435
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,600
Because in chapter 42

1436
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:11,400
He's going to bring justice to the nations

1437
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:15,200
But then that becomes not enough

1438
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,200
Because this is chapter 49

1439
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,600
The Lord says he who formed me in the womb

1440
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:21,200
To be his servant

1441
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,600
To bring Jacob back to him

1442
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,800
To gather Israel to himself

1443
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:28,000
So the servant of the Lord

1444
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,400
Has a mission to Israel

1445
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,600
To bring Israel back to God

1446
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,800
But in chapter 49

1447
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,400
The servant seems to be struggling

1448
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,400
Because he says I have laboured in vain

1449
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,800
I spent my strength for nothing at all

1450
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,800
He has this sense of frustration

1451
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,000
And it gets worse in chapter 50

1452
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,400
Where the servant experiences rejection

1453
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,000
And abuse and people are

1454
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,800
Plucking out his beard and stuff

1455
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,200
So it almost seems

1456
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,000
As if the servant's mission

1457
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,200
Is failing in frustration and opposition

1458
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,800
And then God answers him

1459
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,000
In chapter 49

1460
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,600
With a very startling word

1461
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,000
The Lord says to me

1462
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,400
In answer to that

1463
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:08,200
It's too small a thing for you to be my servant

1464
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:10,200
Just to restore the tribes of Jacob

1465
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,600
And to bring back those of Israel that I've kept

1466
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:16,000
I will also make you a light to the Gentiles

1467
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
To the nations that my salvation

1468
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,600
May reach the ends of the earth

1469
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:21,800
I don't know if you've ever had God

1470
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:22,600
Do that to you

1471
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:23,600
You know you complain to God

1472
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:24,600
This is far too hard

1473
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:25,600
I can't do this

1474
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:26,600
Because oh really

1475
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:29,200
Well let me give you something harder

1476
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,400
God sometimes does that

1477
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,200
That's what he does to the servant

1478
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:34,200
He's going to bring Israel back to God

1479
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:39,400
But also bring the salvation of God to the nations

1480
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:40,600
So to sum this up

1481
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,000
This servant language then

1482
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,800
Israel as a people

1483
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,000
Was a servant of God

1484
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,800
Chosen upheld by him

1485
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,400
In order to be a light to the nations

1486
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,600
But historically in exile

1487
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:54,400
Israel was failing in that role in that mission

1488
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,800
Israel as the servant was blind and deaf

1489
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:58,000
And under God's judgment

1490
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,600
So this individual servant figure

1491
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:02,600
Mysteriously in the prophet

1492
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:06,800
Is at one level distinct from Israel

1493
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:09,000
Because he has a mission to them

1494
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,200
And yet at another level

1495
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:13,400
Is somehow identified with Israel

1496
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,800
Same language is used of both

1497
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,800
So that the servant figure

1498
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:22,600
Will actually fulfill the original mission of Israel itself

1499
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:24,600
That is to bring the salvation

1500
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:25,600
The justice

1501
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:27,000
The liberation of God

1502
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,400
To the ends of the earth and to all the nations

1503
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:33,000
The universal purpose of the election of Israel

1504
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,200
Will be accomplished through the servant of Israel

1505
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:41,200
Now when we come to the New Testament

1506
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,600
There's abundant evidence

1507
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:44,200
Which I won't try to go into

1508
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:47,200
To suggest that Jesus saw himself

1509
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,800
In that identity as the servant of the Lord

1510
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,600
In the texts of Isaiah

1511
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:52,800
For example when he says

1512
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:55,400
I came not to be served but to serve

1513
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:58,200
Or I am among you as the one who serves

1514
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:59,800
And he quotes Isaiah 53

1515
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:01,200
At the Last Supper and so on

1516
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,800
I haven't time to go there

1517
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:05,400
But that mission of the servant

1518
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:08,600
In the Messiah Jesus which he quotes

1519
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:11,800
Doesn't end with Jesus himself

1520
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:13,400
Because what we then discover is that

1521
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:16,200
The Apostle Paul reflected very deeply on these texts

1522
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:19,800
Also in his mission to the nations

1523
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:22,000
He saw theologically a link between

1524
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,800
Jesus being the servant who was sent to Israel

1525
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,200
On the one hand

1526
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,400
And the ingathering of the nations

1527
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,600
With great rejoicing to the people of God

1528
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:34,400
On the other hand he saw them linked together

1529
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,800
That indeed is how he brings his letter to the Romans

1530
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,000
To a climax

1531
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
A climax which we sometimes ignore

1532
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,400
But it's actually very important in chapter 15

1533
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:48,600
Where Paul has been saying to the Jewish and Gentile believers

1534
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:51,200
In chapters 14 through to 15 7

1535
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,200
He's been telling them

1536
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,800
Jews and Gentiles in Christ

1537
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:56,200
That they must accept one another

1538
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:57,000
So he says

1539
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,000
I'm now quoting from Romans 15 verse 7

1540
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,400
Accept one another then

1541
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:04,800
Just as Christ Messiah accepted you

1542
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:07,200
In order to bring praise to God

1543
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,600
For he says I tell you

1544
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:13,400
Christ the Messiah has become a servant

1545
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,200
The servant of the Jews

1546
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,600
On behalf of God's truth

1547
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,000
So that

1548
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
There's the purpose

1549
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,000
So that the promises made to the patriarchs

1550
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
I.e. to Abraham

1551
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,400
Might be confirmed

1552
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:30,200
Moreover that the nations might glorify God for his mercy

1553
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,400
As it is written

1554
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:34,200
And then he quotes four Old Testament texts

1555
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,600
Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles

1556
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:38,000
And sing praises of your name

1557
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,600
Again it says rejoice you Gentiles with his people

1558
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,800
And again praise the Lord all you Gentiles

1559
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:44,200
That all the peoples extol him

1560
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,600
And again Isaiah the root of Jesse will spring up

1561
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:48,200
And he will rule over the nations

1562
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:50,200
And in him the Gentiles will hope

1563
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:53,600
Four texts from the law the prophets and the writings

1564
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:56,600
All of them speaking about God's ultimate purpose

1565
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:59,600
That the nations the Gentiles will come to rejoice

1566
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:01,000
And praise God

1567
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,400
And Paul says all of that in a sense

1568
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,600
Is the fulfillment of the fact that

1569
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:08,400
Jesus became the servant of Israel

1570
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:09,600
He was the servant

1571
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:11,800
So that the glory of God

1572
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,600
And the praise of God could go to the nations

1573
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:15,600
That's how he ends Romans

1574
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,800
It's the climax he brings it to

1575
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,800
And of course Paul could do this

1576
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:22,200
Because this had been part of his calling

1577
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:23,800
At the very beginning

1578
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:26,400
In Acts chapter 26 verse 16

1579
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:30,200
He knew that he had been called to be a servant and a witness

1580
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:33,200
The very words that Jesus spoke to him echoed that

1581
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,400
Here's what Jesus said to Saul of Tarsus

1582
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:37,400
As he still was on the road to Damascus

1583
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,400
Get up stand on your feet

1584
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:42,000
I've appeared to you to appoint you

1585
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,600
Paul Saul of Tarsus

1586
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:46,400
As a servant and as a witness

1587
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:49,200
Of what you have seen and will see of me

1588
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,800
I will rescue you from your own people

1589
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,000
And from the Gentiles

1590
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,800
I'm sending you to them

1591
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,400
The nation the Gentiles

1592
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:58,000
To open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light

1593
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,800
And from the power of Satan to God

1594
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:02,000
So that they may receive forgiveness of sins

1595
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,200
And a place among those

1596
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,000
Who are sanctified by faith in me

1597
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,800
Paul himself

1598
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:10,200
Was commissioned to be servant and witness

1599
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:11,800
And that's why

1600
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:13,800
When Paul was in a synagogue

1601
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,800
In Pisidia in Antioch

1602
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:18,400
And he had given the whole history of Israel

1603
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,800
In about seven verses

1604
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:20,800
To the people there

1605
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:23,400
And led it from Abraham right up to Jesus

1606
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,800
And said this is what has now been fulfilled

1607
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,800
And some of the Jews believed him

1608
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:28,800
And some would not

1609
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:30,400
And the following Sabbath

1610
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,200
They came back and some of them opposed him

1611
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:36,600
And Paul what he does is that he takes this text

1612
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:38,200
From Isaiah

1613
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:41,200
Which of course he knew had been fulfilled by Jesus

1614
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,200
And he applies it to himself

1615
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,800
And his little band of missionary friends

1616
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:49,600
He moves from Jesus as the true son of David and Messiah

1617
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:50,800
And his resurrection

1618
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:54,400
Through to the God-fearing Gentiles in the audience

1619
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:57,000
This is his words, Acts 13

1620
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,800
We now turn to the Gentiles

1621
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:03,800
For this is what the Lord has commanded us, he says

1622
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:07,000
I have made you a light for the Gentiles

1623
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,000
That you may bring my salvation to the ends of the earth

1624
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
That's what God has commanded us, says Paul

1625
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,000
And we've been doing our exegesis and hermeneutics class

1626
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,800
We might say, just a minute Paul

1627
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:21,200
Isaiah actually said that about Old Testament Israel

1628
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,800
Paul said, yeah I know that

1629
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:25,000
And Jesus we understand

1630
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,800
Jesus applied the language of the servant to himself

1631
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:29,200
And Paul said, yeah I know that too

1632
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,600
I've just said it in chapter 15

1633
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:33,200
But here Paul says

1634
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:36,600
That this command of the servant to Israel through Jesus

1635
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:41,000
Is now also explicitly the command for God's people

1636
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:44,000
And we are to be that servant people

1637
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Bringing the light of God to the nations

1638
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,600
It is a missional text for the church

1639
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:52,000
As the servant of the Lord bearing witness to him

1640
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,200
So there we are

1641
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:56,400
Once again I hope what we've seen is that

1642
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,800
In the scriptures of Israel and the Old Testament

1643
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:01,400
We find some essential understandings

1644
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,000
Of what it means not just to be

1645
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,400
The people of God

1646
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,600
But for the purpose for which we are

1647
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:07,800
The people of God

1648
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:10,600
Rooted in God's missional purpose for Israel

1649
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:14,000
Like them we are called in partnership with God

1650
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,200
For the nations and to the nations

1651
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:19,000
To be a blessing, to be a priesthood

1652
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,400
To be a witness and to be God's servant

1653
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:24,600
May God help us to do that

1654
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:27,000
For his name's sake, amen

1655
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:27,800
