1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,920
 (soft piano music)

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:13,380
 - Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,480
 Welcome to the second session

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,360
 of the Josephine Soh Culture and Ethics Lectures, 2023,

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,640
 hosted by China Graduate School of Theology.

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,080
 Our theme this year is "Written for Us,

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,640
 The Old Testament as Christian Scripture."

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,880
 Our keynote speaker is Reverend Dr. Christopher Wright,

9
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,480
 the Global Ambassador and Ministry Director

10
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,760
 of Langham Partnership.

11
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,520
 The two response speakers are Reverend Dr. Florence Koh

12
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,760
 and Dr. Johnson Yu.

13
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,520
 Similar to the arrangement of the previous session,

14
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,800
 there will be time for question and answer

15
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,760
 at the end of tonight's session.

16
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,280
 Our ushers have memo pads ready for you

17
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,400
 to write down your questions,

18
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,000
 or you can choose to come forward in person

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,700
 in the middle of the hall to ask.

20
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,160
 Let me give you a little bit more introduction

21
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,900
 about Dr. Wright.

22
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,800
 Dr. Wright is a missiologist.

23
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:19,800
 He's an Anglican clergyman and also Old Testament scholar.

24
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:24,060
 He had published extensively,

25
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:29,060
 and two of his books, namely "宣教宗的上帝,"

26
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:34,280
 The Mission of God, Unlocking the Bible's Grand Narrative,

27
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,120
 and the other one, "上帝子民的宣教使命,"

28
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,760
 The Mission of God's People,

29
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,200
 A Biblical Theology of the Church's Mission.

30
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,600
 These two books have either been in the textbook

31
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,560
 or on the reading list

32
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,680
 of many of the mission-related courses

33
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,000
 taught here in CGST.

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,480
 So it's a real pleasure to meet you in person, Dr. Wright,

35
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,220
 and hear you lecture.

36
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,920
 Earlier this afternoon,

37
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,660
 Reverend Dr. Wright guided us in a reflection

38
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:07,880
 on how the Old Testament informs us

39
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,360
 about our Christian identity,

40
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,060
 answering the question of who we are.

41
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:16,040
 Upcoming in this session,

42
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,600
 we'll be looking at what we are here for,

43
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,800
 the Old Testament and Christian mission.

44
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,760
 Mission to the Nations is not just a scholarly pursuit

45
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,440
 for Dr. Wright, who is a missionary kid,

46
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,840
 and had experience of teaching and living in India

47
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,880
 with his wife and kids as missionaries.

48
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,720
 We are very much eager to hear his perspectives

49
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,420
 and findings.

50
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,740
 It's very cold out there.

51
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,160
 Let's extend a very warm welcome

52
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,920
 to Reverend Dr. Christopher Wright.

53
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,080
 (audience applauding)

54
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,280
 - Thank you.

55
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,800
 Thank you so much, Swans,

56
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,120
 for that very warm welcome indeed.

57
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,840
 Yes, actually, this is the first time

58
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,120
 I've ever felt cold in Hong Kong.

59
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,760
 I've been here many times,

60
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,240
 but it's nearly always been very hot,

61
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,440
 so it's actually quite a pleasure

62
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,840
 to be in a temperature a bit more like London,

63
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,460
 where I left behind a few days ago.

64
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,380
 Now, in our first lecture,

65
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:23,180
 we explored that theme, as Professor Kwan said,

66
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,740
 the theme of Christian identity.

67
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,940
 And it was interesting that someone said to me,

68
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:28,860
 just as we were going out,

69
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,540
 that I kept on saying about identity is that,

70
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,740
 who are we?

71
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,980
 Who are we as God's people?

72
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,460
 And they said, it's good to ask the question in that way,

73
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,620
 rather than simply asking, who am I?

74
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,060
 Because so often that is the way we ask it as individuals,

75
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,220
 we want our individual identity.

76
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,580
 And just thinking about that chance comment

77
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,940
 as we were leaving,

78
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:55,220
 that of course, who am I does depend as a Christian

79
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:59,100
 on who we are as the people of God.

80
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,460
 But I argued then in that last lecture

81
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,940
 that we can't answer that question,

82
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,500
 who are we as Christians, as the church,

83
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,420
 without going back to the texts and the images

84
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:13,020
 and the story and the metaphors of the Old Testament,

85
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,100
 the scriptures of the Lord Jesus himself.

86
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,700
 But there is a further dimension to that question,

87
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,100
 asking that question, who are we?

88
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,380
 Which has to do with the purpose of our existence

89
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,940
 as God's people in the world.

90
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:30,380
 And there's some analogy here to things,

91
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,660
 human artifacts,

92
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:36,580
 because the only way to explain what something is,

93
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,140
 if it's been manufactured,

94
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,180
 is to understand what it's for.

95
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,180
 You could have a clock and you could describe it,

96
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,340
 I have a little one here,

97
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,860
 and it's with a little box,

98
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,260
 it's got a funny little face,

99
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,820
 it's got numbers up to 12, why only 12?

100
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,860
 It's got two hands that go round and round.

101
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:56,020
 But you haven't said what it is as a clock

102
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,700
 until you've said, ah, well, it's for telling the time,

103
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,500
 that's its purpose of existence,

104
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,340
 is to help you know what time it is.

105
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,260
 What is the purpose for which it's been designed

106
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,620
 and produced?

107
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,900
 And so therefore we must ask,

108
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,060
 if we claim that our identity is a people

109
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,300
 who are created by God,

110
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,940
 as we said in our first lecture,

111
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,580
 we have to further ask, yes, for what purpose?

112
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,380
 What are we here for?

113
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,620
 What is the reason for our existence

114
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:25,060
 and the purpose of being this unique people on the planet?

115
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,220
 Or perhaps better to ask,

116
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:31,620
 what was the purpose and goal, objective of God himself,

117
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,220
 the God of the Bible,

118
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:38,220
 for which and within which he chose to create us as human?

119
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,860
 Us as his people?

120
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,500
 What is the mission of God?

121
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,180
 To quote the title of a book that was just mentioned.

122
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,660
 Well, the apostle Paul, of course,

123
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:51,660
 gives us what I think is perhaps the most succinct statement

124
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:56,660
 of the mission of God in Ephesians 1, verses nine and 10,

125
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,500
 where God says, just a moment,

126
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,220
 I need to bring that on there, yes,

127
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,940
 where God says this, I'm quoting,

128
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,980
 or Paul says this, I'm quoting him,

129
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:07,820
 he says, "God has made known to us the mystery of his will

130
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,220
 according to his good pleasure,

131
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:11,740
 which he purposed in Christ."

132
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,700
 So when Paul's talking about the will of God there,

133
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,580
 he doesn't mean his will for my life,

134
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,820
 he's talking about God's great plan and purpose,

135
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:18,980
 "to be put into effect

136
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,020
 when the times reach their fulfillment,

137
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,980
 to bring unity to all things in heaven

138
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,860
 and on earth under Christ."

139
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:30,060
 And when Paul says all things in heaven and earth,

140
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,980
 he means it, he's talking about the whole creation.

141
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,980
 And so God's plan, says Paul,

142
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:38,380
 is to bring unity, reconciliation, healing,

143
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:42,060
 to the whole creation in and through Christ.

144
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,540
 That's the mission of God.

145
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,980
 It's the redemption, the reconciliation of the creation

146
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:50,500
 that has been broken and fractured by sin and evil

147
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,900
 into the new creation,

148
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,820
 which will be populated by the redeemed

149
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:58,380
 from every culture, tribe, and nation through the cross

150
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,420
 and the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ.

151
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,460
 I think that that, that expression there

152
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,020
 in Ephesians chapter one,

153
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,180
 is what Paul probably meant when he talked about,

154
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:12,060
 in Acts 20, about the whole counsel of God,

155
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:15,460
 which he said he had preached to the people in Ephesus

156
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,500
 in Acts 20, verse 27.

157
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,140
 He means the plan of God, the purpose of God,

158
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,340
 from what we would say from Genesis to Revelation,

159
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,660
 the whole grand narrative of scripture,

160
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,380
 creation, fall, redemption, and new creation,

161
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:32,580
 all embraced and held together by Christ.

162
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,180
 So the mission of God then is fundamentally

163
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:38,420
 the activity of God, driving this story forward

164
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:41,140
 from its beginning through its multiple facets

165
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:44,340
 in the scriptural story, bringing it to its conclusion.

166
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,020
 Now that's the reason why,

167
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,580
 some of you may know about the Lausanne movement.

168
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,580
 I hope you do, here at CGST,

169
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,220
 and Billy Graham and John Stott

170
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:57,660
 on the first Lausanne Congress in 1974.

171
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:02,660
 Well, at the third Lausanne Congress in South Africa in 2010,

172
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,100
 we produced a statement which became known

173
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,620
 as the Cape Town Commitment,

174
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,820
 which I dare say some of you would have heard of,

175
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:13,020
 and I believe has also been translated into Chinese.

176
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:16,540
 And here's how it defines mission.

177
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:19,060
 Let me quote to you from it,

178
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,580
 and it'll come up on a couple of screens.

179
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,340
 I hope you can read that.

180
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,540
 It says this, "And as I read this,

181
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:27,020
 "please listen for the biblical echoes,

182
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,180
 "the echoes of the scriptures,"

183
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,900
 that you, I hope, will discern through it.

184
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,620
 It says, "We are committed to world mission

185
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,300
 "because it is central to our understanding of God,

186
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,860
 "the Bible, the church, human history,

187
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,460
 "and the ultimate future.

188
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,380
 "The whole Bible reveals the mission of God

189
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,940
 "to bring all things in heaven and on earth

190
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,020
 "into unity under Christ,

191
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,820
 "reconciling them through the blood of his cross."

192
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,060
 There's Colossians.

193
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,620
 "In fulfilling his mission,

194
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:57,420
 "God will transform the creation broken by sin and evil

195
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,780
 "into the new creation

196
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:02,180
 "in which there is no more sin or curse.

197
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,460
 "God will fulfill his promise to Abraham

198
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,460
 "to bless all nations on the earth

199
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,780
 "through the gospel of Jesus, the Messiah,

200
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,780
 "the seed of Abraham.

201
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:14,580
 "God will transform this fractured world of nations

202
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,980
 "that are scattered under the judgment of God

203
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,300
 "into the new humanity that will be redeemed

204
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,860
 "by the blood of Christ from every tribe,

205
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,900
 "nation, tongue, and language,

206
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,940
 "and will be gathered to worship our God and Savior.

207
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,340
 "God will destroy the reign of death,

208
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,140
 "corruption, and violence

209
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:34,380
 "when Christ returns to establish his eternal reign

210
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,300
 "of life, justice, and peace.

211
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:41,320
 "And then God, Emmanuel, will dwell with us,

212
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,820
 "and the kingdom of this world

213
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:46,060
 "will become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ,

214
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,420
 "and he will reign forever."

215
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:54,180
 I hope I might have heard an amen somewhere around the room.

216
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,660
 I read that in Africa, they go, "Hallelujah!"

217
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,940
 But then you're Chinese,

218
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,740
 so I don't suppose you'll do that.

219
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:04,820
 Now, what I hope is clear in that statement,

220
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,060
 which I hope you heard the scriptural echoes,

221
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:10,020
 is that God is the principal actor.

222
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,020
 Although it begins with our mission

223
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,460
 that we are committed to,

224
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,300
 it reminds us that it is God

225
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,220
 who has been driving this story forward

226
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,460
 from its beginning,

227
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,620
 from its promise, right through to its conclusion.

228
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:25,300
 But within that story, or that drama of the scripture,

229
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:29,100
 God has chosen to have a partner.

230
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,140
 He has chosen to bring together

231
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:36,140
 those who will participate with him in this great project.

232
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:40,820
 As Paul puts it, "We are co-workers with God,"

233
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,300
 which is quite a remarkable expression.

234
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,020
 And that covenant people, of course,

235
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,820
 is the people of Israel and the Old Testament,

236
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,500
 and believers in the Messiah,

237
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,820
 Jesus, Jews, and Gentiles in the New.

238
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,660
 So what are we here for?

239
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,620
 What is our purpose?

240
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,700
 We are called to partner with God

241
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,620
 in the fulfillment of God's intentions

242
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,640
 for the world and for creation,

243
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,700
 to do that within the course of human history,

244
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,740
 and then to go on serving, worshiping,

245
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:12,980
 and glorifying God for all eternity

246
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,860
 in the world to come, in the new creation,

247
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,100
 God's new creation.

248
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,340
 Now, in our first lecture,

249
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,460
 the one, if you were here earlier this afternoon,

250
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,780
 you'll remember that we surveyed

251
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:25,780
 a number of Old Testament texts

252
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,700
 that related to the story of Israel.

253
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,380
 I want to do much the same thing again,

254
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:34,300
 but this time to show the reflection of them in mission,

255
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:38,140
 how they affect the purpose of God's people.

256
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,100
 And I want to speak about four.

257
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,300
 Blessing, in a slightly different way from the first.

258
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:47,880
 Blessing, priesthood, witness, and servanthood.

259
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,880
 So here is the Old Testament Christian mission,

260
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,760
 and the first thing we want to think about

261
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,580
 is missional blessing.

262
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:57,000
 Now, when did the church begin?

263
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,600
 Well, some people say the church began

264
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,080
 on the day of Pentecost.

265
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,600
 I hope that at least after my first lecture,

266
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,200
 you'll realize that the church didn't begin

267
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,160
 on the day of Pentecost,

268
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,240
 but began right back with Abraham,

269
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,960
 when God called the people into existence.

270
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,900
 But just as the church didn't begin

271
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,660
 on the day of Pentecost,

272
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:18,820
 Christian mission didn't begin on the Mount of Ascension

273
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,580
 only at the end of Matthew's Gospel.

274
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,740
 The mission of God's people began

275
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:28,380
 when God announced his intention through Abraham

276
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,900
 to bless not only him and his people,

277
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,460
 but all the nations on earth through him.

278
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,820
 That's God's mission.

279
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,300
 That's really where we trace it back to.

280
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,900
 Let me remind you of those verses,

281
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,720
 Genesis chapter 12, verses one to three.

282
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,540
 Very quickly read them.

283
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,380
 The Lord said to Abraham,

284
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,260
 "Go from your country, your people,

285
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,440
 "and your father's household

286
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,260
 "to the land that I will show you.

287
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,240
 "I will make you into a great nation,

288
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,860
 "and I will bless you.

289
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,920
 "I will make your name great and be a blessing."

290
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,840
 Or you will be a blessing.

291
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,440
 "I will bless those who curse you,

292
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,400
 "and whoever, who bless you."

293
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,240
 And, sorry.

294
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,240
 "I will bless those who bless you,

295
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,600
 "and whoever curses you, I will curse."

296
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,200
 And, bottom line, "All peoples on earth

297
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,720
 "will be blessed through you."

298
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,200
 Now, it's not hard to hear what the key word

299
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,120
 in those verses are.

300
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,580
 It's the word bless and blessing,

301
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:21,920
 which shines through about five times in three verses.

302
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,360
 And this is very good news,

303
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,920
 because this is Genesis 12,

304
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,880
 which comes after Genesis 11.

305
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,440
 You need to know these things.

306
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,200
 You don't get a PhD for nothing.

307
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,520
 But it's not just the arithmetic,

308
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,800
 because as I was saying this morning,

309
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,020
 Genesis 11 is the sort of climax

310
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:42,380
 of the story of human fallenness and sin and rebellion

311
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,640
 coming to its climax in the Tower of Babel

312
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,560
 and the scattering of the nations.

313
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,480
 Genesis 12 suddenly is good news all over again,

314
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,220
 that God is going to bring blessing into the world.

315
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,360
 So it's no wonder, therefore,

316
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,040
 the Apostle Paul quotes this text

317
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,520
 as what he calls, in Galatians 3, verses eight and nine,

318
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,560
 the gospel in advance.

319
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,560
 That's what he said,

320
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,280
 that the scriptures preach the gospel in advance.

321
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,480
 So Abraham saying, "Through you,

322
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,160
 "all nations will be blessed."

323
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,120
 The Greek literally is he pre-evangelized Abraham.

324
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,920
 Here's God's great surprise, good news,

325
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,560
 that in spite of all that has happened

326
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,560
 in Champlains 4, 3 to 11,

327
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,560
 God still intends to bless the nations of the earth.

328
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,240
 And he would launch this mission

329
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,240
 through Abraham and his people.

330
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,000
 So therefore, as we were thinking earlier,

331
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 there is a universal purpose

332
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,640
 to the existence of particular Israel.

333
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,440
 Israel as a nation exists for the sake

334
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,480
 of God's ultimate purpose for the whole of humanity.

335
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:47,240
 And this fundamentally missional intention

336
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,920
 of the election of Israel

337
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,920
 echoes on and on through the Old Testament.

338
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,680
 Now, you kindly referred to my book, "The Mission of God,"

339
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,560
 and there's a whole chapter on this in there,

340
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,880
 looking at these texts.

341
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:01,320
 But let me just read you two or three of them very quickly.

342
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,960
 Psalm 22, verse 27, "All the ends of the earth

343
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,640
 "will remember and turn to the Lord,

344
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,000
 "and all the families of the nations

345
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,160
 "will bow down before him."

346
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,200
 Isn't that an echo of Abraham?

347
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,520
 Psalm 47, verse nine, "The nobles of the nations

348
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,760
 "assemble as the people of the God of Abraham,

349
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,200
 "for the kings of the earth belong to God,

350
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,640
 "and he is greatly exalted."

351
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,080
 Psalm 47.

352
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:30,280
 Psalm 86, verse nine, "All the nations you have made

353
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,280
 "will come and worship before you, Lord,

354
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,840
 "and bring glory to your name."

355
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,520
 I sometimes wonder what was going through the mind

356
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,280
 of an Israelite when they sang those words,

357
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,720
 even just thinking of the nations

358
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,360
 that they knew about in their world.

359
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,000
 Mind you, sometimes I wonder what's going through

360
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,760
 the mind of Christians when they sing our hymns

361
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,680
 and songs as well, so it's not surprising.

362
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,920
 But there it is, in the text.

363
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,360
 "All the nations that God has made

364
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,320
 "will ultimately worship him.

365
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:59,800
 "And turn to me and be saved, all you ends of the earth,

366
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,160
 "for I am God and there is no other,"

367
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,820
 says Isaiah 45, verse 22.

368
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,520
 "Many nations will be joined with the Lord in that day

369
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,440
 "and will become my people,"

370
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,440
 Zechariah two, verse nine, and so on.

371
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,120
 Many, many more, those are just a sampling.

372
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,920
 So when we turn to the New Testament then,

373
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,720
 it's fascinating, isn't it, that the very first verse

374
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,240
 of Matthew's gospel traces the ancestry of Jesus

375
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,240
 not just back to David, Israel's messianic king in prophecy,

376
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,920
 but to Abraham.

377
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,840
 So Matthew begins with Abraham in the first verse

378
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,840
 and ends with a strongly Abrahamic word of Jesus

379
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,920
 in the Great Commission where he tells his disciples

380
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,820
 to go and make disciples of all nations,

381
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,400
 rather like Paul, who speaks about the obedience of faith

382
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,780
 among all nations, it's very Abrahamic.

383
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:54,600
 Here's how a New Testament scholar, Richard Baucom,

384
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,600
 a very fine New Testament scholar, puts it,

385
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,300
 and I quote, he says, "Matthew frames the whole story

386
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,680
 "of Jesus between the identification of him

387
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,600
 "as a descendant of Abraham,"

388
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,620
 in the opening verse of the gospel,

389
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:12,360
 "and in the closing words of Jesus at the end of the gospel

390
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,880
 "with the commission to the disciples

391
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,060
 "to make disciples of all nations.

392
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:20,300
 "For Matthew, Jesus is the Messiah not only for Jews,

393
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,600
 "but also for Gentiles.

394
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,620
 "He is the descendant of Abraham,

395
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:27,200
 "through whom God's blessing will at least

396
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,280
 "at last reach the nations."

397
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,600
 So mission to the nations, as we would put it,

398
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,960
 evangelization of the world and all of that,

399
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,900
 is not some kind of afterthought that occurred to Jesus

400
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,600
 on the Mount of Ascension when he suddenly thought,

401
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,380
 hey, I'm going off back up to heaven,

402
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,520
 what are these guys gonna do with the rest of their life?

403
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,840
 Hey, why don't you go be missionaries?

404
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,120
 That was a good idea.

405
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,660
 A sort of afterthought at the end of the gospels.

406
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:53,040
 No, it's the climax, it's the point,

407
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,720
 it's what the gospel is all about.

408
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,960
 That what God had now accomplished through the death

409
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,280
 and resurrection of Jesus Christ

410
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,520
 must now become the source of blessing to all nations

411
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,500
 so that God could keep his promise to Abraham.

412
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,700
 So in other words, therefore,

413
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,860
 there's this theological affirmation

414
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,200
 that if we are in Christ,

415
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,280
 then not only, as Paul says in Galatians,

416
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,040
 are we the seed of Abraham,

417
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,180
 we share the blessing of Abraham,

418
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:24,000
 we are also commissioned to spread the blessing of Abraham.

419
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,420
 Indeed, I would argue that there is something

420
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:31,460
 great commission-ish, that's a word,

421
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:34,980
 about the Genesis 12, one to three.

422
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,740
 I'm not suggesting that it's sort of exactly the same,

423
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:41,600
 but the language certainly bears that sort of flavor.

424
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,220
 It starts with command, go.

425
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,260
 It also says be a blessing.

426
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:50,300
 That middle line is actually an imperative,

427
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:53,180
 not just you will be a blessing, but be a blessing.

428
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,740
 And then it ends with all nations

429
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,580
 will be blessed through you.

430
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:01,580
 So here is a kind of a dynamic impulse

431
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,820
 in which Abraham has launched into the world

432
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,060
 in order to become, as it were,

433
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:08,660
 the launch pad of God bringing blessing into the world.

434
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:12,420
 So the people whom God creates in Abraham

435
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:15,460
 are not only a people for God, belonging to God,

436
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,780
 as we were thinking earlier,

437
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,460
 but also a people for the world.

438
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:23,780
 Our identity is also our mission.

439
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:26,780
 In other words, Genesis 12, verses one to three,

440
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:30,380
 is both ecclesiological, it's the beginnings,

441
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,080
 as it were, of the people of God,

442
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,300
 it's also missiological, because it describes

443
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,500
 the very purpose through which they exist.

444
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:42,340
 And this Abrahamic dimension of Christian mission

445
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:46,180
 impacts not just that Gentile mission

446
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,580
 in the book of Acts, where Paul sees

447
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,580
 the moving out to the Gentiles

448
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,860
 as God keeping his promise to Abraham,

449
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,460
 but I would say would be the kind of mantra

450
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,740
 that one could put over all the following centuries

451
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,460
 of Christian mission ever since.

452
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:05,100
 You could argue that Christian mission, at its simplest,

453
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:09,500
 is simply a matter of God keeping his promise to Abraham,

454
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,220
 which he began to do, of course, in the book of Acts,

455
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,460
 and then in the New Testament era,

456
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,100
 so that the gospel went south, down to Africa,

457
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,180
 with the Ethiopian eunuch.

458
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:22,620
 It goes east, according to the church in India,

459
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,740
 with Thomas, who brought the gospel to India,

460
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,180
 and there's certainly documentary evidence

461
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,960
 of Christianity in India from the second century.

462
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,060
 It also, of course, went eastwards to Syria,

463
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,700
 and then northeast, and it was Syrian missionaries

464
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,300
 who were bringing the gospel to China,

465
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,340
 as I'm sure you know, by the sixth to eighth century,

466
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,100
 went west when the apostle Paul

467
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,420
 crossed the Bosphorus into Europe,

468
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:47,380
 and eventually reached the very edges of the world,

469
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,340
 Ireland, where I come from,

470
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,220
 those little islands just off the edge,

471
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,180
 about to drop off the edge of the world,

472
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,460
 and, of course, ever since,

473
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:58,380
 every time the gospel crosses a barrier,

474
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:03,380
 reaches new people, God is keeping his promise to Abraham,

475
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,020
 bringing the blessing of salvation

476
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,780
 to new nation after new nation,

477
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:11,340
 until the day comes that we read about in Revelation,

478
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:14,020
 Revelation 7, verse nine, where John says,

479
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:16,860
 "I saw a great multitude that no one could count

480
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:21,260
 from every tribe, nation, people, and language

481
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:24,860
 standing before the throne of God and the Lamb."

482
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:28,500
 And I have a kind of mental picture of God

483
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,460
 poking Abraham in the ribs and saying,

484
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:33,460
 "There you are, I kept my promise.

485
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:37,420
 All nations I said, all nations it is.

486
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,140
 Mission accomplished."

487
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:42,260
 So that's the first, this missional blessing,

488
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:45,460
 the Abrahamic dimension of Christian mission,

489
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,740
 and there's a lot more about that, of course,

490
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,700
 in my two books.

491
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,220
 That leads us to the second theme that I wanted to bring,

492
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,780
 which is missional priesthood,

493
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:56,340
 moving on from Genesis to Exodus.

494
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,940
 We won't go all the way through the Old Testament,

495
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:00,420
 but at least we do the first two or three books.

496
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:05,180
 God's address to Israel at Mount Sinai

497
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:08,380
 comes after the Exodus, after they get out of Egypt,

498
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,740
 in Exodus chapter 19.

499
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:14,020
 And here again, we pick up one of those identities

500
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,860
 of God's people, we mentioned it,

501
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:18,580
 I mentioned it in passing in the earlier lecture,

502
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,420
 of being God's priesthood.

503
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,820
 But let me read these verses to you,

504
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:24,820
 Exodus chapter 19, verses three to six.

505
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:28,020
 And the first two verses of the chapter

506
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,340
 give us both the date and the location.

507
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,820
 It says this was just three months

508
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,820
 after they had come out of Egypt,

509
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,220
 when they had reached Mount Sinai

510
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,740
 and camped there at the foot of Mount Sinai.

511
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:43,100
 And verse three, "Then Moses went up to God,

512
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,140
 "and the Lord called to him from the mountain,"

513
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,900
 Mount Sinai, "and said, 'This is what you are to say

514
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,440
 "'to the descendants of Jacob,

515
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,840
 "'and what you are to tell the people of Israel.

516
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,440
 "'You yourselves have seen what I did to Egypt,

517
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,520
 "'and how I carried you on eagle's wings

518
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,460
 "'and brought you to myself.

519
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:04,620
 "'Now then, if you will obey me fully and keep my covenant,

520
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,580
 "'then out of all nations,

521
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,640
 "'you will be my treasured possession,

522
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,960
 "'for the whole earth is mine,

523
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,160
 "'and you will be for me a kingdom of priests

524
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,960
 "'and a holy nation.

525
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,780
 "'These are the words you are to speak to the Israelites.'"

526
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:21,100
 End of quote from verse six.

527
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,020
 So the very first thing that God does here

528
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:26,020
 is that he points to his own initiative in verse four.

529
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:30,580
 "You have seen what I have done," says God in verse four.

530
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:33,140
 In other words, this is the priority of God's grace.

531
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:36,580
 As I said also earlier about election,

532
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:39,540
 God redeems his people out of Egypt

533
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:43,940
 and then talks about obeying him and keeping the covenant.

534
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:46,300
 Redemption, salvation comes first,

535
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,940
 God's initiative of grace,

536
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,700
 and then obedience as a response to that

537
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,260
 in the keeping of the law.

538
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:55,260
 And so the motivating power for all that follows,

539
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,580
 including the 10 commandments and the rest of the law,

540
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:00,980
 is always what God has done for them,

541
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,420
 his redemption from slavery.

542
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:05,020
 The Exodus becomes the motivating power.

543
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:07,120
 Why should we keep this law?

544
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,260
 Because God redeemed us out of Egypt.

545
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:13,120
 That's the theme that flows through the rest of the law.

546
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,040
 But then, and one could go on a lot about that point,

547
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,780
 but then the text there in Exodus 19

548
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:22,820
 moves on from that backward-looking motivation,

549
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:27,740
 what God had already done in 18 chapters of salvation,

550
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:31,300
 moves on to a forward-looking motivation.

551
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:36,300
 That is what God planned for Israel to be in the world,

552
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,580
 in the midst of the nations.

553
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:40,860
 Here's my agenda for you, Ezra.

554
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,180
 This is what you will be for me.

555
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,220
 This is a future.

556
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,260
 This is a looking forward.

557
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:50,540
 It is indeed what we might call a missional perspective,

558
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:53,100
 because God's plan for his people

559
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:56,540
 is that they should be a priestly and a holy people

560
00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:00,780
 in the midst of all nations in the whole earth.

561
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:05,020
 Verse five, which, as I hope you will detect by now,

562
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,380
 has a certain Abrahamic ring about it.

563
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,220
 God had said to Abraham,

564
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:11,940
 "I'm going to bless all nations in the earth through you."

565
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:14,300
 And here is Yahweh God, as it were,

566
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,180
 at the top of Mount Sinai,

567
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,860
 saying to the people of Israel, so to speak,

568
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,780
 "From up here," as it were, "in the top,

569
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:23,240
 "I can see the whole earth, and it's all mine,

570
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,600
 "and all the nations of the earth belong to me."

571
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,860
 But you will have a particular purpose,

572
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:32,020
 a particular identity and agenda in that world,

573
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:34,080
 to be a priestly and a holy people.

574
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:38,580
 Now, that identity of being priestly and holy

575
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,380
 is something which echoes on

576
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,980
 through other parts of the Old Testament,

577
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:45,820
 and indeed is inherited by us, as Peter says,

578
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:49,240
 and will still be there in the book of Revelation.

579
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,940
 But we need to ask, what does it mean for Israel

580
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:56,940
 to be God's priesthood in relation to the nations?

581
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,520
 And in order to understand that,

582
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:02,740
 we need to ask, well, what were Israel's priests for them?

583
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:05,020
 How did the priests function?

584
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,660
 And here's one way that I sometimes

585
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,860
 try to illustrate that for you.

586
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:11,620
 Priests basically were middlemen.

587
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:14,620
 They stood in between God on the one hand

588
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:17,220
 and all the rest of the people on the other.

589
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:20,900
 Sometimes we use the word mediator, or in the middle.

590
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,900
 And in that mediating position between God

591
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:28,840
 and the rest of the Israelites, they had two main jobs.

592
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,800
 One which we don't often think about

593
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,460
 was that they were to be teachers,

594
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:35,000
 teachers of God's law to the people.

595
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 That's actually what is said about them

596
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,720
 right at the very ordination of Aaron and his sons.

597
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,860
 The Lord says to Aaron, this is in Leviticus chapter 10,

598
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,680
 he says, "They must distinguish

599
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,960
 "between the holy and the common,

600
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,220
 "the unclean and the clean,

601
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:52,020
 "so that you can teach the Israelites

602
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:55,200
 "all the decrees that the Lord has given them through Moses."

603
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,800
 The priests were to be teachers

604
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,620
 so that the people would come to know the ways of God.

605
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:02,340
 That's also there in the blessing of Moses

606
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:06,780
 on the tribe of Levi in Deuteronomy chapter 33,

607
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:10,560
 where it says about Levi, which was the Levites tribe

608
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,040
 that the priests came from,

609
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:16,200
 he teaches your precepts to Jacob and your law to Israel,

610
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,600
 and he offers incense before you

611
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,440
 and whole burnt offerings on your altar.

612
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,660
 So the teaching function actually comes first,

613
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:26,040
 that through the priests,

614
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,060
 God would become known to the people,

615
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:33,840
 which is why when the people went so badly wrong

616
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,860
 in later life of Israel,

617
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,560
 who did the prophets blame?

618
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,800
 The priests.

619
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,520
 That's what Hosea says very clearly.

620
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,360
 He says, "The land,

621
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,600
 "there's no knowledge of God in the land.

622
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,520
 "The land is full of idolatry and stealing and robbery

623
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,320
 "and murder and adultery."

624
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,760
 And then he says, "Who is my quarrel with?

625
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,200
 "Who am I accusing?"

626
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,680
 He says, "It is you, O priest,"

627
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,760
 because the priests were failing to teach the people.

628
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,360
 So that's the first task.

629
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,640
 Through the priests, God would become known to the people.

630
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,520
 And then the other direction, of course,

631
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,360
 that we're perhaps more familiar with

632
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,760
 is that it was the job of the priests

633
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,680
 to bring the sacrifices of the people to God,

634
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:14,840
 which you read in the first seven chapters of Leviticus.

635
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,720
 So you know this, of course,

636
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,600
 that if you're an Israelite

637
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,160
 and for some reason,

638
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,880
 whether some sin or some uncleanness,

639
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,480
 that you were unable to come into

640
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,400
 the worshiping community of God,

641
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,800
 the temple and so on,

642
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,680
 what would you do?

643
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,240
 Well, you would bring an animal to the sanctuary

644
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,240
 as prescribed in the law.

645
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,100
 You would lay your hand on its head.

646
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,460
 The priest would be then slaughtered

647
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,160
 and the blood of the sacrifice

648
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,000
 would be thrown against the altar representing God.

649
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,880
 And the priest would declare to you

650
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,360
 that your sin is atoned for,

651
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,920
 covered or possibly cleansed.

652
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,920
 The word atone has two possible meanings.

653
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,900
 And so with the sin dealt with through the sacrifice,

654
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,580
 you could then come back

655
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:03,000
 into covenant fellowship with God.

656
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,760
 And if you offered a fellowship offering,

657
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,760
 as it was called,

658
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,120
 then you're gonna have a barbecue as well

659
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:11,260
 and enjoy a good family meal with the meat.

660
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:13,120
 That was what it signified,

661
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,280
 was that you and I back in fellowship

662
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,980
 with God and his people.

663
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,000
 So you can see then that the job of the priest

664
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:19,880
 was twofold.

665
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,000
 It was bringing God to the people

666
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,680
 and bringing the people to God.

667
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,360
 That was their role within Israel.

668
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:30,560
 So it's very significant, isn't it?

669
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,760
 That God says to the Israelites as a whole people,

670
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,200
 as a community for him,

671
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,000
 he said, "You will be for me

672
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,100
 "to the rest of the nations

673
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,820
 "what your priests are for you.

674
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:45,300
 "Through you, my people Israel,

675
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:48,000
 "I will make myself known to the world.

676
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,840
 "And through you, ultimately,

677
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,960
 "I will draw the world to myself."

678
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,320
 That's what it meant for Israel

679
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,480
 to be God's priesthood in the midst of the nations.

680
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,720
 At least that's part of the meaning.

681
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,280
 There are other ways of thinking of it as well.

682
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:05,000
 So as the people of Yahweh, God in the Old Testament,

683
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,280
 they would have this task

684
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,440
 of bringing the knowledge of God to the nations,

685
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,440
 which they've done,

686
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,400
 because we've got this book,

687
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,520
 three quarters of which are the scriptures of Israel

688
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,640
 through whom we know the living God.

689
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,600
 So God has made himself known as it were

690
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,040
 through the priesthood of Israel,

691
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:24,120
 simply being the people that brought us the scriptures.

692
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,080
 And of course, we know that ultimately

693
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,200
 it was through Israel, the Messiah of Israel,

694
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,280
 the Lord Jesus Christ himself,

695
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:34,080
 that God has drawn the nations to himself, as Jesus put it.

696
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,760
 That I, if I be lifted up, will draw all men to myself.

697
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,760
 In his revelation of God

698
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,840
 and in his atonement, atoning work at the cross,

699
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:46,480
 God through the Messiah Jesus has made himself known

700
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,080
 and has brought the world to himself.

701
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,000
 So that's the priestly task of this people.

702
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,480
 And even in exile,

703
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,300
 even when they were thrown out of their land

704
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,680
 under God's judgment,

705
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,120
 Jeremiah writes them a letter,

706
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,400
 do you remember, in Jeremiah chapter 29,

707
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,020
 and says that even in the midst of that calamity,

708
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:07,320
 they were instructed to be a blessing

709
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,920
 to the nation where they were.

710
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:11,120
 That is not the precise words he uses,

711
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,720
 but it by implication,

712
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,440
 where Jeremiah says in chapter 29, verse seven,

713
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,000
 "Seek the shalom of the city

714
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,800
 "to which I've carried you into exile,

715
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,500
 "Babylon, their enemies.

716
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,180
 "Pray to the Lord for it,

717
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:27,000
 "because in its shalom is your shalom."

718
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,120
 In other words, you can be a blessing

719
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,140
 even to the people who are your enemies

720
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,420
 in the midst of the nations.

721
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:34,720
 So that's what I mean by saying

722
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,520
 that it does seem to me that the priesthood of God's people

723
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,160
 is a missional function,

724
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:44,240
 which stands in continuity with the Abrahamic election

725
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,300
 for the sake of the nations.

726
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:49,520
 So the mission of God's people

727
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,400
 then includes being this priesthood in and for the world,

728
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,240
 and that fits exactly with the way,

729
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,660
 one way in which the New Testament speaks

730
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,980
 about our mission in the New Testament.

731
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:05,980
 Certainly it's how the apostle Paul saw his task.

732
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:09,200
 Here I'm quoting from Romans chapter 15.

733
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,480
 Where Paul reminds the Romans, he says,

734
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,740
 "I want to remind you of the grace that God gave to me

735
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:18,720
 "to be a minister of the Messiah, Christ Jesus,

736
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,240
 "to the Gentiles, to the nations."

737
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,200
 So he's a minister of the Messiah to the nations.

738
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,040
 "He gave me the priestly duty

739
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,400
 "of proclaiming the gospel of God

740
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,600
 "so that the Gentiles, the nations,

741
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,980
 "might become an offering acceptable to God,

742
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:35,400
 "sanctified by the Holy Spirit."

743
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,080
 It's a fascinating verse.

744
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,520
 In fact, it's the only verse in the New Testament

745
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:42,840
 where anybody speaks about their personal work

746
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,260
 in priestly terms.

747
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,560
 The pastors in the church,

748
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,600
 they're called pastors or elders or shepherds,

749
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,000
 but not specifically priests.

750
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,700
 But Paul says he had a priestly job to do.

751
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:57,620
 Now, Paul could never have functioned as a priest

752
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,000
 in Jerusalem, in the temple,

753
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,120
 because he was the wrong tribe, wasn't he?

754
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,720
 Saul of Tarsus was of the tribe of Benjamin, not of Levi.

755
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,600
 But he says, "Yes, but I had a priestly job."

756
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,360
 Not in some ordained function, as it were,

757
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,280
 within the church,

758
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:16,280
 but precisely in his evangelistic work among the nations.

759
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:19,480
 He says, "Through my role, my lifetime's work

760
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,540
 "was to bring God to the nations

761
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,940
 "in order to bring the nations to God."

762
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,320
 That's a priestly function.

763
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,080
 I don't know whether he had this verse

764
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,800
 from Exodus in mind when he wrote that

765
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,880
 or whether it was just, as it were,

766
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:33,360
 part of the furniture and assumptions of his mind,

767
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,480
 that his evangelism was effectively priestly work,

768
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:40,120
 bringing the knowledge of God, the gospel, to the nations

769
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,800
 so that the nations could come to God.

770
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,440
 And we might think, "Wow, that's all very well.

771
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,000
 "That was the apostle Paul.

772
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,220
 "He was an apostle.

773
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,560
 "He was a missionary.

774
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,600
 "I'm just an ordinary Christian."

775
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,120
 Well, we don't get off quite so easily

776
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,560
 because, as the text says on the screen,

777
00:33:55,560 --> 00:34:00,320
 the apostle Peter applies precisely this very same verse,

778
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,920
 Exodus 19, verse six, to all believers,

779
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,520
 writing almost certainly to a mixture

780
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,480
 of both Jewish and Gentile believers

781
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,680
 who were scattered across the various provinces

782
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:15,440
 of Asia Minor where the churches were in his day.

783
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:20,440
 And you notice how in 1 Peter 2, verses nine to 12,

784
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:23,480
 Peter combines a number of Old Testament references,

785
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,040
 including Exodus 19, verse six,

786
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:30,920
 and insists that this is how we, we Christian believers,

787
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,800
 are to live among the nations.

788
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,520
 They're fairly familiar verses, but I'll read them anyway.

789
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,300
 Peter says, "You," plural, "You are a chosen people,

790
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:43,240
 "a royal priesthood, a holy nation," is Exodus 19,

791
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:46,100
 "God's special possession, that you may declare

792
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:49,340
 "the praises of him who called you out of darkness

793
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,100
 "into his wonderful light."

794
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:54,680
 There's the Exodus imagery again, "out of, into."

795
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:58,080
 "Once you were not a people, now you are the people of God."

796
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:58,920
 That's Hosea.

797
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,560
 "Once you had not received mercy,

798
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,560
 "but now you have received mercy."

799
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,060
 So therefore, dear friends, on the basis of that,

800
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:08,440
 unfortunately, many of our English Bibles

801
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,960
 put a paragraph division in there with another heading,

802
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,640
 which is a shame because it spoils

803
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,080
 the flow of Peter's thought.

804
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,880
 He says, "This is who you are,

805
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,400
 "this is what you've experienced,

806
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,100
 "therefore I urge you as foreigners in exiles

807
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,920
 "to abstain from sinful desires

808
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,680
 "which war against your soul,

809
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:28,120
 "and to live such good lives among the nations."

810
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,960
 And again, our English Bibles sometimes say,

811
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,240
 "Among the pagans, or the heathen," or something,

812
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,840
 but it is among entwise ethnicities, among the nations.

813
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,860
 It's Genesis language.

814
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:40,460
 "So that even though they accuse you of doing wrong,

815
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:43,780
 "they may see your good deeds and glorify God

816
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,240
 "on the day he visits us."

817
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:48,680
 Where Peter is echoing the Lord Jesus Christ himself.

818
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:52,680
 "You," says Peter, "you are that priesthood."

819
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:56,800
 You, we, we are meant to be God's representatives

820
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,080
 among the nations, to be the living proof

821
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:03,640
 of the living God, to bring God to people

822
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,400
 and to bring people to God.

823
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,480
 That's our priestly mission.

824
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,800
 And how do we do that?

825
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,280
 Well, of course, we can only do that

826
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,420
 by the second phrase that Moses used,

827
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,740
 that is, not only by being a priestly kingdom,

828
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,900
 but by being a holy people.

829
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:20,120
 And that's what we will think of tomorrow,

830
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,460
 if you can come back for lecture number three,

831
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:25,080
 when we ask about how then should we live,

832
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:29,000
 what are the ethical standards of being a holy people?

833
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,320
 So that's therefore missional blessing

834
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,560
 and missional priesthood.

835
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,320
 I think there are just two other ones

836
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,760
 that I want to put before us,

837
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,380
 and that is witnesses and servants.

838
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:43,840
 They occur actually together in one verse.

839
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:47,160
 In Isaiah chapter 43, verses nine to 11,

840
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,000
 this is what we read.

841
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,080
 God says to the Israelites,

842
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:53,680
 says, "You are my witnesses, declares the Lord,

843
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:57,100
 "and my servant whom I have chosen."

844
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:00,100
 And I just want us to think about each of those two words.

845
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:05,580
 Now, the context of those verses there in Isaiah chapter 49

846
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:10,260
 are, of course, that Israel had been in exile in Babylon,

847
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:13,380
 and many of them had completely lost hope

848
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,900
 for any future for themselves

849
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,940
 or indeed for the purposes of God.

850
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:22,100
 You know from Ezekiel, for example, chapter 37,

851
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,320
 that the Israelites in exile thought of themselves

852
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,100
 as dead bones in the grave.

853
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,220
 We might as well be finished.

854
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:29,360
 There's no more future for us.

855
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:32,520
 But God's word through these chapters of Isaiah

856
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:37,440
 repeatedly reassures them that God's purposes go on,

857
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,120
 and that God still has a place within them,

858
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:46,120
 and that their mission was to bear witness to Yahweh,

859
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,500
 the God of Israel, as being the only true and living God,

860
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,380
 that they were God's servant

861
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,940
 in order to bear witness to the living God.

862
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:58,080
 So missional witness.

863
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,260
 You see, as again, you probably know

864
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:02,260
 if you've done some Old Testament study

865
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:04,960
 and read these chapters of Isaiah,

866
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,480
 that there's a great kind of conflict going on

867
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:10,820
 in these chapters between Yahweh, the God of Israel,

868
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:14,080
 and the other nations and their gods.

869
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,260
 It's like a kind of court case

870
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,020
 that's happening between them.

871
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:21,080
 And in Isaiah chapter 43, verse nine,

872
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,960
 there's a great assembly of the nations pictured.

873
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,340
 It's like a sort of great court.

874
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,500
 Here's Isaiah 43, verse nine.

875
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:33,300
 All the nations gather together and the peoples assemble.

876
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:37,380
 Which of their gods foretold all this

877
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:40,580
 and proclaimed to us the former things?

878
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:42,700
 Now you see, God has been saying earlier

879
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:46,380
 that he was the God who had predicted the exile

880
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,740
 and he was the God who had explained it

881
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,220
 and interpreted it in the past.

882
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:53,740
 So which of their gods did that?

883
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:56,260
 Let them bring in their witnesses

884
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,580
 to prove that they were right

885
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,180
 so that others may hear and say, "Oh yeah, yeah,

886
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,220
 that's right."

887
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:02,580
 So there's this sense in which,

888
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:06,260
 in this assembly of the nations with their gods,

889
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:11,900
 who and how will we decide which God or gods is real?

890
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:14,140
 Which God is right?

891
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:16,140
 Now, Yahweh, the God of Israel,

892
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:19,460
 has made his claim to be the only true God

893
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,660
 in all the way through these earlier chapters

894
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:25,360
 by his ability precisely to predict the future,

895
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,500
 to interpret the past, and to explain the present,

896
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,640
 that he's the sovereign God of all these things.

897
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:34,940
 So the other nations then, the other gods rather,

898
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:38,280
 the other gods are invited to bring in their witnesses

899
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:41,160
 if they can prove that they're any better

900
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,660
 or even anywhere near as good.

901
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:45,740
 Now, who are the witnesses of the other gods?

902
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:49,380
 Well, the other nations, but they don't say anything

903
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,020
 'cause they've got nothing to say

904
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:53,540
 because their gods are weak and powerless

905
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,320
 and less than nothing.

906
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,380
 So then, okay, who's left?

907
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,840
 Yahweh God.

908
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,100
 So who will speak for him

909
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:05,180
 in this international court of nations and gods?

910
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:08,780
 Who will testify to the power, the existence,

911
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:11,440
 the reality of Yahweh as God?

912
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,860
 Who?

913
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:15,060
 God says, verse 10, "You."

914
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:19,020
 "You are my witnesses," declares the Lord.

915
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:21,920
 You Israelites, you are my witnesses

916
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,400
 and my servant whom I have chosen.

917
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,740
 In other words, this is God saying to Israel,

918
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:30,220
 you know, you're in exile, but you're still my witnesses.

919
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,740
 In fact, it's actually very surprising

920
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:35,500
 because God had just described Israel

921
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,420
 in the previous chapter, the Israelites in exile,

922
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:40,500
 as blind and deaf.

923
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:45,400
 And there's not, with all due charity,

924
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,540
 not a lot of point bringing into a courtroom

925
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:51,660
 as a witness someone who couldn't see anything

926
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,480
 and can't hear anything.

927
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,540
 Blind and deaf is sort of precisely

928
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:59,060
 not what you want in a witness.

929
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:01,740
 And the reason, of course, why the Israelites

930
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:04,760
 were blind and deaf, as it says in chapter 42,

931
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,360
 is because they had rejected God's words

932
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,980
 and his warnings in the past

933
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:11,500
 and he had had to drive them into judgment.

934
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,660
 But now, by his restoring grace,

935
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,460
 by the miracle of a new exodus,

936
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:17,260
 which was just around the corner,

937
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,740
 God says, you're going back,

938
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:21,580
 back to your original Abrahamic mission

939
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,020
 in the midst of the nations.

940
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:26,140
 And when I've restored you, you will bear witness

941
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:28,860
 to the saving God of Israel once more.

942
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:32,900
 God's people must be witnesses for their God.

943
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,700
 That is a major missional responsibility.

944
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,400
 You are my witnesses, says God.

945
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:41,220
 Now, the word itself is a significant one.

946
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:46,760
 In Old Testament Israel, just being a witness of anything

947
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,880
 was a very serious responsibility,

948
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,800
 especially in a courtroom or in the gate in the city

949
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,160
 where the cases were discussed.

950
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:58,000
 In fact, there are a number of significant laws

951
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,240
 in Old Testament law about the importance

952
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,440
 of being a truthful witness

953
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:06,320
 and how serious it was to be a false witness.

954
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,980
 In fact, one of the Ten Commandments is exactly that.

955
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:11,460
 You shall not bear false witness.

956
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:14,060
 Another thing, of course, is that bribery was hated

957
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:17,760
 because bribery would twist people to tell untruths.

958
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,680
 And indeed, the Old Testament law

959
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:23,260
 had about the most severe perjury law

960
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:25,060
 anywhere in the world, even today.

961
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:29,740
 If you gave false witness in court

962
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:32,280
 and it could then be proved that you had,

963
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:36,360
 then you would be punished with whatever punishment

964
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:39,460
 the person that you were falsely accusing would have got

965
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:41,500
 if your witness had been believed,

966
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,280
 even up to the death penalty.

967
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:47,260
 So if you mistakenly accused somebody of something

968
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:49,820
 for which they could be executed

969
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:53,100
 and you were shown to have told the untruth,

970
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,100
 you would be executed.

971
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:55,340
 Now, that's pretty severe.

972
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:57,340
 It's a very deterrent law.

973
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:59,800
 It shows how seriously God took the importance

974
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:02,940
 of being a true and truthful witness.

975
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:05,580
 The integrity and the truthfulness of witness

976
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:09,060
 was important in Old Testament society.

977
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:12,100
 So here you see God is calling the Israelites

978
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:15,660
 to exercise in the international arena

979
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:19,560
 of nations and gods a responsibility

980
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:23,580
 that was deeply rooted in their own social culture,

981
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:26,040
 the task of bearing witness.

982
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:29,500
 Now, what would it be that the Israelites

983
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,340
 were to bear witness to?

984
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:34,460
 Well, these verses that we are just starting on,

985
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:35,420
 spell it out.

986
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:38,540
 Let me now read to you what they were to bear witness to.

987
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:42,420
 This is Isaiah chapter 43, verses nine to 13.

988
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:44,180
 "You are my witnesses, declared the Lord,

989
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:45,980
 "and my servant whom I have chosen,

990
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:47,860
 "so that you may know and believe me

991
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:52,860
 "and understand that I am he, I am God alone.

992
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:57,860
 "Before me no god was formed, nor will there be one after me."

993
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:00,060
 I'm not a temporary god, in other words,

994
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:01,940
 alpha and omega kind of thing.

995
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:05,300
 "I, even I, am the Lord, and apart from me

996
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:07,800
 "there is no savior.

997
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:11,300
 "I have revealed and saved and proclaimed.

998
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:14,420
 "I am not some foreign god among you.

999
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:17,300
 "So you are my witnesses, declares the Lord,

1000
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:19,820
 "that I am God."

1001
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:21,140
 It's a wonderful language.

1002
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:25,080
 Israel then is being called to bear witness

1003
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:29,140
 to several great foundational truths

1004
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:31,160
 about Yahweh, the God of Israel,

1005
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,940
 all of which we will see in a moment

1006
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:36,580
 apply to Jesus Christ when you get to the New Testament,

1007
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:38,340
 and therefore help us to understand

1008
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:42,500
 what it means for us to be witnesses to Jesus.

1009
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:44,500
 The three things that are clear in this text are,

1010
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,660
 first of all, Israel was to bear witness

1011
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:50,500
 that Yahweh alone is the transcendent, eternal God.

1012
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,700
 I am he, I am God.

1013
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:53,940
 There's no other God.

1014
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:57,960
 He is the transcendent, eternal, living God.

1015
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,980
 There's none before, none to come after.

1016
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:02,480
 That's Old Testament monotheism.

1017
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,160
 It's not just saying there's only one God.

1018
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,120
 It doesn't really matter which God you have,

1019
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,020
 as long as you've only got one.

1020
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:10,600
 No, this is saying not only is there only one God,

1021
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,320
 this is who he is.

1022
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,280
 It's the identity of the living God.

1023
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,200
 Secondly, that Yahweh alone

1024
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,480
 is in sovereign control of history.

1025
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,520
 I have revealed and saved and proclaimed.

1026
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:25,880
 This, again, is recollecting the story of the Exodus,

1027
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:29,340
 that God revealed it, this is what he's gonna do,

1028
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:32,080
 then he did it, then he interpreted it,

1029
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:34,920
 then he explained it, and teaches his people.

1030
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:38,900
 And only the God who is in control of events

1031
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:40,620
 can do all of those things,

1032
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:42,120
 can say this is what's gonna happen,

1033
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:44,360
 that's what just happened, this is why it happened.

1034
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:45,920
 God interprets, explains.

1035
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:50,200
 It's the author of the story who controls the story.

1036
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,680
 God is sovereign in history.

1037
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:55,920
 And that Yahweh alone is not only God and sovereign,

1038
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,600
 but also savior.

1039
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,360
 The I alone and the God who say

1040
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:02,520
 there is no other savior than the living God.

1041
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,200
 That, indeed, is his name.

1042
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:07,120
 He is the God, then, whose righteousness

1043
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:09,920
 had sent the Israelites into exile,

1044
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,160
 and it's the same God whose righteousness

1045
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,700
 will deliver them from exile.

1046
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:17,320
 There is no other saving God,

1047
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:19,840
 because there is no other God, period.

1048
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:25,560
 You, said God to the Israelites,

1049
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:28,440
 you are my witnesses that I am God.

1050
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:33,840
 You, said Jesus twice to his disciples,

1051
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:36,740
 the risen Jesus to his disciples,

1052
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:39,320
 you will be my witnesses.

1053
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:43,660
 Luke makes that phrase by Jesus

1054
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:48,160
 a kind of verbal Velcro between the end of his gospel

1055
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,740
 and the beginning of Acts.

1056
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:53,540
 It's there in Luke chapter 24, in the day of resurrection,

1057
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:56,660
 where Jesus says, you know what the scriptures have said.

1058
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:57,500
 This is what is written.

1059
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:00,700
 Messiah will come and suffer and rise again on the third day

1060
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:02,940
 that repentance and forgiveness of sins

1061
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:04,880
 will be preached in his name to all the nations,

1062
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,800
 and you are witnesses of these things.

1063
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,500
 And then also in Acts chapter one, verse eight,

1064
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,280
 on the day of his ascension,

1065
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:14,640
 where Jesus says to the disciples before he left,

1066
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,120
 you will be my witnesses,

1067
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:20,040
 Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.

1068
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,640
 And I have no doubt in my mind anyway,

1069
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:27,020
 that Jesus was consciously echoing this text from Isaiah 43,

1070
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:29,200
 that just as Yahweh, God of Israel,

1071
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,440
 had said to the Israelites,

1072
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:33,000
 you are my witnesses in the world of the nations,

1073
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,780
 so Jesus, the risen Christ, now calls his disciples

1074
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:38,280
 to do the same task,

1075
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:43,100
 to bear witness to the living God among the nations.

1076
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:46,700
 Because after all, what greater truth could there be

1077
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:51,280
 in the universe than the identity of Jesus of Nazareth

1078
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,940
 as the living God who has come and lived among us?

1079
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:58,240
 The sovereignty of Jesus as Lord,

1080
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:01,000
 he is the Lord Jesus Christ,

1081
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,840
 not kurios kaisar, Caesar is Lord, but Jesus is Lord,

1082
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,000
 they went out into the world to say.

1083
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,240
 And that he is the one and only savior,

1084
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:12,860
 that there is no other name given among men under heaven

1085
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:16,500
 by which we must be saved than the name of Jesus himself.

1086
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:20,740
 So he alone is God and Lord and savior,

1087
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:23,440
 and we are his witnesses.

1088
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:28,280
 That's why it seems to me on the Mount of Ascension

1089
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:31,440
 that Jesus says these amazing words

1090
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,800
 that Matthew records in Matthew 28.

1091
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:37,600
 He almost, in his way, Matthew tells us

1092
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,760
 that when they came to Jesus at the Mount of Ascension,

1093
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,480
 they worshipped him, though some doubted.

1094
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,040
 He's very honest about that.

1095
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,660
 Not everybody was convinced.

1096
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:48,180
 But for those who worshipped Jesus, this is Jesus,

1097
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:50,760
 this is Jesus of Nazareth, the carpenter's son,

1098
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:53,200
 the man they'd walked around with for three years.

1099
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,160
 And these were Jews who knew that they must not worship

1100
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,420
 anybody or anything but the living God.

1101
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:03,140
 But before the risen crucified Jesus, they worshipped him.

1102
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:06,920
 And Jesus accepts it, and he assumes the Yahweh position

1103
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:09,680
 and claims all authority in heaven and on earth

1104
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,720
 has been given to me.

1105
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:14,080
 And those men and women who were there

1106
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:15,760
 would almost certainly have heard the echo

1107
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,520
 of Deuteronomy again,

1108
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,320
 acknowledge and take to heart this day

1109
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,280
 that the Lord is God in heaven above

1110
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:22,400
 and on the earth below.

1111
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,200
 There is no other, Deuteronomy 4, verse 39.

1112
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,280
 It's as if Jesus is saying to his disciples,

1113
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:30,960
 look, guys, now you know who I am,

1114
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:35,080
 that this God you worshipped all your lives,

1115
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:38,360
 Yahweh God, the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel,

1116
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:39,800
 has been walking among you

1117
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:42,840
 in the flesh of Jesus of Nazareth.

1118
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:45,640
 And also that Jesus has accomplished

1119
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:47,520
 all that Yahweh, the God of Israel,

1120
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,320
 said he would accomplish

1121
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,200
 to bring about the salvation of the world.

1122
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:54,120
 So you know that I am he,

1123
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:57,560
 and therefore you are my witnesses of these things,

1124
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:01,920
 of my life, my teaching, my death, my resurrection.

1125
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:05,860
 So how then will the nations come to know

1126
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:08,520
 what God has done through the Lord Jesus Christ?

1127
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:12,480
 How will the nations come to that Abrahamic blessing

1128
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,280
 of the saving knowledge of these truths

1129
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,920
 about the living God?

1130
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:19,520
 You are my witnesses, says Jesus.

1131
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,920
 You now stand in the place of Israel,

1132
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:26,040
 bearing witness to the living God

1133
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,200
 and his son, the Lord Jesus Christ,

1134
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,480
 and all he has accomplished.

1135
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,400
 And so once again, that seems to me

1136
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:36,000
 that we seem that one of these primary dimensions

1137
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,880
 of what it means to be a Christian,

1138
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,600
 namely that we are called to bear witness

1139
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,160
 to the Lord Jesus Christ,

1140
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:47,820
 is deeply, deeply rooted in the soil of Old Testament Israel

1141
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:51,520
 and the identity and mission that was entrusted to them.

1142
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:54,640
 So blessing and priesthood and witness,

1143
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:59,200
 and last of all, in the same verse, missional servanthood.

1144
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:03,920
 That's the other phrase that's there in Isaiah 43, verse nine,

1145
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:08,220
 you will be my witnesses and my servant whom I've chosen.

1146
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:11,820
 Now that word there in chapter 43

1147
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:15,940
 actually repeats what God had said to the Israelites

1148
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:18,820
 in chapter 41, that's on the screen,

1149
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:22,660
 where God had said to Isaiah chapter 41,

1150
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:27,660
 you Israel, my servant, Jacob whom I've chosen,

1151
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:31,580
 you descendants of Abraham, my friend, lovely word,

1152
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:33,220
 I took you from the ends of the earth,

1153
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:34,940
 from its farthest corners I called you,

1154
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:38,700
 and I said, you are my servant, I have chosen you,

1155
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:40,820
 I've not rejected you, so don't be afraid,

1156
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:42,820
 I'm with you, and so on.

1157
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:44,740
 So back there in Isaiah 41,

1158
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:47,500
 Israel is identified as God's servant.

1159
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:51,940
 But there's a massive problem I referred to earlier for God,

1160
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:53,700
 was that at this precise moment,

1161
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:57,140
 Israel was in exile under God's judgment,

1162
00:51:57,140 --> 00:52:01,580
 a failed, disobedient, blind, deaf servant,

1163
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:04,780
 as God says to them, hear you deaf, look you blind,

1164
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:07,540
 and see who is blind but my servant,

1165
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:09,900
 and deaf like the messenger I send,

1166
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:13,260
 who is blind like the one supposedly in covenant with me,

1167
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:15,380
 blind like the servant of the Lord,

1168
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:18,020
 and he goes on, this is chapter 42,

1169
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:20,860
 who handed over Jacob to become loot,

1170
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:22,780
 and Israel to the plunderers,

1171
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:25,900
 was it not the Lord against whom we have sinned?

1172
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:27,860
 For they would not follow his ways,

1173
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:29,620
 they didn't obey his law,

1174
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:32,500
 so he poured out on them his burning anger,

1175
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:34,820
 and the violence of war, and so on.

1176
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:38,300
 And so here is Israel called to be the servant of God,

1177
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:40,660
 but languishing in exile.

1178
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:45,380
 But, says God, he introduces the servant of the Lord

1179
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:47,660
 in chapter 42, and as again,

1180
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:50,060
 you possibly know if you studied these chapters,

1181
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:53,140
 that theme of this servant of the Lord

1182
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:56,740
 flows through these chapters in a mysterious way,

1183
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:59,620
 as both being in a sense Israel,

1184
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:04,060
 but also being an individual who has a mission to Israel,

1185
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:07,060
 and indeed through Israel for the nations,

1186
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:08,740
 because in chapter 42,

1187
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:11,660
 he's going to bring justice to the nations.

1188
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:15,380
 But, then that becomes not enough,

1189
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:17,380
 because this is chapter 49,

1190
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:19,740
 the Lord says, he who formed me in the womb

1191
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:23,740
 to be his servant, to bring Jacob back to him,

1192
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:26,140
 to gather Israel to himself.

1193
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:30,500
 So, the servant of the Lord has a mission to Israel,

1194
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:33,420
 to bring Israel back to God.

1195
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:36,380
 But, in chapter 49, the servant seems to be struggling,

1196
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:38,580
 because he says, I have labored in vain,

1197
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:40,820
 I spent my strength for nothing at all.

1198
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:43,140
 He has this sense of frustration,

1199
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:45,220
 and it gets worse in chapter 50,

1200
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:48,340
 where the servant experiences rejection, and abuse,

1201
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:50,940
 and people are plucking out his beard and stuff.

1202
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:54,060
 So, it almost seems as if the servant's mission

1203
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:57,420
 is failing in frustration and opposition.

1204
00:53:57,420 --> 00:54:00,020
 And then God answers him in chapter 49

1205
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:01,740
 with a very startling word.

1206
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:05,580
 The Lord says to me, in answer to that,

1207
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:08,300
 it's too small a thing for you to be my servant,

1208
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:10,460
 just to restore the tribes of Jacob,

1209
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:12,780
 and to bring back those of Israel that I've kept.

1210
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:16,180
 I will also make you a light to the Gentiles,

1211
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:18,220
 to the nations, that my salvation

1212
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:19,900
 may reach the ends of the earth.

1213
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:22,620
 I don't know if you've ever had God do that to you.

1214
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:23,700
 You know, you complain to God,

1215
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:25,660
 oh, this is far too hard, I can't do this.

1216
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:26,620
 He goes, oh, really?

1217
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:29,260
 Well, let me give you something harder.

1218
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:32,020
 God sometimes does that, that's what he does to the servant.

1219
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:34,140
 He's going to bring Israel back to God,

1220
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:39,140
 but also bring the salvation of God to the nations.

1221
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:41,820
 So, to sum this up, this servant language then,

1222
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:44,860
 Israel as a people was a servant of God,

1223
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:46,660
 chosen, upheld by him,

1224
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:48,340
 in order to be a light to the nations.

1225
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:52,100
 But, historically, in exile, Israel was failing

1226
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:54,300
 in that role, in that mission.

1227
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:56,660
 Israel as the servant was blind and deaf,

1228
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:57,860
 and under God's judgment.

1229
00:54:57,980 --> 00:55:00,660
 So, this individual servant figure,

1230
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:02,540
 mysteriously in the prophet,

1231
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:06,740
 is at one level distinct from Israel,

1232
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:08,900
 because he has a mission to them,

1233
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:13,420
 and yet, at another level, is somehow identified with Israel.

1234
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:15,820
 Same language is used of both.

1235
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:19,540
 So, that the servant figure will actually fulfill

1236
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:22,620
 the original mission of Israel itself,

1237
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:25,580
 that is, to bring the salvation, the justice,

1238
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:28,140
 the liberation of God to the ends of the earth

1239
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:29,540
 and to all the nations.

1240
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:33,100
 The universal purpose of the election of Israel

1241
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:36,420
 will be accomplished through the servant of Israel.

1242
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:41,220
 Now, when we come to the New Testament,

1243
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:44,180
 there's abundant evidence, which I won't try to go into,

1244
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:48,340
 to suggest that Jesus saw himself in that identity

1245
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:51,700
 as the servant of the Lord in the text of Isaiah.

1246
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:54,660
 For example, when he says, "I came not to be served,

1247
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:58,340
 "but to serve," or "I am among you as the one who serves,"

1248
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:01,340
 and he quotes Isaiah 53, "the Last Supper," and so on.

1249
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:03,020
 Haven't time to go there.

1250
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:07,660
 But that mission of the servant in the Messiah Jesus,

1251
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:11,900
 which he quotes, doesn't end with Jesus himself,

1252
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:14,380
 because what we then discover is that the apostle Paul

1253
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:16,260
 reflected very deeply on these texts

1254
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:19,780
 also in his mission to the nations.

1255
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:23,180
 He saw theologically a link between Jesus

1256
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:27,460
 being the servant who was sent to Israel, on the one hand,

1257
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:30,540
 and the ingathering of the nations with great rejoicing

1258
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:32,580
 to the people of God, on the other hand.

1259
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:34,700
 He saw them linked together.

1260
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:38,020
 That, indeed, is how he brings his letter to the Romans

1261
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:41,060
 to a climax, climax which we sometimes ignore,

1262
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:43,420
 but it's actually very important in chapter 15,

1263
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:47,220
 where Paul has been saying to the Jewish

1264
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:51,460
 and Gentile believers in chapters 14 through to 15.7,

1265
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:54,140
 he's been telling them, Jews and Gentiles in Christ,

1266
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:56,500
 that they must accept one another.

1267
00:56:56,500 --> 00:57:00,220
 So he says, and now quoting from Romans 15, verse seven,

1268
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:03,620
 "Accept one another then, just as Christ, Messiah,

1269
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:07,540
 "accepted you in order to bring praise to God.

1270
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:11,600
 "For," he says, "I tell you, Christ, the Messiah,

1271
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:15,540
 "has become a servant, the servant of the Jews,

1272
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:20,180
 "on behalf of God's truth, so that," there's the purpose,

1273
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:23,220
 "so that the promises made to the patriarchs,"

1274
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:25,660
 i.e. to Abraham, "might be confirmed.

1275
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:29,260
 "Moreover, that the nations might glorify God

1276
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:31,740
 "for his mercy, as it is written,"

1277
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:34,580
 and then he quotes four Old Testament texts.

1278
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:36,700
 "Therefore, I will praise you among the Gentiles

1279
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:38,340
 "and sing praises of your name."

1280
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:40,980
 Again, it says, "Rejoice, you Gentiles, with his people."

1281
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:43,020
 And again, "Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles,

1282
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:44,500
 "that all the peoples extol him."

1283
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:46,740
 And again, Isaiah, "The root of Jesse will spring up

1284
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:48,440
 "and he will rule over the nations,

1285
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:50,500
 "and in him the Gentiles will hope."

1286
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:53,860
 Four texts from the law, the prophets, and the writings,

1287
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:56,940
 all of them speaking about God's ultimate purpose,

1288
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:58,540
 that the nations, the Gentiles,

1289
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:01,280
 will come to rejoice and praise God.

1290
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:03,720
 And Paul says all of that, in a sense,

1291
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:05,660
 is the fulfillment of the fact

1292
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:08,580
 that Jesus became the servant of Israel.

1293
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:12,060
 He was the servant so that the glory of God

1294
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:13,860
 and the praise of God could go to the nations.

1295
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:15,860
 That's how he ends Romans.

1296
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:18,140
 It's the climax he brings it to.

1297
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:20,100
 And of course, Paul could do this

1298
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:22,420
 because this had been part of his calling

1299
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:24,060
 at the very beginning.

1300
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:28,180
 In Acts 26, verse 16, he knew that he had been called

1301
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:30,500
 to be a servant and a witness.

1302
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:33,360
 The very words that Jesus spoke to him echoed that.

1303
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:35,580
 Here's what Jesus said to Saul of Tarsus,

1304
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:37,500
 as he still was on the road to Damascus.

1305
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:39,540
 "Get up, stand on your feet.

1306
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:42,140
 "I have appeared to you to appoint you,"

1307
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:46,560
 Paul, Saul of Tarsus, "as a servant and as a witness

1308
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:49,260
 "of what you have seen and will see of me.

1309
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:50,920
 "I will rescue you from your own people

1310
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:52,140
 "and from the Gentiles.

1311
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:55,460
 "I'm sending you to them," the nation, the Gentiles,

1312
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:58,100
 "to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light

1313
00:58:58,100 --> 00:58:59,920
 "and from the power of Satan to God

1314
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:02,220
 "so that they may receive forgiveness of sins

1315
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:06,220
 "and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me."

1316
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:10,540
 Paul himself was commissioned to be servant and witness.

1317
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:13,980
 And that's why when Paul was in a synagogue

1318
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:17,320
 in Pisidian, Antioch, and he had given

1319
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:19,960
 the whole history of Israel in about seven verses

1320
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:22,200
 to the people there and led it from Abraham

1321
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:24,120
 right up to Jesus and said,

1322
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:26,080
 "This is what has now been fulfilled."

1323
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:29,000
 And some of the Jews believed him and some would not.

1324
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,760
 And the following Sabbath, they came back

1325
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:33,400
 and some of them opposed him.

1326
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:36,800
 And Paul, what he does is that he takes this text

1327
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:39,440
 from Isaiah, which of course he knew

1328
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:43,440
 had been fulfilled by Jesus, and he applies it to himself

1329
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:46,120
 and his little band of missionary friends.

1330
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:49,680
 He moves from Jesus as the true son of David and Messiah

1331
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:53,320
 and his resurrection through to the God-fearing Gentiles

1332
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:54,640
 in the audience.

1333
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:57,200
 This is his words, Acts 13.

1334
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,920
 "We now turn to the Gentiles,

1335
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:04,060
 "for this is what the Lord has commanded us," he says.

1336
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:07,180
 Quote, "I have made you a light for the Gentiles

1337
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:10,800
 "that you may bring my salvation to the ends of the earth."

1338
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:13,460
 That's what God has commanded us, says Paul.

1339
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:16,440
 And we've been doing our exegesis and hermeneutics class.

1340
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:18,320
 We might say, "Oh, just a minute, Paul.

1341
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:21,720
 "Isaiah actually said that about Old Testament Israel."

1342
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:23,200
 Paul said, "Yeah, I know that."

1343
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:26,580
 And Jesus, we understand, Jesus applied the language

1344
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:27,880
 of the servant to himself.

1345
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:29,260
 And Paul said, "Yeah, I know that too.

1346
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:31,940
 "I've just said it," in chapter 15.

1347
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:35,040
 But here, Paul says that this command of the servant

1348
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:38,980
 to Israel through Jesus is now also explicitly

1349
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:41,400
 the command for God's people.

1350
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:44,280
 We are to be that servant people,

1351
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:46,080
 bringing the light of God to the nations.

1352
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:48,820
 It is a missional text for the church,

1353
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:52,280
 as the servant of the Lord bearing witness to him.

1354
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:53,360
 So there we are.

1355
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:56,640
 Once again, I hope what we've seen is that

1356
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:58,920
 in the scriptures of Israel and the Old Testament,

1357
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:02,240
 we find some essential understandings of what it means,

1358
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,520
 not just to be the people of God,

1359
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:07,980
 but for the purpose for which we are the people of God,

1360
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:10,640
 rooted in God's missional purpose for Israel.

1361
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:14,200
 Like them, we are called in partnership with God

1362
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:17,700
 for the nations and to the nations to be a blessing,

1363
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:22,520
 to be a priesthood, to be a witness, and to be God's servant.

1364
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:24,800
 May God help us to do that.

1365
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:26,600
 For his name's sake, amen.

1366
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:30,720
 (audience applauding)

1367
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:33,800
 (gentle piano music)

1368
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:36,880
 (gentle piano music)

1369
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:39,960
 (gentle piano music)

1370
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:42,540
 (gentle music)
