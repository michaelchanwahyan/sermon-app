1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
(音樂)

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
我坐在兩隻巨人的後面

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
非常令人感到害怕

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
你不看起來很害怕

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
我只是在假裝

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
只是在假裝

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
所以,李博士已經非常完美地總結了李博士的講座

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
我想簡單地講一下李博士的講話

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
我認為這三個肋骨

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
我只是在假裝

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
我沒有想到他會這樣說

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
所以我可能會錯誤

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
但是李博士選的這三個肋骨

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
有些許跟劇本有關

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
第一是關於神的形狀

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
第二是關於影響力的神的方向

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
不是說到最後

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
而是回到中心,回到神的圖案

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
最後可能是關於神的權力

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
李博士,關於這三個肋骨

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
你覺得他們好吃嗎?

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
我今天午餐的時候

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
我正在想著

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
我希望中國人會知道

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
有別的方法去切雞肉

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
而不是每一塊雞肉都要切成一塊

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
我想說的是

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
我嘗試說的

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
李博士說的話

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
在很多方面都很合理

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
因為我嘗試說的

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
這整個神話的理論流程

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
從一個開始到一個結局

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
當然不是否認

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
在這個理論的結構

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
有很多的轉變

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
有很多的事情發生

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
這些事實上

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
在某些時候

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
是一個故事的懸殊

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
例如,耶穌進入了死亡,然後再回來

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
還有,在神話和詩中

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
有很多的評論

44
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
這些都是好的

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
但我認為

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
雖然第一部分

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
斯蒂芬的觀點是

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
在古代的神話

49
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
這就是它的看法

50
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
但當你看到

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
這是一個故事

52
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
它在某個地方

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
它其實是帶領著耶穌

54
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
到結局的時候

55
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
我有時候對學生說

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
我們不應該去想

57
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
這個神話的故事

58
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
即使我把它放在

59
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
一個很長的直線

60
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
它只是一個大渠道

61
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
兩個直線在前方

62
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
在中間流動的水

63
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
它就像亞馬遜河一樣

64
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
亞馬遜河的渠道

65
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
那是一個非常複雜的水系統

66
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
水流向後

67
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
向後

68
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
渠道,湖,等等

69
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
但最後一天

70
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
水流都會向同一方向流動

71
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
那就是

72
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
那些水

73
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
在亞馬遜渠道

74
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
會在亞洲海洋中

75
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
這就是命運

76
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
我想說的是

77
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
在古代

78
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
就像亞馬遜河流

79
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
水流都會向著耶穌

80
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
和神的使命流動

81
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
這是我首先想說的

82
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
然後

83
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
我第二點

84
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
我認為和斯蒂夫所說的相符

85
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
當然

86
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
當聖經寫家

87
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
神父

88
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
說者

89
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
聖經寫家

90
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
寫到聖經

91
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
當他們想要看未來

92
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
他們總是回到過去

93
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
他們總是說

94
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
我們有一個神

95
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
已經做了一些很奇妙的事

96
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
但祂還是一樣的神

97
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
所以祂要再做一次

98
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
那最明顯的地方

99
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
在聖經最後一章

100
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
你無法理解聖經

101
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
不說祂一直

102
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
使用耶穌的語言

103
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
和古代的語言

104
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
來表達

105
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
我們有一個神

106
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
所以

107
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
這就是我前面的講座

108
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
一種講座

109
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
我說了

110
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
神的民族

111
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
是以記憶和希望為主

112
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
的

113
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
沒有記憶

114
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
你不知道自己是誰

115
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
這就是為什麼

116
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
在後成代的時期

117
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
內瑪雅人

118
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
會做很多

119
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
以保存記憶

120
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
這個人是誰

121
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
這是亞維的民族

122
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
是出口的神

123
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
當你有記憶

124
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
你會知道

125
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
你會有希望

126
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
因為這是你擁有的神

127
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
所以

128
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
那種不斷的被轉移

129
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
使用過去

130
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
為了未來的希望

131
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
是基礎

132
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
我認為我會同意

133
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
斯文的說法

134
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
這可以嗎?

135
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
這可以嗎?

136
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
你提到的一點是

137
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
希望不是基於

138
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
我們在遙遠的未來

139
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
但也有部分的希望

140
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
是基於

141
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
我們對神的工作的記憶

142
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
我對嗎?

143
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
是的

144
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
是基於記憶

145
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
但也有部分的

146
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
是在想像未來

147
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
這就是神父們所做的

148
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
他們以神的方式

149
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
創造未來

150
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
未來還沒有

151
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
當聖經96召喚

152
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
所有的創造

153
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
來慈祷

154
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
來慶祝

155
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
因為神正到來

156
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
他們正在描述世界

157
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
實際上

158
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
聖經描述世界

159
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
是一個平等的地方

160
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
正義和正義

161
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
和穩定

162
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
和慶祝

163
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
我們知道世界並非如此

164
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
但

165
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
聖經的預言

166
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
和諸侯的預言

167
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
能夠預見

168
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
未來的世界

169
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
基於他們知道

170
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
神的性質

171
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
和他們想要做的事

172
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
所以這是一種組合

173
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
記憶和想像

174
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
這總是會有

175
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
我可以繼續嗎?

176
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
抱歉

177
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
我必須抱歉

178
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
我把時間給你短了

179
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
不不不

180
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
沒關係

181
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
請說

182
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
我們無法想像

183
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
新的創造會是怎樣

184
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
除了聖經告訴我們

185
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
在聖經65召喚之外

186
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
這並不驚訝

187
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
因為我們還沒有到那裡

188
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
我們無法想像

189
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
我們無法想像

190
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
我們已經超越了

191
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
我們生活在三個層次

192
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
的宇宙時間宇宙

193
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
和時間

194
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
耶穌

195
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
耶穌的復活體

196
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
已經在那三個層次裡

197
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
因為祂可以觸摸

198
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
祂可以吃

199
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
祂可以烤魚

200
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
但是祂也能夠

201
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
在那裡活動

202
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
消失

203
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
祂已經存在

204
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
如新創造的第一果實

205
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
新創造已經在這裡

206
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
這就是我和斯蒂芬的最後的意見

207
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
所有聖經說的

208
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
已經開始了

209
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
我們已經在那三個層次裡

210
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
生活了

211
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
我的最後的三角形

212
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
新創造

213
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
我再做一次

214
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
我把它再次傳遞到

215
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
聖經

216
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
我們已經在聖經和聖經之間

217
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
生活了

218
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
在神的新世界

219
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
已經在那裡

220
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
雖然我們無法想像

221
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
現在我用我的說法

222
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
我喜歡在聖經8

223
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Paul在說

224
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
生命的形式

225
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
他說

226
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
全創造正在長大

227
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
是的

228
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
但是它正在長大

229
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
因為孩子的孕育

230
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
換句話說

231
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
新創造已經在

232
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
這個創造的胎兒裡

233
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
生育了

234
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
這是一個非常有趣的說法

235
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
因為這裡有一個原因

236
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Paul在說

237
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
復活身體

238
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
你能想像

239
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
兩個胎兒

240
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
胎兒在胎兒裡

241
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
一個人對另一個人說

242
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
這是想像

243
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
一個人對另一個人說

244
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
你相信生命的復活嗎

245
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
我們聽到很多

246
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
關於光和氣息的謠言

247
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
你能呼吸嗎

248
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
你相信這些嗎

249
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
然後他就說

250
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
不不不

251
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
這只是一個謠言

252
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
只是為了讓你開心

253
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
這個胎兒就是所有的東西

254
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
沒有什麼比無精靈液更多

255
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
只要享受它

256
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
因為

257
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
吃喝住

258
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
結婚

259
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
因為明天我們會出生

260
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
我們結束了

261
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
OK

262
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
現在

263
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
你看

264
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
胎兒在胎兒裡

265
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
無法想像

266
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
胎兒在胎兒外面的情況

267
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
即使它有所有的能力

268
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
因為胎兒在胎兒裡

269
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
他們有眼睛

270
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
他們有耳朵

271
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
他們有腦子

272
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
他們有能力

273
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
活在一個世界

274
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
他們還沒想像到

275
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
這就是為什麼生育這麼傷心

276
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
OK

277
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
這就是為什麼我們會在胎兒裡

278
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
喊哭

279
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
因為我們突然

280
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
在光和氣息

281
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
和呼吸

282
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
有人在背後打擊你

283
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
讓你哭

284
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
現在

285
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Paul說

286
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
新的創造

287
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
與生育不同

288
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
它是同一個人嗎

289
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
當然是

290
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
胎兒在胎兒裡

291
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
是同一個人

292
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
會生育

293
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
活在世界裡

294
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
但是生育是一個巨大的

295
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
變化的時刻

296
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
這就是為什麼我們說

297
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
生育的日子

298
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
我們知道你的生育日

299
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
不是你的出生日

300
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
即使你知道

301
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
生育的日子

302
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
即使你開始的時候

303
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
已經是九個月了

304
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
我們現在正在生活在

305
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
新創造的世界裡

306
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
的一種生育

307
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
我們還沒想像

308
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
它會是怎樣的

309
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
但這也不是原因

310
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
否認它會存在

311
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
因為神已經保證了

312
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
這就是我喜歡用的形容詞

313
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
幫助我們思考

314
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
這世界和下一世界之間的持續

315
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
同時也有著不持續的

316
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
這就像是

317
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
生育的胎兒

318
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
與生育的人

319
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
之間的持續

320
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
同時也有著不持續的

321
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
在生育的時刻

322
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
有幫助嗎

323
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
是的

324
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
是一種想像的想像

325
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
謝謝

326
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
這是一個很有幫助的例子

327
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
所以

328
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
李博士

329
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
我非常高興

330
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
繼續你對於

331
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
生育的說法

332
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
因為

333
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
我只不喜歡的一點

334
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
就是在你的題目中

335
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
你說

336
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
它們會在哪裡

337
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
結束

338
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
是的

339
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
所以對於生育

340
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
這不是結束

341
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
我喜歡CS Lewis的書寫

342
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
我第一次讀

343
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
他的《善於基督教》

344
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
是在我大學一年級

345
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
我不懂這個詞語

346
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
但是我後來

347
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
繼續讀《南亞》的《論述》

348
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
最後一段

349
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
最後一場戰爭

350
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
他描述了死亡的那一刻

351
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
是夏季的第一天

352
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
然後我才明白

353
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
這不是學校的年底

354
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
這是夏季的一年初

355
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
所以

356
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
它們在哪裡開始

357
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
所以謝謝你對於

358
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
這個生育的說法

359
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
我覺得這對兩隻胎兒的交流

360
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
對話很有幫助

361
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
我以為你說的是想像

362
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
我們要開始

363
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
而不是結束

364
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
所以這確實是

365
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
我認為

366
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
生育的關鍵

367
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
所以我不是說

368
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
這個世界並不重要

369
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
所以記憶

370
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
或整個聖經

371
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
是關於這生命

372
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
並不是關於未來的生命

373
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
但我們仍然在等待

374
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
這個生育的開始

375
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
我喜歡

376
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
謝謝

377
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
我們可以在這裡拍一部

378
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
荷里活電影

379
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
但是

380
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
你剛才說了

381
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
它什麼時候會開始

382
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
讓我開始懷疑

383
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
我會在哪裡

384
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
所以這是什麼

385
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
我認為

386
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
這就提出了

387
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
我們現在為了什麼而生存

388
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
你看

389
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
這就是我們的基督教學

390
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
其實非常重要

391
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
因為

392
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
如果我們看到的是新的創造

393
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
在這裡

394
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
如同聖經所說

395
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
不會有欺騙、謀殺、謊言、邪惡、腐敗

396
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
如果沒有了

397
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
就不會有了

398
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
換句話說

399
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
我們現在要活在

400
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
為了這生命而準備的那一刻

401
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
這不僅是在道德上

402
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
我必須要小心

403
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
如何活下去

404
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
因為我將會在天堂

405
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
或新的創造

406
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
這也意味著

407
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
這就是我

408
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
我沒有給足夠時間

409
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
對於我所說的

410
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
在《聖經》21:1

411
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
約翰說

412
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
他看到了國王們

413
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
帶著他們的光榮

414
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
他們的富貴

415
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
他們的榮耀

416
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
進入了神的城市

417
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
這意味著什麼

418
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
我認為這並不意味著

419
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
這只是會發生在

420
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
國王們和首相們

421
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
他們會活著

422
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
當耶穌回來了

423
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
他們將會前來

424
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
前往聖堂

425
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
在我們之間

426
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
我認為

427
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
它正在說

428
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
什麼是國王們和國家的

429
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
光榮和美麗

430
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
這是人類的

431
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
人類的

432
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
人類的文化成就

433
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
我們人類

434
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
能夠創造

435
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
巨大的

436
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
光榮和美麗

437
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
都被罪和自私

438
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
和自豪和憂愁

439
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
和無道

440
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
和慾望

441
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
但人類的成就

442
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
在神的形象中

443
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
是奇妙的

444
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
我認為這段話

445
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
告訴我們

446
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
新的創造

447
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
並不是一個

448
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
空白的座席

449
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
在那裡

450
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
神看著人類

451
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
所做的一切

452
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
在過去的十萬年裡

453
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
祂說

454
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
把所有的東西

455
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
放進垃圾桶裡

456
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
那是煙火的一切

457
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
讓我們開始新的創造

458
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
我認為

459
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
這會發生的是

460
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
神會把

461
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
人類的文化的光榮

462
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
和所有的邪惡

463
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
都吸進去

464
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
然後被毀滅

465
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
清洗和滅絕

466
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
在祂的判決中

467
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
這就是2彼得

468
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
三語

469
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
它會被燒掉

470
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
但燒掉的東西

471
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
並不是一個

472
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
宇宙的燭台

473
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
裡面沒有東西

474
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
只剩下煙火

475
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
而是一個

476
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
宇宙的煙火

477
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
裡面的東西

478
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
被吸進去

479
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
就是垃圾

480
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
就是罪

481
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
就是邪惡

482
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
而剩下的

483
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
就是人類創造的

484
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
光榮和美麗

485
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
在神的形象中

486
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
現在在新創造中

487
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
正在祝福神

488
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
這意味著什麼呢

489
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
意味著你的工作

490
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
每天的工作

491
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
對於人類的

492
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
會有所貢獻

493
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
在新創造中

494
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
我在這生的工作中

495
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
會有所貢獻

496
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
在神的新創造中

497
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
這給予了價值

498
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
給予了意義和意義

499
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
對於普通的每天工作

500
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
這本書寫了

501
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
由達爾·科斯頓寫的

502
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
叫做

503
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
"天地之好"

504
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
我認為這是它的名字

505
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
我們的每天工作

506
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
在這生中

507
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
會有所貢獻

508
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
在神將帶給我們的

509
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
新創造中

510
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
不要問我為什麼

511
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
我不知道

512
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
我明天要寫什麼報告

513
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
或者說

514
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
你需要做什麼

515
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
你需要煮什麼

516
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
我不知道

517
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
但是神有能力

518
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
來賦予和恢復

519
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
我認為這是一個

520
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
很勵志的思想

521
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
不只是

522
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
我們死後都會飛到天上

523
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
這比此更有信心

524
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
比此更有地道性

525
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
比此更有滿足感

526
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
所以我們在準備裝飾

527
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
這可能

528
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
你可以這麼說

529
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
我們肯定是

530
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
新創造的人口

531
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
已經在這創造中生活

532
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
這就是教會

533
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
我們是未來的人

534
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
我們在歷史的右邊

535
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
我們在神的故事中生活

536
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
所以現實世界並不在那裡

537
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
我們有時會談到

538
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
現實世界在那裡

539
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
不是

540
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
現實世界是神的世界

541
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
新創造

542
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
我們在生存中

543
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
我們已經在裝飾中

544
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
我們已經在貢獻

545
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
我們在賦予

546
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
國王和國家的榮耀

547
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
他們將會帶來他們的榮耀

548
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
他們將會帶來他們的榮耀

549
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
他們將會帶來他們的榮耀

550
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
他們將會帶來他們的榮耀

551
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
他們將會帶來他們的榮耀

552
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
他們將會帶來他們的榮耀

553
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
他們將會帶來他們的榮耀

554
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
他們將會帶來他們的榮耀

555
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
他們將會帶來他們的榮耀

556
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
他們將會帶來他們的榮耀

557
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
他們將會帶來他們的榮耀

558
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
他們將會帶來他們的榮耀

559
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
他們將會帶來他們的榮耀

560
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
他們將會帶來他們的榮耀

561
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
他們將會帶來他們的榮耀

562
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
他們將會帶來他們的榮耀

563
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
他們將會帶來他們的榮耀

564
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
他們將會帶來他們的榮耀

565
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
他們將會帶來他們的榮耀

566
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
他們將會帶來他們的榮耀

567
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
他們將會帶來他們的榮耀

568
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
他們將會帶來他們的榮耀

569
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
他們將會帶來他們的榮耀

570
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
他們將會帶來他們的榮耀

571
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
他們將會帶來他們的榮耀

572
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
他們將會帶來他們的榮耀

573
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
他們將會帶來他們的榮耀

574
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
他們將會帶來他們的榮耀

575
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
他們將會帶來他們的榮耀

576
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
他們將會帶來他們的榮耀

577
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
他們將會帶來他們的榮耀

578
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
他們將會帶來他們的榮耀

579
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
他們將會帶來他們的榮耀

580
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
他們將會帶來他們的榮耀

581
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
他們將會帶來他們的榮耀

582
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
他們將會帶來他們的榮耀

583
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
他們將會帶來他們的榮耀

584
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
他們將會帶來他們的榮耀

585
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
他們將會帶來他們的榮耀

586
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
他們將會帶來他們的榮耀

587
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
他們將會帶來他們的榮耀

588
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
他們將會帶來他們的榮耀

589
00:17:47,000 --> 00:18:13,000
他們將會帶來他們的榮耀

590
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
這對一年級的理論學學生來說是非常有趣的

591
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
但我可以深刻地記住

592
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
我們在課堂上的討論

593
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,000
這給予了意義、意義

594
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
以及永恆的善良價值

595
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
給予了我們亂亂糾纏的感覺

596
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
這也是為何

597
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
我今天早上想與你們進行一個對話

598
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:50,000
我會提到路德的《道德法》的靈性使用

599
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
因為您已經非常深入地探討了

600
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
路德的原始法律

601
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
但路德先出手

602
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
他說:你無法做任何事

603
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
這是一場失敗

604
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
懺悔是指不要相信自己

605
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
這在於基督,是在於聖體

606
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,000
我覺得這就是希望的共同實現

607
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
我們盡力而為,但卻失敗了

608
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
但這就是聖經

609
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
這是天性

610
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
這是永恆

611
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
不是遠遠的未來

612
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
是天空的派

613
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
或是人類的opium

614
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
不,這是現實

615
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
我們今天正在體驗

616
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
我們知道這是真的

617
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
因為基督已從死亡中復活

618
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
這定義的時刻

619
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
並非在未來

620
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
這正是勒斯林·雅畢根說的

621
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
在復活中

622
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
復活只有意義在於

623
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
它是從何而來的故事

624
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
如果你嘗試去理解

625
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
基督的復活

626
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
如同新教義所描述

627
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
在任何其他世界觀

628
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
如在物質世界觀

629
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
死亡的身體不會復活

630
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
你只能以神話來理解

631
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
基督在復活的心中

632
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
或是在聖經中

633
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
有過一些靈性體驗

634
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
但墓地是空的

635
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
是基督的身體

636
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
從死亡中復活

637
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
這就是聖經所說的

638
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
你見到一個人復活

639
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
我們見到一個人復活

640
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
他們碰到他,吃了他,走過他

641
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
基督的身體復活

642
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
是新創造的開始

643
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
是基督已經開始的

644
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
因此,在基督教中

645
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Paul可以說

646
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
我們已經與祂同在

647
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
我們已經與祂同在

648
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Paul說的,在天堂

649
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
這要靠一大步的想像力

650
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
我還活在這個世界

651
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
我仍然是一個死去的罪惡人

652
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
在這個時代的複雜

653
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
我仍然活在這個古代

654
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
但我已經在這個緊張的世界

655
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
我已經在天堂的市民中

656
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
我已經在我的身體中

657
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
有了基督的生命復活

658
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
就如同Paul所說的

659
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
這也是為何

660
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
不僅是John堅持

661
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
基督的靈魂

662
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
說話變成靈魂

663
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
他也被提起了身體

664
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
但Paul也堅持

665
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
這就是他現在所活的

666
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
我所活的生命

667
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
是基督在我身體中的

668
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
我們是基督在我身體中的

669
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
我可以回到你的問題

670
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
關於法律的問題

671
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
我同意你的說法

672
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
當然,我認為

673
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Luther和Calvin

674
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
在這裡彼此彼此彼此

675
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Luther當然認同

676
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
法律的重要功能

677
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
就是它可以曝光我們的罪惡

678
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
但這不是因為法律本身不好

679
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
而是因為我們不好

680
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
這一點我們需要非常小心

681
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
因為Luther的懷疑

682
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
是要把法律曝光我們的罪惡

683
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
然後讓法律本身

684
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
變成不好的

685
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
我們必須要守護法律

686
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Paul從來沒有這樣說

687
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
我們必須要守護罪惡

688
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
在聖經七章

689
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
他重複地描述法律

690
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
是那些是善、活、聖的

691
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
法律不是問題

692
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
問題是

693
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
當法律對付了罪

694
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
當法律對付了死

695
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
我們就會對它造成死亡

696
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
我重新想到一個說法

697
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
對於這個說法的意思

698
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Paul其實問了一個問題

699
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
那是如何對生命造成死亡的

700
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
然後我想到蝦子

701
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
蝦子

702
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
抱歉,寶寶在胸前

703
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
但這是另一個畫面

704
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
因為我們都知道蝦子是好東西

705
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
是食物

706
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
是神的創造物

707
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
是充滿蛋白質的

708
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
但對某些人來說

709
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
蝦子會殺死你

710
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
但問題不是蝦子

711
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
問題是你的疾病

712
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
是在你身上

713
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
有些東西在你的身體裡

714
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
會反應蝦子

715
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
然後會殺死你

716
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
我想這就是Paul所說的

717
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
問題不是神的法律

718
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
這是善、活、聖、正、完美的

719
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
但問題是我們是罪惡的

720
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
我們拒絕遵守

721
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
所以法律在靈性的意義上

722
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
它會引導你去聖經

723
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
它會閉上你的嘴巴

724
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
告訴你你需要被救

725
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
但感謝彼得神

726
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
祂會讓我們得到這一點

727
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
然後是Calvin

728
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
他也說了

729
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
是的,這是真的

730
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
但法律也有三種用法

731
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
第三種是

732
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
法律仍然操作為指引

733
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
指明了我們如何活著

734
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
法律告訴我們

735
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
如何愛一個人

736
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
法律給我們設定的標準

737
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
模式、模式

738
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
如何活著

739
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
這就是我主要用法律的方式

740
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
在我的書中

741
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
我問

742
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
如果Paul說

743
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
所有的文章都是有用的

744
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
正如你所說

745
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
為正確訓練和正義

746
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
我沒有必要

747
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
說自己是一位教會人士

748
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
我相信所有的文章

749
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
都是由神啟發的

750
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
是有用的

751
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
除非我準備了

752
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
寫一章關於伊達基

753
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
或一章關於聖經

754
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
或聖經

755
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
這本文章

756
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
是神吸引的

757
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
是有用的

758
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
對訓練和正義的

759
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
我必須找到

760
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
這裡有些東西

761
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
在我對神的聲音

762
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
對神的呼吸中

763
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
在我對正義的訓練

764
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
能夠做到的方式中

765
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
能夠使我能夠

766
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
做到的方式中

767
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
即使我沒有

768
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
做到正確的訓練

769
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
因為我無法

770
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
我沒有牛角尖

771
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
在我的後座

772
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
在我背後

773
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
在我背後

774
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
所以我無法遵守這個法律

775
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
正如它所寫

776
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
但是

777
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
這裏必須有些東西

778
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
神想通過它

779
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
對我說話

780
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
使我能夠

781
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
有神的聲音

782
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
這就是

783
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
法律

784
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
作為一個牆壁

785
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
作為一個鏡子

786
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
讓你展現你的罪行

787
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
讓你展現你的失敗

788
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
你需要聖經

789
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
但也成為了一個導導

790
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
讓你能夠

791
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
活在神的方向

792
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
謝謝

793
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
我想你們也提出了

794
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
各種話題

795
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
都值得追究

796
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
例如

797
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
我的觀點

798
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
我的觀點

799
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
是要

800
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
要被形容

801
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
但其實

802
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
我喜歡你的觀點

803
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
關於想像

804
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
是的

805
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
這是很真實的

806
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
記憶能夠幫助我們

807
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
有一個

808
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
有一個交換的想像

809
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
並不是固定在現實之中

810
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
但是

811
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
神是更加強大的

812
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
祂可以

813
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
做任何事

814
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
祂可以做更大的事

815
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
比你能想像的更大

816
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
比你能想像的更大

817
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
所以

818
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
這就是我們

819
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
期待的一件事

820
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
但同時我們也知道

821
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
這不是我們能夠得到的結局

822
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
是的

823
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
老天爺也說過

824
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
神說

825
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
不要想起過去的事

826
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
就算你提醒他們

827
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
過去的事

828
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
祂說

829
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
我會做一些

830
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
會讓你們感到驚訝和驚訝的事

831
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
但是過去的事

832
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
仍然是祂所做的模式

833
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
所以

834
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
當耶穌第一次來

835
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
很多人都認出了

836
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
很多人沒有

837
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
即使他們有了經文

838
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
他們仍然驚訝

839
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
神會成為

840
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
納粹的耶穌

841
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
這個探頭的兒子

842
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
洗別人的腳

843
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
觸碰妖精

844
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
和原諒女性

845
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
你知道

846
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
神怎麼會

847
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
變成這樣

848
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
所以很驚訝

849
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
神會這樣做

850
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
所以這就是

851
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
我所想說的

852
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
當耶穌再次回來

853
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
會有很多驚訝的事

854
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
即使我們

855
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
知道經文的知識

856
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
我們仍然會發現

857
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
神會做一些

858
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
讓我們驚訝

859
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
我們從來沒有想到

860
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
謝謝神

861
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
祂比我們的想像更大

862
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
但祂給了我們我們的想像

863
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
就像那本

864
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
《諾貝爾》的書

865
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
《神的想像》

866
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
我們是神的形象

867
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
我們是神的想像

868
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
神要想像宇宙

869
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
然後說出它成為實相

870
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
神給了我們

871
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
這個想像的能力

872
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
我覺得這很明顯

873
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
是人類的

874
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
我們知道

875
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
狗和大象

876
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
不會想像

877
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
其他東西

878
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
很難說

879
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
他們會夢想

880
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
但我不知道

881
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
我們人類的能力

882
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
是站在宇宙和時間之間

883
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
去想像一些不同的東西

884
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
在人類歷史的偉大時刻

885
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
當時有很多的壓迫和痛苦

886
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
例如黑人奴隸

887
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
是由耶穌基督

888
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
和神所傳授的

889
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
寫信的想像

890
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
帶來的

891
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
尤其是在美國

892
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
黑人奴隸的流行

893
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
黑人的靈性

894
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
他們所說的

895
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
想像了約旦的未來

896
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
想像了去到康寧地區

897
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
想像了去到水裡

898
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
有非常多的

899
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
想像自由和自由

900
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
都是從

901
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
從古代的耶穌

902
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
尤其是從耶穌的死亡

903
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
這在歷史上

904
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
有很多次發生

905
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
神的人類

906
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
是記憶的人類

907
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
因此他們是希望的人類

908
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
當你有了過去的記憶

909
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
和希望未來的希望

910
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
你就是一個任務的人

911
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
因為你會問

912
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
我該怎麼生活

913
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
如果那是

914
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
我過去的事

915
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
而那是我未來的目標

916
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
那是一個

917
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
道德和任務的挑戰

918
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,000
我想我們應該邀請觀眾

919
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
參加我們的討論

920
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
你認為呢?

921
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
有問題的觀眾

922
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
請用麥克風

923
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
來問問題

924
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
或寫下問題

925
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
在紙上

926
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
傳給我

927
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
讓我可以

928
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
翻譯出來

929
00:29:46,000 --> 00:30:08,000
(麥克風轉換中)

930
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
(英文)

931
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
謝謝你們

932
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
非常感謝你們

933
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
默哲偉

934
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
你們給我們畫了一張圖片

935
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
是一種想像

936
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
這是現實

937
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
但那是未來的事

938
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
我們被圖片觸動了

939
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
我們真的想要去那裡

940
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
但是當然

941
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
對於基督徒來說

942
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,000
如果我們只將希望放在未來

943
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
問題就會變成逃脫

944
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
我們想逃脫

945
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
所以這世界並不重要

946
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
所以我想默哲偉的訊息

947
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
是重要的

948
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
我們今天也看到了希望

949
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
即使是在過去

950
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
所以如果我想將你們兩人的形象

951
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
可能是像

952
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
我們的基督信仰

953
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
是基於一個

954
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
已經發生了

955
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
但還沒有實現的事

956
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
信仰是已經發生了

957
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
透過死亡和復活

958
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
但也並非完全滿足

959
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
所以我們已經在那裡

960
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
但還沒有實現

961
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
我想我們需要兩個

962
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
但當我讀《新經》時

963
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,000
作者們總是希望耶穌的復活

964
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
我認為原因是

965
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
其一是因為他們在受苦

966
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
所以他們無法找到希望

967
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
在地球上

968
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
我認為

969
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
當我們回到整件事的基督性應用

970
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
當我們面對一個真正的受苦的人

971
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
我們應該如何

972
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
如何與他們交談基督的希望

973
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
就像

974
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:04,000
現在你看到地球上還有希望

975
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
我們應該如何

976
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
我們應該如何更加強調未來

977
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
你明白我的意思嗎?

978
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:22,000
「已經」但還沒有的方面

979
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
已經在耶穌的教導中

980
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
在他的講道中

981
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
他將兩段講道放在一起

982
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
在一篇章中

983
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
我認為是在《路克》中

984
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
或者是在《馬克》中

985
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
他在講述基督的國王是怎樣的

986
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
他說

987
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
一方面

988
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,000
就像是種了柑橘子

989
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
它會長得很大

990
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
所以事情會開始變得小

991
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
所以不要擔心

992
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
如果一切看起來很不重要

993
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
只有耶穌和一位工匠

994
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
它是小的

995
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
但它會長大

996
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
另一方面

997
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
就是種了柑橘子的人

998
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
他起來

999
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
他去睡覺

1000
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
他不知道發生了什麼

1001
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
而柑橘子本身已經長大

1002
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
並產生了種子

1003
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
所以耶穌似乎在說

1004
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
柑橘子已經種了

1005
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
而神的國王也會長大

1006
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
也會產生種子

1007
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
所以已經有了

1008
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
工匠已經做了他的工作

1009
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
也有了未來

1010
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
我認為新教的作家們

1011
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
並沒有提到

1012
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
耶穌的復活

1013
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
因為他們只是在痛苦

1014
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
並沒有希望

1015
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
他們是在痛苦

1016
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
但我覺得是因為

1017
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
他們有了

1018
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
復活的信心

1019
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
這個耶穌

1020
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
祢基督基督

1021
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
祂將祂提出

1022
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
從死去

1023
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
並使祂成為耶穌

1024
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
因此

1025
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
祂現在是

1026
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
天上的國王

1027
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
如同聖經所說

1028
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
未來也屬於祂

1029
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
現在和未來

1030
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
所以他們可以

1031
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
走出一個世界

1032
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
那時總是說

1033
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
耶穌是主的

1034
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
並說不

1035
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
耶穌是主的

1036
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
然後去死

1037
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
因為他們願意

1038
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
認同

1039
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
世界的國王

1040
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
已經被基督基督復活

1041
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
所以我認為

1042
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
新教的

1043
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
已經和未來

1044
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
你去看

1045
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
在《聖經》中

1046
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
那裡的約翰

1047
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
在帕瑪斯的監獄

1048
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
或許他自己在監獄

1049
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
他可能只認識

1050
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
幾個基督徒

1051
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
在伊布萊斯斯

1052
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
或者是其他地方

1053
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
但耶穌給了他

1054
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
這個視覺

1055
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
基督復活

1056
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
基督復活

1057
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
以及一種視覺

1058
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
是所有的國家

1059
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
族群

1060
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
語言

1061
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,000
It's a kind of tearing back of the veil to say this is reality.

1062
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,600
There is a throne at the center of the universe and god is on it,

1063
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,800
and there is a lamb who was crucified,

1064
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,000
in whose hand is the scroll of the whole of human history,

1065
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
and human history is under the control of the lamb of god.

1066
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,800
And so he gives hope to the martyrs,

1067
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,600
the suffering churches that he writes to,

1068
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:55,000
because he sees the reality of the present glory of Christ.

1069
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
I think that's the way the New Testament expresses it.

1070
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I don't know whether Stephen you want to add.

1071
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:07,000
For the last 12 months or so,

1072
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
or to be more precise,

1073
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
since the national security law comes into place,

1074
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I kept asking myself,

1075
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
why are we evangelical church leaders

1076
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
are so afraid of suffering and persecution,

1077
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
that we leave so quickly?

1078
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Of course there are exceptions,

1079
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,000
but I remember,I recall back in the 80s,

1080
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
when Eastern European Christians came out,

1081
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
and the first question they asked,

1082
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,000
why are you Western Christians not being persecuted all the time?

1083
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
It's the other way around.

1084
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
So in our faith,

1085
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
is it a kind of do-it-yourself,

1086
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
IKEA furniture building game?

1087
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Is all we are doing things,

1088
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
when we cannot do anything,

1089
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
then we gave up and leave?

1090
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Or is it a trust in the one true God,

1091
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
in spite of our own,

1092
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
was it frustrations, failures?

1093
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I think the Old Testament talks more about failures than success.

1094
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I don't know whether this is true in the Psalms.

1095
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I mean, you know, laments more than praises.

1096
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
So you talk about the meta-narrative,

1097
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
it's a story of failure.

1098
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
It's not a story of success.

1099
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
And you read the book of Acts,

1100
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:55,000
it's not the church,you know,practicing mission,

1101
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
but it's persecutions,it's arguments,

1102
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,000
it's seal it,or whatever.

1103
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Among these realities,

1104
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:12,000
the way of the Lord conquers the Roman Empire,

1105
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
that seems to be the hope,

1106
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:22,000
which again I would say not where are we going to end,

1107
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
but here and now,

1108
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
here in Hong Kong today,

1109
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,000
or putting aside the sociopolitical,

1110
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
moralistic reading of scripture,

1111
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
but as a cancer patient,

1112
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,000
I'm faced with this reality every day.

1113
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Oh, I hope someday,

1114
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
no, no, no, no, no,

1115
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
it's every day, every hour, every minute.

1116
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,000
And so, yes, Christian hope.

1117
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I think I always want to ask New Testament colleagues

1118
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
or theology colleagues,

1119
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,000
ascetology, is it always in the future?

1120
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
No.

1121
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I remember Carver Yu, our president emeritus,

1122
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
once answered questions on our curriculum,

1123
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:20,000
because some senior pastors raised his hands and queried,

1124
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,000
CGSD doesn't have a course on eschatology.

1125
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
And Dr. Yu stood up.

1126
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I was a dean.

1127
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
I don't know how to answer as an Old Testament scholar,

1128
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,000
but he is the theologian at CGSD.

1129
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
So he stood up and said,

1130
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:45,000
"Eschatology permeates every lesson."

1131
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Has he spoken the same to you?

1132
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
I remember that statement very clearly.

1133
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:56,000
So I suppose that is the Reformed tradition,

1134
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
or the legacy.

1135
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,000
And I think our church here in Hong Kong

1136
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,000
really undergoing something that the Lord has prepared for us

1137
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:19,000
and pushed us to reflect and review and self-criticism,

1138
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,000
not criticizing the other side, but ourselves.

1139
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Can I add one thing about how,

1140
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,000
during the present suffering or persecution or frustration,

1141
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
how we may maintain hope?

1142
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I think the psalmic literature in this respect

1143
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
helps us or provides us with a language

1144
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,000
how we can talk to God in those times

1145
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
so that we may uphold our hope

1146
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:54,000
and uphold our hope in the one sovereign God

1147
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
at the same time without

1148
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
subcoming to the external pressures.

1149
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
And I think this is one of the contributions

1150
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I think that's why psalms is so important.

1151
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I take it you teach the psalms?

1152
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Oh, sorry.

1153
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
I don't mean to let you know about that.

1154
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Yes, why did you say what you really think?

1155
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I want to agree with you,

1156
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,000
because I think the psalms are tragically neglected

1157
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
in the Christian church.

1158
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
When I speak, even sadly, of my own church,

1159
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
All Souls Church, I keep on trying to get them

1160
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
to use the psalms more often, to pray the psalms,

1161
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
to actually sing the psalms from time to time.

1162
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Because the church through the ages,

1163
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
the psalms were the hymn book for the church.

1164
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
And as you rightly said,

1165
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
the title of the book is "The Praises,"

1166
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
and yet the largest category of psalms

1167
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
within the book of psalms are laments.

1168
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
But lament is not an absence of praise.

1169
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Lament, praise in the biblical sense,

1170
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
is recognizing the reality and presence of God,

1171
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
saying, "God, you are there,

1172
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
and I will worship and glorify you."

1173
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
But actually, God, at the moment,

1174
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
life is pretty tough right here.

1175
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
People are laughing at me, I'm suffering,

1176
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
and you're not doing anything about it.

1177
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
When are you going to do something about it?

1178
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I praise you, I love you, I trust you, I worship you,

1179
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
but it's pretty bad.

1180
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,000
So the psalms are willing to protest to God

1181
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
about what's going on,

1182
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
and there's nothing wrong with that.

1183
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I think, in fact, the idea that Christians

1184
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
should always just be happy,

1185
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
and never be angry with God

1186
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
or never say anything negative,

1187
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,000
that's not the way the Old Testament saints behaved.

1188
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
They were quite willing to, it says,

1189
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,000
beat on God's chest or to cry on his shoulder

1190
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
and then to acknowledge him, to say,

1191
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
"But God, I still trust you.

1192
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
You're still there,

1193
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
even though I don't understand what you're doing

1194
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
or why you're letting this happen."

1195
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
And so that is this balance

1196
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,000
between recognizing that there's evil in the world

1197
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
and wrong things are being done

1198
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
and things are not the way we want them

1199
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
and it's not comfortable

1200
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
and we may be suffering,

1201
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
and yet somehow being willing to say,

1202
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
in all of that, God remains sovereign,

1203
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
God has his purposes,

1204
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
and God will remember his own people

1205
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
and preserve them, ultimately,

1206
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
even through death, even through martyrdom,

1207
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
that you're safe in the hands of God.

1208
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
So I think we do need to use the psalms more,

1209
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
and that's what Revelation does as well.

1210
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,000
It fills the book with the songs of the people of God,

1211
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
celebrating the sovereignty of God,

1212
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
even in the midst of the beasts and the empire

1213
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
and the wrong things that are being done

1214
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
by the kings and the nations

1215
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
before the end of the world.

1216
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Thank you.

1217
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
So, the next question.

1218
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Thank you, Dr. Rice and Dr. Lee.

1219
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
The sharing of Dr. Rice on the FIFO forms

1220
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
of hope, the hope of sinners,

1221
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
of the nations and of creation

1222
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
is truly inspiring.

1223
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
And as you mentioned about new creation

1224
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
repeatedly in this lecture,

1225
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,000
and one important agent of the new creation

1226
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
in the New Testament is the Holy Spirit.

1227
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
But maybe due to lack of time,

1228
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
you rarely mentioned the Spirit

1229
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
in the previous lectures.

1230
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Yet, I believe the Holy Spirit

1231
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
is the important agent of new creation

1232
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
who reborn the Christians,

1233
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
the John 3,

1234
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
and transformed them into new creation in Christ,

1235
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:40,000
2 Corinthians 5, verse 17.

1236
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
And my question is,

1237
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
I have two questions.

1238
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
The first question is,

1239
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
is the Spirit of God in the Old Testament

1240
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
referring to the same agent

1241
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
as the Holy Spirit in the New Testament?

1242
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Some biblical scholars prefer

1243
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
to treat them separately

1244
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
rather than equating them.

1245
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
What do you think?

1246
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
And the second question is,

1247
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
you mentioned about the metanarrative,

1248
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
the mission of God,

1249
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
the story of God.

1250
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Can you outline the story of the Spirit,

1251
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
the narrative of the Spirit

1252
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
within your metanarrative?

1253
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Briefly, thank you.

1254
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Thank you.

1255
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
My answer to the first part of your question is yes.

1256
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Yes, the Spirit of God

1257
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
is the same Spirit of God

1258
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
as the Spirit of Yahweh in the Old Testament,

1259
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
who is sometimes called the Holy Spirit,

1260
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
the Spirit of God's holiness,

1261
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
and the Holy Spirit as we see in the New.

1262
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I'm absolutely convinced of that.

1263
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
God is only one Spirit.

1264
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
It is the Trinity.

1265
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
We believe God is Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

1266
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I've actually written a book called

1267
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Knowing God the Spirit,

1268
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Knowing the Holy Spirit

1269
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Through the Old Testament.

1270
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
So you might want to look for that

1271
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
because he is the Spirit of creation.

1272
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
He's there.

1273
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
He's the Spirit of justice.

1274
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
He's the Spirit of...

1275
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Do you know who the first people

1276
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
who are said to be filled with the Spirit are?

1277
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
If you want to be filled with the Spirit,

1278
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
the first people who are filled with the Spirit

1279
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
are in the Old Testament,

1280
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
in the Book of Exodus,

1281
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
and they're called Bezalel and Aholiab.

1282
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
You should know those guys.

1283
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
They were artists.

1284
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
They were craftsmen.

1285
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
They were there to work with wood and stone

1286
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
and fine metals and precious stones

1287
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
to build a tabernacle.

1288
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
The God whose Spirit had done creation

1289
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
with all its beauty

1290
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
now pours the same Spirit on these men

1291
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
to be the artisans of the tabernacle.

1292
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
It's a beautiful thought.

1293
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
And then he's the Spirit of justice.

1294
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,000
He's the Spirit of the prophets and so on.

1295
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
And it's also the Spirit who is poured out

1296
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,000
in the eschatological vision of new creation

1297
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
because Isaiah speaks about God

1298
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
pouring out His Spirit on the land

1299
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
and restoring His people.

1300
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
And of course, so does Joel.

1301
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
And Peter quotes from Joel in the Day of Pentecost

1302
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,000
that this is that which the prophet Joel spoke about.

1303
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
So the idea that Spirit is different

1304
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
in the Old and New Testament

1305
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
wouldn't stand up to the Day of Pentecost

1306
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
where Peter equates.

1307
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
In relation to the metanarrative,

1308
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
I would want to put my hand up and say,

1309
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
yes, you are right.

1310
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:18,000
That is an element that I should bring in more clearly,

1311
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000
namely the role of God's Spirit in the story

1312
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
and the role of the Holy Spirit in Christian mission.

1313
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
So forgive me for not emphasizing that as much as I should

1314
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
because I think you're right.

1315
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
But I want to say that the Spirit is there

1316
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
throughout the whole of the narrative, isn't it?

1317
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
The Spirit is there in the second verse of the Bible.

1318
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
The Spirit of God is hovering over the waters,

1319
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
over the deep there in creation.

1320
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
And the Spirit of God is there in the ministry of Jesus.

1321
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
He is filled with the Spirit.

1322
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
He is conceived by the Spirit.

1323
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,000
If I, the Spirit of God is doing the work.

1324
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,000
And also, Hebrews says that even the work of atonement

1325
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
is the work of the whole Trinity

1326
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
because it's through the Holy Spirit

1327
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
that Jesus offered Himself to the cross.

1328
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
So the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit

1329
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
are united in the work of atonement.

1330
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
And then, of course, the Spirit comes

1331
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
in the book of Revelation.

1332
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
The Spirit is there before the throne of God

1333
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:20,000
and engaged in the work of new creation and so on.

1334
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
So that's something I should factor in.

1335
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
And thank you for the reminder.

1336
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:30,000
And I wouldn't want in any sense to have overlooked it,

1337
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Him, the Spirit.

1338
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
But I should have perhaps mentioned it more than I did.

1339
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
But it's certainly something which, again,

1340
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
is cross-testamental.

1341
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
It would be another uniting theme

1342
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
within who we are and why we're here

1343
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
and how we should live.

1344
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Well, who we are, we are created by the Spirit of God.

1345
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
And how we should live?

1346
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Well, by bearing the fruit of the Spirit,

1347
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
by being filled with the Spirit,

1348
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
by living our lives in the Spirit and so on,

1349
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
walking in the Spirit.

1350
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Thank you.

1351
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:25,000
(英文)

1352
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Steven, you are the one who talked about

1353
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
biblical theology and dogmatic theology.

1354
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
And, yeah, there is obviously a difference,

1355
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:38,000
but you explain it.

1356
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Well, I think at the risk of being

1357
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
over-simplifying things,

1358
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:50,000
I would say dogmatic theology or Christian theology.

1359
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Christian theology, yeah.

1360
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,000
By theology, logos of theos,

1361
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
we are talking about logic.

1362
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:05,000
So today we talked about systematic theology.

1363
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Systematic is logical.

1364
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
But going back to the Old Testament,

1365
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
I don't claim to know the New Testament

1366
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
as good as the Old Testament.

1367
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
But talking about the Old Testament,

1368
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
it's never logical, never.

1369
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Who stopped?

1370
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
What do you say?

1371
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:33,000
The Amazon River with all the undercurrents upside down.

1372
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Yes.

1373
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
That's a challenge.

1374
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,000
My understanding of the phrase biblical theology

1375
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,000
means the theology of the biblical texts

1376
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,000
seen in their own context and background.

1377
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
So one could speak about, say,

1378
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
the theology of Ezekiel

1379
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
or the theology of the Pentateuch

1380
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
or the theology of the Old Testament.

1381
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
It's thinking what is the Bible saying

1382
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
about God and God's action in the world.

1383
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
And you were right, as James Sanders said.

1384
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Was it James Sanders?

1385
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
The whole is about what God is doing,

1386
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
not about us.

1387
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
God is the main character.

1388
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
That's why I like the idea of it being a drama

1389
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
in which God is the director

1390
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
and the chief author of the whole story.

1391
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
So biblical theology is the theology

1392
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
as articulated when we try to explain

1393
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
what the Bible is saying.

1394
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Systematic theology is the way

1395
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
in which we then try to put that together

1396
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,000
into categories such as, well,

1397
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,000
what is our doctrine of God, of creation,

1398
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,000
of humanity, of sin, of salvation?

1399
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:47,000
And so we create a kind of conceptual framework

1400
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
for the Christian faith

1401
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,000
based around those biblical theology

1402
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,000
So systematic theology has to be rooted

1403
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
in what the Bible says,

1404
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
but in a sense it's trying to organize it

1405
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
into a more conceptual framework.

1406
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
But here is what I want to say

1407
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:09,000
is that to me, all that we put

1408
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,000
into our systematic theology

1409
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,000
flows from the grand meta-narrative

1410
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
of the Scripture

1411
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:21,000
because it all comes out of that great story.

1412
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
It tells us there is one living God.

1413
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
He created this world.

1414
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
He made us in His image.

1415
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
We rebelled and fell against Him, fell into sin.

1416
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
God chose to redeem us,

1417
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
so He had to atone for our sin.

1418
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
So it leads you to Christ,

1419
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
leads you to the cross, the resurrection,

1420
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
and ultimately the future.

1421
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,000
So our doctrines are in a sense

1422
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
an articulation of the implications

1423
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,000
of the biblical story

1424
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,000
and what it is telling us

1425
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
about God and the world.

1426
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
The two need to mesh together.

1427
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
There is also a sense in which,

1428
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
and maybe this is why CGST moves to put,

1429
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
teach systematic theology,

1430
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
teach dogmatics first,

1431
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,000
and then see how the Bible critiques

1432
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
and explains it,

1433
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,000
is because the early Christian fathers

1434
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
talked about the rule of faith.

1435
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
They said that there is a way

1436
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
of understanding the Scriptures,

1437
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
which comes from the Scriptures,

1438
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
but it's possible to read the Scriptures

1439
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
in a way which distorts their meaning.

1440
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
You could, as we all know,

1441
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
you can make a Bible text

1442
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
mean whatever you want.

1443
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000
You can take verses and passages

1444
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,000
and you can really say things

1445
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
based on a single verse,

1446
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
which would be quite contrary

1447
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
to what the whole Bible says.

1448
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Prosperity Gospel does that all the time,

1449
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
for example.

1450
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
And what the fathers were saying is

1451
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
we need to read each passage of Scripture

1452
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
and each book of the Scripture

1453
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
in consistency with what the whole

1454
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
of the Bible has to say,

1455
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
the whole canonical rule of faith.

1456
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
That's why there's a commentary series

1457
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
by Zondervan just in the process

1458
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
of being produced called

1459
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
The Story of God Bible Commentary.

1460
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
I've contributed the volume on Exodus.

1461
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
I don't know if it's in the bookstall downstairs,

1462
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
but the idea of the series is

1463
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,000
that each commentator will work

1464
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
on the text of that book

1465
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
in the light of the story

1466
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
that has gone before

1467
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,000
and the story that follows.

1468
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
In other words,

1469
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
setting the text in the light

1470
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
of the canonical Scripture,

1471
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
especially, of course,

1472
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
as centered on Christ.

1473
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
And I think that's a very biblical way

1474
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
of reading the Bible itself,

1475
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
because it's what the Bible does.

1476
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
They keep on telling us the story

1477
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
as they go through.

1478
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
So biblical theology, Christian theology,

1479
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
they are ultimately the same,

1480
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
but they're just different ways

1481
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
of organizing and expressing

1482
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
what we believe as Christians from the Bible.

1483
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Is that fair enough?

1484
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Something like that.

1485
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,000
I just want to add one footnote.

1486
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
A long one?

1487
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
No.

1488
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Is it logical?

1489
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
No, it is not logical,

1490
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,000
because you talk about metanarrative,

1491
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
the Bible story.

1492
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:13,000
I would just want to add biblical poetry

1493
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,000
or in Brueggemann's Old Testament theology,

1494
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,000
the counter testimony

1495
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
or Robert Davidson's

1496
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
The Courage to Doubt.

1497
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
You know what I'm saying.

1498
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,000
I mean, it is not just the logical,

1499
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
the positive,

1500
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,000
or even the triumphalistic way

1501
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,000
of reading Scripture into theology

1502
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
and faith and work.

1503
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
No.

1504
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
It's actually,

1505
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
I like your word, struggle.

1506
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
It's a struggle.

1507
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
And during the struggling,

1508
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
you discover it's God,

1509
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,000
the only one true God.

1510
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:58,000
So you are not working for your salvation.

1511
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
It's grace.

1512
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
It's sola gratia.

1513
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
So this is the Bible.

1514
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Yes.

1515
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:10,000
I don't want to give the impression

1516
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
that I'm looking down upon

1517
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,000
systematic theology.

1518
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
My first theological degree,

1519
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
divinity training,

1520
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,000
I did a double major in Old Testament

1521
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
and systematic theology.

1522
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
And then I moved on to my THM

1523
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,000
in historical theology,

1524
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,000
then coming back after playing truant

1525
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:39,000
to Old Testament doctoral research.

1526
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,000
So I suppose dogmatic theology,

1527
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
historical theology,

1528
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,000
systematic theology,

1529
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,000
really helps, as you say,

1530
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:57,000
categorizing the content of Christian faith.

1531
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:02,000
But still, when you open the Old Testament,

1532
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,000
it doesn't begin with, you know,

1533
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,000
systematic theology,

1534
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
existence of God.

1535
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Instead it says,

1536
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,000
only fools will say there is no God.

1537
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
So...

1538
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
I think, Stephen,

1539
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
with this word "metanarrative",

1540
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
I would emphasize the meta bit of it,

1541
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
because although I drew that diagram,

1542
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
a nice straight line,

1543
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
nice symbols and so on,

1544
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:33,000
I don't want to say that it's all just story,

1545
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
that it's all just narrative.

1546
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,000
The whole point about a metanarrative is that

1547
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,000
here is an overarching canonical shape

1548
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
to the scripture,

1549
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
which has a beginning and an ending,

1550
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,000
which is a new beginning at the end.

1551
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
And within that canonical metanarrative,

1552
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
of course,

1553
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
there are all kinds of counter movements

1554
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,000
and questions and problems and struggles.

1555
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,000
And that's why I love a book like Ecclesiastes,

1556
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
which I've written a small exposition of.

1557
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
It's coming out next year.

1558
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Because what Ecclesiastes does,

1559
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
and to some extent Job,

1560
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
but especially Ecclesiastes,

1561
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
it says,

1562
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Look, I know that this is what God says,

1563
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
and I know this is what wisdom should be,

1564
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
and I know it's better to be righteous

1565
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
than to be wicked,

1566
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
and it's even probably better to be alive

1567
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
than to be dead,

1568
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
although you can't really tell

1569
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,000
when you look at a dead dog.

1570
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
It's just as dead as a dead human.

1571
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
So, you know,

1572
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,000
he's facing the fact that he knows

1573
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
with his head what's true,

1574
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
and yet he struggles

1575
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
with all the stupidities,

1576
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
the absurdities,

1577
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
the futilities of life,

1578
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
and he just puts the two together

1579
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
and says,

1580
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
What do you think?

1581
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,000
And it's a wonderful book

1582
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:48,000
of sort of questioning faith.

1583
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
And I use the word questioning

1584
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
both in the sense of it is

1585
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,000
questioning the faith he knows he has,

1586
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
because the book still comes to the fear of God,

1587
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
but it's also a faith

1588
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
which has the ability to question.

1589
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000
And so in my book I say

1590
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
just because we're Christian believers

1591
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
doesn't mean that we don't have any questions,

1592
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:10,000
but also just because we're Christian believers

1593
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
doesn't mean we have all the answers

1594
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
to all the questions we have.

1595
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Sometimes we don't have answers.

1596
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
That's why I wrote a book

1597
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
called The God I Don't Understand,

1598
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
because there are many things

1599
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
you don't understand about God,

1600
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
but it's okay.

1601
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
There's a lot I don't understand

1602
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
about my wife,

1603
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
but that doesn't mean I don't know her

1604
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
and love her and trust her.

1605
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
She's a person,

1606
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,000
and you don't always understand other people,

1607
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
but you can love and trust them.

1608
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
And so you can love and trust and know God,

1609
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
even though there are things

1610
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
beyond what we can really understand,

1611
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
even when we have to say,

1612
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,000
God, why did you allow that?

1613
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
We don't know why.

1614
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:51,000
And so that's true.

1615
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
The Old Testament has this wonderful capacity

1616
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
to affirm the truth,

1617
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
but also to put the truth into the furnace

1618
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
of questions and doubt and suffering

1619
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
and lament and protest

1620
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
and still come out the other side

1621
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:10,000
as faith in the sovereign goodness of God.

1622
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,000
I want to say a final word

1623
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,000
before I stop.

1624
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Thank you for quoting very often

1625
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
from the Book of Isaiah,

1626
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,000
the prophecy.

1627
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
The poetic commentary

1628
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
rather than the storyline part

1629
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
of the Old Testament.

1630
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:36,000
I think that shows your meta narrative.

1631
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,000
It's not simply narrative or storyline.

1632
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:42,000
So thank you very much indeed.

1633
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Yes, I think that is a good question

1634
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,000
to close the whole discussion.

1635
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Well, actually, I suspect

1636
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
I'm just doing a reading response reading

1637
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
of that question.

1638
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,000
The person asking,

1639
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
a Christian, our Christian theology

1640
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,000
actually, may have something in mind

1641
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
that a theology that has to be unifying,

1642
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:06,000
unitary, and that can maybe

1643
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,000
can include everything.

1644
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:13,000
But perhaps what we are led to explore

1645
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
is actually we may have

1646
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,000
political theologies, if I may say.

1647
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,000
And there are actually different trajectories

1648
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
within this meta narrative.

1649
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
And we do look forward

1650
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
to your coming books

1651
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:32,000
to lead us to scale

1652
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,000
along all these trajectories again.

1653
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
So once again,

1654
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:41,000
our warmest applause to Dr. Wright

1655
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
and also Dr. Liu.

1656
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
謝謝大家.

1657
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,000
謝謝大家.

1658
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
謝謝大家.

1659
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
謝謝大家.
