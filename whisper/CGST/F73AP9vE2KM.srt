1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,920
 (soft piano music)

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:19,000
 - Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,080
 Good morning to those of you who are in Hong Kong,

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,680
 and good evening, Dr. Mark Labberton,

5
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,880
 and welcome those of you who are viewing this

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,820
 at home on the internet.

7
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,240
 Welcome to the second day

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,800
 of the China Graduate School of Theology,

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,360
 Josephine Zou Culture and Ethics Lecture Week.

10
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:43,360
 We had a very fruitful and sharing discussion yesterday.

11
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,400
 If this is the first day that you joined the lecture,

12
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,680
 I would like to welcome you to the second day

13
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,640
 of our lecture on the crisis

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,280
 of American white evangelicalism.

15
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,440
 So just a housekeeping item,

16
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,840
 if you would like to view the lecture in Cantonese

17
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,880
 or Mandarin, you can scroll down to the webpage

18
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,880
 to the bottom, and you can find the respective language,

19
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:12,000
 so either in English, Cantonese, or Mandarin.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,480
 So today, we are honored and fortunate

21
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,580
 to have Dr. Mark Labberton with us again

22
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,360
 to share with us about Christology and our culture.

23
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,920
 And the title of today's lecture is

24
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,280
 The Battle of American White Evangelicalism

25
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,120
 that Exalts its Christology While its Culture Itself.

26
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,860
 And without further ado, let's welcome Dr. Mark Labberton.

27
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,760
 - Thank you very much.

28
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:43,920
 It's my great privilege and honor to be with you again.

29
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,640
 And as we go through our lecture tonight

30
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,000
 and then have opportunities for questions

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,720
 and discussion later, I look forward to that,

32
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,040
 as well as the respondents

33
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,320
 that are going to comment as well.

34
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,640
 So Christology and our culture,

35
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,640
 we will reflect on the battle

36
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,640
 of American white evangelicalism

37
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,960
 that exalts its Christology while its culture eats its soul.

38
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:15,600
 In 2004, at the height of George W. Bush's administration

39
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,160
 and new waves of the press exploring the meaning

40
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,440
 and character of evangelicalism,

41
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,680
 David Brooks, a New York Times columnist,

42
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,040
 wrote an article entitled, "Who is John Stott?"

43
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,760
 It was a brief article,

44
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:39,680
 and yet it gave a wonderful picture of John,

45
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,560
 a remarkable overview of his work,

46
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,720
 but also of John Stott's character and influence.

47
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,480
 And all of this as a justification, Brooks said,

48
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,560
 for saying, "Surely this is the one

49
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,640
 "by whom the best of evangelicalism should be measured."

50
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,840
 It captured the faithfulness,

51
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,080
 the strong and careful theological, pastoral,

52
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,860
 cultural, and ethical mind and spirit of John.

53
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:11,040
 Obviously, John was not from the United States,

54
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,300
 so I am borrowing him tonight.

55
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,760
 But the evangelicalism that he represented and promoted

56
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,480
 is one of the strongest and most significant voices

57
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,480
 that has shaped a wide segment of US

58
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,320
 and, I dare say, global evangelicalism.

59
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:33,000
 John's primary authorship of not only many books,

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,520
 but of the Lausanne Covenant,

61
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,400
 was a witness to his distinctive character.

62
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,320
 Though born into a truly upper-class English home,

63
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,800
 the gospel in John's life shattered the hold

64
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:52,800
 of a colonialist vision or attitude into which he was born.

65
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:58,900
 He became a Christ-centered globalist and a profound friend.

66
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,880
 Having had the personal privilege of working for

67
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,240
 and with John Stott for over 30 years,

68
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,320
 I can witness to the fact that John's Christology

69
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,240
 was as lived as it was affirmed.

70
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,040
 In fact, he was a more authentic disciple

71
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,540
 the more deeply one came to know him.

72
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:24,760
 A second image I want you to hold in your mind

73
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,960
 is that of Franklin Graham, son of Billy Graham.

74
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,600
 While Franklin Graham's father was still alive

75
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,680
 and a direct private and public influence on Franklin,

76
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,360
 Franklin operated inside the character and narrative

77
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,120
 that had been established by his father,

78
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,120
 a US and global icon of American and white evangelicalism.

79
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:55,640
 Franklin Graham founded Samaritan's Purse,

80
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,640
 a Christian relief organization,

81
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,080
 which is an expression of Christian compassion,

82
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,440
 similar to the founding of other relief

83
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,240
 and development agencies, such as World Vision,

84
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,040
 Compassion International, and others.

85
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,760
 As Billy Graham's health declined

86
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,960
 and Billy withdrew from public life,

87
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,660
 Franklin's voice increased in different ways,

88
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:24,800
 and unfortunately, not least in its shrill volume and tone.

89
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,240
 By the time the Trump administration was in place

90
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,480
 in the United States White House,

91
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,660
 Franklin seemed to have become a true believer

92
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:39,340
 in the service that the Trump presidency might be

93
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,080
 to evangelical purposes,

94
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,040
 and Franklin piled on with all that he had.

95
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,940
 He made support of Trump a vehement

96
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,680
 and often spoken of cause,

97
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,200
 and explicitly equated support for Trump

98
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,640
 with being a faithful Christian,

99
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,980
 including Trump's America First policy.

100
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:09,200
 I lift up these two voices as contrasting exemplars

101
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:13,240
 of two very different American, in quotes,

102
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,280
 since John is not technically American,

103
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,240
 but American types of evangelicalism.

104
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,920
 John Stott and Franklin Graham share a common seedbed

105
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,820
 of faith and theology centered in Jesus Christ,

106
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:31,400
 and they defend largely common versions

107
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,200
 of a theology of the cross as the way of salvation.

108
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,160
 Dependency on the Bible as God's unique

109
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,480
 and authoritative word,

110
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:45,060
 and God's evangelistic mission in the world,

111
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,620
 as well as God's evidences of goodness

112
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:51,200
 through relief and development efforts,

113
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,080
 and the primacy of the church

114
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,020
 as God's instrument in the world.

115
00:06:55,020 --> 00:07:00,000
 However, they demonstrate quite different views

116
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,680
 of gospel and culture,

117
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,860
 and herein lies the subject that I want us to consider

118
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,360
 in this second lecture.

119
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,640
 Stott was an Anglican born into a family

120
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:17,640
 in which he was taken to Alsos Church in London

121
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,280
 week by week by his mother,

122
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,060
 while his father, who was an atheist and a surgeon,

123
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:26,820
 stayed at home a few blocks away.

124
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:30,960
 He lived in London his whole life.

125
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,640
 He was never married.

126
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:36,540
 He regularly engaged in private and in public

127
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,540
 with a very diverse array of people and opinions.

128
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:45,240
 By the grace of God and a lived Christology

129
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,880
 or incarnationalism,

130
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,800
 the gospel allowed him to break free

131
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,240
 from many of the strictures

132
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,820
 that might have held or kept him culturally bound.

133
00:07:55,820 --> 00:08:00,320
 It was centrally his Christology,

134
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:04,440
 his view of the radical reorienting reality of God

135
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,860
 embodied in human flesh,

136
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,720
 emphasizing, serving,

137
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,380
 empathizing rather, serving, healing,

138
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:17,440
 suffering, dying, and rising

139
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,120
 that transformed John's life and social location.

140
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:25,940
 His Christology moved him to live and move

141
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,680
 in a different way in the world.

142
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:34,180
 In fact, lived in a simple two-room apartment or flat

143
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,500
 doing ministry focused on study,

144
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,740
 writing, preaching, and travel.

145
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:44,660
 His Christology led him to listen.

146
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:50,480
 That in turn led him to hear and trust,

147
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,460
 understand and act on the perspectives

148
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:56,980
 of brothers and sisters in Christ throughout the world.

149
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:01,140
 When I recently spoke with Rene Padilla,

150
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,180
 one of the founders and leaders

151
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:06,640
 of Missio Integral in Columbia, South America,

152
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,340
 he said that what stood out about Stott

153
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:14,140
 among other Western white evangelical leaders

154
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:18,340
 was simply this, that he listened,

155
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:21,900
 that he wanted to know and understand us,

156
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,860
 not to control or use us.

157
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:31,660
 Despite Franklin Graham's exposure to the global church,

158
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,620
 despite his father's sympathies

159
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,180
 and growing understanding of a world

160
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:40,020
 beyond the small town in which they lived in North Carolina,

161
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:44,140
 despite the good work of the Samaritans purse

162
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:48,740
 around the world, I regrettably say that in my view,

163
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:53,580
 Franklin's life speaks most loudly of his social location,

164
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,040
 not his Christology.

165
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:01,480
 Candidly, and with my own self critique in this as well,

166
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,840
 Franklin sounds often much more like a white,

167
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,640
 Southern male, privileged person

168
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:14,440
 who lives and trusts in Christian language

169
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:18,120
 to justify and defend American exceptionalism

170
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,400
 and exclusivity.

171
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:24,700
 In other words, his Christology does not seem

172
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,820
 to have broken through and relocated him

173
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:31,560
 or redefined his life or his social location.

174
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:37,000
 Admitting I may see him wrongly, and I well could,

175
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,080
 my impression is that his Christology has never expanded

176
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:46,080
 his core perception of God or neighbor or self.

177
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:52,040
 His view of authority, of power, of pragmatism,

178
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:56,020
 and even of nationalism have not been recast

179
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:59,520
 by his Christology, but rather the reverse.

180
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:03,620
 He trusts deeply in American exceptionalism.

181
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:08,920
 No wonder when the Samaritan purse set up

182
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:13,400
 a coronavirus clinic in Central Park in New York City,

183
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,520
 it initially made a major issue over the fact

184
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,740
 that it would not be serving LGBT people.

185
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:26,840
 His politics impaired his compassion for suffering people.

186
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:32,020
 The Jesus who sat at table with sinners and tax collectors

187
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:35,860
 with the weak and needy seemed captive

188
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,980
 to Franklin's social ideology.

189
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:43,940
 The magnanimity of grace appears trumped.

190
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:48,360
 That is, it was overtaken by a Trumpian view of things.

191
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:55,820
 So my concern tonight is, or this morning on your end,

192
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:59,800
 is an observation and a conviction.

193
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:05,660
 It's this, that American white evangelicals tell ourselves

194
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,660
 that we are living our Christology.

195
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,460
 That is our public message.

196
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:14,300
 But the more likely truth is that we are often living

197
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:18,280
 our cultural location, not our Christology.

198
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,180
 Of course, we all know that the relationship

199
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,480
 between the gospel and culture

200
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,340
 is an historic Christian dilemma.

201
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,620
 As we know, God entered culture,

202
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:33,000
 and to make that affirmation is not simplistic,

203
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,540
 though its familiarity may suggest otherwise.

204
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:41,100
 Once God has entered human experience,

205
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,300
 though equal with God, he did not regard equality with God

206
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,820
 as something to be grasped, but emptied himself

207
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:51,660
 in finding himself in human form.

208
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:56,540
 He humbled himself and became obedient, even unto death.

209
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:59,020
 And therefore God highly exalted him

210
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:02,380
 and gave him the name that is above every name,

211
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:05,420
 that at the name of Jesus, every knee will bow

212
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:09,700
 and every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord

213
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,440
 to the glory of God the Father.

214
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:18,540
 In ways beyond the philosophical mind-body problem,

215
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:22,780
 we now ask through the lens of the incarnation itself

216
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:27,660
 what we have in order to face new kinds of mind-body,

217
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:32,660
 body-spirit, theology-culture, confession-action issues.

218
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:38,000
 This dilemma is not new, but the way it manifests itself

219
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,740
 in American white evangelicalism shows itself

220
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,900
 in particularly problematic ways.

221
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,860
 When taken at its surface,

222
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,540
 it has found a broad cultural acceptability,

223
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:54,020
 but beneath it exposes a problematic underbelly.

224
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:59,380
 Outside observers to white evangelicalism

225
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,500
 have seen this for some time,

226
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,220
 but let's delineate some of the unfortunate markers.

227
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:09,940
 A crisis first then of Christological knowing.

228
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:14,900
 American white evangelicalism is living out

229
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,900
 an inadequate even failed theological

230
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,080
 or Christological epistemology.

231
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:25,540
 What is claimed to be known seems to sit on the surface

232
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:28,480
 rather than penetrating our underlying

233
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,520
 and controlling social location.

234
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:34,620
 Consciously or otherwise, the Christ we know

235
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:38,260
 does not necessarily lead to a life that demonstrates

236
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:42,220
 the radical recreative work of being remade

237
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,560
 after the image of Jesus Christ himself.

238
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,660
 It feels more like a form of imitative knowledge

239
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,140
 than of penetrative knowledge.

240
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,180
 And when the absence of Christ-like fruit

241
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,980
 in places of pain and injustice

242
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:01,180
 seems so prominent and guarded,

243
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,540
 one has to ask if the Christ that they name

244
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:08,420
 is real and knowable enough for the real world.

245
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:12,380
 In other words, at the core of the crisis

246
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:16,140
 is an unacknowledged, unintegrated Christology

247
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,420
 in which the evangelical seems to sit

248
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,360
 on the surface of history,

249
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,260
 rather than being the penetrating and recreating

250
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:26,580
 of the human story itself.

251
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:29,020
 In some white evangelical spaces,

252
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:32,860
 faithful theology is verbal and dogmatic,

253
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:37,460
 but spiritually abstract rather than self-critical

254
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:40,200
 and convicting about social realities

255
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,500
 that lie outside the white, middle-class

256
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,340
 and male cultural box.

257
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:50,980
 The denial of racism and of white supremacy,

258
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:55,040
 the denial of the coronavirus and trust in science,

259
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:00,700
 the denial of the election recently in the United States

260
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,820
 and its outcome,

261
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:07,700
 all have millions of white evangelical supporters.

262
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,780
 Even in the second election,

263
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:13,700
 80% of evangelicals voted for President Trump.

264
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:17,980
 Tragically, when these denials are offered

265
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:21,500
 specifically as an expression of Christian faith,

266
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,660
 then the evangel itself appears to have less and less

267
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,420
 to do with reality,

268
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:31,020
 the world in which ordinary people live and work,

269
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,280
 suffer and play.

270
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,500
 In this circumstance,

271
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,760
 our Christology starts to appear as a fantasy

272
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,280
 rather than as knowledge.

273
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:45,220
 Does our Christology do the work of defining

274
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:49,420
 and reconstructing our personal and public lives,

275
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:52,380
 giving evidence that we are a reflection

276
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,640
 of what lies beyond our sociology?

277
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:59,860
 Is not this what living in but not of the world

278
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,260
 is actually meant to produce?

279
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:04,600
 And not just in piety,

280
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,620
 but in evidences in the public square.

281
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:11,780
 It seems by painful contrast

282
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,260
 that white evangelicalism does not really attend

283
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,580
 to being made new,

284
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:20,720
 but being internally and eternally safe.

285
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,800
 It doesn't intersect with our ordinary everyday world.

286
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,720
 So how has this come to be?

287
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,920
 I wanna say, suggest several reasons.

288
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,960
 Out of fear,

289
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:39,600
 a crisis of pursuing power

290
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,040
 is upon us more than pursuing wisdom.

291
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,600
 There are many manifestations

292
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,200
 of this white evangelical orientation

293
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,120
 that set the stage for how white evangelicals live

294
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:50,960
 and thrive.

295
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,520
 They are cultural,

296
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,600
 they are cultural premises,

297
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,640
 racially, economically, and culturally.

298
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,000
 They are like the elements that set the stage

299
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,760
 for the faith that they promote.

300
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,720
 There can be a variation in personality,

301
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,080
 but the main elements that I'm going to describe

302
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,960
 are fairly predictable, even necessary.

303
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,660
 And they show little penetration

304
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,640
 of a living reordering Christology.

305
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,640
 First, whiteness.

306
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,320
 As you are aware,

307
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,720
 the dominant culture of the US numerically and culturally

308
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,420
 is white and European.

309
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:35,040
 By dominant, I mean both the largest

310
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,860
 and the most influential.

311
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:40,400
 The population that holds the primary power roles

312
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,920
 and levers of cultural influence.

313
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:47,500
 This is fast changing in the United States.

314
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,600
 And by 2045,

315
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,000
 just 24 years from now,

316
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,700
 the US will no longer be white majority.

317
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,880
 The racial separation and division

318
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,580
 underneath the narrative of America as a melting pot

319
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,300
 is a secret in plain view.

320
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:11,120
 That is, we say that we are a melting pot,

321
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,800
 but anybody who has lived in the United States

322
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,240
 understands that frequently that is not true.

323
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,840
 We have proximate diversity.

324
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,640
 We are near one another,

325
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,600
 but not deep or intimate diversity.

326
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,120
 In fact, that is as true or more true

327
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,000
 of American evangelicalism

328
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 than it is of other institutions or groups of people.

329
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,500
 A lot of energy of white evangelicalism

330
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,500
 can be found in the Southern part of the United States.

331
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:44,760
 And its legacy of racial separation

332
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,720
 directly shows in the separation

333
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,240
 of white and black churches.

334
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,880
 Even now in newly planted

335
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,760
 and growing Southern congregations,

336
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,200
 they are still deeply racially divided.

337
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,480
 Churches established and maintained for white people,

338
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,500
 even those that often claim to be multiracial

339
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,380
 are still dominantly white.

340
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:11,360
 Let me give you an example

341
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,080
 of how this formed from early days

342
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,720
 and how sadly so much of this same description

343
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,520
 could be used even today.

344
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:25,960
 Some of you may know the name of Frederick Douglass.

345
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,800
 Frederick Douglass was an emancipated slave

346
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:34,760
 and one of the finest orators in American history,

347
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,520
 not just among African-Americans,

348
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,040
 but among all people that have lived

349
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,880
 and spoken in the United States.

350
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,720
 And what I'm about to read to you

351
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,040
 is something that he spoke on July 5th

352
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,800
 the day after American Independence Day, July 4th.

353
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,520
 He had been asked to speak

354
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,880
 and he said that he wouldn't be able to speak on the 4th,

355
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,320
 but that he would speak and address

356
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:05,160
 an almost entirely white audience on the 5th of July.

357
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,020
 And these are some of his words.

358
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:12,960
 What to the American slave is your 4th of July?

359
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,960
 And I answer, a day that reveals to him

360
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,640
 more than all other days in the year,

361
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,280
 the gross injustice and cruelty

362
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,400
 to which he is a constant victim.

363
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:30,720
 To him, your celebration is a sham,

364
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,120
 your boasted liberty and unholy license.

365
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:40,280
 Your national greatness, swelling vanity,

366
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:44,080
 your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless.

367
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:49,880
 Your denunciations of tyrants, brass-fringed impudence,

368
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:55,300
 your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery,

369
00:21:55,300 --> 00:22:01,500
 your prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings,

370
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,740
 with all your religious parade and solemnity

371
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:09,740
 are to the slave mere bombast, fraud,

372
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:15,300
 deception, impiety and hypocrisy,

373
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,580
 a thin veil to cover up the crimes

374
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:21,280
 which would disgrace a nation of savages.

375
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,280
 This is not a nation,

376
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:27,680
 there is not a nation on earth guilty of practices

377
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,020
 more shocking and bloody

378
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:34,020
 than are the people of the United States at this very hour.

379
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,500
 The structures and policies

380
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,660
 and even more the culture of whiteness

381
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:48,660
 that Frederick Douglass is describing in 1852

382
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,900
 are still so thick in the United States

383
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,020
 that what he says speaks far more loudly

384
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:58,100
 than the evidence of serious discipleship

385
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,580
 in which we become transformed

386
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:04,860
 as a part of one new humanity in Christ.

387
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:10,720
 The summer of 2020 and continuing on

388
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,360
 has been a renewed season of racial reckoning.

389
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:18,340
 The underbelly and anxiety of this

390
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:21,240
 has been the easy cover of whites

391
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,640
 complaining about violence against buildings,

392
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,580
 the riots with greater ferocity

393
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:31,320
 than complaints about the underlying violence every day

394
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,840
 against blacks and people of color.

395
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:38,680
 The increased racism expressed in these past months

396
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,520
 toward Latinos and Asians,

397
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,360
 as well as evidences the sense that they are the problem

398
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,680
 rather than the profound injustice

399
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,520
 against people made in the image of God

400
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,660
 through personal and institutional systemic racism.

401
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,960
 One of the historically

402
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:02,120
 predominant white evangelical denominations

403
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:06,300
 recently acted to condemn critical race theory.

404
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:10,400
 And they did so rather than to speak up

405
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,240
 and against the social realities

406
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:16,760
 that critical race theory attempts to expose.

407
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,320
 They were more concerned about the theory

408
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,680
 than about the reality.

409
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,440
 The assumption seems to focus

410
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,600
 on the apparatus of reflection on race

411
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,680
 rather than to face the gripping

412
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,760
 and present impact of racism.

413
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:34,080
 It is a Christology that sits atop

414
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:41,080
 what is rather than fundamentally reorders reality itself.

415
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,640
 I'd like to come back to this

416
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,000
 with questions in the Q&A time.

417
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,480
 Whiteness is one of the features

418
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,360
 that makes it possible

419
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,740
 for culture to dominate Christology.

420
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:59,720
 The second one is maleness.

421
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,760
 Also inextricably linked to being white

422
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,200
 and evangelical in America is typically being male.

423
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,960
 It's male voices that have dominated

424
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,360
 the American evangelical scene,

425
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,040
 partly through a rejection of women in leadership,

426
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,920
 not least women in church leadership,

427
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,400
 and especially against women preaching

428
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,700
 in the life of the church.

429
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:26,760
 Anyone who knows the life of the church around the world

430
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,120
 is more than aware of the pervasive

431
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,120
 life-giving ministry of women.

432
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:36,200
 CGST knows this, Fuller Seminary knows this.

433
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:40,160
 The church around the world sees and understands

434
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,440
 the impossible contribution,

435
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:46,000
 possibly large contributions of women.

436
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,040
 But for many reasons in evangelical churches,

437
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,400
 those in leadership are typically male

438
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:55,000
 and typically older male and typically white male.

439
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,160
 They're the ones that are thought as if by nature

440
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,820
 to be the ones in charge.

441
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:04,880
 The long established assumption excludes 50%

442
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,040
 of the body of Christ from leadership

443
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,240
 and fits a stereotype that I would argue

444
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,240
 is not biblical or Christological,

445
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,000
 but much more of an unformed,

446
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,040
 untransformed aspect of culture.

447
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,440
 White evangelicalism in the United States

448
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,240
 is predominantly male in its public manifestation

449
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,440
 and the events last week

450
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,840
 on the steps of the Capitol building in Washington, DC

451
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,640
 only further emphasize that very point,

452
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,140
 not least with signs that said, "Jesus saves."

453
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:41,360
 This shows itself to be out of touch

454
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,360
 with the world in which we live,

455
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,560
 not least the community gathered in worship.

456
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,400
 Where are the leading voices

457
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,040
 in American white evangelicalism?

458
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,960
 It's not as though there are no well-known women

459
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,680
 Bible teachers like Beth Moore, for example,

460
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,640
 but they are often not held in the same respect

461
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,640
 as institutional leaders or church planters

462
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,000
 or public policy advocates or theologians.

463
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,800
 They are primarily seen as "women's speakers"

464
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:17,400
 rather than voices that should lead change,

465
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,360
 should lead and change the church

466
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,840
 by a deeply penetrative Christology

467
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,600
 that rewrites our narratives,

468
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,880
 sets us free and resets our social location.

469
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,760
 As Beth Moore has spoken out more and more publicly,

470
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,080
 male voices have harshly criticized her

471
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:40,080
 and many of her adherents who are women have dropped away.

472
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,680
 What has been fascinating to watch

473
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,320
 is that at the same time,

474
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,520
 she's attracted a wider set of women,

475
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,600
 not so much from inside the white evangelical subculture

476
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,080
 who are hungering for a deep encounter

477
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,240
 and transformation with God

478
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,440
 that will affect their whole lives.

479
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,960
 It is her care with the scriptures,

480
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,640
 her honesty in their implications,

481
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,960
 her refreshing self-critique

482
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:10,680
 and her confidence in God's power rather than in her own.

483
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,920
 These are the charisms that I see

484
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,360
 as the fruit of the Spirit in her life

485
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,540
 and that the body of Christ needs.

486
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:25,040
 The next category, in addition to whiteness and maleness,

487
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:29,520
 is the way white American evangelicalism

488
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,280
 is bent on success.

489
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:34,480
 The fruitfulness of the church

490
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,600
 that tends to get the most attention

491
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:42,800
 in white evangelicalism is the growth, size, amounts,

492
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:46,760
 numbers that can be externally measured,

493
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,120
 considered success-oriented,

494
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,920
 and evaluated and rewarded because of that.

495
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,640
 This is reflective of a set

496
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,160
 of selective theological influences

497
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:02,160
 connected now to corporate or entertainment values.

498
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,040
 It does not show the fruit of the Spirit

499
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:07,400
 of an identification with a crucified Christ.

500
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,080
 It is not a narrative of laying down power,

501
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:15,000
 but a public success measured by benchmarks of influence

502
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,160
 with social or economic power.

503
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:21,440
 Being invited by the President of the United States

504
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,240
 to be one of his "evangelical advisors"

505
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,840
 is the height of this convergence

506
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,720
 and this crisis in the United States.

507
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:36,180
 The megachurch model symbolically distills these tendencies

508
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:40,300
 and maximizes efficiency and scale as a value.

509
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:45,440
 This all makes sense once you embrace and assume

510
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,040
 that church means standing inside

511
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,240
 this non-Christological paradigm.

512
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,880
 It's just the environment

513
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,520
 and not itself the focus of attention.

514
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,680
 It is the assumed basis for all that is done

515
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,680
 on top of that platform.

516
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,140
 It is like paint on a canvas,

517
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:05,500
 not evidence of a new creation.

518
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:09,000
 This does not mean, of course,

519
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,080
 that all good disappears or the truth is absent

520
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:16,480
 or that faithful servant does not occur in megachurches.

521
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,560
 Of course, that's not true.

522
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:22,740
 But all those things happen often to the side

523
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:27,740
 or on the back or on top of an industrial strength engine

524
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:31,440
 that is being driven by the growth machine,

525
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,700
 which is not itself a kingdom value.

526
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:39,040
 The multi-billion dollar evangelical industrial complex

527
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:42,480
 is driven by achieving statistical, financial,

528
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,440
 and production quality,

529
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:48,720
 and letting that show that keeps the audience coming back

530
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,400
 and it keeps that audience giving financially.

531
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:56,280
 They follow numbers, rankings, quality

532
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,960
 that drives the machine

533
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,960
 more than the evidence of true wisdom.

534
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:04,220
 The pandemic makes this inclination all the more evident.

535
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:07,500
 Preaching at such a church,

536
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,560
 I was once introduced as a preacher

537
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:13,520
 for a night of what they called star-studded worship.

538
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:19,220
 Imagine, star-studded worship.

539
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:23,580
 There is only one star in Christian worship.

540
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:29,080
 In light of these three prominent markers,

541
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:33,120
 white, male, and success,

542
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,840
 the result looks like white, male, success culture

543
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,500
 wrapping itself in biblical language,

544
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:44,880
 but not showing the Christological fruit

545
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,880
 by the spirit of love, mercy, kindness, justice, or more.

546
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:54,580
 At a time when the racial and gender landscape

547
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,280
 of the United States is rapidly changing

548
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,360
 and challenging the vestiges of white supremacy

549
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,740
 and of male dominance,

550
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:07,280
 white evangelicalism has become very nostalgic.

551
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,900
 No wonder so many have been taken with the notion

552
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,160
 of make America great again.

553
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,880
 It's a nostalgic phrase.

554
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:17,320
 That very slogan fails to reflect anything

555
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,480
 about the inherent character of the gospel,

556
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:24,500
 but instead of something quite different.

557
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,960
 It does not feed a picture of reconstituting

558
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,440
 and reordering our lives

559
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,840
 because of the gospel's transformation.

560
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:39,160
 Native American, black, Latino, and Asian stories

561
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:44,420
 are not truly heard and trusted in such churches

562
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,640
 as the ones I'm describing.

563
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,240
 Their narratives have to be quote,

564
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,160
 vetted by white male evangelical voices

565
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:55,460
 that claim a biblicism that is belied

566
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,860
 by their words and their actions.

567
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:01,180
 This is the whirlwind that brings the enterprise

568
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:04,340
 of white evangelicalism spiraling down

569
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:06,260
 in the culture wars of today.

570
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:10,620
 Even in today's press, so many different voices

571
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:13,740
 expressing the death of evangelicalism

572
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:17,100
 and potentially the death of the church in America.

573
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:20,040
 While these may be reactionary words at the moment,

574
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:24,300
 they do not fail to grasp the urgency and crisis

575
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,120
 that I actually think is upon us.

576
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:30,620
 White evangelicalism in America shows itself

577
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:33,580
 to have bankruptcy at its core,

578
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:37,600
 not just in its policy or presidential preferences.

579
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:43,820
 Back to John Stott and Franklin Graham.

580
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:48,260
 On a trip with John Stott that I took,

581
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:52,240
 primarily giving lectures in various Indian seminaries,

582
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,920
 we had a Sunday afternoon venture to go in search

583
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:59,340
 of the elderly mother of an Indian missionary

584
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,740
 currently serving in Vietnam

585
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:03,580
 at the time that this trip took place.

586
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:07,480
 He asked if John would go and find and call on his mother

587
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,580
 the next time he was in India.

588
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:12,040
 And John said he would do his best to do so.

589
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:16,600
 This was the afternoon for fulfilling that commitment.

590
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:21,000
 We had her name and a region in the city of Madras

591
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 where she lived, but we didn't know any further information.

592
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,080
 We had an Indian pastor with us.

593
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:34,080
 And with those tiny helps, we set off to try to find her.

594
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:38,520
 It took a few hours with no success

595
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,760
 and no confidence of success.

596
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:44,400
 We were literally wandering in the streets of Madras

597
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,800
 trying to find an elderly woman

598
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,060
 who lived in very, very poor conditions.

599
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:53,360
 There was no precise address.

600
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:56,840
 We just had her name and the area that she might live in.

601
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:01,120
 We were in that sense without human hope.

602
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:06,120
 And still by John's commitment to his friend, we persisted.

603
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:11,080
 Suddenly after several false hopes,

604
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,840
 we seem to have perhaps come up with a lead.

605
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,640
 A man unknown to us led us further and further

606
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,720
 into the borough layers of a particular neighborhood

607
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,560
 in India, in Madras,

608
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:27,400
 eventually into a common courtyard or two

609
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:31,760
 until finally and remarkably we had before us

610
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,280
 this sweet elderly woman,

611
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:37,520
 mother of the man who wrote to John from Vietnam.

612
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:41,080
 He described her as a dear lady

613
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:44,600
 who was losing her teeth one by one.

614
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,620
 Would John please go and see her?

615
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:53,120
 She immediately knelt before us and kissed John's feet

616
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:57,280
 and she asked immediately if he would preach for her

617
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,220
 and to her.

618
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:02,400
 After an honorific small rug was found

619
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,980
 and John was positioned on top of it,

620
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:08,700
 this simple woman knelt with her hands open

621
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,100
 to hear the word of God.

622
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:14,420
 The man who spoke to scholars and leaders

623
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:18,900
 all around the world and in Madras that day

624
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:24,940
 now offered in the clearest and most appropriate way,

625
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:28,100
 a compassionate and convicting sermon

626
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,740
 of God's love for the world,

627
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:34,800
 including for this woman's son and for she herself.

628
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,260
 He prayed for her.

629
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,860
 She kissed his feet again.

630
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:43,580
 The man who preached to tens,

631
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:46,820
 maybe hundreds of thousands was no different

632
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:49,620
 than the man who preached for the one person.

633
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:54,060
 This was not about power, but wisdom.

634
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:58,900
 Not about being male or white, but about being human.

635
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:03,620
 Not about being successful, but being a servant.

636
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:08,980
 Now, I want to believe that Franklin Graham

637
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:10,820
 would have such stories himself.

638
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:16,320
 But that is not what is at least publicly visible.

639
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,700
 Out of the same seedbed that they both shared

640
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:24,060
 of evangelical faith comes two very different manifestations.

641
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:28,780
 Yes, one comes from America and the other from Britain,

642
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:32,540
 but in a deeper sense, they come from

643
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:36,900
 different social locations and surrounding cultures,

644
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:40,060
 but they actually share quite similar Christologies.

645
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:42,940
 Their written statements of faith

646
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:45,180
 might be quite similar to one another,

647
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:49,940
 but the display of the implications of that Christology

648
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,380
 seems to be quite different.

649
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:57,740
 Both men are mature and complex.

650
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:01,420
 Both had complicated relationships

651
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:04,420
 with their highly public and influential fathers.

652
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:08,820
 Both were born into an ecosystem

653
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:11,220
 that was feeding them in particular ways.

654
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:14,460
 Both are more than entitled

655
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:17,420
 to their distinctive journeys of soul before God

656
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:20,500
 and before the audiences that in the call of God,

657
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:23,700
 they sought to live out as their vocation.

658
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:26,140
 Contrast between the two, however,

659
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:28,580
 does seem to tell a significant story.

660
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:33,500
 The gospel landed in John's life as a counterpoint

661
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:36,740
 to his wealthy and prominent medical family narrative.

662
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:40,780
 At an early stage during World War II,

663
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:44,540
 John's father was a highly prominent heart surgeon,

664
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:48,460
 and it was after his conversion as a young man

665
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:51,900
 that he declared himself a pacifist because of his faith.

666
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:57,740
 For two years during the war, living under the same roof,

667
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:59,860
 John's father did not talk with him.

668
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:04,340
 They eventually reconciled.

669
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:07,620
 John eventually was no longer a pacifist,

670
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:10,100
 and his life proceeded as someone

671
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,900
 who would have defended just war.

672
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:16,620
 He entered eventually the Anglican communion

673
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:20,140
 at a time when evangelicals were a very small

674
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,300
 and beleaguered minority.

675
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:25,580
 He had been converted at a school as a boy

676
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,220
 and then discipled by the influence

677
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:29,580
 of that evangelist for many years.

678
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:34,580
 This man's name was affectionately called Dash, John Nash,

679
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:41,500
 and he wrote to John as a school boy every week

680
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:45,700
 for five years to help nurture him as a disciple.

681
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:50,780
 Franklin was raised in the home

682
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:53,740
 of one of the world's most famous evangelicals,

683
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:56,380
 a person of deep character and passion for Christ

684
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:59,860
 and for the Bible and for its message of salvation hope.

685
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:05,780
 He worked very hard and did lead an exemplary life,

686
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:09,740
 private and public, primarily marked by personal piety.

687
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:13,980
 It was an evangel of individual salvation,

688
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:18,500
 internal deliverance, biblical dependency,

689
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:22,500
 church allegiance, evangelistic commitment and zeal.

690
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:26,860
 This is the gospel of the American Bible Belt.

691
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:30,660
 It is a gospel that taps into the cultural location,

692
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:34,140
 a religious strategy that names true things

693
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:37,700
 that are stripped of surrounding truth so profound

694
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:41,140
 that they lead to another kind of Jesus,

695
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:43,300
 or at least they are susceptible to that.

696
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:49,100
 God can and does use almost any kind of messenger.

697
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:51,780
 But the evangel it represents in my view,

698
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:55,780
 especially in this kind of white American evangelicalism

699
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,460
 that I'm describing,

700
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:02,140
 misrepresents so much that has become problematic,

701
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:04,860
 especially in recent years

702
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:07,860
 as it has become tied to President Trump

703
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:11,020
 and the repeated deflection of all the immoral

704
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:14,900
 and abuse theologies tied to the Trump administration.

705
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:21,020
 All this, Franklin has publicly affirmed again and again

706
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:24,660
 as a person who was God's anointed leader

707
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:25,900
 to the United States.

708
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:31,420
 This evangel is submerged

709
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:34,700
 in a culture of power and self-interest.

710
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:41,260
 What makes the story of John Stott especially remarkable

711
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:44,460
 is the way the evangel set him free

712
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,660
 from his cultural location.

713
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:50,460
 He began inside, deeply inside,

714
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:55,460
 a highly privileged, very economically wealthy family.

715
00:41:55,460 --> 00:42:00,620
 John leveraged the gifts of privilege,

716
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:03,140
 but he did so attuning himself as he grew

717
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,980
 and matured as a disciple

718
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,900
 to an entirely different vision of a kingdom

719
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:12,020
 that was not about empire, English or otherwise,

720
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:15,740
 and a normativity that was not about his own power,

721
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:19,060
 but was about trying to be evidence

722
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:23,380
 of the reflective power of Christ in vulnerability

723
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:25,460
 that was not about success,

724
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:29,300
 but about truth and obedience and servanthood.

725
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:36,020
 Gestures of kindness, cultural relocation

726
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:39,300
 shows up in a prominent way in the Lausanne Covenant.

727
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:42,860
 At the first Congress called jointly

728
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,860
 by Billy Graham and John Stott,

729
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:49,140
 when the voices and lives of non-Western Christian leaders

730
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:52,340
 were finally heard and trusted

731
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:54,860
 on an international evangelical stage

732
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:58,900
 in a way that one could argue had never happened before,

733
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:02,060
 the evangelical world changed by its adoption

734
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:05,980
 because it was the story of the evangel confronting culture

735
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:10,980
 and hearing voices that are not powerful, successful,

736
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:15,300
 mega, popular, or dominantly white or male.

737
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:20,300
 This is the fruit of a wise life centered in Christ,

738
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:24,500
 a Christology that trumps culture, not the other way around.

739
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:28,500
 So culture or Christology,

740
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:33,860
 Christians cannot and should not deny or reject culture.

741
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:36,260
 And we must not pretend

742
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:39,420
 that we are not shaped and compromised by it.

743
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:41,860
 What we must discover is how much more sway

744
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:45,340
 culture typically has than our Christology.

745
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:48,540
 It is not clear the American white evangelicals

746
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:51,500
 understand culture seriously enough.

747
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,180
 But what does seem clear

748
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:55,940
 is that they do not allow our Christology

749
00:43:55,940 --> 00:44:00,420
 to be transformative enough, self-critiquing enough

750
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:03,220
 of the water in which they swim.

751
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:05,260
 Without that deeper work,

752
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:09,180
 we are to speak and to show the evangel to the world

753
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:14,180
 it will fail the God that we claim to honor and to serve.

754
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:21,580
 Let me stop there and turn to our evening's respondents.

755
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:25,060
 - Thank you, Mark, for the inspiring lecture

756
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:27,180
 and to invite us to reflect on

757
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:29,620
 how should we allow our Christology

758
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:32,700
 to transform our culture and the way we live

759
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:36,380
 that's about truth, obedience, and servanthood.

760
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,620
 Now, two members of our faculty

761
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:43,420
 will give their responses to Dr. Labotin's lecture

762
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:47,980
 and the Q&A session will immediately follow the responses.

763
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:50,180
 Just a quick reminder again,

764
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:52,860
 if you have any questions or comments,

765
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:57,020
 you can post them on our website in the live streaming page.

766
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:59,020
 You can scroll down to the webpage

767
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:02,780
 and after the live streaming in Putonghua,

768
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:04,820
 there is a Q&A session

769
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:07,740
 where you can input your questions or comments

770
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:09,520
 after inputting your names.

771
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:14,620
 So let us now welcome our respondents.

772
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:18,900
 Dr. Celine Yun, Assistant Professor of Theological Study,

773
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:22,780
 and then later we'll have reference Dr. King Yip Lui,

774
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:26,240
 Heavenly Blessing Professor of Theological Study.

775
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,080
 So welcome.

776
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:30,820
 (audience members murmuring)

777
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:43,800
 - Thank you, Mark, for another inspiring lecture.

778
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:50,720
 I appreciate your remark that theological scholarship

779
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:57,160
 is personal narrative,

780
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:01,720
 so I guess I'll fill everyone in with my own history here.

781
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:07,440
 I grew up in a Christian home here in Hong Kong.

782
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,220
 I would describe myself as a conservative,

783
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:19,400
 ephedraical, if that means respecting

784
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:24,400
 the outmost authority of scripture

785
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:29,840
 and believing that the mission of the church

786
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:33,000
 is to convert people to Christ.

787
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,360
 My exposure has been as such

788
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:40,400
 until I found myself setting foot

789
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:45,400
 in Princeton Theological Seminary five years ago

790
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:50,520
 in New Jersey where I did my PhD in theology.

791
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:59,560
 New Jersey is a deeply democrat state,

792
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:06,960
 and that is to say as a conservative.

793
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,480
 I spent five years in a very

794
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,900
 (stammering)

795
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:14,480
 a very

796
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:20,980
 liberal place.

797
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:26,300
 I will spare you all with the details

798
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:31,300
 of my adventure in Princeton as a conservative woman,

799
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:36,360
 but for now I'll just say that while I agree with Mark

800
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:41,400
 that American evangelicals are in a crisis,

801
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:45,120
 I like to give them at least some credit.

802
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:51,160
 My experience at Princeton was that ironically,

803
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:56,320
 it is often the conservative evangelicals

804
00:47:56,320 --> 00:48:01,320
 who befriend international students

805
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:06,060
 and go out of their way to help us.

806
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:10,440
 I went to many churches near my area,

807
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:15,440
 and it was almost impossible to find a congregation

808
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:19,660
 that is multiracial.

809
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:25,700
 They are always either all white or all black or all Asians,

810
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:31,700
 but the only one church I came across

811
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:38,580
 that was truly multiracial with roughly 1/3

812
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:43,400
 of the congregation white, 1/3 black,

813
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:48,300
 and 1/3 Hispanic was in fact an

814
00:48:48,300 --> 00:49:01,660
 evangelical church led by a white couple.

815
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:06,660
 In these two lectures,

816
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:18,900
 I think Mark has highlighted a clear

817
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:21,660
 and present danger in the church

818
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:27,420
 that what we hold as Christian faith

819
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:31,480
 may in fact not be the true gospel.

820
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:37,280
 But only a reflection of our own ideology.

821
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:42,120
 In the words of

822
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:49,200
 Grand Louis Segundo,

823
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:55,440
 we are capable of deforming doctrine

824
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:02,820
 in order to protect our own interests.

825
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:11,100
 This warning also reminds me of Caleb Barthes' warning

826
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:14,820
 of happy little hyphens.

827
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:16,060
 The hyphens we

828
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:21,980
 intentionally or unintentionally

829
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:28,140
 put between the gospel and our own culture.

830
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:34,580
 Chinese Christians, for example,

831
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:36,460
 without very

832
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:42,140
 competitive culture

833
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:49,620
 tends to equate a good Christian kid

834
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:52,020
 with being hardworking.

835
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:56,780
 And achieving good academic results.

836
00:50:56,780 --> 00:51:05,480
 We like to listen to testimonies

837
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:10,180
 that highlight success as some form of divine

838
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:14,860
 blessing.

839
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,960
 Yet this reflect more

840
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:29,360
 a social location than the content of the gospel.

841
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:35,640
 While a lot of churches are active

842
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:43,260
 in social services in Hong Kong,

843
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:46,640
 a lot of the church leaders think the church

844
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:51,360
 should take on a quiet attitude

845
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,780
 towards politics.

846
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:56,800
 Even during the heated

847
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:01,320
 and anti-extradition protests

848
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:05,960
 since June 2019 that rocked the whole city.

849
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:10,560
 This attitude, however,

850
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:14,880
 coincides with that of a particular generation

851
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,100
 here in Hong Kong.

852
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,660
 Who, who, who, who,

853
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:26,260
 who treasure prosperity and stability.

854
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:32,420
 In,

855
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:39,500
 in today's lecture,

856
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:41,920
 (stuttering)

857
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:48,820
 Mark has offered an

858
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:49,820
 overwhelming

859
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:56,820
 contrast between two

860
00:52:56,820 --> 00:53:00,520
 evangelical figures.

861
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:09,300
 Both grew up in,

862
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:15,980
 in privileged families.

863
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:20,980
 But one managed to be free from his own culture and class.

864
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:27,580
 While the other seems to proclaim a gospel

865
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:29,660
 that only

866
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:35,300
 reflects his own

867
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:37,620
 (stuttering)

868
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:40,200
 social location.

869
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:45,460
 I think Mark has helped us,

870
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:50,020
 I think Mark has helpfully shown us

871
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:50,860
 how the two

872
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:55,860
 differ not so much in the content of their

873
00:53:55,860 --> 00:54:02,300
 Christology as in the integration of their faith.

874
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:06,980
 As a systematic theologian, I hope to,

875
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:14,140
 to reiterate a little bit more

876
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:16,940
 on, on, on what

877
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:21,320
 Christology amounts to.

878
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:24,100
 First,

879
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:31,060
 Christology attempts to speak of the unspeakable cross.

880
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:35,260
 The unspeakable horror of the cross

881
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:38,140
 on which God in the person of the son

882
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:40,300
 condemned all human sin.

883
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:47,340
 The cross precisely

884
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:51,380
 denounces the human status quo.

885
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:55,460
 I believe that we fail to understand the cross

886
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:57,420
 if we fail to understand

887
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:01,860
 this divine no.

888
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:02,700
 Or if we

889
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:07,320
 restrict it only to our personal lives

890
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:09,160
 or to spiritual matters

891
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:15,460
 instead of the whole human condition.

892
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:24,960
 One way of letting Christology

893
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:29,540
 reform our lives is to acknowledge that

894
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:33,360
 all that is taken for granted in our culture

895
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:36,380
 has to be transformed.

896
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:41,160
 And this first person pronoun is important.

897
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:48,080
 The cross does not only condemn our opponents

898
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,580
 but our ways as well.

899
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:51,760
 Second,

900
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:55,760
 Christology attempts to speak of the

901
00:55:56,840 --> 00:56:00,120
 humiliation and suffering of God

902
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:02,000
 in the person of the son.

903
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:09,740
 Jesus Christ identified with the poor

904
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:12,220
 and loved to surround himself with

905
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:15,620
 social outcasts and sinners.

906
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:19,040
 He was himself a refugee and a

907
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:24,100
 political criminal.

908
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:29,300
 I notice however that the Chinese churches

909
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:34,300
 love to preach the disciplinary and authoritative poor

910
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:37,580
 a lot more than the lowly and even

911
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:42,940
 politically sensitive Christ.

912
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:48,340
 And even with Christ, our culture makes us focus more

913
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:50,700
 on the victorious side of him.

914
00:56:55,360 --> 00:57:00,020
 Instead of the humble and compassionate side of him.

915
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:04,340
 One way of letting Christology reform our lives

916
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:09,340
 is to rediscover the Christ

917
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:11,940
 who is for the sinner.

918
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:16,180
 In some I've learned that

919
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:22,000
 that Christology is not only asking a who question

920
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,080
 as in who is Christ

921
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:29,080
 but equally a whom question.

922
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:33,420
 For whom is Christ proclaimed?

923
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:34,540
 We have to ask

924
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:40,880
 does the Christology we proclaim

925
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:44,340
 only serve the interest of a certain group?

926
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:52,100
 Thank you again Mark for your lecture.

927
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,940
 (footsteps)

928
00:57:54,940 --> 00:58:06,440
 - Well thank you Mark for your two illuminating lectures.

929
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:09,360
 I'm so glad I can hear this reflection

930
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:12,000
 from a KOL or key opinion leader

931
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,780
 of American evangelicalism.

932
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:19,600
 Since Mark begins his lectures with some personal story

933
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:22,840
 I would do the same to let Mark and others

934
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:25,160
 understand where I come from.

935
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:29,000
 I went to a conservative reformed theological seminary

936
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:32,000
 Westminster Theological Seminary Philadelphia

937
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,860
 for my MDiv degree.

938
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:37,260
 To broaden my theological perspectives

939
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:40,140
 I took classes in Princeton Seminary

940
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:43,100
 and in Union Seminary New York.

941
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:48,060
 And I almost went to a fuller for my PhD studies

942
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:49,460
 but that's another story.

943
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:53,220
 I still identify myself as a child

944
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:55,940
 of American evangelicalism.

945
00:58:55,940 --> 00:59:00,620
 I wrote my doctoral dissertation on Jonathan Edwards.

946
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:04,740
 And I have taught on American fundamentalisms

947
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:08,340
 and evangelicalism here in CGST.

948
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:11,340
 So thank you Mark for speaking on a topic

949
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:12,960
 that is dear to me.

950
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:19,020
 I concur with Mark that American white evangelicalism

951
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:23,220
 is very sick today or at least parts of it.

952
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:27,060
 And we need to pray for God's mercy upon his church.

953
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:30,900
 President Trump has somehow managed

954
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:34,140
 to bring out some of the worst characteristics

955
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:35,680
 of evangelicalism.

956
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:41,580
 Yes I understand why some Christians would vote for Trump

957
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:43,500
 in the recent election.

958
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:47,740
 But when some of my Christian friends denounce

959
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:52,740
 the New York Times as a tabloid from the radical left

960
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:56,900
 while they totally ignore the many unfounded claims

961
00:59:56,900 --> 01:00:00,600
 that Trump has told, I'm troubled.

962
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:03,940
 Yes I don't want school children to have the freedom

963
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:06,380
 to declare their own sex.

964
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:10,460
 And I don't believe that it is a violation of human right

965
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:14,380
 to differentiate between a naturally born woman

966
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:16,840
 and a transgender woman.

967
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:21,840
 However I'm also appalled by the gun violence in America

968
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:26,200
 and the abject poverty of the city ghettos

969
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:28,640
 among all the riches in America.

970
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:34,540
 Why does the church make the LGBTQ movement

971
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:38,300
 into an apocalyptic calamity

972
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:42,000
 while ignoring the sufferings of the black community?

973
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,660
 Yes I believe in the authority of the Bible.

974
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:50,560
 Yet when someone quotes Genesis 2

975
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:54,420
 and then claims that there is a divine given right

976
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:58,640
 of breathing and this right means that the government

977
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:03,640
 cannot ask people to wear a mask even in a pandemic.

978
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:07,600
 I feel baffled by such theological reasoning.

979
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:13,520
 Why does culture trump Christology, pun intended,

980
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:16,920
 in white evangelicalism?

981
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:20,000
 I would like to suggest a few reasons.

982
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,000
 Perhaps speaking with the prejudice

983
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,020
 of a church historian which I am.

984
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:30,760
 White evangelicalism buys into the mythology

985
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:35,760
 of a once golden era of American Christianity.

986
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:39,080
 I.e. it's a question about eschatology.

987
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:42,720
 What is our theology of eschatology?

988
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:45,320
 In my years in Westminster,

989
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:49,840
 the Puritans are exhorted as model Christians

990
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:53,880
 and Machen and Van Thiel which they are founders

991
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:56,760
 of my seminary, are the bugwack

992
01:01:56,760 --> 01:02:00,020
 against anti-Christian modernism.

993
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:02,840
 While these people are heroes of faith to me

994
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:05,480
 in their own ways, they did not address

995
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:08,480
 the burning issues of our days.

996
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:10,680
 Sometimes they even choose to ignore

997
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:13,840
 the burning issues of their time.

998
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:16,400
 For example, the civil rights movement

999
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:19,100
 is invisible in Van Thiel's writing.

1000
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:25,000
 John Murray defends slavery as not being per se evil

1001
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,880
 in his book on biblical ethics.

1002
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:31,400
 The book is called Principles of Conduct

1003
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:34,960
 which was written in 1957 and was still used

1004
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:38,500
 as a textbook when I studied there at Westminster in 1992.

1005
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:44,440
 And Trump's slogan, "Make America Great Again,"

1006
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:47,840
 again, notice the words, suggests that

1007
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:52,840
 the once golden era of America is now ruined

1008
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:56,760
 by immigrants, by the liberals, by the radical left,

1009
01:02:56,760 --> 01:03:00,820
 by the Chinese government, or by unpatriotic Americans.

1010
01:03:01,660 --> 01:03:05,980
 According to Trump or white evangelicalism,

1011
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:10,860
 we need to build endless wars, both physical wars

1012
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:15,380
 and psychological wars, to reign in these evil forces.

1013
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:19,820
 Mark has told us how the white church

1014
01:03:19,820 --> 01:03:23,240
 has failed African people in the past

1015
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:25,640
 and even in the present.

1016
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:29,380
 White evangelicals need to read their past

1017
01:03:29,380 --> 01:03:34,380
 with a critical spirit, without an unhealthy nostalgia

1018
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:40,380
 or an unhealthy sense of the superiority of the past.

1019
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:43,220
 But we need to understand that

1020
01:03:43,220 --> 01:03:47,440
 the golden Christian America never exists.

1021
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:53,580
 With a rereading of the past, we can then be open

1022
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:56,460
 to a more flexible future.

1023
01:03:56,460 --> 01:04:00,820
 Yes, white Anglo-Saxon Protestant, or WAPF,

1024
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:05,220
 is no longer the dominant cultural force in America,

1025
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:08,700
 but that does not mean that America

1026
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:13,040
 is on a slippery slope to Satan's kingdom.

1027
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:18,040
 White evangelicals need to see that God has not left America

1028
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:22,140
 and will never leave America,

1029
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:24,500
 not even with a Biden presidency.

1030
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:29,180
 If we Christians can give thanks

1031
01:04:29,180 --> 01:04:31,620
 for the heritage of the Puritans,

1032
01:04:31,620 --> 01:04:35,300
 we can also give thanks for Martin Luther King,

1033
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:38,020
 for the concern for ecology,

1034
01:04:38,020 --> 01:04:41,100
 or for the push towards diversity in government

1035
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:42,620
 and in the corporate world.

1036
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:48,080
 America will not go back to a nostalgic past,

1037
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:49,940
 and it should not.

1038
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:54,200
 Sure, not all social changes in America are good,

1039
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:57,500
 but evangelicals should have the confidence

1040
01:04:57,500 --> 01:05:01,620
 that God is still working today in America.

1041
01:05:01,620 --> 01:05:06,260
 In many ways, white evangelicals have bought

1042
01:05:06,260 --> 01:05:09,540
 into a lot of secular values,

1043
01:05:09,540 --> 01:05:14,040
 even as they claim to be upholding biblical values only.

1044
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:18,980
 Mark will discuss some of these values in the next lecture.

1045
01:05:18,980 --> 01:05:23,140
 Here, I will just single out one particular example,

1046
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:25,920
 the postmodern hermeneutics of suspicion.

1047
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:29,940
 According to postmodernism,

1048
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:33,580
 the society is fragmented into many subgroups

1049
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:35,520
 and subcultures.

1050
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:40,000
 Postmodernism has lost faith in objectivity

1051
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,940
 or procedural justice.

1052
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:46,540
 All truth claims are power grabs,

1053
01:05:46,540 --> 01:05:49,720
 and we need to unnerve conspiracies

1054
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:52,940
 and hypocrisies all the time.

1055
01:05:52,940 --> 01:05:55,260
 We need to fight at all costs,

1056
01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:58,260
 including demonization of opponents

1057
01:05:58,260 --> 01:06:02,900
 or disinformation campaign to maintain our own turf.

1058
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:07,900
 We see a lot of this postmodern behavior recently

1059
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:10,780
 in the white evangelical church.

1060
01:06:10,780 --> 01:06:14,100
 For example, a lot of medically sound

1061
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:18,220
 pandemic control policies are perceived as tactics

1062
01:06:18,220 --> 01:06:22,380
 by the liberals to control religious liberty.

1063
01:06:22,380 --> 01:06:26,500
 Talks of diversity are automatically classified

1064
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:29,100
 as LGBTQ ideology.

1065
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:33,580
 Key opinion leaders who dare to build bridges

1066
01:06:33,580 --> 01:06:37,660
 with non-evangelicals, such as Tim Keller,

1067
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:42,180
 are sometimes vilified as giving up their orthodox faith.

1068
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:48,260
 Jesus dined with tax collectors and with the Pharisees.

1069
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:52,700
 As Mark has said, the church needs to reflect

1070
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:56,300
 more on incarnation Christology

1071
01:06:56,300 --> 01:07:00,820
 in order to overcome such agonistic mentality,

1072
01:07:00,820 --> 01:07:04,220
 you know, that everyone else who disagree with us,

1073
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:06,420
 they are our enemies, you know.

1074
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:12,100
 Lastly, white evangelicalism needs to evaluate

1075
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:14,660
 their own beneath critically.

1076
01:07:14,660 --> 01:07:18,020
 There is no pure Christian faith

1077
01:07:18,020 --> 01:07:21,780
 devoid of all cultural bias,

1078
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:25,740
 i.e. in their search for a so-called pure Christian faith,

1079
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:30,740
 actually they turn a blind eye to their own cultural bias.

1080
01:07:30,740 --> 01:07:34,900
 All theology are in some way culturally biased,

1081
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:36,500
 for we are but humans.

1082
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:41,580
 We can try to be aware of our own bias as much as possible

1083
01:07:41,580 --> 01:07:46,540
 by studying the history of evangelicalism critically

1084
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:49,580
 and by listening to how others,

1085
01:07:49,580 --> 01:07:51,380
 including others' ethnic groups,

1086
01:07:51,380 --> 01:07:53,580
 other Christian traditions,

1087
01:07:53,580 --> 01:07:56,580
 even social scientists or people of other faith,

1088
01:07:56,580 --> 01:08:01,380
 we evangelicals can perceive,

1089
01:08:01,380 --> 01:08:05,020
 can have a better perception of the pressing evils of today.

1090
01:08:05,020 --> 01:08:08,580
 And then perhaps evangelicals can now

1091
01:08:08,580 --> 01:08:12,700
 and can then work with others to make America

1092
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:17,460
 and even the world a better place to live for all peoples.

1093
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:18,740
 Thank you.

1094
01:08:18,740 --> 01:08:19,580
 - Thank you.

1095
01:08:19,580 --> 01:08:24,740
 Thank you both very much.

1096
01:08:24,740 --> 01:08:41,220
 - Thank you, Kin, and thank you, Celine, for your responses.

1097
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:43,780
 So now we are in our Q&A session.

1098
01:08:43,780 --> 01:08:46,460
 We have about 45 minutes.

1099
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:48,940
 We have been receiving some questions already

1100
01:08:48,940 --> 01:08:51,100
 on the internet, but for those of you

1101
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:54,300
 who have any questions or comments

1102
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:58,820
 regarding Dr. Laputin's lecture or for the response then,

1103
01:08:58,820 --> 01:09:00,660
 you're welcome to post your question

1104
01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:02,900
 on our live streaming page.

1105
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:04,940
 You can scroll down at the end of the page

1106
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:06,580
 and you will see a Q&A session

1107
01:09:06,580 --> 01:09:09,520
 where you can enter your questions and also your name.

1108
01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:15,660
 So let me read the question we have already.

1109
01:09:15,660 --> 01:09:20,780
 So Dr. Laputin, maybe you can respond to this question.

1110
01:09:20,780 --> 01:09:24,860
 So this audience appreciate very much

1111
01:09:24,860 --> 01:09:29,860
 about your critiques of the American white evangelical church

1112
01:09:29,860 --> 01:09:32,820
 which understand her identity more in social

1113
01:09:32,820 --> 01:09:36,980
 and cultural terms rather than through a Christological lens.

1114
01:09:36,980 --> 01:09:39,140
 And to risk oversimplification,

1115
01:09:39,140 --> 01:09:43,100
 I want to see how a true understanding of Christology

1116
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:46,660
 will help faith communities which are not in power

1117
01:09:46,660 --> 01:09:49,940
 but subdued, not perpetrator of oppression,

1118
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:54,780
 but oppressed to gain a transformed vision of the identity.

1119
01:09:54,780 --> 01:09:57,020
 Maybe, Mark, you can speak a little bit

1120
01:09:57,020 --> 01:09:59,980
 and then respondents, you're welcome to jump in.

1121
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:04,220
 - I want to be sure that I'm understanding.

1122
01:10:04,220 --> 01:10:07,820
 So the question is, how does a Christology

1123
01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:11,100
 influence the experience and perceptions

1124
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:12,940
 of people who are without power,

1125
01:10:12,940 --> 01:10:14,580
 not just people who have power?

1126
01:10:14,580 --> 01:10:17,060
 - Right, so how can a true Christology

1127
01:10:17,060 --> 01:10:20,900
 can help us to have a more transformed identity

1128
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:23,300
 of our Christian identity?

1129
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:24,860
 - Right.

1130
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:28,500
 Well, let me use the example that I did earlier

1131
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:35,020
 about the influence of the gospel

1132
01:10:35,020 --> 01:10:37,420
 in slave culture, for example.

1133
01:10:37,420 --> 01:10:41,500
 So often, if you go to the Museum of African American

1134
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:43,300
 Studies in the United States,

1135
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:47,340
 what you'll find is that this museum has what were called,

1136
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:50,140
 quote, slave Bibles.

1137
01:10:50,140 --> 01:10:54,620
 And the slave Bibles had sections of the biblical text

1138
01:10:54,620 --> 01:10:59,620
 cut out that would have given power and value and dignity

1139
01:10:59,620 --> 01:11:03,540
 to people who were without power,

1140
01:11:03,540 --> 01:11:06,220
 namely to the slaves themselves.

1141
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:09,500
 And the slave masters didn't want the whole Bible

1142
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:12,900
 to be handed out to people who are learning to read.

1143
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:15,900
 They wanted them to only have parts of the text

1144
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:18,060
 in order to subjugate them.

1145
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:20,580
 What of course happens is that over time,

1146
01:11:20,580 --> 01:11:23,780
 they are readers of the whole Bible.

1147
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:26,180
 And part of the planting, the deep planting

1148
01:11:26,180 --> 01:11:31,060
 of Christian faith among slaves in the United States,

1149
01:11:31,060 --> 01:11:34,180
 and still to this day among African Americans,

1150
01:11:34,180 --> 01:11:39,180
 is that the Bible itself is a book of social transformation.

1151
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:42,820
 And though they may be devalued by culture,

1152
01:11:42,820 --> 01:11:46,820
 they may be misrepresented in government and in business.

1153
01:11:46,820 --> 01:11:50,420
 They may be poor and marginalized culturally.

1154
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:54,540
 They are given value and dignity and worth

1155
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:59,460
 because of the way that the Bible reveals to them

1156
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:03,500
 the character and meaning of their lives.

1157
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:07,140
 Now, this experience of course is evident around the world.

1158
01:12:07,140 --> 01:12:09,500
 We can probably all give examples

1159
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:11,220
 of the way this has occurred.

1160
01:12:11,220 --> 01:12:14,580
 But I think it is in part letting the Bible

1161
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:18,620
 have its own full voice and not be heard

1162
01:12:18,620 --> 01:12:21,700
 only through the lens of a dominant interpreter,

1163
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:25,180
 whether white and male and American

1164
01:12:25,180 --> 01:12:27,700
 or some other kind of dominant expression

1165
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:30,220
 of biblical authority.

1166
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:33,380
 So I think that's one key.

1167
01:12:33,380 --> 01:12:35,780
 I think another key is meant to be,

1168
01:12:35,780 --> 01:12:38,660
 and often isn't for the reasons I've tried to give,

1169
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:41,540
 one of the ways that it's meant to be experienced

1170
01:12:41,540 --> 01:12:45,260
 and discovered is through the church itself,

1171
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:49,020
 a communion of unlike people who come to know

1172
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:52,300
 and love one another because Jesus Christ alone

1173
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:55,340
 breaks down the dividing walls of hostility

1174
01:12:55,340 --> 01:12:58,260
 and welcomes the rich and the poor,

1175
01:12:58,260 --> 01:13:03,020
 the white, the black, the Asian, the Latino,

1176
01:13:03,020 --> 01:13:05,020
 that welcomes people who are educated

1177
01:13:05,020 --> 01:13:06,260
 and people who have no education,

1178
01:13:06,260 --> 01:13:07,780
 people who are public sinners

1179
01:13:07,780 --> 01:13:12,380
 and people who are private sinners or both, et cetera.

1180
01:13:12,380 --> 01:13:16,580
 And in that unexpected communion,

1181
01:13:16,580 --> 01:13:19,540
 we wake up to our deeper identity,

1182
01:13:19,540 --> 01:13:22,980
 which is not the social status into which we were born

1183
01:13:22,980 --> 01:13:24,860
 or that we've supposedly earned

1184
01:13:24,860 --> 01:13:27,820
 and fought our way into achieving,

1185
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:31,780
 but instead into a gift that only God's grace can create

1186
01:13:31,780 --> 01:13:34,820
 called the body of Christ.

1187
01:13:34,820 --> 01:13:37,940
 So the tragedy of all the divisions

1188
01:13:37,940 --> 01:13:41,300
 within the body of Christ is not only a wound against God

1189
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:44,500
 and a wound against Jesus who gave his life

1190
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:49,180
 for a new communion, but then a failure for people,

1191
01:13:49,180 --> 01:13:52,180
 wherever they might be on the social spectrum,

1192
01:13:52,180 --> 01:13:55,580
 to rediscover their identity through the Bible

1193
01:13:55,580 --> 01:14:00,580
 and by the embodiment of its teaching in the church itself.

1194
01:14:00,580 --> 01:14:03,740
 So when all of that is broken, the Bible is dismissed,

1195
01:14:03,740 --> 01:14:05,780
 let's say, or it's put to the uses

1196
01:14:05,780 --> 01:14:09,540
 of only some ranks in social hierarchy

1197
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:13,340
 and used against other ranks in social hierarchy,

1198
01:14:13,340 --> 01:14:16,820
 then in fact, it is literally a dismemberment

1199
01:14:16,820 --> 01:14:21,020
 of the body that Jesus Christ died to save

1200
01:14:21,020 --> 01:14:26,020
 and aches and longs and weeps to make one new humanity.

1201
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:28,980
 So I think I'll stop there

1202
01:14:28,980 --> 01:14:31,580
 just as an introductory set of comments.

1203
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:35,820
 - So allowing the Bible to speak the full voice

1204
01:14:35,820 --> 01:14:38,220
 and also through the church community,

1205
01:14:38,220 --> 01:14:41,580
 we can embody what the Bible says.

1206
01:14:41,580 --> 01:14:45,060
 - Right, and yet we know, I think, around the world

1207
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:46,980
 that typically the churches reflect

1208
01:14:46,980 --> 01:14:50,020
 certain social categories and racial categories

1209
01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:54,900
 and gender types and a social expression,

1210
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:58,020
 which does not embody the whole gospel.

1211
01:14:58,020 --> 01:14:59,500
 And often we're not committed to that

1212
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:01,180
 even as a hope or a goal.

1213
01:15:01,180 --> 01:15:03,460
 - Thank you.

1214
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:06,940
 - I just add two more remarks.

1215
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:09,460
 I think sometimes when we read the Bible,

1216
01:15:09,460 --> 01:15:11,580
 we tend to take the Bible's message

1217
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:14,180
 out of the social context.

1218
01:15:14,180 --> 01:15:17,980
 For example, we say Jesus is apolitical,

1219
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:22,140
 but actually if you read Jesus' criticism of the Pharisees,

1220
01:15:22,140 --> 01:15:24,860
 it's a very political move.

1221
01:15:24,860 --> 01:15:27,820
 The other remark I will add is

1222
01:15:27,820 --> 01:15:32,780
 we need to read Christology written by different people.

1223
01:15:32,780 --> 01:15:35,540
 For example, when I was in America,

1224
01:15:35,540 --> 01:15:38,060
 I took a course from James Cone,

1225
01:15:38,060 --> 01:15:40,940
 a back theologian on back theology.

1226
01:15:40,940 --> 01:15:41,940
 Now at the end of the day,

1227
01:15:41,940 --> 01:15:43,540
 I don't, there are a lot of things

1228
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:45,300
 I don't agree with James Cone.

1229
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:46,340
 But on the other hand,

1230
01:15:46,340 --> 01:15:48,900
 that course was just an eye opener for me.

1231
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:50,940
 I mean, I see things in the Bible

1232
01:15:50,940 --> 01:15:54,740
 that I would never see if I stay just in Westminster.

1233
01:15:54,740 --> 01:15:58,260
 So we need to listen to people who speak

1234
01:15:58,260 --> 01:16:00,940
 from different backgrounds, different ethnic groups,

1235
01:16:00,940 --> 01:16:03,620
 to just to see how things,

1236
01:16:03,620 --> 01:16:06,580
 how different people can see things quite differently

1237
01:16:06,580 --> 01:16:07,540
 from the Bible.

1238
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:09,420
 - Right.

1239
01:16:09,420 --> 01:16:16,460
 - So we have another two questions

1240
01:16:16,460 --> 01:16:18,540
 that are related to the relationship

1241
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:21,020
 between the church and the government.

1242
01:16:21,020 --> 01:16:22,620
 So I'm just gonna read both of them

1243
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:25,060
 and then maybe you can answer them together.

1244
01:16:25,060 --> 01:16:30,340
 So evangelicals and Republicans go hand in hand.

1245
01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:32,420
 The relationship is very deep.

1246
01:16:32,420 --> 01:16:36,100
 Is it possible for evangelical to take a neutral position

1247
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:39,260
 to both parties in the near future?

1248
01:16:39,260 --> 01:16:40,980
 And another related question,

1249
01:16:40,980 --> 01:16:46,180
 people like Jerry Falwell and other famous pastor

1250
01:16:46,180 --> 01:16:49,700
 and powerful evangelicals use their position

1251
01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:53,100
 to influence presidents and lawmakers

1252
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:55,220
 to advance their causes.

1253
01:16:55,220 --> 01:16:58,620
 A lot of people, especially non-Christians, resent this.

1254
01:16:58,620 --> 01:17:00,340
 What is your opinion?

1255
01:17:00,340 --> 01:17:02,780
 That's a quote from the question online.

1256
01:17:02,780 --> 01:17:07,300
 So Mark, do you have any response to those questions?

1257
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:11,140
 - They're both very good questions.

1258
01:17:11,140 --> 01:17:13,540
 Can you read the end of the first question again?

1259
01:17:13,540 --> 01:17:14,380
 - Sure.

1260
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:16,420
 Is it possible for the evangelical

1261
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:21,460
 to take a neutral position to both parties in the near future?

1262
01:17:21,460 --> 01:17:23,060
 - Right.

1263
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:26,820
 Republicanism has been taken to be socially consortia

1264
01:17:26,820 --> 01:17:29,180
 as a party.

1265
01:17:29,180 --> 01:17:34,380
 And Democrats have been taken to be social progressives.

1266
01:17:34,380 --> 01:17:38,540
 That question is, does one or the other belong

1267
01:17:38,540 --> 01:17:40,860
 to the church as an identity?

1268
01:17:40,860 --> 01:17:44,380
 And I would say, no, not as an identity.

1269
01:17:45,420 --> 01:17:46,980
 There are things about the gospel

1270
01:17:46,980 --> 01:17:48,620
 which are socially conservative,

1271
01:17:48,620 --> 01:17:50,540
 and there are other things about the gospel

1272
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:53,140
 which are socially progressive.

1273
01:17:53,140 --> 01:17:56,220
 And the thought of a church or a church leader

1274
01:17:56,220 --> 01:17:58,820
 being identified with a single party

1275
01:17:58,820 --> 01:18:01,780
 seems by definition, from my point of view,

1276
01:18:01,780 --> 01:18:04,860
 to be enormously problematic

1277
01:18:04,860 --> 01:18:06,900
 because it suggests that the gospel

1278
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:09,340
 then that you're preaching is being filtered

1279
01:18:09,340 --> 01:18:12,220
 through one political sectarian lens

1280
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:14,700
 rather than actually accountable to something

1281
01:18:14,700 --> 01:18:16,340
 that's much richer.

1282
01:18:16,340 --> 01:18:19,540
 For one thing, the gospel is itself not binary.

1283
01:18:19,540 --> 01:18:22,940
 That is, it's not a choice simply between one and the other

1284
01:18:22,940 --> 01:18:25,060
 as though there's only two options.

1285
01:18:25,060 --> 01:18:28,700
 We're talking about the God who holds all things together,

1286
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:31,100
 the God who is the Lord over all,

1287
01:18:31,100 --> 01:18:34,780
 the firstborn of creation and the firstborn from the dead.

1288
01:18:34,780 --> 01:18:36,860
 That's the God that we're worshiping.

1289
01:18:36,860 --> 01:18:41,180
 So the idea somehow of thinking that our Christology

1290
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:44,860
 could be reduced to allegiance to one political party

1291
01:18:44,860 --> 01:18:46,860
 seems like pure folly to me.

1292
01:18:46,860 --> 01:18:52,180
 I think there are ways that I'm personally democratic

1293
01:18:52,180 --> 01:18:54,860
 and there's ways that I'm personally a Republican,

1294
01:18:54,860 --> 01:18:56,900
 but I don't really care about those labels.

1295
01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:59,580
 They do not hold any intrinsic value

1296
01:18:59,580 --> 01:19:00,940
 or particular meaning to me.

1297
01:19:00,940 --> 01:19:03,940
 They're reference points in social conversation,

1298
01:19:03,940 --> 01:19:06,260
 but they are not reference points

1299
01:19:06,260 --> 01:19:11,260
 in my own theological or political philosophy or actions.

1300
01:19:11,260 --> 01:19:14,620
 So I don't think there is such a thing

1301
01:19:14,620 --> 01:19:15,860
 as a neutral position,

1302
01:19:15,860 --> 01:19:18,260
 nor do I think there should be a neutral position.

1303
01:19:18,260 --> 01:19:20,380
 I'm not arguing for a neutral position.

1304
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:24,420
 What I'm arguing for is a deeply vested position

1305
01:19:24,420 --> 01:19:28,900
 in a whole gospel for all people

1306
01:19:28,900 --> 01:19:33,900
 and a gospel that speaks at the most profound levels

1307
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:38,340
 internally, but also at the most public levels as well.

1308
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:40,180
 That's not a neutral position.

1309
01:19:40,180 --> 01:19:43,380
 It's not a way of quote, staying out of politics.

1310
01:19:43,380 --> 01:19:46,780
 I don't think a Christian should stay out of politics.

1311
01:19:46,780 --> 01:19:49,100
 If you mean politics by politics,

1312
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:53,340
 sectarian politics divided along party lines,

1313
01:19:53,340 --> 01:19:55,220
 that's a different conversation.

1314
01:19:55,220 --> 01:19:58,380
 But if you mean it's possible for a Christian leader

1315
01:19:58,380 --> 01:20:02,940
 to stay neutral about the uses of power

1316
01:20:02,940 --> 01:20:05,140
 in the culture that we're a part of,

1317
01:20:05,140 --> 01:20:08,540
 I don't see how a Christian who calls Jesus Lord

1318
01:20:08,540 --> 01:20:10,100
 can remain neutral about that.

1319
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:14,540
 If I'm seeking to follow Jesus as Lord,

1320
01:20:14,540 --> 01:20:16,500
 it reorders all power.

1321
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:18,540
 It calls my power in question.

1322
01:20:18,540 --> 01:20:21,100
 It calls any other person's power in question.

1323
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:24,380
 It talks about how to rightly order power

1324
01:20:24,380 --> 01:20:26,780
 in a way that reflects the goodness and justice

1325
01:20:26,780 --> 01:20:28,980
 and truth of God.

1326
01:20:28,980 --> 01:20:33,700
 So I don't think neutrality is or should be a goal.

1327
01:20:33,700 --> 01:20:36,060
 And I don't think I would encourage it really

1328
01:20:36,060 --> 01:20:39,340
 for anyone who might be listening to these lectures.

1329
01:20:39,340 --> 01:20:42,020
 Working out how we live that out, of course,

1330
01:20:42,020 --> 01:20:43,100
 is a hard challenge.

1331
01:20:43,100 --> 01:20:46,220
 And that's partly why we're having these conversations.

1332
01:20:46,220 --> 01:20:48,940
 Now, the second question,

1333
01:20:48,940 --> 01:20:51,300
 can you read the end of that again as well?

1334
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:53,780
 - Let's see.

1335
01:20:53,780 --> 01:20:57,380
 So many famous or powerful evangelical pastor

1336
01:20:57,380 --> 01:21:00,180
 used their position to influence presidents

1337
01:21:00,180 --> 01:21:02,620
 and lawmakers to advance their cause.

1338
01:21:02,620 --> 01:21:07,020
 And a lot of people, especially non-Christian, resented it.

1339
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:09,180
 What is your opinion on this?

1340
01:21:09,180 --> 01:21:12,700
 - Well, there's a number of things to say about that.

1341
01:21:12,700 --> 01:21:14,820
 But fundamentally, I would side with the people

1342
01:21:14,820 --> 01:21:15,660
 who resent it.

1343
01:21:15,660 --> 01:21:20,540
 And the reason I put it that way is that often,

1344
01:21:20,540 --> 01:21:24,620
 when Christians are given access to political power,

1345
01:21:24,620 --> 01:21:27,180
 especially when their power is primarily located

1346
01:21:27,180 --> 01:21:30,180
 in the church or in the Christian community,

1347
01:21:30,180 --> 01:21:33,300
 they go to the government trying to get the government,

1348
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:35,500
 quote, "on their side,"

1349
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:39,100
 as though it is about seeking governmental favoritism,

1350
01:21:39,100 --> 01:21:41,380
 rather than bringing to the government

1351
01:21:41,380 --> 01:21:43,820
 a Christian critique of their government

1352
01:21:43,820 --> 01:21:46,100
 or of the problem that we're looking at,

1353
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:47,740
 whatever it might be.

1354
01:21:47,740 --> 01:21:51,020
 So often, in the cases of people like Terry Falwell

1355
01:21:51,020 --> 01:21:54,140
 and in President Trump's Evangelical Advisory Board,

1356
01:21:54,140 --> 01:21:57,700
 for example, I know from knowing a number of people

1357
01:21:57,700 --> 01:21:59,540
 that are in that group,

1358
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:01,620
 that one of the things that they would all say

1359
01:22:01,620 --> 01:22:06,260
 is true of that group is that they are not self-critiquing.

1360
01:22:06,260 --> 01:22:10,300
 They go because they want the president to do their bidding.

1361
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:14,980
 So for a pluralist culture to watch Christian people

1362
01:22:14,980 --> 01:22:17,980
 look for special favor from the government

1363
01:22:17,980 --> 01:22:20,580
 feels to me as though that's not looking for justice

1364
01:22:20,580 --> 01:22:22,860
 from the government, which includes,

1365
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:24,220
 yes, justice toward the church,

1366
01:22:24,220 --> 01:22:26,460
 that's legitimate to argue for,

1367
01:22:26,460 --> 01:22:28,300
 justice for society in general,

1368
01:22:28,300 --> 01:22:31,180
 that's also part of the work of the church,

1369
01:22:31,180 --> 01:22:34,180
 to argue for justice for different racial groups,

1370
01:22:34,180 --> 01:22:36,460
 genders, et cetera.

1371
01:22:36,460 --> 01:22:40,820
 Those are justice issues around which we should be

1372
01:22:40,820 --> 01:22:43,460
 not looking for favor

1373
01:22:43,460 --> 01:22:46,060
 that's going to preference our agenda,

1374
01:22:46,060 --> 01:22:51,060
 but instead hold the government accountable to God's agenda

1375
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:54,420
 for what is actually true and good and righteous,

1376
01:22:54,420 --> 01:22:56,500
 not just for the church,

1377
01:22:56,500 --> 01:22:59,700
 but for people made in God's image.

1378
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:02,380
 Now that's a delicate balance that has to be done

1379
01:23:02,380 --> 01:23:04,020
 in a whole variety of different ways

1380
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:06,420
 in order to be able to be wise

1381
01:23:06,420 --> 01:23:08,540
 and discerning about these things.

1382
01:23:08,540 --> 01:23:11,220
 I'm not suggesting this is easy at all,

1383
01:23:11,220 --> 01:23:15,220
 but I think that's more like the model that I would command

1384
01:23:15,220 --> 01:23:19,500
 standing into the conflicts

1385
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:23,940
 and trying to bring a more adequate Christian worldview

1386
01:23:23,940 --> 01:23:28,580
 rather than seeking favor from the government for Christians,

1387
01:23:28,580 --> 01:23:31,220
 which I don't think is actually what we're called to.

1388
01:23:31,220 --> 01:23:34,980
 - Right, so standing in conflict

1389
01:23:34,980 --> 01:23:37,500
 and bringing the critique to the government

1390
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:40,420
 instead of trying to gain flavor from it.

1391
01:23:40,420 --> 01:23:41,460
 - Right.

1392
01:23:41,460 --> 01:23:42,300
 - Thank you.

1393
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:46,540
 - I want to add something again.

1394
01:23:46,540 --> 01:23:49,820
 I think the evangelical church in America,

1395
01:23:49,820 --> 01:23:53,620
 sometimes they are too fixated on specific issues,

1396
01:23:53,620 --> 01:23:55,820
 like abortion, for example.

1397
01:23:55,820 --> 01:23:58,500
 They're thinking about overturning Roe versus Wade

1398
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:02,860
 all the time, but I think the Bible actually teach

1399
01:24:02,860 --> 01:24:04,620
 many things about justice.

1400
01:24:04,620 --> 01:24:06,380
 It's not just one thing.

1401
01:24:06,380 --> 01:24:08,940
 And I think no political party

1402
01:24:08,940 --> 01:24:11,900
 fulfill the biblical model completely.

1403
01:24:11,900 --> 01:24:13,540
 So there's a bit diversity.

1404
01:24:13,540 --> 01:24:15,900
 So some Christians study Republicans,

1405
01:24:15,900 --> 01:24:18,700
 some Christians study Democrats.

1406
01:24:18,700 --> 01:24:20,900
 I think that would be a healthy situation.

1407
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:22,020
 - Yes, yes.

1408
01:24:22,020 --> 01:24:25,820
 - So you just pursue things that is nearest to your heart,

1409
01:24:25,820 --> 01:24:29,180
 but there is no one issue that defines

1410
01:24:29,180 --> 01:24:32,340
 so-called the Christian political position.

1411
01:24:32,340 --> 01:24:35,540
 And secondly, I would suggest individual Christian,

1412
01:24:35,540 --> 01:24:38,420
 of course you can support Republicans,

1413
01:24:38,420 --> 01:24:39,460
 you can support Democrats,

1414
01:24:39,460 --> 01:24:41,780
 you can even join their political machine

1415
01:24:41,780 --> 01:24:45,420
 and lobby for the party and so on, so on.

1416
01:24:45,420 --> 01:24:49,500
 But for church leaders, for pastor in particular,

1417
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:52,780
 I would suggest that pastors should refrain

1418
01:24:52,780 --> 01:24:55,340
 from political activity directly.

1419
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:59,700
 I mean, you can visit a president or a senator

1420
01:24:59,700 --> 01:25:01,220
 and pray with him, that's okay.

1421
01:25:01,220 --> 01:25:03,540
 On a personal level, of course that's okay.

1422
01:25:03,540 --> 01:25:06,140
 But if it's a political event,

1423
01:25:06,140 --> 01:25:10,020
 I think the pastor or church leaders to remember

1424
01:25:10,020 --> 01:25:13,700
 the main role of the church is witnessing the truth.

1425
01:25:13,700 --> 01:25:15,220
 We are not an interest group.

1426
01:25:15,220 --> 01:25:19,700
 Our main job is to witness God's justice.

1427
01:25:19,700 --> 01:25:23,860
 And if this justice can come to fruit in the world,

1428
01:25:23,860 --> 01:25:26,940
 that's God's work, that's not our effort.

1429
01:25:26,940 --> 01:25:31,620
 And we witness what is the faithful truth of God.

1430
01:25:31,620 --> 01:25:33,740
 And then sometimes we just have to trust God

1431
01:25:33,740 --> 01:25:38,060
 to see how God will realize his kingdom on earth.

1432
01:25:38,060 --> 01:25:42,380
 - Right, but I think I agree with what you've just said.

1433
01:25:42,380 --> 01:25:45,260
 And I think your points are very well taken.

1434
01:25:45,260 --> 01:25:47,860
 The only thing I would want to be sure that,

1435
01:25:47,860 --> 01:25:49,940
 at least from my point of view,

1436
01:25:49,940 --> 01:25:53,500
 is that if I'm having access to talk to political leaders,

1437
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:56,020
 I do want to talk to them about political things

1438
01:25:56,020 --> 01:25:57,460
 in the name of Jesus Christ

1439
01:25:57,460 --> 01:25:59,820
 and in light of God's standards of justice,

1440
01:25:59,820 --> 01:26:02,460
 which then means talking to them about things

1441
01:26:02,460 --> 01:26:05,780
 around which there may be political division.

1442
01:26:05,780 --> 01:26:07,860
 My interest isn't the political division.

1443
01:26:07,860 --> 01:26:10,380
 It's about trying to bear witness to the justice of God,

1444
01:26:10,380 --> 01:26:11,740
 which is, I think, what you were just saying.

1445
01:26:11,740 --> 01:26:14,900
 But I just want to put it that way.

1446
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:16,260
 Have we just said the same thing,

1447
01:26:16,260 --> 01:26:17,580
 or do you think what I'm saying

1448
01:26:17,580 --> 01:26:19,860
 is different than what you were saying?

1449
01:26:19,860 --> 01:26:21,140
 - No, it is the same thing.

1450
01:26:21,140 --> 01:26:23,780
 It just means in public events,

1451
01:26:23,780 --> 01:26:25,980
 we are not trying to support or pass this

1452
01:26:25,980 --> 01:26:28,780
 and not try to say, you know, "Roll for Democrat."

1453
01:26:28,780 --> 01:26:30,780
 But of course they can raise those issues

1454
01:26:30,780 --> 01:26:33,540
 with individual political leaders.

1455
01:26:33,540 --> 01:26:34,860
 - Yes, yes, thank you.

1456
01:26:34,860 --> 01:26:37,300
 - Yeah, thank you.

1457
01:26:37,300 --> 01:26:40,460
 I want to concur with your trying

1458
01:26:40,460 --> 01:26:45,460
 to make a distinction between being neutral in politics

1459
01:26:45,460 --> 01:26:51,340
 versus being neutral with respect to political parties.

1460
01:26:51,340 --> 01:26:56,540
 I think that distinction is very helpful.

1461
01:26:56,540 --> 01:26:59,980
 And I think that distinction is helpful

1462
01:26:59,980 --> 01:27:03,820
 for the churches in Hong Kong too,

1463
01:27:03,820 --> 01:27:05,860
 because it is very common here

1464
01:27:05,860 --> 01:27:08,180
 that they want to stick to the,

1465
01:27:08,820 --> 01:27:13,820
 the principle of the separation between church and state.

1466
01:27:13,820 --> 01:27:20,100
 And a lot of them understand that to mean

1467
01:27:20,100 --> 01:27:23,860
 that church therefore should be neutral

1468
01:27:23,860 --> 01:27:27,580
 with respect to politics.

1469
01:27:27,580 --> 01:27:31,380
 But I think that goes against our,

1470
01:27:35,060 --> 01:27:38,540
 the command to love our neighbors,

1471
01:27:38,540 --> 01:27:42,020
 because politics is what affects our neighbors

1472
01:27:42,020 --> 01:27:48,100
 the most in a lot of situations.

1473
01:27:48,100 --> 01:27:51,820
 So thank you for making that clear.

1474
01:27:51,820 --> 01:27:54,180
 - Yes, thank you very much.

1475
01:27:54,180 --> 01:27:59,780
 - There is a related question asking about,

1476
01:27:59,780 --> 01:28:01,620
 you know, there's observation that, you know,

1477
01:28:01,620 --> 01:28:03,180
 there are lots of minority

1478
01:28:03,180 --> 01:28:06,060
 or even Chinese American Christians

1479
01:28:06,060 --> 01:28:10,780
 seems to be joining, you know, the Trump wagon this year.

1480
01:28:10,780 --> 01:28:14,500
 You know, they are not for, you know, the white racism.

1481
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:17,260
 What do you explain, you know,

1482
01:28:17,260 --> 01:28:21,060
 this people when they're having this post-Trump attitude?

1483
01:28:21,060 --> 01:28:25,060
 Like how would you, what are their motivation, you think?

1484
01:28:25,060 --> 01:28:26,460
 - Right.

1485
01:28:26,460 --> 01:28:28,300
 Well, it comes down, I think,

1486
01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:30,860
 to the fact that a great deal of the Christian life

1487
01:28:30,860 --> 01:28:32,700
 is about reordering power

1488
01:28:32,700 --> 01:28:35,580
 and how we understand power in the world.

1489
01:28:35,580 --> 01:28:39,580
 And there are many people that are attracted to Trump

1490
01:28:39,580 --> 01:28:41,620
 because of the way that he demonstrates

1491
01:28:41,620 --> 01:28:46,620
 a kind of strong man view of governance, right?

1492
01:28:46,620 --> 01:28:51,300
 That has to do largely with the exercising of force

1493
01:28:51,300 --> 01:28:56,300
 and the demonstration of decisiveness

1494
01:28:56,300 --> 01:28:59,300
 and direction and authority.

1495
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:03,060
 This is one of the reasons why, for example, in Africa,

1496
01:29:03,060 --> 01:29:05,860
 there are a lot of African Christians

1497
01:29:05,860 --> 01:29:09,300
 who are really very, very enthusiastic Trump supporters.

1498
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:12,300
 And it's partly because of the fact

1499
01:29:12,300 --> 01:29:16,260
 that the residue of tribal life in Africa

1500
01:29:16,260 --> 01:29:20,860
 and its emphasis on the strong man

1501
01:29:20,860 --> 01:29:23,020
 who's going to lead the tribes

1502
01:29:23,020 --> 01:29:27,940
 is a person that sometimes speaks and acts like Trump.

1503
01:29:27,940 --> 01:29:32,580
 This is one of the reasons why I find it very ironic

1504
01:29:32,580 --> 01:29:36,180
 that it's the church in Uganda this week

1505
01:29:36,180 --> 01:29:39,460
 that will vote if they follow the past.

1506
01:29:39,460 --> 01:29:41,260
 It will be Christian people

1507
01:29:41,260 --> 01:29:46,260
 who will be some of Museveni's strongest supporters.

1508
01:29:46,260 --> 01:29:47,420
 Why?

1509
01:29:47,420 --> 01:29:49,540
 Museveni is a strong man.

1510
01:29:49,540 --> 01:29:51,740
 He's so strong that many, of course,

1511
01:29:51,740 --> 01:29:53,460
 would call him a dictator.

1512
01:29:53,460 --> 01:29:55,300
 Who supports that?

1513
01:29:55,300 --> 01:29:59,300
 Interestingly and thankfully, I would say the church.

1514
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:02,300
 So Museveni does not pay attention to people

1515
01:30:02,300 --> 01:30:05,420
 who are poor and in need.

1516
01:30:05,420 --> 01:30:09,820
 Women and children are abused by his government.

1517
01:30:09,820 --> 01:30:14,620
 Whereas the church wants to speak up for Museveni

1518
01:30:14,620 --> 01:30:16,980
 because he uses Christian language

1519
01:30:16,980 --> 01:30:20,260
 and because he's seen to be quote strong.

1520
01:30:20,260 --> 01:30:24,660
 Now, I don't know if that's true for that justification

1521
01:30:24,660 --> 01:30:27,540
 in the among Asians and Asian Americans,

1522
01:30:27,540 --> 01:30:32,020
 but I think Trump's language of strength, success,

1523
01:30:32,020 --> 01:30:35,340
 power, money, influence,

1524
01:30:35,340 --> 01:30:40,340
 and then tying it to certain hot button issues,

1525
01:30:40,340 --> 01:30:42,660
 as has already been named,

1526
01:30:42,660 --> 01:30:47,460
 like abortion or human sexuality or immigration,

1527
01:30:47,460 --> 01:30:50,620
 that those things are taken all together

1528
01:30:50,620 --> 01:30:54,300
 as a way of first getting what we want materially

1529
01:30:54,300 --> 01:30:55,420
 and otherwise,

1530
01:30:55,420 --> 01:30:58,860
 then getting a leader who's going to defend what we want

1531
01:30:58,860 --> 01:31:01,420
 and keep the enemy at bay.

1532
01:31:01,420 --> 01:31:04,860
 And then that's going to protect our values,

1533
01:31:04,860 --> 01:31:06,980
 namely things like abortion

1534
01:31:06,980 --> 01:31:11,260
 or a conservative approach to LGBTQ issues.

1535
01:31:11,260 --> 01:31:13,580
 So I don't know, you'd have to tell me

1536
01:31:13,580 --> 01:31:16,540
 whether you think that's a reasonable explanation

1537
01:31:16,540 --> 01:31:21,540
 for the attraction to Trump of some Chinese Americans.

1538
01:31:21,540 --> 01:31:26,540
 - Well, yeah, I think, you know, strong leader,

1539
01:31:26,540 --> 01:31:31,740
 that image is certainly part of it.

1540
01:31:31,740 --> 01:31:33,540
 I think the other part is, you know,

1541
01:31:33,540 --> 01:31:37,620
 Mark, you mentioned already about social conservative.

1542
01:31:37,620 --> 01:31:41,380
 Trump represent a more conservative voice

1543
01:31:41,380 --> 01:31:44,540
 on many social issues, family and so on.

1544
01:31:44,540 --> 01:31:45,860
 And I have to say, yes,

1545
01:31:45,860 --> 01:31:49,020
 Trump has done something I agree to,

1546
01:31:49,020 --> 01:31:53,460
 his emphasis on protecting religious liberty, for example.

1547
01:31:53,460 --> 01:31:56,300
 That's something that we can identify with.

1548
01:31:56,300 --> 01:31:59,940
 So, but in general, I think many Chinese

1549
01:31:59,940 --> 01:32:03,060
 want to preserve a conservative social order,

1550
01:32:03,060 --> 01:32:05,100
 like respect of the parents and so on.

1551
01:32:05,100 --> 01:32:06,900
 So those things.

1552
01:32:06,900 --> 01:32:09,580
 And that may explain some of the Latino support,

1553
01:32:09,580 --> 01:32:11,820
 you know, that Trump get to.

1554
01:32:11,820 --> 01:32:15,780
 And so at least in the rhetorics of Trump

1555
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:18,780
 and so-called the conservative wing,

1556
01:32:18,780 --> 01:32:22,700
 the Democrat is, you know, painted as radical.

1557
01:32:22,700 --> 01:32:26,780
 You know, they want to, how to uproot the whole social order

1558
01:32:26,780 --> 01:32:28,820
 so that everyone is equal

1559
01:32:28,820 --> 01:32:31,180
 and there's no more respect to person,

1560
01:32:31,180 --> 01:32:33,700
 no, and everyone is equal in that sense.

1561
01:32:33,700 --> 01:32:36,220
 So I think a lot of the fear

1562
01:32:36,220 --> 01:32:39,260
 of the upsetting of the social order,

1563
01:32:39,260 --> 01:32:40,940
 I think it's what drive, you know,

1564
01:32:40,940 --> 01:32:44,820
 some Chinese Christian or other ethnic Christian

1565
01:32:44,820 --> 01:32:46,580
 to support Trump.

1566
01:32:46,580 --> 01:32:47,540
 - Yes, yes.

1567
01:32:47,540 --> 01:32:48,380
 Thank you for that.

1568
01:32:48,380 --> 01:32:49,580
 I think that's true.

1569
01:32:49,580 --> 01:32:50,420
 I agree.

1570
01:32:50,420 --> 01:32:53,260
 - I don't know if,

1571
01:32:53,260 --> 01:32:56,340
 I don't think I can speak for a lot of people,

1572
01:32:56,340 --> 01:32:59,260
 but for some of the people I know,

1573
01:32:59,260 --> 01:33:02,620
 it could be because of Trump's foreign policies,

1574
01:33:02,620 --> 01:33:08,860
 because of the way that he's so strong

1575
01:33:08,860 --> 01:33:13,780
 against some governments,

1576
01:33:13,780 --> 01:33:14,620
 such as

1577
01:33:18,020 --> 01:33:18,860
 CCP.

1578
01:33:18,860 --> 01:33:23,020
 I think that could be part of the reasons.

1579
01:33:23,020 --> 01:33:24,620
 And also in America,

1580
01:33:24,620 --> 01:33:28,540
 I don't know if I get it right,

1581
01:33:28,540 --> 01:33:31,380
 but the Christian, the Bible belt

1582
01:33:31,380 --> 01:33:36,380
 is also where the Rust Belt is, roughly.

1583
01:33:36,380 --> 01:33:39,300
 And before Trump's era,

1584
01:33:39,300 --> 01:33:42,020
 a lot of the jobs were lost to countries

1585
01:33:42,020 --> 01:33:44,260
 like Mexico and China.

1586
01:33:44,260 --> 01:33:47,260
 So a lot of people have lost their jobs.

1587
01:33:47,260 --> 01:33:52,260
 So maybe partly why they want to make America great again

1588
01:33:52,260 --> 01:33:55,380
 is such that jobs could come back to them,

1589
01:33:55,380 --> 01:34:00,380
 so that such that they can actually have their jobs back.

1590
01:34:00,380 --> 01:34:02,860
 I think that could be partly why.

1591
01:34:02,860 --> 01:34:05,540
 - I agree with that as well.

1592
01:34:05,540 --> 01:34:06,900
 Yeah, yeah.

1593
01:34:06,900 --> 01:34:10,220
 But often what that, all of that,

1594
01:34:10,220 --> 01:34:11,420
 both of your answers, I think,

1595
01:34:11,420 --> 01:34:14,260
 are ones I certainly would accept.

1596
01:34:14,260 --> 01:34:19,260
 I think often what's less visible inside those answers

1597
01:34:19,260 --> 01:34:24,500
 is really an interest, finally, of simply self-protection.

1598
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:27,580
 And there's something about the gospel, Christology itself,

1599
01:34:27,580 --> 01:34:29,860
 this is why I chose that word,

1600
01:34:29,860 --> 01:34:32,260
 that is about vulnerability

1601
01:34:32,260 --> 01:34:35,220
 and about becoming interested in the other,

1602
01:34:35,220 --> 01:34:39,540
 not just in what we have a prerogative to grasp.

1603
01:34:39,540 --> 01:34:43,460
 So I'm not saying anything that that leads to a direct plan

1604
01:34:43,460 --> 01:34:47,700
 for economics or for job security or those kinds of things.

1605
01:34:47,700 --> 01:34:50,620
 But I think it's based on an assumption,

1606
01:34:50,620 --> 01:34:52,020
 a cultural assumption, I would say,

1607
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:53,700
 not a gospel assumption,

1608
01:34:53,700 --> 01:34:57,100
 that self-interest should come first

1609
01:34:57,100 --> 01:35:00,780
 or often legitimately can come first.

1610
01:35:00,780 --> 01:35:02,380
 And I think from a Christian point of view,

1611
01:35:02,380 --> 01:35:04,700
 that has to be at least wrestled with.

1612
01:35:04,700 --> 01:35:08,620
 And if I saw those that were surrounding Trump

1613
01:35:08,620 --> 01:35:11,620
 critiquing that, even while they're also affirming it,

1614
01:35:11,620 --> 01:35:13,260
 in other words, setting it boundaries

1615
01:35:13,260 --> 01:35:17,060
 as well as giving it its own head,

1616
01:35:17,060 --> 01:35:20,220
 then I think I would feel differently about those arguments,

1617
01:35:20,220 --> 01:35:21,780
 which I think do have a place

1618
01:35:21,780 --> 01:35:24,460
 in things that we should carefully consider.

1619
01:35:24,460 --> 01:35:27,940
 - Thank you.

1620
01:35:27,940 --> 01:35:30,060
 So for our next question,

1621
01:35:30,060 --> 01:35:34,300
 if the current trend among the white evangelicals continue,

1622
01:35:34,300 --> 01:35:39,020
 what, in your opinion, would become of evangelicalism?

1623
01:35:39,020 --> 01:35:41,060
 Another related question,

1624
01:35:41,060 --> 01:35:43,140
 do you think now is a turning point

1625
01:35:43,140 --> 01:35:46,620
 for the white evangelical churches to reflect their value,

1626
01:35:46,620 --> 01:35:49,300
 or you would think that they would move on

1627
01:35:49,300 --> 01:35:50,860
 to the extreme ends?

1628
01:35:50,860 --> 01:35:54,500
 - Well, based on where we are right now,

1629
01:35:54,500 --> 01:35:58,140
 I have to say that I'm more skeptical than optimistic.

1630
01:35:58,140 --> 01:36:01,340
 I'm not saying that with any pleasure

1631
01:36:01,340 --> 01:36:03,700
 or with any feeling that I'm even being dramatic.

1632
01:36:03,700 --> 01:36:06,940
 I just think it's descriptive of where we are right now.

1633
01:36:07,940 --> 01:36:12,140
 Despite all that's going on, even right now,

1634
01:36:12,140 --> 01:36:15,820
 there are people who are still defending in every way

1635
01:36:15,820 --> 01:36:19,220
 the legitimacy of the complaints against the election

1636
01:36:19,220 --> 01:36:23,740
 and of the violence that was used and all of that, right?

1637
01:36:23,740 --> 01:36:26,860
 So there's not a pervasive sense I have

1638
01:36:26,860 --> 01:36:30,380
 of deep reflection about this.

1639
01:36:30,380 --> 01:36:34,940
 It's much more intuitive and reactionary

1640
01:36:34,940 --> 01:36:39,060
 rather than self-critical and repentant.

1641
01:36:39,060 --> 01:36:42,500
 And I think people are showing their true colors,

1642
01:36:42,500 --> 01:36:45,420
 that they're more aligned to this agenda

1643
01:36:45,420 --> 01:36:48,260
 rather than humbling themselves before God

1644
01:36:48,260 --> 01:36:52,540
 and asking for God to give us new eyes and a new heart

1645
01:36:52,540 --> 01:36:56,060
 and a new mind to perceive ourselves and our neighbor

1646
01:36:56,060 --> 01:37:00,140
 and our nation and the world around us in a different way.

1647
01:37:00,140 --> 01:37:04,260
 I certainly think that there are some institutions,

1648
01:37:04,260 --> 01:37:08,620
 for example, even today, there are maybe four,

1649
01:37:08,620 --> 01:37:11,220
 three or four institutions that I'm aware of

1650
01:37:11,220 --> 01:37:14,540
 that have put out some really very strong

1651
01:37:14,540 --> 01:37:18,740
 and repentant statements of their own sense of complicity

1652
01:37:18,740 --> 01:37:20,060
 in this narrative.

1653
01:37:20,060 --> 01:37:24,140
 And in the letter that I put out last week,

1654
01:37:24,140 --> 01:37:28,340
 I was trying to say, we have to call ourselves into account,

1655
01:37:28,340 --> 01:37:31,140
 though Fuller would not wanna see itself

1656
01:37:31,140 --> 01:37:34,020
 as part of this narrative that I'm describing.

1657
01:37:34,020 --> 01:37:37,620
 There's no way that we are not in some way entangled in it

1658
01:37:37,620 --> 01:37:39,940
 and guilty of some of the same things,

1659
01:37:39,940 --> 01:37:44,060
 even though we may occupy a different social location

1660
01:37:44,060 --> 01:37:46,740
 and have a different social critique,

1661
01:37:46,740 --> 01:37:51,340
 we can still be caught up in the same problematic issues.

1662
01:37:51,340 --> 01:37:54,380
 So let's admit that of ourselves.

1663
01:37:54,380 --> 01:37:56,700
 I think what I'm being invited into

1664
01:37:56,700 --> 01:37:59,300
 and what I'm inviting others into here

1665
01:37:59,300 --> 01:38:02,140
 is into a sustained conversation

1666
01:38:02,140 --> 01:38:06,140
 with different people from different racial,

1667
01:38:06,140 --> 01:38:10,180
 theological and denominational contexts

1668
01:38:10,180 --> 01:38:14,420
 to have some sustained conversations about the crisis itself

1669
01:38:14,420 --> 01:38:18,420
 because to some degree, we have to feel our way

1670
01:38:18,420 --> 01:38:23,420
 toward as much of a fresh narrative that we can all share in

1671
01:38:23,420 --> 01:38:29,020
 in order to be able to then share in acting together

1672
01:38:29,020 --> 01:38:32,780
 in a way that could be really more publicly productive.

1673
01:38:32,780 --> 01:38:36,780
 Right now, there are just endless stories.

1674
01:38:36,780 --> 01:38:42,700
 I wonder if all of you are aware of a quite wonderful video.

1675
01:38:42,700 --> 01:38:45,100
 I don't know if it's been translated into Chinese,

1676
01:38:45,100 --> 01:38:50,100
 but it's one of the TED Talks given by a Nigerian woman

1677
01:38:50,100 --> 01:38:56,580
 named Adichie is her last name, Chimamanda Adichie.

1678
01:38:56,580 --> 01:39:00,140
 And it's called "The Danger of the Single Story."

1679
01:39:00,140 --> 01:39:02,660
 "The Danger of the Single Story."

1680
01:39:02,660 --> 01:39:07,660
 And she basically offers us a kind of social anthropology

1681
01:39:07,660 --> 01:39:12,740
 of why there is almost never one story.

1682
01:39:12,740 --> 01:39:14,980
 So what I'm not trying to argue for is

1683
01:39:14,980 --> 01:39:17,420
 we all need to come together and tell the same story.

1684
01:39:17,420 --> 01:39:21,260
 That's not a good idea, even as a goal,

1685
01:39:21,260 --> 01:39:23,940
 let alone as a possibility.

1686
01:39:23,940 --> 01:39:28,940
 So, but what I am saying is a shared narrative,

1687
01:39:28,940 --> 01:39:31,980
 even in our differences in our narratives,

1688
01:39:31,980 --> 01:39:34,420
 that could bring us close enough together

1689
01:39:34,420 --> 01:39:38,020
 that we could then begin to conceive the church in America

1690
01:39:38,020 --> 01:39:39,700
 in a different way.

1691
01:39:39,700 --> 01:39:41,660
 And we've not been very good at this.

1692
01:39:41,660 --> 01:39:44,260
 We're inventive around secular values.

1693
01:39:44,260 --> 01:39:47,340
 We're not very inventive around gospel values.

1694
01:39:47,340 --> 01:39:49,020
 How do we become more Christ-like

1695
01:39:49,020 --> 01:39:51,700
 is not the dominant question in the American church.

1696
01:39:51,700 --> 01:39:55,020
 And that's partly what I've been trying to say this evening,

1697
01:39:55,020 --> 01:39:56,940
 or tomorrow morning, rather,

1698
01:39:56,940 --> 01:40:01,940
 is that we are called to become conformed to Jesus Christ

1699
01:40:01,940 --> 01:40:06,820
 individually and communally.

1700
01:40:06,820 --> 01:40:09,900
 But that's not our goal,

1701
01:40:09,900 --> 01:40:13,660
 not predominantly within the white evangelical movement.

1702
01:40:13,660 --> 01:40:18,660
 It's how do we retain being white and dominant and male

1703
01:40:19,060 --> 01:40:22,620
 and successful and powerful and influential?

1704
01:40:22,620 --> 01:40:24,940
 Those are the questions that have driven so much

1705
01:40:24,940 --> 01:40:26,420
 of the American church,

1706
01:40:26,420 --> 01:40:29,980
 not how do we become conformed to Jesus Christ?

1707
01:40:29,980 --> 01:40:32,180
 How do we lay down our power?

1708
01:40:32,180 --> 01:40:35,340
 How do we surrender in the name of Jesus

1709
01:40:35,340 --> 01:40:39,220
 to our friends, our neighbors, our family,

1710
01:40:39,220 --> 01:40:43,300
 and including our enemies in ways that represent

1711
01:40:43,300 --> 01:40:46,620
 the unexpected love and sacrifice of Jesus?

1712
01:40:46,620 --> 01:40:49,380
 Those are surely the qualities that are meant to be part

1713
01:40:49,380 --> 01:40:51,780
 of what the body of Christ throughout history,

1714
01:40:51,780 --> 01:40:53,100
 when it's been at its best,

1715
01:40:53,100 --> 01:40:54,980
 that's what the church has been called to.

1716
01:40:54,980 --> 01:40:57,820
 That's what we are called to in this moment.

1717
01:40:57,820 --> 01:41:01,380
 And I've been trying to highlight the way that the church,

1718
01:41:01,380 --> 01:41:04,140
 the evangelical white church in America,

1719
01:41:04,140 --> 01:41:06,860
 loves using that language.

1720
01:41:06,860 --> 01:41:09,900
 And it preaches it, it writes about it, it teaches it,

1721
01:41:09,900 --> 01:41:12,620
 but it does it within the confines

1722
01:41:12,620 --> 01:41:15,300
 of a social structure that is so much more

1723
01:41:15,300 --> 01:41:18,580
 than the confines of a social structure,

1724
01:41:18,580 --> 01:41:20,900
 which actually makes becoming Christ-like,

1725
01:41:20,900 --> 01:41:24,300
 by definition, actually not the goal.

1726
01:41:24,300 --> 01:41:26,700
 It's actually to be white, male, American,

1727
01:41:26,700 --> 01:41:30,060
 dominant, successful, powerful, et cetera.

1728
01:41:30,060 --> 01:41:32,260
 That's, it's our destruction.

1729
01:41:32,260 --> 01:41:35,220
 So when I think about will evangelicals

1730
01:41:35,220 --> 01:41:36,980
 be different parties, you know,

1731
01:41:36,980 --> 01:41:41,980
 different political point of views and ethnic groups?

1732
01:41:41,980 --> 01:41:44,380
 - Right, right.

1733
01:41:44,380 --> 01:41:46,260
 - And I remember when I was a pastor,

1734
01:41:46,260 --> 01:41:48,660
 there was a period of time in the congregation

1735
01:41:48,660 --> 01:41:51,100
 that I was serving in Berkeley, California,

1736
01:41:51,100 --> 01:41:54,420
 that we were working on some of these issues,

1737
01:41:54,420 --> 01:41:57,660
 and we developed a simple liturgy

1738
01:41:57,660 --> 01:42:00,060
 that we used for several months

1739
01:42:00,060 --> 01:42:02,340
 as a way of trying to just keep remembering

1740
01:42:02,340 --> 01:42:03,820
 these first order things.

1741
01:42:03,820 --> 01:42:06,300
 So it went something like this.

1742
01:42:06,300 --> 01:42:07,420
 I would get up and I,

1743
01:42:07,420 --> 01:42:10,180
 (audio cuts out)

1744
01:42:12,060 --> 01:42:13,540
 I'm not God.

1745
01:42:13,540 --> 01:42:16,660
 And I would say to them, you are not God.

1746
01:42:16,660 --> 01:42:19,620
 And they would say, we are not God.

1747
01:42:19,620 --> 01:42:23,180
 And then we would name a number of other categories

1748
01:42:23,180 --> 01:42:26,620
 where we wanted to remember at the start of our worship

1749
01:42:26,620 --> 01:42:29,700
 that these are not the things that we're here to worship,

1750
01:42:29,700 --> 01:42:31,300
 that we have to lay these things down.

1751
01:42:31,300 --> 01:42:33,540
 So it was a repentance, yes,

1752
01:42:33,540 --> 01:42:38,540
 but it was also a denial, a rejection, yes.

1753
01:42:38,580 --> 01:42:43,300
 It was a seeking after what is the right ordering of power,

1754
01:42:43,300 --> 01:42:45,140
 where everyone is called into account,

1755
01:42:45,140 --> 01:42:48,460
 not just the left or the right or anyone else,

1756
01:42:48,460 --> 01:42:50,940
 and then trying to figure out how do we live together

1757
01:42:50,940 --> 01:42:54,980
 in the newly ordered power of the kingdom of God.

1758
01:42:54,980 --> 01:42:58,940
 - Thank you.

1759
01:42:58,940 --> 01:43:01,020
 - I want to repeat actually something

1760
01:43:01,020 --> 01:43:03,220
 I've said already in my response.

1761
01:43:03,220 --> 01:43:06,780
 I think being a Christian is the adventure.

1762
01:43:06,780 --> 01:43:11,060
 We are open to what God is doing today.

1763
01:43:11,060 --> 01:43:15,180
 I think we evangelicals tend to be conservative

1764
01:43:15,180 --> 01:43:19,340
 in the sense we don't want to go into anything controversial

1765
01:43:19,340 --> 01:43:21,540
 unless somehow we are persuaded

1766
01:43:21,540 --> 01:43:24,220
 we have the absolute correct answer.

1767
01:43:24,220 --> 01:43:27,780
 Like for example, whatever, in some sexual issue,

1768
01:43:27,780 --> 01:43:29,540
 we think we have the right answer.

1769
01:43:29,540 --> 01:43:33,060
 So we just keep repeating that right answer.

1770
01:43:33,060 --> 01:43:36,300
 But I think the church need to be open to things

1771
01:43:36,300 --> 01:43:38,940
 that we don't have a final answer.

1772
01:43:38,940 --> 01:43:41,860
 I mean, we may have, for example,

1773
01:43:41,860 --> 01:43:45,860
 abortion is not pleasing to God in some way,

1774
01:43:45,860 --> 01:43:49,220
 but does it mean making abortion illegal

1775
01:43:49,220 --> 01:43:51,140
 in our situation is a good thing?

1776
01:43:51,140 --> 01:43:54,540
 I mean, there are a big step between the two.

1777
01:43:54,540 --> 01:43:59,380
 Abortion is morally okay versus banning of abortion.

1778
01:43:59,380 --> 01:44:01,660
 But I think a lot of times we Christian are afraid

1779
01:44:01,660 --> 01:44:05,180
 to discuss about things we are not sure.

1780
01:44:05,180 --> 01:44:08,940
 We listen to one another and see how we can find a path

1781
01:44:08,940 --> 01:44:10,900
 that everybody can walk in.

1782
01:44:10,900 --> 01:44:13,580
 I think that's something the evangelical church

1783
01:44:13,580 --> 01:44:18,580
 need to take the courage to walk in this road.

1784
01:44:18,580 --> 01:44:21,020
 And secondly, just the question about

1785
01:44:21,020 --> 01:44:22,980
 what would happen to white evangelical

1786
01:44:22,980 --> 01:44:26,300
 if it continues the way it is now.

1787
01:44:26,300 --> 01:44:28,740
 And I think, well, it will just decline.

1788
01:44:28,740 --> 01:44:32,460
 I think the democracy of the United States,

1789
01:44:32,460 --> 01:44:35,460
 it's just, they will have declining influence

1790
01:44:35,460 --> 01:44:37,220
 and something new will come up.

1791
01:44:37,220 --> 01:44:40,220
 Like Mark has said, the evangel will never die.

1792
01:44:40,220 --> 01:44:42,540
 So the church will just have a new face.

1793
01:44:42,540 --> 01:44:43,660
 What will the new face be?

1794
01:44:43,660 --> 01:44:47,020
 We don't know, but I know the church will survive.

1795
01:44:47,020 --> 01:44:47,860
 - Right.

1796
01:44:47,860 --> 01:44:51,540
 Well, and I do think, I agree with all of

1797
01:44:51,540 --> 01:44:52,700
 what you've just said.

1798
01:44:52,700 --> 01:44:55,660
 And I think that one of the really quite exciting things

1799
01:44:55,660 --> 01:44:58,620
 is that some of the most wonderful demonstrations

1800
01:44:58,620 --> 01:45:00,700
 of the gospel that I'm seeing in the United States

1801
01:45:00,700 --> 01:45:04,380
 are coming from multi-ethnic, multi-racial communities

1802
01:45:04,380 --> 01:45:09,300
 that are literally creating a new kind of church

1803
01:45:09,300 --> 01:45:12,020
 for the 21st century that does not look like

1804
01:45:12,020 --> 01:45:13,500
 and is not structured like,

1805
01:45:13,500 --> 01:45:17,220
 it does not defer to authority in the same way

1806
01:45:17,220 --> 01:45:19,780
 as typical churches have done in the past.

1807
01:45:19,780 --> 01:45:21,260
 So that's an example of something new

1808
01:45:21,260 --> 01:45:24,060
 that's coming out of the brokenness.

1809
01:45:24,060 --> 01:45:27,180
 And I like the word adventure very much.

1810
01:45:28,140 --> 01:45:32,460
 Another word that I think fits alongside adventure

1811
01:45:32,460 --> 01:45:34,940
 is that God is a God of surprise.

1812
01:45:34,940 --> 01:45:37,820
 And he does things that we would never be able to

1813
01:45:37,820 --> 01:45:40,260
 have anticipated if we're open to that.

1814
01:45:40,260 --> 01:45:42,900
 And that often does then call in question,

1815
01:45:42,900 --> 01:45:46,980
 not endlessly and not at every point,

1816
01:45:46,980 --> 01:45:49,820
 but it calls in question tradition and structures

1817
01:45:49,820 --> 01:45:53,740
 and formalities that we might've become overly used to.

1818
01:45:56,500 --> 01:46:00,140
 - So the next question probably for Dr. Yun.

1819
01:46:00,140 --> 01:46:03,340
 So an audience comment on Dr. Yun,

1820
01:46:03,340 --> 01:46:06,540
 you make a good observation that conservative,

1821
01:46:06,540 --> 01:46:09,780
 quote unquote, churches welcome ethnic minority.

1822
01:46:09,780 --> 01:46:13,220
 I too have similar experience being a Chinese seminary

1823
01:46:13,220 --> 01:46:14,820
 student in America.

1824
01:46:14,820 --> 01:46:18,260
 What set churches apart from other white evangelical

1825
01:46:18,260 --> 01:46:21,020
 churches in your experience?

1826
01:46:25,060 --> 01:46:29,700
 - Actually what I meant was that in my experience,

1827
01:46:29,700 --> 01:46:34,020
 at least maybe I could not speak for a lot of people,

1828
01:46:34,020 --> 01:46:37,620
 but in my own experience at Princeton,

1829
01:46:37,620 --> 01:46:42,620
 it's really often is the case that it is white

1830
01:46:42,620 --> 01:46:51,020
 evangelicals who are friendly to international students.

1831
01:46:53,820 --> 01:46:55,780
 It's not something that I could explain,

1832
01:46:55,780 --> 01:46:57,980
 but that's actually the case.

1833
01:46:57,980 --> 01:47:00,580
 And a lot of them I have to say.

1834
01:47:00,580 --> 01:47:02,660
 So that's why in my response,

1835
01:47:02,660 --> 01:47:05,980
 I wanted to say that I want to give them at least some.

1836
01:47:05,980 --> 01:47:08,300
 - Yes.

1837
01:47:08,300 --> 01:47:09,140
 - Some credit.

1838
01:47:09,140 --> 01:47:11,420
 - I agree.

1839
01:47:11,420 --> 01:47:12,260
 Thank you for that.

1840
01:47:12,260 --> 01:47:16,660
 - I feel that again, it's my own experience.

1841
01:47:16,660 --> 01:47:21,580
 A lot of the liberals in Princeton,

1842
01:47:21,580 --> 01:47:26,580
 I think they are very conscious that they have to be

1843
01:47:26,580 --> 01:47:35,180
 in the right place along the political spectrum.

1844
01:47:35,180 --> 01:47:42,220
 A lot of them, I feel that they like to point their finger

1845
01:47:42,220 --> 01:47:44,900
 to the people on the other side,

1846
01:47:44,900 --> 01:47:46,940
 but they don't really,

1847
01:47:47,940 --> 01:47:50,340
 (stuttering)

1848
01:47:50,340 --> 01:47:57,140
 reflect on how they actually treat the people

1849
01:47:57,140 --> 01:48:00,820
 they claim to love.

1850
01:48:00,820 --> 01:48:03,020
 That's actually my experience.

1851
01:48:03,020 --> 01:48:07,820
 So I think both sides have their own blind spots.

1852
01:48:07,820 --> 01:48:08,660
 - Yes.

1853
01:48:08,660 --> 01:48:12,140
 - Something.

1854
01:48:12,140 --> 01:48:15,380
 Anyway, so I think that we've been critical

1855
01:48:15,380 --> 01:48:19,740
 of the evangelicalism, quite critical in this lectures,

1856
01:48:19,740 --> 01:48:22,540
 but there's something good about evangelical tradition.

1857
01:48:22,540 --> 01:48:25,620
 For example, the concern to spread the gospel.

1858
01:48:25,620 --> 01:48:28,860
 I think that's one motive, a strong motive

1859
01:48:28,860 --> 01:48:32,380
 to let the evangelical church to try to invite people

1860
01:48:32,380 --> 01:48:34,020
 from different backgrounds.

1861
01:48:34,020 --> 01:48:37,300
 It's not the lack of motivation to invite people.

1862
01:48:37,300 --> 01:48:40,500
 It's what happened when you do get people into your church.

1863
01:48:40,500 --> 01:48:42,500
 Can you make those people comfortable?

1864
01:48:42,500 --> 01:48:44,580
 I mean, that's another issue.

1865
01:48:44,580 --> 01:48:46,660
 And we talk about the liberal church.

1866
01:48:46,660 --> 01:48:49,380
 Actually, in my experience, the liberal church

1867
01:48:49,380 --> 01:48:51,300
 in some way is not that liberal at all.

1868
01:48:51,300 --> 01:48:53,420
 I mean, I studied in, as I said,

1869
01:48:53,420 --> 01:48:55,660
 I took courses in Union Seminary.

1870
01:48:55,660 --> 01:48:57,780
 I think Union Seminary in some ways

1871
01:48:57,780 --> 01:49:00,380
 as narrow-minded as Westminster Seminary.

1872
01:49:00,380 --> 01:49:02,900
 It's just narrow-minded in their different ways.

1873
01:49:02,900 --> 01:49:06,540
 So, I mean, the evangelical church

1874
01:49:06,540 --> 01:49:10,900
 does not has a monopoly on being narrow-minded.

1875
01:49:12,340 --> 01:49:14,740
 And thirdly, you know, I actually,

1876
01:49:14,740 --> 01:49:18,140
 I was a pastor in a church in New York City.

1877
01:49:18,140 --> 01:49:22,420
 And my church in New York City is a multi-ethnic church.

1878
01:49:22,420 --> 01:49:25,180
 We have a Hispanic congregation, an English congregation,

1879
01:49:25,180 --> 01:49:27,100
 and a Chinese congregation.

1880
01:49:27,100 --> 01:49:28,940
 I preach in the Chinese congregation.

1881
01:49:28,940 --> 01:49:30,620
 I preach in the English congregation too.

1882
01:49:30,620 --> 01:49:32,860
 I don't know Spanish, so can't preach there.

1883
01:49:32,860 --> 01:49:36,220
 Anyway, so for a while, the church,

1884
01:49:36,220 --> 01:49:39,140
 the church was my church, First Baptist Church of Flushing,

1885
01:49:39,140 --> 01:49:43,260
 was founded in the 19th century, I think.

1886
01:49:43,260 --> 01:49:47,820
 But anyway, for a while, we actually have a Chinese person

1887
01:49:47,820 --> 01:49:52,140
 as the senior pastor of this multi-ethnic church.

1888
01:49:52,140 --> 01:49:54,740
 Now it's a white American again,

1889
01:49:54,740 --> 01:49:56,940
 but there was a while when, there was a time

1890
01:49:56,940 --> 01:49:59,780
 when there was a Chinese pastor who was the senior pastor.

1891
01:49:59,780 --> 01:50:03,540
 So there are evangelical church who try to, you know,

1892
01:50:03,540 --> 01:50:07,700
 be, try to be multicultural, like American societies.

1893
01:50:07,700 --> 01:50:11,260
 So I don't want, so I want people to know

1894
01:50:11,260 --> 01:50:16,060
 that the evangelical church in America is also diverse.

1895
01:50:16,060 --> 01:50:20,220
 White evangelicalism is just part of the evangelical church.

1896
01:50:20,220 --> 01:50:22,940
 It's not the whole of the evangelical church.

1897
01:50:22,940 --> 01:50:29,420
 - I'm just mindful of our time.

1898
01:50:29,420 --> 01:50:34,420
 And thank you, Mark, for your inspiring sharing

1899
01:50:34,420 --> 01:50:36,340
 and lecture today.

1900
01:50:36,340 --> 01:50:39,700
 Do you have a few words that you would like to say to us

1901
01:50:39,700 --> 01:50:42,100
 before we finish our lecture today?

1902
01:50:42,100 --> 01:50:45,380
 - Just that I appreciate very much, of course,

1903
01:50:45,380 --> 01:50:47,780
 the good word for American evangelicalism,

1904
01:50:47,780 --> 01:50:51,780
 because there's many, many good words to say about it.

1905
01:50:51,780 --> 01:50:55,380
 And if I wasn't speaking under the title,

1906
01:50:55,380 --> 01:50:58,620
 the crisis of American white evangelicalism,

1907
01:50:58,620 --> 01:51:01,220
 I would have a very great deal to say

1908
01:51:01,220 --> 01:51:04,100
 about what is healthy and positive.

1909
01:51:04,100 --> 01:51:07,900
 But the assignment that I've been working on has been,

1910
01:51:07,900 --> 01:51:09,540
 how do we describe the crisis?

1911
01:51:09,540 --> 01:51:12,500
 And while it is certainly the case

1912
01:51:12,500 --> 01:51:16,300
 that there are many manifestations of evangelicalism

1913
01:51:16,300 --> 01:51:19,740
 that are not marked by this culture of whiteness

1914
01:51:19,740 --> 01:51:24,220
 and maleness that are thriving,

1915
01:51:24,220 --> 01:51:25,740
 not only in the United States,

1916
01:51:25,740 --> 01:51:29,420
 but obviously in places around the world.

1917
01:51:29,420 --> 01:51:30,660
 And I'm very grateful for that.

1918
01:51:30,660 --> 01:51:33,540
 There is still a dominant presence

1919
01:51:33,540 --> 01:51:35,660
 of white American evangelicalism

1920
01:51:35,660 --> 01:51:36,980
 that I think is the problem

1921
01:51:36,980 --> 01:51:40,420
 that I'm trying to work out this week.

1922
01:51:40,420 --> 01:51:43,140
 But I'm grateful for anyone who wants to speak

1923
01:51:43,140 --> 01:51:45,900
 about the positiveness of what's happening

1924
01:51:45,900 --> 01:51:48,300
 as an antidote to my critique.

1925
01:51:48,300 --> 01:51:50,820
 I would just also say that one resource

1926
01:51:50,820 --> 01:51:54,020
 that I would like to point you to is a book

1927
01:51:54,020 --> 01:51:56,860
 that was first a set of lectures

1928
01:51:57,820 --> 01:52:01,180
 that were given at Fuller by a number of people.

1929
01:52:01,180 --> 01:52:04,580
 But the title of the book is "Can White,"

1930
01:52:04,580 --> 01:52:09,580
 and that's in quotes, "Can White People Be Saved?"

1931
01:52:09,580 --> 01:52:14,180
 And it's a book in which the leading lecture

1932
01:52:14,180 --> 01:52:16,340
 and the title came from his lecture,

1933
01:52:16,340 --> 01:52:20,100
 was given by Dr. Willie Jennings at Yale,

1934
01:52:20,100 --> 01:52:22,220
 who is actually a Fuller alum,

1935
01:52:22,220 --> 01:52:26,420
 and who gave a lecture, which you can find online

1936
01:52:26,420 --> 01:52:29,980
 under that title, "Can White People Be Saved?"

1937
01:52:29,980 --> 01:52:31,460
 And it's Willie Jennings,

1938
01:52:31,460 --> 01:52:33,860
 and then it's me giving a response

1939
01:52:33,860 --> 01:52:36,700
 to Willie Jennings' lecture.

1940
01:52:36,700 --> 01:52:39,660
 And in that lecture, he's defining whiteness,

1941
01:52:39,660 --> 01:52:42,820
 not about melatonin color, as it were,

1942
01:52:42,820 --> 01:52:44,380
 the color of our skin,

1943
01:52:44,380 --> 01:52:48,940
 but about a social framework called whiteness,

1944
01:52:48,940 --> 01:52:51,420
 which is what I've been primarily talking about.

1945
01:52:51,420 --> 01:52:56,420
 And so if people are wanting a specific resource

1946
01:52:56,420 --> 01:52:59,420
 to follow up on, that would be one, two.

1947
01:52:59,420 --> 01:53:01,380
 You can easily find online the lecture,

1948
01:53:01,380 --> 01:53:02,900
 the video of the lecture,

1949
01:53:02,900 --> 01:53:06,980
 and my response to the book, you can find online as well.

1950
01:53:06,980 --> 01:53:09,820
 Thank you again for tonight and for your attentiveness,

1951
01:53:09,820 --> 01:53:11,860
 and I look forward to two more sessions together.

1952
01:53:11,860 --> 01:53:12,820
 Thank you.

1953
01:53:12,820 --> 01:53:14,260
 - Thank you, Mark.

1954
01:53:14,260 --> 01:53:15,900
 Do you have any, this one?

1955
01:53:15,900 --> 01:53:16,740
