[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (gentle music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:16.120]   - Good afternoon.
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.080]   Honorable guests, speakers,
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.180]   CGST family, brothers and sisters.
[00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.720]   It is my pleasure to welcome everyone
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.720]   to the CGST Josephine Soh Culture and Ethics Lecture Week.
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.400]   The CGST Josephine Soh Culture and Ethics Lectures
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.920]   are sponsored by the Josephine Soh Foundation.
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.520]   Every two years, we invite overseas scholars
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.960]   and church leaders to speak on issues regarding Christianity,
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.760]   culture and ethics that are of concern to Chinese believers.
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.040]   This year, we have the honor and privilege
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.480]   in welcoming Dr. Christopher Wright,
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.960]   Global Ambassador and Ministry Director
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.600]   of the Land-Game Partnership.
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.480]   He will be our keynote speaker
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.040]   for all four sessions of the lectures.
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.440]   We are grateful that Dr. Wright is present in person
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.900]   to speak to us, which we know
[00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.840]   is no longer given during COVID times.
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.120]   The theme for his lecture this week is "Written for Us,
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.120]   "The Old Testament as Christian Scripture."
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.600]   In this afternoon's first lecture,
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.280]   Dr. Wright will talk about the Old Testament
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.360]   and Christian identity.
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.200]   Who are we?
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.400]   After his speech, I will introduce our two correspondents
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.200]   who will give their responses, followed by time for Q&A.
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.320]   Now, please join us in welcoming Dr. Christopher Wright.
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.480]   (audience applauding)
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:58.640]   - Thank you.
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.360]   Thank you.
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.920]   Thank you so much, Professor Lee, for your welcome
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.680]   and to CGST for having me back.
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.800]   It's lovely to be here again.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.440]   I remember standing at this podium several times
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.760]   in the past and enjoying both some teaching
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.640]   and some lecturing over the years.
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.560]   So it's good to be back and back in Hong Kong
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.560]   and grateful to God that things have made it possible
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.800]   these days to do so.
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.880]   It is, of course, an honor as well to bring you greetings
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.160]   from my home city of London, where I live.
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.520]   That's London, England, not Ontario, London, England.
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.320]   And from my church, All Souls Church, Langham Place,
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.560]   from which the Langham Foundation here in Hong Kong
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.120]   gets the name, not from the hotel
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.840]   or from any shopping center,
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.360]   but from just the place where John Stott's church
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.080]   still is, All Souls Church, Langham Place.
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.320]   And so that's who I also represent
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.560]   and bring you greetings from them.
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.880]   And it is, of course, also a great honor
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.160]   to be invited to give these lectures,
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.280]   the Josephine Soh Lectures.
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.320]   And Simon Chung was giving me a little bit of background
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.680]   as to who she was and how influential she was
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.160]   and as the founder of the Breakthrough Center as well,
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.080]   where I've also had the privilege of staying
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.280]   several times in past years.
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.160]   So here we are then, as Professor Lee said,
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.200]   with the title written for us,
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.320]   The Old Testament as Christian Scripture.
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.280]   And some of you will know that that's my own field,
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.120]   is Old Testament studies, and particularly
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.000]   in their relevance to Christian ethics and mission.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.920]   So I'm going to be reading my lecture
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.320]   because I find that's the best way
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.440]   that I can make sure I keep on topic and roughly on time,
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.120]   and also so that my very esteemed responders
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.200]   won't hear anything different from what they've already read,
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.160]   which I'm sure is to their relief.
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.160]   So here is our first title,
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.400]   The Old Testament and Christian Identity, Who Are We?
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.920]   You see, the problem is that it's sadly true these days
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.720]   that many Christian believers wonder
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.720]   whether the Old Testament is really relevant to themselves.
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.280]   Or even if they accept that the Old Testament
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.160]   is part of the Bible and they ought to take it seriously,
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.640]   they struggle with how it relates
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.280]   to what they think of as their Christian faith.
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.520]   Is the Old Testament really compatible
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.080]   with Christianity, they think?
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.880]   Which is not only sad, but also deeply ironic,
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.960]   because putting the question that way round
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.800]   is the diametric opposite to the problem
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.560]   that was faced by the earliest followers of Jesus.
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.240]   You see, their question was not,
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.720]   as it is for so many today,
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.840]   is the Old Testament compatible with Christianity,
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.720]   rather they wrestled with the reverse question
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.240]   in their faith and their claims,
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.960]   namely, is the Christian church that we have formed,
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.080]   is it compatible with the scriptures?
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.320]   That is to say, they did not judge the scriptures,
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.920]   the authoritative word of God that they had
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.080]   in what we now call the Old Testament
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.000]   in the light of the Christian faith, but the reverse.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.720]   They evaluated their Christian claims
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.560]   in the light of what we now call the Old Testament,
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.280]   the scriptures that they had.
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.200]   And that was especially so in relation
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.760]   to this whole new multi-ethnic reality
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.560]   of Jews and Gentiles together claiming
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.720]   to be the covenant people of God
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.480]   without observing Jewish identity criteria
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.680]   such as circumcision or Sabbath observance or food laws.
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.120]   How could you justify that scripturally, in other words?
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.000]   Well, the apostle Paul, as we know,
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.680]   devotes the whole of the letter to the Galatians
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.840]   and some of the letter to the Romans to that very issue.
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.200]   And in these four lectures, I want to follow Paul's example,
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.140]   which is a good thing to do, I'm sure,
[00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.000]   as well as the example of Peter
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.080]   and indeed of Jesus himself in exploring
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.640]   how the Christian faith, that is the faith of the church,
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.480]   is deeply rooted and grounded
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.280]   in the Old Testament scriptures
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.480]   and therefore how our Christian faith,
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.400]   that is what we personally believe about ourselves
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.160]   and God, needs to be intentionally informed
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.920]   by those scriptures, which were our scriptures,
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:18.240]   I want to say, not written to us, of course,
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.720]   but certainly, as Paul says, written for us.
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.840]   And because the Old Testament is so vast
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.040]   and there are so many ways one could tackle this,
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.320]   I wanted to take this single theme
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:34.200]   of who are we as the church, as the people of God?
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.280]   What is our identity, our mission, our ethics,
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.800]   and our hope?
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.760]   And in each case of those four things,
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.640]   I want us to see that the New Testament itself
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.280]   draws profoundly on the scriptures,
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.080]   the scriptures of the Old Testament,
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.540]   in articulating its answers to those great themes.
[00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:54.860]   So here then is indeed the first one,
[00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.000]   the Old Testament and Christian identity,
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.840]   who are we, we as Christians, as the people of God?
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.620]   And I want to answer it in two ways,
[00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.080]   broadly speaking, over these next minutes.
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.600]   First of all, to say that we are a people
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.520]   who have been formed by God's story,
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:17.800]   and secondly, that we are a people created for God's glory.
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:22.080]   So first of all, a people formed by God's story,
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.400]   and secondly, a people created for God's glory.
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.760]   We think of both of those.
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:28.720]   So here's the first then,
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:32.420]   we are a people formed by God's story.
[00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.920]   Now, the story of God, of course,
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.640]   begins right at the beginning.
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.560]   In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth,
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.320]   and so this whole universe that we inhabit is,
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:46.640]   we are told, the creation of the one living personal God
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:51.400]   who made it good, created us human beings in his own image
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.760]   in order to rule over the earth on his behalf,
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:58.360]   in a sense, as kings within creation in Genesis 1,
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.420]   and to serve and to care for the earth,
[00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:04.480]   as he says to Adam in chapter two.
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.360]   So this is indeed the first thing
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.080]   we would have to say about ourselves
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.560]   if we're asking the question, who are we?
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:15.320]   Well, we are human beings created in the image of God
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.240]   and intended to function as God's kings and priests
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:23.240]   within God's creation, ruling and serving on God's behalf.
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.880]   That is a role which we'll see once or twice
[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.800]   as we go through these lectures, kings and priests,
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:33.120]   which we meet again in the case of Israel in Exodus 19,
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:36.040]   and again in the identity of the church
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:39.880]   in 1 Peter chapter two, and eschatologically
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:43.400]   in the book of Revelation at the very end of the Bible
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.920]   as the redeemed humanity from all nations
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.880]   whom God will have made kings and priests for him.
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.120]   So the story of creation, but then, of course,
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.840]   as we know with the entrance of sin and evil
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.720]   into human life, this all went wrong.
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.560]   Everything was fractured, broken, and distorted.
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:01.380]   Why?
[00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:05.440]   Because we chose, we chose to rebel against our creator,
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:09.480]   to substitute our own moral autonomy for his authority.
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.600]   We would choose what it is to be good or evil
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.800]   and not depend on God, and so we have brought
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:19.920]   into this world all manner of personal and social sin,
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:24.120]   fear, anger, violence, injustice, oppression, corruption,
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:25.920]   and it's all there.
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:29.040]   It's early in the Bible, it's Genesis four to 11.
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:32.340]   So we exploit, we pollute, we destroy the earth
[00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.340]   that God told us to care for,
[00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:37.340]   and we fight and kill one another.
[00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:40.340]   And so that story, that early story of the fall
[00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:44.420]   comes to its climax in chapter 11 with the Tower of Babel
[00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:48.080]   where God, in order to prevent humanity
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:51.140]   from frustrating his purposes, which was that we should
[00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:53.900]   scatter and fill the earth, which was happening
[00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.380]   in Genesis 10, we wanted to stop that
[00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:59.660]   by this arrogant homolinguistic unity
[00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:01.300]   of the Tower of Babel.
[00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:05.940]   God confuses human languages, scatters the nations anyway,
[00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:08.640]   but scatters them in division and misunderstanding
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:09.560]   of one another.
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:13.980]   So by the end of that part of the Bible story, Genesis 11,
[00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:17.060]   we find a humanity that is fractured and divided,
[00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:20.580]   scattered over the face of an earth that has been cursed.
[00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:23.300]   So is there any hope for humanity?
[00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:24.660]   But the story continues, doesn't it?
[00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:27.660]   The great Bible story moves from creation through fall
[00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:29.820]   to redemption within history,
[00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:32.820]   leading to its ultimate climax in the new creation.
[00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:34.300]   And that is a story that takes us
[00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:35.820]   through the rest of the Bible,
[00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:39.100]   from Genesis 12 to Revelation 22,
[00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:41.220]   centered, of course, on the cross
[00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:43.740]   and the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:47.180]   And it will come to its climax when Christ returns
[00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:50.580]   to reign over the new creation.
[00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:52.060]   And the great thing about this story
[00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:55.620]   is that it involves humanity, who we are,
[00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:58.820]   in this world of nations from beginning to end.
[00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:01.740]   In Genesis 11, the nations of the world
[00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:06.740]   are united in arrogance, but then scattered in confusion.
[00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:10.460]   Whereas in Revelation 7, they will be gathered
[00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:12.780]   as a great multitude whom no one could count,
[00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:15.460]   from every nation, tribe, people, and language,
[00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:17.860]   but they will be gathered in unity
[00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:20.640]   to worship the Lord who was on the throne,
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.660]   the Lamb of God himself.
[00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:24.500]   And that picture there in Revelation,
[00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:26.940]   at the end of the Bible, the end of the story,
[00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:29.620]   is, of course, a portrait of the church.
[00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:33.280]   It is us, the multinational community
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:35.500]   of God's redeemed humanity.
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:38.160]   And that takes you right back to the promise
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.540]   that God first made to Abraham,
[00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:44.100]   that through him all nations on earth would be blessed.
[00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:46.560]   So we are the people, then, in that sense,
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:51.100]   who have been created within and for this story,
[00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:54.860]   this story of God, this story of God's purposes
[00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:57.100]   for the earth, his creation,
[00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:00.220]   and for all the nations who live on it.
[00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:01.340]   That's who we are.
[00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:05.580]   We are that redeemed people of God within the Bible story.
[00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:09.560]   But let's look at that in just a little bit more detail
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:13.460]   from two other perspectives, as you can see on the screen,
[00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:17.220]   that we are also the community, or we learn from,
[00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:20.180]   the community of Abraham in the book of Genesis,
[00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:23.080]   where God first talks about bringing blessing
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.360]   to all the nations and his descendants.
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:27.860]   And then also from Abraham, of course,
[00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:31.740]   we are from the community of Israel of the Old Testament.
[00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:36.580]   What was their story that helps us to understand ours?
[00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:39.280]   So what, then, can we learn about this community
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:42.880]   from the call of Abraham and those early stories?
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:44.220]   I want to suggest four things,
[00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:45.740]   as you can see on the screen,
[00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:48.440]   that we are a community of blessing,
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:52.300]   of faith, obedience, and hope.
[00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:55.260]   We see all of those four things in the story of Abraham,
[00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:59.100]   and they also are the marks of the people of Abraham,
[00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:02.080]   the seed of Abraham, as Paul calls us.
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.980]   First of all, a community of blessing.
[00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:09.980]   Now, blessing was indeed God's first word to creation,
[00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.220]   apart from the word of creation itself.
[00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:14.280]   You remember there, back in Genesis 1,
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:19.280]   he successfully blesses his own acts of creation.
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:21.760]   And then, after the flood,
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:26.760]   God blesses Noah with a covenant with all life on earth.
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:29.540]   So blessing comes back, in a sense,
[00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:31.840]   into creation with Noah.
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:34.760]   But then, as you know, the repeated sin and failure
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:37.120]   that goes on in the following chapters
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:41.360]   seems to reinforce what chapter three had said
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.660]   about God's curse on the earth.
[00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:46.060]   Where can blessing be found
[00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:48.660]   in a world which lies under God's curse?
[00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:51.460]   Even Noah's own father was worried about that.
[00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:55.020]   Oh, that God would lift the curse from the earth.
[00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:57.080]   And so, with Abraham,
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:59.640]   when the language of blessing comes back,
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.420]   and God says, "I will bless you,
[00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:02.960]   "and you will be a blessing,
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:05.460]   "and through you, all nations will be blessed,"
[00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:08.860]   there is, in a sense, a fresh start there,
[00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:10.980]   in Genesis chapter 12.
[00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:12.920]   But the point I want to make here is
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:16.260]   that that blessing is not just a blessing received,
[00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.500]   but a mandate that, through you,
[00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:22.460]   all nations will be blessed, will come into blessing.
[00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:25.560]   So here, then, is a community, God's people,
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:28.280]   who both experience the blessing of God
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:32.060]   and are the means of that being passed on to others.
[00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:35.740]   Blessing received and blessing shared
[00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:37.200]   is part of the very essence
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.600]   of what it means to be the people of God.
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:43.320]   If we are to live within the story that God puts us in,
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:47.340]   then being a people of blessing is part of our identity.
[00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:49.520]   We could spend the rest of the day
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:52.160]   just talking about what that would mean in practice,
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.800]   but I think, in principle, it's very important.
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.680]   Then, secondly, a community of faith,
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:58.920]   because we are told, aren't we,
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:02.000]   that Abraham believed God,
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.460]   and it was credited to him as righteousness.
[00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:08.340]   That's what it says in Genesis 15, verse six,
[00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:10.340]   and, of course, Paul quotes that
[00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:14.120]   in Galatians, chapter three, verse six.
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:17.240]   When he is showing how we are within Abraham,
[00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:19.620]   he makes that connection between the faith
[00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:22.020]   and the righteousness of Abraham.
[00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:24.440]   Hebrews, of course, also strongly highlights
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.800]   Abraham as a man of faith,
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:29.880]   has a lot about Abraham's faith in Hebrews 11,
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:34.320]   "Having earlier said," Hebrews, that is, "about Enoch,
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:38.540]   "that without faith it is impossible to please God."
[00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:41.940]   So the community, then, that stems from Abraham
[00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:46.460]   must be a people who will trust the promise of God
[00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:49.700]   rather than trusting in their own ability
[00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:52.020]   to build something for their own security,
[00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:53.980]   which they tried to do at Babel.
[00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:56.620]   Remember, in chapter 11, there we find a people
[00:15:56.620 --> 00:16:00.660]   who want to build a tower for themselves, as it were,
[00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:04.360]   and God says, "Now I will bless you if you will trust me,
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:08.320]   "that through you all nations will be blessed."
[00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:10.360]   So Abraham, then, as a man of faith,
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.960]   as a believer in God's promises,
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:16.840]   is one of the reasons why one of the earliest names
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:20.120]   for Christians, even before they were called Christians,
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.920]   is that we are believers.
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.160]   We are people of faith.
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:28.520]   We are called to participate in the story of God,
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:32.000]   God's plan for creation, God's plan for humanity.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.900]   It's a story which has a future, a future new creation,
[00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:38.800]   and when we enter into that story,
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:41.960]   we put our faith in the God of the story
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:44.280]   and say, "I believe that God will accomplish
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:46.080]   "what he will accomplish,"
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:48.280]   because he has already proved it, of course,
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:51.840]   in the cross and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:54.340]   So a community of blessing, of faith,
[00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:56.840]   and thirdly, of obedience.
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:17:01.440]   It was because of his faith that Abraham obeyed God.
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.600]   In fact, Romans stresses that,
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:07.200]   so does Hebrew, so does James in his letter.
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:09.560]   Abraham got up, he left his homeland,
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:11.800]   he went out at God's command,
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:16.200]   and in the supreme test, in Genesis chapter 22,
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:19.680]   he was even prepared to sacrifice his own son,
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:23.680]   the son of the promise, in order to obey God
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:26.200]   until God intervened to stop him.
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:29.520]   And you remember that the way in which Hebrews
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:32.320]   interprets that is that Abraham must have even believed
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:34.840]   that God had the power to raise the dead,
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:37.240]   because if the promise of God was going to be fulfilled
[00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:40.840]   through Isaac, then somehow Isaac must survive
[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:42.580]   in order to have descendants.
[00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:46.640]   So Abraham was prepared to believe God and to obey God,
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:49.120]   and in fact, God then comments on that
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:53.360]   in Genesis chapter 22, after he has stopped Abraham
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.960]   from actually sacrificing his son.
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:59.080]   God says twice at the beginning and the end of that section,
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:02.160]   he says, "Because you have obeyed me,
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.160]   "because you have done this,"
[00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.400]   God renews his promise and his oath
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:09.480]   to bring blessing to the nations.
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:12.120]   And so that's why, as I said, in Hebrews 11
[00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:16.440]   and James chapter two, they set Abraham's obedience
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:20.520]   alongside Abraham's faith as the proof
[00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:23.520]   of his authentic relationship with God,
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:27.400]   which then both Paul and Hebrews and James
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:31.200]   all emphasize as being fundamental to Christian experience
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:35.040]   and Christian imitation, belief and obey.
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:37.760]   And then fourthly, a community of hope,
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:40.400]   because you see that promise of God to Abraham,
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:43.320]   that through, that he would become a great nation
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.040]   and that through his people,
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:48.080]   all nations on earth would experience blessing,
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:51.440]   that remained the foundation for Israel's hope
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:54.920]   for the future all through the succeeding generations
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:59.520]   and centuries, even in times of the most appalling
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:03.040]   unfaithfulness, even in times of God's judgment,
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:08.040]   they knew that God would not, could not abandon his people.
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.260]   Or at least he could not do it
[00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.720]   without breaking his covenant with Abraham.
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:15.080]   And he couldn't break his covenant with Abraham
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.960]   because that had been sworn on God's own self,
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:21.440]   by myself have I sworn, says the Lord.
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:24.900]   So God was eternally committed by his own existence
[00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:28.120]   in a sense to keep his promise to Abraham.
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:31.560]   And that promise of course, included not only
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:33.560]   that Israel would be a people
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:35.980]   and therefore they would continue as a people,
[00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:38.120]   but that through him all nations on earth
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.520]   would find blessing.
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:43.080]   And so the hope of Israel, as Paul would put it later,
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:45.600]   is indeed hope for the world.
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:48.920]   That's why Simeon with baby Jesus in his arms
[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:51.660]   could say that he was seeing the Lord's salvation,
[00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:54.680]   not just the glory of his people Israel,
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:57.180]   but a light to lighten the nations.
[00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:58.920]   The mission of God through Abraham
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:01.200]   generates the mission of God's people
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.120]   to the ends of the earth.
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:05.040]   And of course, we think more about that
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:09.000]   in the next lecture later this afternoon,
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.700]   when we're thinking about the mission of God's people.
[00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:15.680]   So to summarize then this part of our lecture,
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:19.280]   the church, when we trace our roots back to God's call
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:21.000]   and promise to Abraham,
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   finds here some key identity marks or markers
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.400]   that are established right there at the beginning
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.880]   of the story in the book of Genesis.
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:33.000]   As the seed of Abraham,
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.480]   we are a community that not only experiences
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:37.180]   the blessing of God,
[00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:40.100]   but are commissioned to be the means of blessing others.
[00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:42.380]   We are a community that live by faith
[00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:44.380]   in the promises of God,
[00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:47.580]   and prove that faith by practical
[00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:50.960]   and sometimes sacrificial obedience to God.
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:53.100]   And it is a community of hope,
[00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:54.660]   a hope for the future,
[00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:57.100]   which is guaranteed because God is sovereign
[00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:58.880]   and will always keep his word.
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:01.660]   So that's something that we learn
[00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:03.740]   simply from the book of Genesis,
[00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:07.260]   and the way it is then applied in the New Testament.
[00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:08.980]   But I wanted to move on secondly,
[00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:10.540]   on the screen as you can see,
[00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:12.420]   to Israel's story,
[00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:15.660]   the ongoing story of the Old Testament.
[00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:18.100]   Because if the church as the biblical people of God
[00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:20.660]   began really with Abraham, as we did,
[00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:22.260]   then we need to give some attention
[00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:27.220]   to the rest of that Old Testament part of our story.
[00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:30.780]   And to look at some of the significant moments
[00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:32.700]   in that story of Israel,
[00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:34.740]   and the theological inferences
[00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:38.460]   that are then drawn from that story and those events
[00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:40.460]   in terms of the relationship with God,
[00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:42.780]   and then how they are reflected
[00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:44.940]   in what the New Testament says
[00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:46.860]   about the Christian church's existence
[00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:49.100]   and our mission in the world.
[00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:52.180]   Now, just at this point as a slightly as an aside,
[00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:54.020]   but I think a quite an important one.
[00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:58.340]   I want to be very clear that this is not as
[00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:02.060]   I'm sometimes accused of a super sessionist argument,
[00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:04.580]   that is a replacement theology,
[00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:07.580]   as if to say that the Christian church
[00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:11.540]   has simply replaced the Jews in the plan of God.
[00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:14.020]   As some people say, well, God had the Jews up to here,
[00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:16.300]   got fed up with them, now he's got the Christians.
[00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:19.540]   That kind of very simplistic super sessionism
[00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:22.260]   is not what I'm saying.
[00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:25.340]   Rather, what the New Testament does affirm
[00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:27.820]   is that that Old Testament, as we call it,
[00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:31.140]   that scriptural story of Israel
[00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:35.340]   has found its climax, its life, and its fulfillment
[00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:40.140]   in the life and death and resurrection of Israel's Messiah,
[00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:44.140]   Jesus of Nazareth, and that through the Messiah,
[00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:48.860]   Israel's story, Israel's reality continues, grows,
[00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:52.660]   is fulfilled in the identity and mission of God
[00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:55.060]   through this multinational community of people,
[00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:59.500]   including believing Jews and Gentiles in Christ,
[00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:03.140]   as Paul puts it in Romans and Galatians.
[00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:07.860]   In other words, it's not that the church replaces the Jews,
[00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:11.540]   but that Israel expands to include the Gentiles
[00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:15.020]   in God's fulfillment, as he always said they would.
[00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:16.660]   So I just wanted to get that point in
[00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:18.660]   in order to try to at least clarify
[00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:22.180]   and defend myself against that accusation.
[00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:25.140]   So here are, again, just three main points,
[00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:28.140]   and one at the end of the story of Israel.
[00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:30.460]   First of all, of course, election.
[00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:32.020]   The foundation of Israel's faith
[00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:36.980]   was that God had chosen them as his own people
[00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:39.780]   through the historic act of calling Abraham
[00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:41.740]   out of Ur of the Chaldees,
[00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:44.100]   and then making those remarkable promises
[00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:45.780]   to Abraham and Sarah.
[00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:48.660]   So Israel knew that they were not a nation
[00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:53.300]   who happened to have chosen to worship this particular God,
[00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:56.380]   but rather this God, Yahweh God,
[00:23:56.380 --> 00:24:00.100]   had chosen them as a particular people.
[00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:02.540]   They would not exist on the planet
[00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:04.980]   apart from God's choice and God's calling
[00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:06.900]   and God's creation.
[00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:09.900]   And so two things need to be said immediately about that,
[00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:14.620]   which also apply to us as their followers.
[00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:16.940]   First of all, that Israel were not to imagine
[00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:20.900]   that their election by God, that is God's choice of them,
[00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:23.820]   owed anything to their greatness,
[00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:26.900]   numerical or moral superiority.
[00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:29.540]   Far from it, they are told in the book of Deuteronomy
[00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:31.700]   several times, they were a tiny nation,
[00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:33.580]   they were an insignificant people,
[00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:35.540]   and they were certainly no more righteous
[00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:36.820]   than other nations.
[00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:40.380]   No, the roots of their election lay exclusively
[00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:44.140]   in the love and the grace of God.
[00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:46.780]   He loved them because he loved them.
[00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:50.060]   And that's axiomatic, you can't get behind that.
[00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:52.700]   There's no other reason given among them.
[00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:54.540]   So it's based on the grace and love of God.
[00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:57.100]   And secondly, that they had been chosen
[00:24:57.100 --> 00:25:00.540]   for the sake of the rest of the nations.
[00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:03.860]   So blessing choosing Abraham and his descendants
[00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:07.020]   was God's intended means of bringing blessing
[00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:08.900]   to all the nations that were there
[00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:11.500]   in Genesis chapter 10 especially.
[00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:15.580]   So election then means being chosen for that task,
[00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:20.180]   to be the means by which God will fulfill his mission.
[00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:23.060]   And what then of the church in the light of this?
[00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:27.620]   Well, you said Peter to the Christians
[00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:30.380]   that he was writing to in his letter, 1 Peter,
[00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:34.900]   you he said, you are that chosen people.
[00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:37.740]   In other words, he takes that language of the Old Testament
[00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:41.060]   and he applies it to this multinational community
[00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:44.660]   of believers in Jesus the Messiah, Jews and Gentiles,
[00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:47.580]   who are standing then in organic continuity
[00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:51.460]   with Old Testament Israel as the elect people of God,
[00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:54.340]   which is the language he uses in his first chapter.
[00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:57.620]   And so the same two points apply to us
[00:25:57.620 --> 00:26:01.940]   if we want to think about election as part of our identity
[00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:03.140]   as the people of God.
[00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:06.740]   First of all, that it's entirely by God's grace.
[00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:09.020]   There is nothing at all about us
[00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:12.580]   that made us worthy of God choosing us.
[00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:13.980]   It's by God's grace.
[00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:18.940]   And secondly, that it is fundamentally missional in purpose.
[00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:21.980]   That's to say our election being chosen by God
[00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:24.260]   is not so that we would be the only ones
[00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:26.540]   who would ever enjoy salvation,
[00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:27.940]   but that we would be the means
[00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:30.940]   by which God will bring salvation to others,
[00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:33.220]   which is what Peter goes on to emphasize
[00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:35.940]   immediately after that in chapter two,
[00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:38.740]   that we're to live such godly lives among the nations
[00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:41.700]   that they will see something of the glory of God
[00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:43.580]   and come to praise our God.
[00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:45.780]   So the church then exists in the world
[00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:48.540]   just as Israel did in the Old Testament
[00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:52.420]   as a community that God has chosen and called
[00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:54.900]   in order to serve God's mission
[00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:57.820]   of bringing the nations of the world ultimately
[00:26:57.820 --> 00:27:01.220]   from their condition in Genesis four to 11
[00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:03.460]   in rebellion against God
[00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:06.220]   to that portrayed in Revelation seven
[00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:09.820]   as a community of nations in worship and praise
[00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:11.860]   of the God as their redeemer.
[00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:14.540]   And we'll talk a bit more about that in the next lecture.
[00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:15.620]   So that's election.
[00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:19.860]   Secondly, redemption is a word that is used,
[00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:22.020]   first of all, in the Old Testament about Israel.
[00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:25.980]   They were a people whom God had redeemed.
[00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:27.820]   And the language of redemption, of course,
[00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:29.460]   goes back to the Exodus, doesn't it?
[00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:31.820]   To that great historical deliverance
[00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:34.980]   of their ancestors from slavery in Egypt.
[00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:39.140]   And they saw that Exodus as proof of God's love
[00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:42.300]   and God's justice and God's power and greatness.
[00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:43.620]   That's why they could sing about it
[00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:46.460]   and celebrate it as they did in Exodus 15,
[00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:49.020]   but also, of course, in many of the Psalms.
[00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:51.580]   And so there's a huge range of vocabulary
[00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:54.780]   of words and concepts that are linked to the Exodus.
[00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:59.780]   Redemption, salvation, mighty acts, justice, and so on.
[00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:02.100]   And then, of course, it leads through
[00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:04.660]   into the law and the covenant and the worship
[00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:07.940]   that they had in the book of Psalms and elsewhere.
[00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:10.740]   And this memory of the Exodus was kept alive
[00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:13.420]   through the annual Passover salvation
[00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:15.780]   because Israel was a people who remembered
[00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:19.420]   and renewed and refreshed their historical memory
[00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:20.900]   year after year after year.
[00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:24.980]   They knew their God, Yahweh, above all
[00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:27.540]   as their saving redeemer God.
[00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:29.940]   That's the language of Exodus.
[00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:31.740]   Now, when we come to the New Testament,
[00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:34.220]   of course, it's very clear that the New Testament
[00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:39.220]   sees the cross of Christ through the lens of the Exodus.
[00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:42.180]   In fact, on the Mount of Transfiguration,
[00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:45.660]   we read, Luke tells us in Luke 9, verse 31,
[00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:49.220]   that when the disciples saw Jesus in his glory
[00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:51.620]   on the Mount of Transfiguration
[00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:54.500]   conversing with Moses and Elijah,
[00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:57.880]   and what they were talking about was, says Luke,
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:02.880]   the Exodus that Jesus was going to accomplish in Jerusalem.
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:06.020]   It's usually translated as his departure,
[00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:08.700]   which is a sort of airport term,
[00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:11.220]   which is not really the way in which we usually speak
[00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:13.620]   about our death, and we don't usually speak
[00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:16.660]   about our death as something we accomplish.
[00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:18.020]   Did you accomplish dying?
[00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:19.980]   No, no, you just die.
[00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:23.340]   But these are discussing the Exodus
[00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:26.260]   that Jesus would accomplish in Jerusalem,
[00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:28.540]   speaking, of course, of the cross.
[00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:30.300]   Because it was at the cross, wasn't it,
[00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:33.840]   that God achieved, accomplished the redemption of the world,
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:37.140]   defeated the force of evil, liberated his people.
[00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:40.060]   And so we as Christians, we look back to Calvary
[00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:42.260]   and to the cross, and through the cross,
[00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:44.860]   back with Israel to the Exodus.
[00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:47.740]   Because as Paul puts it, Christ, our Passover lamb,
[00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:51.220]   has been sacrificed for us, and therefore,
[00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:55.440]   we have had our Exodus experience when God brought us,
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:57.580]   as Peter would say, out of darkness
[00:29:57.580 --> 00:29:59.580]   into his marvelous light.
[00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:02.380]   So we too are a people who have experienced
[00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:06.660]   the redeeming, delivering power of God through the cross.
[00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:09.220]   That means that we too, like Israel,
[00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:12.620]   are a people of memory and of hope.
[00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:15.300]   We look back and we look forward.
[00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:19.540]   And we do both also through a meal, the Passover meal having,
[00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:23.180]   in a sense, been absorbed into the Eucharist, the Lord's
[00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:27.500]   Supper, which was significantly instituted in the Passover meal
[00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:30.580]   immediately before Jesus died on the cross.
[00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:32.660]   So again, we see that the church stands
[00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:37.540]   in this organic, spiritual, theological continuity
[00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:40.780]   with God's people, Israel, in the Old Testament.
[00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:45.140]   So election, redemption, and then thirdly, covenant.
[00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:47.900]   This is another, of course, dominant concept
[00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:51.860]   in Israel's theology, this covenant relationship with God.
[00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:54.340]   Goes back originally to Abraham, where
[00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:59.860]   it involves a combination of promise and response.
[00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:03.020]   There's a promise and a commitment made by God.
[00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:05.460]   God says, this is what I'm going to do.
[00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:07.980]   And then there's a required response for Abraham,
[00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:12.060]   walk before me in obedience, trust and obey.
[00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:15.140]   God promised Abraham, and Abraham's response
[00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:16.140]   is faith and obedience.
[00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:18.740]   That's the essence of the covenant.
[00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:21.660]   And then, of course, shortly after that in the Bible,
[00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:23.340]   you get to the book of Exodus.
[00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:25.780]   You arrive at Mount Sinai with the Israelites
[00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:28.100]   after they've been redeemed out of Egypt.
[00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:31.460]   And the covenant-making ceremony takes place there
[00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:34.940]   in Exodus chapters 19 to 24.
[00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:38.340]   And within that context, God makes known his personal name,
[00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:41.460]   Yahweh, the name which is then associated forever
[00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:45.980]   after with the Exodus and with God's saving power.
[00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:50.060]   God redeems his name, his character, his law.
[00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:52.340]   His covenant is made with Israel.
[00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:56.100]   He's committed to them in salvation and protection
[00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:57.220]   and blessing.
[00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:59.940]   And he calls them to be committed to him
[00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:04.100]   in covenantal obedience and worship exclusively of God,
[00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:05.900]   Yahweh God alone.
[00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:10.500]   And so the law of Israel, which then follows in Exodus
[00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:13.140]   and then also, of course, in Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
[00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:16.340]   the gift of God's law comes in that context.
[00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:18.500]   This is so important to grasp this,
[00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:22.980]   that God gives his law to people whom he has already redeemed.
[00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:26.460]   The covenant is made on the basis of the grace
[00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:28.860]   and the redemption of God.
[00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:31.900]   And we'll think a bit more about that in the third lecture
[00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:34.860]   when we're looking at the ethics of Israel.
[00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:37.820]   So here again, we find just as with election
[00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:42.020]   and with redemption, we find this organic theological
[00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:45.500]   continuity because the church is the people
[00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:49.300]   of the new covenant, which is foretold in the Old Testament
[00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:52.900]   explicitly by Jeremiah, but referred to in other ways
[00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:54.260]   by other prophets.
[00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:57.700]   And the new covenant is inaugurated quite explicitly
[00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:01.100]   by Jesus Christ just before his death.
[00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:03.740]   In fact, in the context of his death.
[00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:06.940]   And those words of Jesus at the Last Supper
[00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:10.780]   where he uses the words which we use again and again
[00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:13.580]   in the Lord's Supper or the Holy Communion
[00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:15.980]   echo these Old Testament texts.
[00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:19.260]   Jesus says, "This is the blood of the covenant,"
[00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:21.140]   which echoes Exodus 24.
[00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:23.980]   He said, "Which has been poured out for many,"
[00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:26.500]   which is an echo of Isaiah 53.
[00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:28.900]   "For the forgiveness of sins,"
[00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:31.460]   which is an echo of Jeremiah 31.
[00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:35.540]   So in so many ways, the deepest moment
[00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:38.260]   of our Christian identity in the Holy Communion
[00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:41.060]   is saturated with words and language
[00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:43.820]   which come from the Old Testament itself.
[00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:46.380]   So here we are then, we are a community
[00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:49.620]   of experience of God's election and God's redemption
[00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:52.820]   and God's covenant united to the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:54.820]   through faith in his blood.
[00:33:56.020 --> 00:33:59.660]   But the last word on that page,
[00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:03.900]   these were the great foundational truths of Israel.
[00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:07.660]   These were the great, in a sense, historical realities
[00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:11.100]   of their existence and their theology.
[00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:15.500]   But we know that they struggled with all of these
[00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:20.500]   as a human nation in the midst of a world of nations
[00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:24.500]   all just as fallen and sinful as one another.
[00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:26.340]   Indeed, the prophets tell Israel
[00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:28.500]   that they become even more wicked
[00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:30.340]   than the surrounding nations.
[00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:34.020]   And so the Old Testament records honestly and painfully
[00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:36.940]   and surprisingly, given that this is
[00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:39.080]   the national literature of the nation,
[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:42.500]   the Old Testament records Israel's failures
[00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:45.260]   alongside the affirmations of their faith
[00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:46.460]   and their aspirations.
[00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:50.820]   This is who they knew they were and what they wanted to be,
[00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:52.740]   but this is how they actually failed.
[00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:56.780]   They sinned, they suffered, they fail internally,
[00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:58.920]   they are attacked externally.
[00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:00.660]   And their whole history of Israel,
[00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:02.820]   as we know in the Old Testament,
[00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:06.520]   is just one long catalog of struggle
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:09.700]   between those who brought the word of God to them,
[00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:11.420]   taught them what they needed to believe,
[00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:14.340]   the prophets, the psalmists, Moses, and so on,
[00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:17.900]   and those who at street level, as we might say,
[00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:20.040]   were determined to resist the will of God
[00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:21.460]   and the ways of God.
[00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:25.260]   And yet, of course, the apostle Paul
[00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:30.260]   discerns and realizes this enormous paradox
[00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:33.420]   that it was through that failure of Israel,
[00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:36.700]   even to the point of rejecting their own Messiah
[00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:38.240]   and putting him to death,
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:43.220]   which in God's foreknowledge and God's sovereignty
[00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:46.440]   would be the means by which God would bring redemption,
[00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:48.500]   not only to the Jews, the Israelites,
[00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:50.940]   who would believe in Christ and accepted him
[00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:54.020]   as Messiah, but also to those from any nation
[00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:55.900]   and every nation, the Gentiles,
[00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:58.260]   who would come through faith in Jesus
[00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:00.800]   into the blessing of Abraham, as he explained.
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:04.540]   So there then, in all those ways,
[00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:07.820]   to get this sort of, so it's more than halfway through,
[00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:10.140]   this first part, that we are a people
[00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:12.520]   who stand in organic continuity,
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:14.220]   I've used that word several times,
[00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:17.260]   with Old Testament reason, with Old Testament Israel,
[00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:20.460]   because, in a sense, we share the same story.
[00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:23.220]   The people of God, we are the people
[00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:25.940]   who are chosen and called by God
[00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:28.440]   for his purpose of blessing the nations.
[00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:31.280]   We are also, like them, people who have experienced
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:34.500]   the redeeming grace and power of God in history,
[00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:36.660]   for them through the Exodus, ultimately, of course,
[00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:39.100]   for all people through Christ on the cross.
[00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:41.460]   We are people who stand in a committed,
[00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:43.820]   covenant relationship with God
[00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:45.700]   through the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:48.260]   enjoying the security of his promises
[00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:51.620]   and responding with exclusive loyalty and obedience.
[00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:54.660]   We are a people who have been set apart by him
[00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:58.600]   to live in distinct, holy ways in the world,
[00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:00.320]   as we'll think about later.
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:03.400]   And we are a people who, like them,
[00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:07.000]   show this, as it were, this tension
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   between knowing the God we worship
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.040]   and wanting to live for him,
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:14.120]   and yet struggling with all the ambiguities
[00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:18.400]   and pain and struggle of historical life on this planet,
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:21.920]   in which nothing is perfect, especially ourselves,
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:23.480]   that we also struggle.
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:25.300]   So in all these ways, it seems,
[00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:28.000]   the church stands in continuity with Israel,
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.320]   the same promise, the same inheritance,
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:32.000]   the same ultimate gospel.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.640]   Their story is our story.
[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:36.660]   It's one story, the story of God.
[00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:39.920]   That leads to the second big area
[00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:40.960]   that I wanted to bring to us,
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:43.420]   not only a people formed by God's story,
[00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:46.900]   but a people created for God's glory.
[00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:50.220]   Now that phrase itself, of course,
[00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:52.320]   comes from the Old Testament,
[00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:54.160]   from what God says through Isaiah.
[00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:57.080]   This is Isaiah 43, verses six and seven.
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:59.280]   "Bring my sons from afar and my daughters
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:00.680]   "from the ends of the earth,
[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:03.040]   "everyone who is called by my name,
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:06.360]   "whom I created for my glory,
[00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:08.420]   "whom I formed and made," says God.
[00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:13.180]   "My people, my chosen, the people I formed for myself,
[00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:16.120]   "that they may proclaim my praise,
[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:20.800]   "created for my glory, created to proclaim my praise."
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:22.360]   That's the language of Isaiah.
[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:26.880]   Now, Jeremiah provides an interesting metaphor
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:29.960]   for this particular purpose of God
[00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:32.080]   in creating his people, to create somebody
[00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:35.440]   that would be glorifying and praising to him.
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:37.720]   It comes in Jeremiah chapter 13.
[00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:41.720]   It's a kind of acted prophecy, one of several.
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:43.660]   You remember, well, I don't know if you remember it,
[00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:44.780]   but I'll tell you anyway.
[00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:47.780]   In Jeremiah chapter 13, God tells Jeremiah
[00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:52.420]   to go and buy a brand new linen waistband.
[00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:54.140]   Our Bibles often say just belt,
[00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:55.220]   but it's more than just a belt.
[00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:57.340]   It would be a whole band around his waist
[00:38:57.340 --> 00:39:00.500]   of lovely, bright, clean, white linen,
[00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:02.780]   such as the priests would wear.
[00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:05.540]   And so he wears this for a while around Jerusalem.
[00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:08.020]   Imagine people, "Oh, nice, nice, nice clothes, Jeremiah.
[00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:10.740]   "Very, very smart," you know, that they'd be saying to him.
[00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:15.740]   But then God tells him to go and bury it in some wet soil.
[00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:17.820]   It says by the river Euphrates.
[00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:19.240]   He won't be going quite that far,
[00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:21.160]   but he buries it for a long time.
[00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:23.840]   So then he goes back to get it, to retrieve it,
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:25.860]   and it's become rotten and unwearable.
[00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:26.820]   It's falling apart.
[00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:29.460]   It's full of mud and worms and all of that
[00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:30.400]   being in the soil.
[00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:33.740]   And so that's the way God says it's like
[00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:34.860]   for him with Israel.
[00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:37.260]   And I now quote Jeremiah 13.
[00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:40.340]   "For as a belt is wound around the waist
[00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:44.080]   "so I, God, I bound all the people of Israel
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:46.760]   "and all the people of Judah to me, says the Lord,
[00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:51.760]   "to be my people for my renown and my praise and my honor."
[00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:57.460]   See, God says, "I created Israel so that I could look good."
[00:39:57.460 --> 00:39:59.580]   God wanted his people, as it were,
[00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:04.300]   to be something that would be commendable to the wearer.
[00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:05.820]   You know, when I say to my wife,
[00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:08.180]   "What a really lovely dress you're wearing, my dear,"
[00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:09.380]   I don't often say that, but you know,
[00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:10.540]   if I were to say that to her,
[00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:12.460]   "It's a lovely dress you're wearing,"
[00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:15.540]   my compliment is for her, not really the dress,
[00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:19.020]   I'm saying, "You look good dressed like that.
[00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:22.660]   "It makes you look beautiful, that dress."
[00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:24.700]   And that, in a sense, is what God is saying here
[00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:25.540]   about Israel.
[00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:28.940]   He wanted Israel to make the God they worship
[00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:30.960]   look good in the eyes of the nations,
[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:32.380]   that when people would look at Israel,
[00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:34.340]   they'd say, "Who's their God?"
[00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:35.380]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:37.540]   So that's God's intention,
[00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:39.460]   that the quality of Israel's life
[00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:42.140]   would display something of the glory of their God
[00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:44.060]   and bring him praise among the nations.
[00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:45.840]   But the tragedy was, of course,
[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:49.580]   that the rottenness of their sinful, rebellious society
[00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:51.860]   meant that they were nothing but an embarrassment to God,
[00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:56.040]   a disgrace, like a rotten garment would be to its wearer.
[00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:58.820]   You know, Yahweh couldn't be seen wearing those people,
[00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:00.820]   couldn't go out looking like that,
[00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:03.220]   is the intention of the metaphor.
[00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:06.260]   So God's people are created for God's glory.
[00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:09.060]   Now, I just wanted to then use that idea
[00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:12.180]   to pick up three or four of the pictures
[00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:14.580]   that are used for Israel in the Old Testament,
[00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:17.500]   each of which has a New Testament equivalent,
[00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:20.020]   which is also picked up in the New Testament.
[00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:24.260]   In fact, there is only one metaphor for the church
[00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:28.340]   in the New Testament, which is unique to the New Testament,
[00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:31.500]   and indeed, unique to the apostle Paul himself,
[00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:33.500]   and that is when Paul describes the church
[00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:35.300]   as the body of Christ.
[00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:37.540]   It's a very familiar one, it comes from Paul,
[00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:39.660]   but it's the only picture of the church
[00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:41.860]   in the New Testament which doesn't have
[00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:43.480]   Old Testament roots.
[00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:46.620]   In the Old Testament, there are many metaphors for Israel,
[00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:47.860]   and here are just a few.
[00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:49.540]   First of all, God's people.
[00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:51.900]   We may just have time for three, we'll see how we go.
[00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:53.100]   First of all, God's people.
[00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:56.220]   It's not really a metaphor, but it is interesting
[00:41:56.220 --> 00:42:00.040]   that they describe themselves as an am, a people,
[00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:03.140]   rather than the word used for the nations,
[00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:06.740]   which is goi, or goyim, the plural of the nations.
[00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:10.020]   In Exodus 19, verse six, God says that Israel
[00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:13.700]   will be a goi kadosh, a holy nation,
[00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:17.380]   meaning, yes, you will be a nation, like the other nations,
[00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:19.300]   but you will be a nation distinctive,
[00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:20.900]   set apart from the other nations.
[00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:23.220]   You will be my am, my people.
[00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:27.300]   Now, Israel, as you know, had an ethnic core,
[00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:29.640]   the 12 tribes of the sons of Jacob,
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:31.540]   but in reality, historical reality,
[00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:33.820]   Israel is a very mixed community.
[00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:36.380]   Exodus tells us that there were multitudes of people
[00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:39.220]   of other tribes who came out with the Hebrews
[00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:41.700]   when they left Egypt, so from the very start,
[00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:42.900]   they were a mixed community,
[00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:44.540]   and then in the book of Joshua,
[00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:46.380]   we get other people who joined them,
[00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:48.780]   and Leviticus and Deuteronomy speak repeatedly
[00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:51.220]   of the foreigners who were living among them.
[00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:54.340]   So what held Israel together was not so much
[00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:57.060]   that they were a single ethnicity
[00:42:57.060 --> 00:42:59.800]   as that they were the covenantly loyal people
[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:01.440]   of this one God.
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:04.980]   They are the people of Yahweh, Yahweh's people.
[00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:08.260]   They bear his name, and indeed, they are commanded
[00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:09.580]   in the third commandment,
[00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:13.060]   do not bear the name of the Lord in vain,
[00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:15.000]   which doesn't mean stop swearing.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.060]   It means don't be a disgrace to the God
[00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:18.700]   whose name you bear.
[00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:21.380]   I think that's what the passage means.
[00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:23.680]   And so, indeed, that was a problem to God
[00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:26.980]   when he scattered the Israelites in exile
[00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:29.100]   was, as Ezekiel puts it,
[00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:32.200]   that they were profaning the name of Yahweh.
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:35.200]   That is, they were making Yahweh the God of Israel
[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:37.440]   looking no better than the defeated gods
[00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:38.360]   of the other nations.
[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:40.840]   They were making the name Yahweh just common,
[00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:44.060]   ordinary, profaning it, not cursing and swearing,
[00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:47.640]   but just making Yahweh no different from the other gods.
[00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:51.780]   And so Yahweh, God says, I'm going to restore my people
[00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:56.580]   for the sake of my name, my reputation among the nations.
[00:43:56.580 --> 00:43:58.700]   But that title, people of Yahweh,
[00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:01.500]   the people of God, could be expanded.
[00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:03.740]   And this is the amazing thing that in the Old Testament,
[00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:06.900]   as we see a little bit more later on today,
[00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:10.780]   that the Old Testament envisages people from other nations
[00:44:10.780 --> 00:44:14.620]   coming to be included within the people of Yahweh.
[00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:18.680]   So Isaiah chapter 19 can say that even Egypt
[00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:20.700]   will be called my people, Egypt,
[00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:23.860]   and even Assyria, my inheritance,
[00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:25.540]   and Israel, my handiwork.
[00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:27.660]   The other nations become included.
[00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:30.260]   Psalm 87 says that this one and that one,
[00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:32.500]   and then it lists a number of nations around,
[00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:34.420]   will be born in Zion.
[00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:37.220]   They will be enfranchised as citizens of Zion.
[00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:39.500]   Many nations will come and join Zion,
[00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:41.540]   says God in Zechariah 2.
[00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:45.780]   And so that Old Testament inclusion of other nations
[00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:48.760]   within, quote, "the people of Yahweh,"
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:52.220]   or the people of Zion, is exactly what the New Testament
[00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:55.860]   says was beginning to happen through the Gentile mission
[00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:58.100]   of the church, that others were coming
[00:44:58.100 --> 00:45:00.020]   to become part of that people.
[00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:02.460]   So in that sense, then, the church, we as the people,
[00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:03.060]   who are we?
[00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:04.860]   We are a people.
[00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:07.540]   But in this sense, we are the people,
[00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:11.540]   the people of this God, the God of the scriptures,
[00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:15.580]   the God of biblical faith, a multinational people,
[00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:18.520]   not defined by ethnicity, not defined
[00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:21.340]   by whether you're Jew or Gentile, male or female,
[00:45:21.340 --> 00:45:22.700]   slave or free.
[00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:26.220]   But you, says Peter, again, that plural you,
[00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:29.020]   quoting both Exodus and Hosea, you
[00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:31.420]   are a people belonging to God.
[00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:33.580]   Once you were not a people, but now you
[00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:37.660]   are the people of God, a worldwide community of peoples
[00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:40.020]   fulfilling God's promise to Abraham.
[00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:43.380]   So even that word itself is quite a remarkable biblical
[00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:44.300]   term.
[00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:48.580]   And then secondly, we are God's household or family.
[00:45:48.580 --> 00:45:50.460]   Now, we know that in the Old Testament,
[00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:56.060]   Israel was structured around a network of kinship.
[00:45:56.060 --> 00:45:58.780]   There were the tribes, the largest unit.
[00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:00.780]   And then within the tribes, there were clans,
[00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:02.040]   the mishpachoth.
[00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:05.340]   And then within the clans, there were the households.
[00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:08.860]   The basic unit was, quote, "the father's house."
[00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:11.560]   That's the term that's used throughout the Old Testament.
[00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:14.460]   It was a kind of extended family,
[00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:17.300]   more like, in many ways, Asian families still
[00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:21.780]   are today than my own experience of Western nuclear families.
[00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:25.180]   Israel's families would have been three or four generations
[00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:26.660]   from the head of the family.
[00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:29.860]   It would include sons and their wives and their children,
[00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:32.380]   their servants, their agricultural workers,
[00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:34.780]   and even some of the resident foreigners practicing
[00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:35.900]   their trade among them.
[00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:39.580]   So it was a robust, large community, the household,
[00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:41.100]   the father's house.
[00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:44.380]   And it was a place in which the individual Israelite
[00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:49.500]   would find personal identity, because your name in Israel
[00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:50.860]   was virtually an address.
[00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:54.420]   You were the so-and-so, the son of X, the son of Y,
[00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:57.340]   the son of Z. And you would go through your personal name,
[00:46:57.340 --> 00:46:59.020]   your father's name, the name--
[00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:00.580]   that's your biological father--
[00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:02.260]   then the name of the head of the house,
[00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:04.860]   who might by now be dead, and then the clan name,
[00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:06.380]   and then the tribe name.
[00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:07.460]   That was your full name.
[00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:09.300]   It gave you identity.
[00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:11.340]   It also, therefore, created inclusion.
[00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:13.500]   You knew who you belonged to.
[00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:15.940]   It was a place of security, because if you
[00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:17.740]   belonged in an Israelite family, then you
[00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:19.700]   had a place on the land.
[00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:21.820]   That's why the genealogies were so important.
[00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:23.540]   When they returned to the land, you
[00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:27.340]   had security, a share in Israel's inheritance.
[00:47:27.340 --> 00:47:30.340]   And of course, it was a place of nurture and teaching,
[00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:33.580]   because it was where you learned the faith from your fathers,
[00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:36.140]   who would be teaching them, from the way in which the law was
[00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:39.020]   observed, and from the annual Passover, and so on.
[00:47:39.020 --> 00:47:42.060]   So to call Israel the household of Yahweh,
[00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:46.660]   the house of Israel, was a very significantly rich term.
[00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:51.060]   It meant that you were identified, included, secure,
[00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:54.260]   and nurtured within that faith.
[00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:56.940]   So it's not surprising, then, that Christians
[00:47:56.940 --> 00:47:59.740]   adopted very similar language to speak of the church.
[00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:03.380]   Paul calls the church in Timothy the household of God.
[00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:07.620]   We are his house, says Hebrews, chapter 3, verse 6.
[00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:09.740]   This was probably made easier by the fact
[00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:11.140]   that in the early days, of course,
[00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:15.100]   these Christians would have met in homes, initially,
[00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:18.060]   especially when it moved out into the Roman Empire.
[00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:21.220]   So this sense, then, of these little Christian communities
[00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:24.380]   being an extended family together
[00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:26.060]   must have been very strong.
[00:48:26.060 --> 00:48:28.900]   But it was strong in a countercultural way,
[00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:31.060]   because these communities of believers
[00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:36.460]   included men and women meeting together, parents and children
[00:48:36.460 --> 00:48:40.540]   in the same room, slaves and their owners in the same room,
[00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:43.180]   listening to the letters of Paul being read out.
[00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:45.900]   So here were countercultural households
[00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:49.900]   of faith in which individuals would have their identity.
[00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:54.140]   I'm now a man or a woman in Christ, even if I'm a slave.
[00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:56.820]   They would be given a sense of inclusion
[00:48:56.820 --> 00:48:59.740]   within this fellowship of sisters and brothers,
[00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:03.380]   as they would call one another, even if by faith in Christ
[00:49:03.380 --> 00:49:06.500]   they had been excluded from their earthly family.
[00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:09.580]   And they were given security, because as Peter says,
[00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:13.260]   now you have an inheritance, greater even the land,
[00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:15.900]   an inheritance that cannot spoil or fade,
[00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:18.980]   because it's an eternal inheritance, as the land was.
[00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:22.020]   And of course, it was the place of nurture and teaching
[00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:24.940]   in the scriptures, teaching and admonishing one another.
[00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:27.500]   So these household communities of the Church--
[00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:32.300]   and that word for the Church had deep social, spiritual,
[00:49:32.300 --> 00:49:35.220]   and theological roots in the Old Testament.
[00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:37.660]   So for those who might have been severed
[00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:40.060]   from their natural families and households
[00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:42.020]   because of their loyalty to Christ,
[00:49:42.020 --> 00:49:45.660]   the Church becomes a new household, a new family.
[00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:49.940]   And then thirdly, God's dwelling place.
[00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:53.100]   Going back, right back again to the Exodus,
[00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:57.020]   we all know that the Exodus was a great act of liberation.
[00:49:57.020 --> 00:49:59.980]   It gave Israel freedom from slavery and oppression
[00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:01.300]   in Egypt.
[00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:02.980]   But according to the book of Exodus,
[00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:05.300]   that was not the final goal.
[00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:07.640]   It wasn't as if God says, OK, I brought you out of Egypt.
[00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:08.940]   There you are.
[00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:09.500]   Go on.
[00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:10.180]   Be free.
[00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:13.020]   I'll see you in heaven when you die, or anything like that.
[00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:15.260]   No, God says, I brought you out of Egypt
[00:50:15.260 --> 00:50:18.900]   in order to bring you to myself here at Sinai.
[00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:21.420]   And then what God says to Moses, tell you what,
[00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:23.660]   when you go back down from Mount Sinai,
[00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:27.380]   I want you to build me a tent, just a tent.
[00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:29.780]   God said, I want to go camping with my people.
[00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:30.980]   I want to dwell among them.
[00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:33.220]   I want to be in the midst of my people.
[00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:34.380]   It's quite remarkable, really.
[00:50:34.380 --> 00:50:36.220]   It's very incarnational there, actually,
[00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:37.500]   in the book of Exodus.
[00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:43.540]   And here in Exodus 29, verses 44 to 45, Exodus 29, 40, 45,
[00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:44.260]   God says this.
[00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:46.900]   I will consecrate the tent of meeting, and the altar,
[00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:47.620]   and so on.
[00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:51.740]   And then I will dwell among the Israelites and be their God.
[00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:55.100]   And they will know that I am the Lord their God, who
[00:50:55.100 --> 00:51:00.020]   brought them out of Egypt so that I might dwell among them.
[00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:01.660]   I am the Lord their God.
[00:51:01.660 --> 00:51:03.900]   God says, the very reason I brought Israel out of Egypt,
[00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:05.320]   because I want to live among them.
[00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:07.100]   I want to dwell among my people.
[00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:10.220]   So the people of God, therefore, in the Old Testament,
[00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:13.460]   are to be the dwelling place of God.
[00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:16.220]   It's as if they're going to be his home address on Earth,
[00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:17.540]   so to speak.
[00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:19.100]   And this is so important.
[00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:20.740]   Moses recognized how important it
[00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:24.460]   was that he couldn't even envisage the people of Israel
[00:51:24.460 --> 00:51:27.500]   moving on from Mount Sinai unless God would be with them
[00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:29.900]   in that sense, actually dwelling among them.
[00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:31.780]   Wasn't content with an angel.
[00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:34.060]   Had to be God in their midst.
[00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:35.900]   Now, later on, of course, the tabernacle
[00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:37.780]   was replaced by the temple.
[00:51:37.780 --> 00:51:40.700]   And like the tabernacle, it has this double significance.
[00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:43.740]   It's a dwelling place for God, not in the sense
[00:51:43.740 --> 00:51:46.380]   that he would live in that little house,
[00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:49.780]   but that that temple house would represent, as it were,
[00:51:49.780 --> 00:51:53.380]   the focal point of the God who is dwelling among his people.
[00:51:53.380 --> 00:51:55.820]   He was living among them, walking among them.
[00:51:55.820 --> 00:51:57.500]   And secondly, it would be the place where
[00:51:57.500 --> 00:51:59.060]   they would meet with God.
[00:51:59.060 --> 00:52:01.680]   So those two words are used in the temple, a dwelling place
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:03.180]   and a meeting place.
[00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:06.500]   It's where God dwells, and it's where you meet with him
[00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:09.820]   and where you go in songs of pilgrimage and so on.
[00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:13.020]   Now, when you come to the New Testament, of course,
[00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:18.380]   you find that Jesus, as the Lord's anointed Messiah,
[00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:23.180]   has significant impact on that physical temple.
[00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:24.500]   In fact, it's very destructive.
[00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:26.380]   Jesus says the temple would be torn down
[00:52:26.380 --> 00:52:31.580]   because Jesus himself now becomes the person, no longer
[00:52:31.580 --> 00:52:36.580]   just the place, of God's presence on Earth.
[00:52:36.580 --> 00:52:39.100]   That's why John puts it, isn't it, that the word became
[00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:41.860]   flesh and tabernacled among us.
[00:52:41.860 --> 00:52:47.780]   God came to dwell no longer in a temple or a tent or a temple,
[00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:52.160]   but God dwells in the person of Jesus, the incarnate Jesus.
[00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:53.860]   God becomes flesh.
[00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:56.180]   And then also, of course, it's through Jesus
[00:52:56.180 --> 00:52:59.940]   that people must come to meet with God in worship.
[00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:05.820]   As Jesus says to the woman at the well in John chapter 4,
[00:53:05.820 --> 00:53:07.620]   that we must worship him in spirit and truth
[00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:10.380]   because he has now come as the Messiah.
[00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:13.740]   And as Hebrews will later put it in Hebrews chapter 12,
[00:53:13.740 --> 00:53:16.700]   we who are believers in Jesus have already
[00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:19.920]   come to Mount Zion, to the temple.
[00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:22.820]   Not in that sense to the old Mount Zion, he says,
[00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:26.340]   but to the one that is there through the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:28.980]   So we are that temple because Paul
[00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:33.940]   uses this temple language of a dwelling place
[00:53:33.940 --> 00:53:36.260]   language in three different ways.
[00:53:36.260 --> 00:53:39.620]   First, he says individually that individual Christians
[00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:42.420]   are the temple of the Holy Spirit, 1 Corinthians chapter
[00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:43.140]   6.
[00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:46.400]   So we don't abuse our bodies with sexual immorality
[00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:48.560]   because our bodies are, in that sense,
[00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:49.820]   the dwelling place of God.
[00:53:49.820 --> 00:53:52.060]   He indwells us as his temple.
[00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:54.820]   But secondly, he speaks of the local church.
[00:53:54.820 --> 00:53:57.020]   In 1 Corinthians chapter 3, he says,
[00:53:57.020 --> 00:53:59.500]   you, meaning you Christians in Corinth,
[00:53:59.500 --> 00:54:03.700]   as a local body of believers, you are God's temple.
[00:54:03.700 --> 00:54:06.300]   And therefore, he warns them not to take part
[00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:08.860]   in things that were happening in pagan temples
[00:54:08.860 --> 00:54:11.180]   because we are the temple of the living God.
[00:54:11.180 --> 00:54:15.420]   And then he uses it also in the sense of the universal church.
[00:54:15.420 --> 00:54:18.300]   In Ephesians chapter 2, addressing all Gentile
[00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:20.460]   believers, he says that they have now
[00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:24.380]   been united, Jews and Gentiles together,
[00:54:24.380 --> 00:54:29.500]   to become built together, he says, into a living temple
[00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:32.260]   for God to indwell by his spirit.
[00:54:32.260 --> 00:54:35.900]   So that the temple imagery of the Old Testament
[00:54:35.900 --> 00:54:40.540]   is there used to describe not just a church, but indeed
[00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:44.580]   the one whole church on earth, the church of the living God
[00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:47.740]   with his one dwelling place through his one spirit.
[00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:51.900]   But it's one dwelling place for people of all nations.
[00:54:51.900 --> 00:54:54.660]   Now, I'll not go on to talk about priesthood, I think,
[00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:58.860]   because I'll refer to that in the next lecture a bit.
[00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:01.540]   It's used there of the people of God, the people of Israel
[00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:02.420]   as God's priesthood.
[00:55:02.420 --> 00:55:05.500]   It's also used of ourselves by Peter.
[00:55:05.500 --> 00:55:07.060]   And of course, we could add others.
[00:55:07.060 --> 00:55:08.660]   I need to draw to a close.
[00:55:08.660 --> 00:55:10.820]   But there are many other metaphors
[00:55:10.820 --> 00:55:13.580]   that the Old Testament uses for Israel, which are then picked
[00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:15.300]   up in the New Testament church.
[00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:17.500]   There is the picture of a vine--
[00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:19.940]   Jesus used that-- of an olive tree--
[00:55:19.940 --> 00:55:22.460]   Paul uses that-- of a bride--
[00:55:22.460 --> 00:55:23.820]   comes all over the place--
[00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:27.940]   and indeed, of a flock of sheep with God as the shepherd.
[00:55:27.940 --> 00:55:32.380]   And all of these ways of thinking about the people of God
[00:55:32.380 --> 00:55:34.220]   are distinctive in the Old Testament,
[00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:37.860]   but they feed through into the New.
[00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:39.940]   So I hope that for now, at least,
[00:55:39.940 --> 00:55:41.420]   I've said enough to show that if we
[00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:44.820]   are going to answer this question of Christian identity,
[00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:50.740]   who are we, we simply can't do without the rich theological,
[00:55:50.740 --> 00:55:55.060]   historical truths of the faith and the scriptures of Israel
[00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:56.740]   in our Old Testament.
[00:55:56.740 --> 00:55:57.740]   Thank you.
