[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920]   (soft piano music)
[00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:19.000]   - Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.080]   Good morning to those of you who are in Hong Kong,
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.680]   and good evening, Dr. Mark Labberton,
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.880]   and welcome those of you who are viewing this
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.820]   at home on the internet.
[00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.240]   Welcome to the second day
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.800]   of the China Graduate School of Theology,
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.360]   Josephine Zou Culture and Ethics Lecture Week.
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.360]   We had a very fruitful and sharing discussion yesterday.
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.400]   If this is the first day that you joined the lecture,
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.680]   I would like to welcome you to the second day
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.640]   of our lecture on the crisis
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.280]   of American white evangelicalism.
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.440]   So just a housekeeping item,
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.840]   if you would like to view the lecture in Cantonese
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.880]   or Mandarin, you can scroll down to the webpage
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.880]   to the bottom, and you can find the respective language,
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.000]   so either in English, Cantonese, or Mandarin.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.480]   So today, we are honored and fortunate
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.580]   to have Dr. Mark Labberton with us again
[00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.360]   to share with us about Christology and our culture.
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.920]   And the title of today's lecture is
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.280]   The Battle of American White Evangelicalism
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.120]   that Exalts its Christology While its Culture Itself.
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.860]   And without further ado, let's welcome Dr. Mark Labberton.
[00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.760]   - Thank you very much.
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.920]   It's my great privilege and honor to be with you again.
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.640]   And as we go through our lecture tonight
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.000]   and then have opportunities for questions
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.720]   and discussion later, I look forward to that,
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.040]   as well as the respondents
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.320]   that are going to comment as well.
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.640]   So Christology and our culture,
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.640]   we will reflect on the battle
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.640]   of American white evangelicalism
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.960]   that exalts its Christology while its culture eats its soul.
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:15.600]   In 2004, at the height of George W. Bush's administration
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.160]   and new waves of the press exploring the meaning
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.440]   and character of evangelicalism,
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.680]   David Brooks, a New York Times columnist,
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.040]   wrote an article entitled, "Who is John Stott?"
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.760]   It was a brief article,
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.680]   and yet it gave a wonderful picture of John,
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.560]   a remarkable overview of his work,
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.720]   but also of John Stott's character and influence.
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.480]   And all of this as a justification, Brooks said,
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.560]   for saying, "Surely this is the one
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.640]   "by whom the best of evangelicalism should be measured."
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.840]   It captured the faithfulness,
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.080]   the strong and careful theological, pastoral,
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.860]   cultural, and ethical mind and spirit of John.
[00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.040]   Obviously, John was not from the United States,
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.300]   so I am borrowing him tonight.
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.760]   But the evangelicalism that he represented and promoted
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.480]   is one of the strongest and most significant voices
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.480]   that has shaped a wide segment of US
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.320]   and, I dare say, global evangelicalism.
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:33.000]   John's primary authorship of not only many books,
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.520]   but of the Lausanne Covenant,
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.400]   was a witness to his distinctive character.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.320]   Though born into a truly upper-class English home,
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.800]   the gospel in John's life shattered the hold
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.800]   of a colonialist vision or attitude into which he was born.
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:58.900]   He became a Christ-centered globalist and a profound friend.
[00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.880]   Having had the personal privilege of working for
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.240]   and with John Stott for over 30 years,
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.320]   I can witness to the fact that John's Christology
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.240]   was as lived as it was affirmed.
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.040]   In fact, he was a more authentic disciple
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.540]   the more deeply one came to know him.
[00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.760]   A second image I want you to hold in your mind
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.960]   is that of Franklin Graham, son of Billy Graham.
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.600]   While Franklin Graham's father was still alive
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.680]   and a direct private and public influence on Franklin,
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.360]   Franklin operated inside the character and narrative
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.120]   that had been established by his father,
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.120]   a US and global icon of American and white evangelicalism.
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.640]   Franklin Graham founded Samaritan's Purse,
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.640]   a Christian relief organization,
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.080]   which is an expression of Christian compassion,
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.440]   similar to the founding of other relief
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.240]   and development agencies, such as World Vision,
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.040]   Compassion International, and others.
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.760]   As Billy Graham's health declined
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.960]   and Billy withdrew from public life,
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.660]   Franklin's voice increased in different ways,
[00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.800]   and unfortunately, not least in its shrill volume and tone.
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.240]   By the time the Trump administration was in place
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.480]   in the United States White House,
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.660]   Franklin seemed to have become a true believer
[00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.340]   in the service that the Trump presidency might be
[00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.080]   to evangelical purposes,
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.040]   and Franklin piled on with all that he had.
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.940]   He made support of Trump a vehement
[00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.680]   and often spoken of cause,
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.200]   and explicitly equated support for Trump
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.640]   with being a faithful Christian,
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.980]   including Trump's America First policy.
[00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:09.200]   I lift up these two voices as contrasting exemplars
[00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:13.240]   of two very different American, in quotes,
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.280]   since John is not technically American,
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.240]   but American types of evangelicalism.
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.920]   John Stott and Franklin Graham share a common seedbed
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.820]   of faith and theology centered in Jesus Christ,
[00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:31.400]   and they defend largely common versions
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.200]   of a theology of the cross as the way of salvation.
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:39.160]   Dependency on the Bible as God's unique
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.480]   and authoritative word,
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:45.060]   and God's evangelistic mission in the world,
[00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.620]   as well as God's evidences of goodness
[00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:51.200]   through relief and development efforts,
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.080]   and the primacy of the church
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.020]   as God's instrument in the world.
[00:06:55.020 --> 00:07:00.000]   However, they demonstrate quite different views
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.680]   of gospel and culture,
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.860]   and herein lies the subject that I want us to consider
[00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.360]   in this second lecture.
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.640]   Stott was an Anglican born into a family
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:17.640]   in which he was taken to Alsos Church in London
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.280]   week by week by his mother,
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.060]   while his father, who was an atheist and a surgeon,
[00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:26.820]   stayed at home a few blocks away.
[00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:30.960]   He lived in London his whole life.
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.640]   He was never married.
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:36.540]   He regularly engaged in private and in public
[00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:39.540]   with a very diverse array of people and opinions.
[00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:45.240]   By the grace of God and a lived Christology
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.880]   or incarnationalism,
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:50.800]   the gospel allowed him to break free
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.240]   from many of the strictures
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.820]   that might have held or kept him culturally bound.
[00:07:55.820 --> 00:08:00.320]   It was centrally his Christology,
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:04.440]   his view of the radical reorienting reality of God
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.860]   embodied in human flesh,
[00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:09.720]   emphasizing, serving,
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:14.380]   empathizing rather, serving, healing,
[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:17.440]   suffering, dying, and rising
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:20.120]   that transformed John's life and social location.
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:25.940]   His Christology moved him to live and move
[00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:27.680]   in a different way in the world.
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:34.180]   In fact, lived in a simple two-room apartment or flat
[00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:36.500]   doing ministry focused on study,
[00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:39.740]   writing, preaching, and travel.
[00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:44.660]   His Christology led him to listen.
[00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:50.480]   That in turn led him to hear and trust,
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:53.460]   understand and act on the perspectives
[00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:56.980]   of brothers and sisters in Christ throughout the world.
[00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:01.140]   When I recently spoke with Rene Padilla,
[00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:03.180]   one of the founders and leaders
[00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:06.640]   of Missio Integral in Columbia, South America,
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:11.340]   he said that what stood out about Stott
[00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:14.140]   among other Western white evangelical leaders
[00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:18.340]   was simply this, that he listened,
[00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:21.900]   that he wanted to know and understand us,
[00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.860]   not to control or use us.
[00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:31.660]   Despite Franklin Graham's exposure to the global church,
[00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:33.620]   despite his father's sympathies
[00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:36.180]   and growing understanding of a world
[00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:40.020]   beyond the small town in which they lived in North Carolina,
[00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:44.140]   despite the good work of the Samaritans purse
[00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:48.740]   around the world, I regrettably say that in my view,
[00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:53.580]   Franklin's life speaks most loudly of his social location,
[00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.040]   not his Christology.
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:10:01.480]   Candidly, and with my own self critique in this as well,
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.840]   Franklin sounds often much more like a white,
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:09.640]   Southern male, privileged person
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:14.440]   who lives and trusts in Christian language
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:18.120]   to justify and defend American exceptionalism
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.400]   and exclusivity.
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:24.700]   In other words, his Christology does not seem
[00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:27.820]   to have broken through and relocated him
[00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:31.560]   or redefined his life or his social location.
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:37.000]   Admitting I may see him wrongly, and I well could,
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.080]   my impression is that his Christology has never expanded
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:46.080]   his core perception of God or neighbor or self.
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:52.040]   His view of authority, of power, of pragmatism,
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:56.020]   and even of nationalism have not been recast
[00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:59.520]   by his Christology, but rather the reverse.
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:03.620]   He trusts deeply in American exceptionalism.
[00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:08.920]   No wonder when the Samaritan purse set up
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:13.400]   a coronavirus clinic in Central Park in New York City,
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:17.520]   it initially made a major issue over the fact
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:20.740]   that it would not be serving LGBT people.
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:26.840]   His politics impaired his compassion for suffering people.
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:32.020]   The Jesus who sat at table with sinners and tax collectors
[00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:35.860]   with the weak and needy seemed captive
[00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:37.980]   to Franklin's social ideology.
[00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:43.940]   The magnanimity of grace appears trumped.
[00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:48.360]   That is, it was overtaken by a Trumpian view of things.
[00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:55.820]   So my concern tonight is, or this morning on your end,
[00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:59.800]   is an observation and a conviction.
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:05.660]   It's this, that American white evangelicals tell ourselves
[00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:07.660]   that we are living our Christology.
[00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:09.460]   That is our public message.
[00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:14.300]   But the more likely truth is that we are often living
[00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:18.280]   our cultural location, not our Christology.
[00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:22.180]   Of course, we all know that the relationship
[00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:24.480]   between the gospel and culture
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:27.340]   is an historic Christian dilemma.
[00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:29.620]   As we know, God entered culture,
[00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:33.000]   and to make that affirmation is not simplistic,
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.540]   though its familiarity may suggest otherwise.
[00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:41.100]   Once God has entered human experience,
[00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:44.300]   though equal with God, he did not regard equality with God
[00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:47.820]   as something to be grasped, but emptied himself
[00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:51.660]   in finding himself in human form.
[00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:56.540]   He humbled himself and became obedient, even unto death.
[00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:59.020]   And therefore God highly exalted him
[00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:02.380]   and gave him the name that is above every name,
[00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:05.420]   that at the name of Jesus, every knee will bow
[00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:09.700]   and every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord
[00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:11.440]   to the glory of God the Father.
[00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:18.540]   In ways beyond the philosophical mind-body problem,
[00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:22.780]   we now ask through the lens of the incarnation itself
[00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:27.660]   what we have in order to face new kinds of mind-body,
[00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:32.660]   body-spirit, theology-culture, confession-action issues.
[00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:38.000]   This dilemma is not new, but the way it manifests itself
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.740]   in American white evangelicalism shows itself
[00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:43.900]   in particularly problematic ways.
[00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:46.860]   When taken at its surface,
[00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:49.540]   it has found a broad cultural acceptability,
[00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:54.020]   but beneath it exposes a problematic underbelly.
[00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:59.380]   Outside observers to white evangelicalism
[00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:01.500]   have seen this for some time,
[00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:05.220]   but let's delineate some of the unfortunate markers.
[00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:09.940]   A crisis first then of Christological knowing.
[00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:14.900]   American white evangelicalism is living out
[00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:17.900]   an inadequate even failed theological
[00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:20.080]   or Christological epistemology.
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:25.540]   What is claimed to be known seems to sit on the surface
[00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:28.480]   rather than penetrating our underlying
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:30.520]   and controlling social location.
[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:34.620]   Consciously or otherwise, the Christ we know
[00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:38.260]   does not necessarily lead to a life that demonstrates
[00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:42.220]   the radical recreative work of being remade
[00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:44.560]   after the image of Jesus Christ himself.
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:48.660]   It feels more like a form of imitative knowledge
[00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:51.140]   than of penetrative knowledge.
[00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:54.180]   And when the absence of Christ-like fruit
[00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:56.980]   in places of pain and injustice
[00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:01.180]   seems so prominent and guarded,
[00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:03.540]   one has to ask if the Christ that they name
[00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:08.420]   is real and knowable enough for the real world.
[00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:12.380]   In other words, at the core of the crisis
[00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:16.140]   is an unacknowledged, unintegrated Christology
[00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:18.420]   in which the evangelical seems to sit
[00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:20.360]   on the surface of history,
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.260]   rather than being the penetrating and recreating
[00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.580]   of the human story itself.
[00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:29.020]   In some white evangelical spaces,
[00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:32.860]   faithful theology is verbal and dogmatic,
[00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:37.460]   but spiritually abstract rather than self-critical
[00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:40.200]   and convicting about social realities
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:43.500]   that lie outside the white, middle-class
[00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.340]   and male cultural box.
[00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:50.980]   The denial of racism and of white supremacy,
[00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:55.040]   the denial of the coronavirus and trust in science,
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:16:00.700]   the denial of the election recently in the United States
[00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:02.820]   and its outcome,
[00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:07.700]   all have millions of white evangelical supporters.
[00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:09.780]   Even in the second election,
[00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:13.700]   80% of evangelicals voted for President Trump.
[00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:17.980]   Tragically, when these denials are offered
[00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:21.500]   specifically as an expression of Christian faith,
[00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:24.660]   then the evangel itself appears to have less and less
[00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:27.420]   to do with reality,
[00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:31.020]   the world in which ordinary people live and work,
[00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:33.280]   suffer and play.
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:35.500]   In this circumstance,
[00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:39.760]   our Christology starts to appear as a fantasy
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:41.280]   rather than as knowledge.
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:45.220]   Does our Christology do the work of defining
[00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:49.420]   and reconstructing our personal and public lives,
[00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:52.380]   giving evidence that we are a reflection
[00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:54.640]   of what lies beyond our sociology?
[00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:59.860]   Is not this what living in but not of the world
[00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:01.260]   is actually meant to produce?
[00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:04.600]   And not just in piety,
[00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:07.620]   but in evidences in the public square.
[00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:11.780]   It seems by painful contrast
[00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:14.260]   that white evangelicalism does not really attend
[00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:15.580]   to being made new,
[00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:20.720]   but being internally and eternally safe.
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:25.800]   It doesn't intersect with our ordinary everyday world.
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.720]   So how has this come to be?
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:32.920]   I wanna say, suggest several reasons.
[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:33.960]   Out of fear,
[00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:39.600]   a crisis of pursuing power
[00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:42.040]   is upon us more than pursuing wisdom.
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:44.600]   There are many manifestations
[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:47.200]   of this white evangelical orientation
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:50.120]   that set the stage for how white evangelicals live
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:50.960]   and thrive.
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:53.520]   They are cultural,
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:56.600]   they are cultural premises,
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:59.640]   racially, economically, and culturally.
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.000]   They are like the elements that set the stage
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.760]   for the faith that they promote.
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:06.720]   There can be a variation in personality,
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:10.080]   but the main elements that I'm going to describe
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:12.960]   are fairly predictable, even necessary.
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:15.660]   And they show little penetration
[00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:18.640]   of a living reordering Christology.
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:22.640]   First, whiteness.
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.320]   As you are aware,
[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:29.720]   the dominant culture of the US numerically and culturally
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.420]   is white and European.
[00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:35.040]   By dominant, I mean both the largest
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:36.860]   and the most influential.
[00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:40.400]   The population that holds the primary power roles
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:42.920]   and levers of cultural influence.
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:47.500]   This is fast changing in the United States.
[00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:50.600]   And by 2045,
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:53.000]   just 24 years from now,
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.700]   the US will no longer be white majority.
[00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:58.880]   The racial separation and division
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:03.580]   underneath the narrative of America as a melting pot
[00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:06.300]   is a secret in plain view.
[00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:11.120]   That is, we say that we are a melting pot,
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.800]   but anybody who has lived in the United States
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:16.240]   understands that frequently that is not true.
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.840]   We have proximate diversity.
[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:20.640]   We are near one another,
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:24.600]   but not deep or intimate diversity.
[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:28.120]   In fact, that is as true or more true
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:30.000]   of American evangelicalism
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   than it is of other institutions or groups of people.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.500]   A lot of energy of white evangelicalism
[00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:40.500]   can be found in the Southern part of the United States.
[00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:44.760]   And its legacy of racial separation
[00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:46.720]   directly shows in the separation
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.240]   of white and black churches.
[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:50.880]   Even now in newly planted
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:53.760]   and growing Southern congregations,
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:57.200]   they are still deeply racially divided.
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:01.480]   Churches established and maintained for white people,
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:04.500]   even those that often claim to be multiracial
[00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.380]   are still dominantly white.
[00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:11.360]   Let me give you an example
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:14.080]   of how this formed from early days
[00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:17.720]   and how sadly so much of this same description
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:19.520]   could be used even today.
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:25.960]   Some of you may know the name of Frederick Douglass.
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:29.800]   Frederick Douglass was an emancipated slave
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:34.760]   and one of the finest orators in American history,
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:37.520]   not just among African-Americans,
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:40.040]   but among all people that have lived
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:41.880]   and spoken in the United States.
[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:44.720]   And what I'm about to read to you
[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:47.040]   is something that he spoke on July 5th
[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:51.800]   the day after American Independence Day, July 4th.
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:54.520]   He had been asked to speak
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:57.880]   and he said that he wouldn't be able to speak on the 4th,
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:00.320]   but that he would speak and address
[00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:05.160]   an almost entirely white audience on the 5th of July.
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:07.020]   And these are some of his words.
[00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:12.960]   What to the American slave is your 4th of July?
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.960]   And I answer, a day that reveals to him
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:20.640]   more than all other days in the year,
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:23.280]   the gross injustice and cruelty
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:25.400]   to which he is a constant victim.
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:30.720]   To him, your celebration is a sham,
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:34.120]   your boasted liberty and unholy license.
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:40.280]   Your national greatness, swelling vanity,
[00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:44.080]   your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless.
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:49.880]   Your denunciations of tyrants, brass-fringed impudence,
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:55.300]   your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery,
[00:21:55.300 --> 00:22:01.500]   your prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings,
[00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:04.740]   with all your religious parade and solemnity
[00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:09.740]   are to the slave mere bombast, fraud,
[00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:15.300]   deception, impiety and hypocrisy,
[00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:18.580]   a thin veil to cover up the crimes
[00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:21.280]   which would disgrace a nation of savages.
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:24.280]   This is not a nation,
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:27.680]   there is not a nation on earth guilty of practices
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:30.020]   more shocking and bloody
[00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:34.020]   than are the people of the United States at this very hour.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.500]   The structures and policies
[00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:43.660]   and even more the culture of whiteness
[00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:48.660]   that Frederick Douglass is describing in 1852
[00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:51.900]   are still so thick in the United States
[00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:55.020]   that what he says speaks far more loudly
[00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:58.100]   than the evidence of serious discipleship
[00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:00.580]   in which we become transformed
[00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:04.860]   as a part of one new humanity in Christ.
[00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:10.720]   The summer of 2020 and continuing on
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:13.360]   has been a renewed season of racial reckoning.
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:18.340]   The underbelly and anxiety of this
[00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:21.240]   has been the easy cover of whites
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:24.640]   complaining about violence against buildings,
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:27.580]   the riots with greater ferocity
[00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:31.320]   than complaints about the underlying violence every day
[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:33.840]   against blacks and people of color.
[00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:38.680]   The increased racism expressed in these past months
[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:41.520]   toward Latinos and Asians,
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:46.360]   as well as evidences the sense that they are the problem
[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:48.680]   rather than the profound injustice
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:51.520]   against people made in the image of God
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:55.660]   through personal and institutional systemic racism.
[00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:57.960]   One of the historically
[00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:02.120]   predominant white evangelical denominations
[00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:06.300]   recently acted to condemn critical race theory.
[00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:10.400]   And they did so rather than to speak up
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:13.240]   and against the social realities
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:16.760]   that critical race theory attempts to expose.
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:19.320]   They were more concerned about the theory
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:20.680]   than about the reality.
[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:23.440]   The assumption seems to focus
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.600]   on the apparatus of reflection on race
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:28.680]   rather than to face the gripping
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:30.760]   and present impact of racism.
[00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:34.080]   It is a Christology that sits atop
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:41.080]   what is rather than fundamentally reorders reality itself.
[00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:42.640]   I'd like to come back to this
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:45.000]   with questions in the Q&A time.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.480]   Whiteness is one of the features
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:53.360]   that makes it possible
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:56.740]   for culture to dominate Christology.
[00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:59.720]   The second one is maleness.
[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:03.760]   Also inextricably linked to being white
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:08.200]   and evangelical in America is typically being male.
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:10.960]   It's male voices that have dominated
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:13.360]   the American evangelical scene,
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:16.040]   partly through a rejection of women in leadership,
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.920]   not least women in church leadership,
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:21.400]   and especially against women preaching
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:22.700]   in the life of the church.
[00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:26.760]   Anyone who knows the life of the church around the world
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:29.120]   is more than aware of the pervasive
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:31.120]   life-giving ministry of women.
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:36.200]   CGST knows this, Fuller Seminary knows this.
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:40.160]   The church around the world sees and understands
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:42.440]   the impossible contribution,
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:46.000]   possibly large contributions of women.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.040]   But for many reasons in evangelical churches,
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:51.400]   those in leadership are typically male
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:55.000]   and typically older male and typically white male.
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:59.160]   They're the ones that are thought as if by nature
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.820]   to be the ones in charge.
[00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:04.880]   The long established assumption excludes 50%
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:07.040]   of the body of Christ from leadership
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:10.240]   and fits a stereotype that I would argue
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:13.240]   is not biblical or Christological,
[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:16.000]   but much more of an unformed,
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.040]   untransformed aspect of culture.
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:21.440]   White evangelicalism in the United States
[00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:25.240]   is predominantly male in its public manifestation
[00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:27.440]   and the events last week
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:31.840]   on the steps of the Capitol building in Washington, DC
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:34.640]   only further emphasize that very point,
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:38.140]   not least with signs that said, "Jesus saves."
[00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:41.360]   This shows itself to be out of touch
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:43.360]   with the world in which we live,
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:46.560]   not least the community gathered in worship.
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:49.400]   Where are the leading voices
[00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:52.040]   in American white evangelicalism?
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:54.960]   It's not as though there are no well-known women
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:58.680]   Bible teachers like Beth Moore, for example,
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:01.640]   but they are often not held in the same respect
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:04.640]   as institutional leaders or church planters
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:08.000]   or public policy advocates or theologians.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.800]   They are primarily seen as "women's speakers"
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:17.400]   rather than voices that should lead change,
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:19.360]   should lead and change the church
[00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:21.840]   by a deeply penetrative Christology
[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:23.600]   that rewrites our narratives,
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:26.880]   sets us free and resets our social location.
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:31.760]   As Beth Moore has spoken out more and more publicly,
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:35.080]   male voices have harshly criticized her
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:40.080]   and many of her adherents who are women have dropped away.
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:42.680]   What has been fascinating to watch
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:44.320]   is that at the same time,
[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:47.520]   she's attracted a wider set of women,
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:51.600]   not so much from inside the white evangelical subculture
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:54.080]   who are hungering for a deep encounter
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:56.240]   and transformation with God
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:58.440]   that will affect their whole lives.
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:00.960]   It is her care with the scriptures,
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:03.640]   her honesty in their implications,
[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:05.960]   her refreshing self-critique
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:10.680]   and her confidence in God's power rather than in her own.
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:13.920]   These are the charisms that I see
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:16.360]   as the fruit of the Spirit in her life
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:18.540]   and that the body of Christ needs.
[00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:25.040]   The next category, in addition to whiteness and maleness,
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:29.520]   is the way white American evangelicalism
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:31.280]   is bent on success.
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:34.480]   The fruitfulness of the church
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:36.600]   that tends to get the most attention
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:42.800]   in white evangelicalism is the growth, size, amounts,
[00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:46.760]   numbers that can be externally measured,
[00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:49.120]   considered success-oriented,
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:51.920]   and evaluated and rewarded because of that.
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:54.640]   This is reflective of a set
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:57.160]   of selective theological influences
[00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:02.160]   connected now to corporate or entertainment values.
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:04.040]   It does not show the fruit of the Spirit
[00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:07.400]   of an identification with a crucified Christ.
[00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:11.080]   It is not a narrative of laying down power,
[00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:15.000]   but a public success measured by benchmarks of influence
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.160]   with social or economic power.
[00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:21.440]   Being invited by the President of the United States
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:24.240]   to be one of his "evangelical advisors"
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:27.840]   is the height of this convergence
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:30.720]   and this crisis in the United States.
[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:36.180]   The megachurch model symbolically distills these tendencies
[00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:40.300]   and maximizes efficiency and scale as a value.
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:45.440]   This all makes sense once you embrace and assume
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:48.040]   that church means standing inside
[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:50.240]   this non-Christological paradigm.
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:52.880]   It's just the environment
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:55.520]   and not itself the focus of attention.
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:58.680]   It is the assumed basis for all that is done
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:00.680]   on top of that platform.
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:03.140]   It is like paint on a canvas,
[00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:05.500]   not evidence of a new creation.
[00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:09.000]   This does not mean, of course,
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.080]   that all good disappears or the truth is absent
[00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:16.480]   or that faithful servant does not occur in megachurches.
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:18.560]   Of course, that's not true.
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:22.740]   But all those things happen often to the side
[00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:27.740]   or on the back or on top of an industrial strength engine
[00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:31.440]   that is being driven by the growth machine,
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:33.700]   which is not itself a kingdom value.
[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:39.040]   The multi-billion dollar evangelical industrial complex
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:42.480]   is driven by achieving statistical, financial,
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:44.440]   and production quality,
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:48.720]   and letting that show that keeps the audience coming back
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:52.400]   and it keeps that audience giving financially.
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:56.280]   They follow numbers, rankings, quality
[00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:57.960]   that drives the machine
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:59.960]   more than the evidence of true wisdom.
[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:04.220]   The pandemic makes this inclination all the more evident.
[00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:07.500]   Preaching at such a church,
[00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:09.560]   I was once introduced as a preacher
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:13.520]   for a night of what they called star-studded worship.
[00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:19.220]   Imagine, star-studded worship.
[00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:23.580]   There is only one star in Christian worship.
[00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:29.080]   In light of these three prominent markers,
[00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:33.120]   white, male, and success,
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:37.840]   the result looks like white, male, success culture
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:40.500]   wrapping itself in biblical language,
[00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:44.880]   but not showing the Christological fruit
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:49.880]   by the spirit of love, mercy, kindness, justice, or more.
[00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:54.580]   At a time when the racial and gender landscape
[00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:57.280]   of the United States is rapidly changing
[00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:00.360]   and challenging the vestiges of white supremacy
[00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:01.740]   and of male dominance,
[00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:07.280]   white evangelicalism has become very nostalgic.
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:09.900]   No wonder so many have been taken with the notion
[00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:12.160]   of make America great again.
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:13.880]   It's a nostalgic phrase.
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:17.320]   That very slogan fails to reflect anything
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:19.480]   about the inherent character of the gospel,
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:24.500]   but instead of something quite different.
[00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:27.960]   It does not feed a picture of reconstituting
[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:30.440]   and reordering our lives
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:32.840]   because of the gospel's transformation.
[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:39.160]   Native American, black, Latino, and Asian stories
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:44.420]   are not truly heard and trusted in such churches
[00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:46.640]   as the ones I'm describing.
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:48.240]   Their narratives have to be quote,
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:52.160]   vetted by white male evangelical voices
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:55.460]   that claim a biblicism that is belied
[00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:57.860]   by their words and their actions.
[00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:01.180]   This is the whirlwind that brings the enterprise
[00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:04.340]   of white evangelicalism spiraling down
[00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:06.260]   in the culture wars of today.
[00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:10.620]   Even in today's press, so many different voices
[00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:13.740]   expressing the death of evangelicalism
[00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:17.100]   and potentially the death of the church in America.
[00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:20.040]   While these may be reactionary words at the moment,
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:24.300]   they do not fail to grasp the urgency and crisis
[00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:26.120]   that I actually think is upon us.
[00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:30.620]   White evangelicalism in America shows itself
[00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:33.580]   to have bankruptcy at its core,
[00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:37.600]   not just in its policy or presidential preferences.
[00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:43.820]   Back to John Stott and Franklin Graham.
[00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:48.260]   On a trip with John Stott that I took,
[00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:52.240]   primarily giving lectures in various Indian seminaries,
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:55.920]   we had a Sunday afternoon venture to go in search
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:59.340]   of the elderly mother of an Indian missionary
[00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:00.740]   currently serving in Vietnam
[00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:03.580]   at the time that this trip took place.
[00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:07.480]   He asked if John would go and find and call on his mother
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:09.580]   the next time he was in India.
[00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:12.040]   And John said he would do his best to do so.
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:16.600]   This was the afternoon for fulfilling that commitment.
[00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:21.000]   We had her name and a region in the city of Madras
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   where she lived, but we didn't know any further information.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.080]   We had an Indian pastor with us.
[00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:34.080]   And with those tiny helps, we set off to try to find her.
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:38.520]   It took a few hours with no success
[00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:40.760]   and no confidence of success.
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:44.400]   We were literally wandering in the streets of Madras
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:47.800]   trying to find an elderly woman
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:51.060]   who lived in very, very poor conditions.
[00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:53.360]   There was no precise address.
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:56.840]   We just had her name and the area that she might live in.
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:35:01.120]   We were in that sense without human hope.
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:06.120]   And still by John's commitment to his friend, we persisted.
[00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:11.080]   Suddenly after several false hopes,
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:13.840]   we seem to have perhaps come up with a lead.
[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:18.640]   A man unknown to us led us further and further
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:21.720]   into the borough layers of a particular neighborhood
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:23.560]   in India, in Madras,
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:27.400]   eventually into a common courtyard or two
[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:31.760]   until finally and remarkably we had before us
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:34.280]   this sweet elderly woman,
[00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:37.520]   mother of the man who wrote to John from Vietnam.
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:41.080]   He described her as a dear lady
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:44.600]   who was losing her teeth one by one.
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:46.620]   Would John please go and see her?
[00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:53.120]   She immediately knelt before us and kissed John's feet
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:57.280]   and she asked immediately if he would preach for her
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:58.220]   and to her.
[00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:02.400]   After an honorific small rug was found
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:04.980]   and John was positioned on top of it,
[00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:08.700]   this simple woman knelt with her hands open
[00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:10.100]   to hear the word of God.
[00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:14.420]   The man who spoke to scholars and leaders
[00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:18.900]   all around the world and in Madras that day
[00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:24.940]   now offered in the clearest and most appropriate way,
[00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:28.100]   a compassionate and convicting sermon
[00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:29.740]   of God's love for the world,
[00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:34.800]   including for this woman's son and for she herself.
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:37.260]   He prayed for her.
[00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:39.860]   She kissed his feet again.
[00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:43.580]   The man who preached to tens,
[00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:46.820]   maybe hundreds of thousands was no different
[00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:49.620]   than the man who preached for the one person.
[00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:54.060]   This was not about power, but wisdom.
[00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:58.900]   Not about being male or white, but about being human.
[00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:03.620]   Not about being successful, but being a servant.
[00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:08.980]   Now, I want to believe that Franklin Graham
[00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:10.820]   would have such stories himself.
[00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:16.320]   But that is not what is at least publicly visible.
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:19.700]   Out of the same seedbed that they both shared
[00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:24.060]   of evangelical faith comes two very different manifestations.
[00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:28.780]   Yes, one comes from America and the other from Britain,
[00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:32.540]   but in a deeper sense, they come from
[00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:36.900]   different social locations and surrounding cultures,
[00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:40.060]   but they actually share quite similar Christologies.
[00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:42.940]   Their written statements of faith
[00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:45.180]   might be quite similar to one another,
[00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:49.940]   but the display of the implications of that Christology
[00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:51.380]   seems to be quite different.
[00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:57.740]   Both men are mature and complex.
[00:37:57.740 --> 00:38:01.420]   Both had complicated relationships
[00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:04.420]   with their highly public and influential fathers.
[00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:08.820]   Both were born into an ecosystem
[00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:11.220]   that was feeding them in particular ways.
[00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:14.460]   Both are more than entitled
[00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:17.420]   to their distinctive journeys of soul before God
[00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:20.500]   and before the audiences that in the call of God,
[00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:23.700]   they sought to live out as their vocation.
[00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:26.140]   Contrast between the two, however,
[00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:28.580]   does seem to tell a significant story.
[00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:33.500]   The gospel landed in John's life as a counterpoint
[00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:36.740]   to his wealthy and prominent medical family narrative.
[00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:40.780]   At an early stage during World War II,
[00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:44.540]   John's father was a highly prominent heart surgeon,
[00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:48.460]   and it was after his conversion as a young man
[00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:51.900]   that he declared himself a pacifist because of his faith.
[00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:57.740]   For two years during the war, living under the same roof,
[00:38:57.740 --> 00:38:59.860]   John's father did not talk with him.
[00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:04.340]   They eventually reconciled.
[00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:07.620]   John eventually was no longer a pacifist,
[00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:10.100]   and his life proceeded as someone
[00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:12.900]   who would have defended just war.
[00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:16.620]   He entered eventually the Anglican communion
[00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:20.140]   at a time when evangelicals were a very small
[00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:22.300]   and beleaguered minority.
[00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:25.580]   He had been converted at a school as a boy
[00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:27.220]   and then discipled by the influence
[00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:29.580]   of that evangelist for many years.
[00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:34.580]   This man's name was affectionately called Dash, John Nash,
[00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:41.500]   and he wrote to John as a school boy every week
[00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:45.700]   for five years to help nurture him as a disciple.
[00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:50.780]   Franklin was raised in the home
[00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:53.740]   of one of the world's most famous evangelicals,
[00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:56.380]   a person of deep character and passion for Christ
[00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:59.860]   and for the Bible and for its message of salvation hope.
[00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:05.780]   He worked very hard and did lead an exemplary life,
[00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:09.740]   private and public, primarily marked by personal piety.
[00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:13.980]   It was an evangel of individual salvation,
[00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:18.500]   internal deliverance, biblical dependency,
[00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:22.500]   church allegiance, evangelistic commitment and zeal.
[00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:26.860]   This is the gospel of the American Bible Belt.
[00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:30.660]   It is a gospel that taps into the cultural location,
[00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:34.140]   a religious strategy that names true things
[00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:37.700]   that are stripped of surrounding truth so profound
[00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:41.140]   that they lead to another kind of Jesus,
[00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:43.300]   or at least they are susceptible to that.
[00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:49.100]   God can and does use almost any kind of messenger.
[00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:51.780]   But the evangel it represents in my view,
[00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:55.780]   especially in this kind of white American evangelicalism
[00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:57.460]   that I'm describing,
[00:40:57.460 --> 00:41:02.140]   misrepresents so much that has become problematic,
[00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:04.860]   especially in recent years
[00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:07.860]   as it has become tied to President Trump
[00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:11.020]   and the repeated deflection of all the immoral
[00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:14.900]   and abuse theologies tied to the Trump administration.
[00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:21.020]   All this, Franklin has publicly affirmed again and again
[00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:24.660]   as a person who was God's anointed leader
[00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:25.900]   to the United States.
[00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:31.420]   This evangel is submerged
[00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:34.700]   in a culture of power and self-interest.
[00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:41.260]   What makes the story of John Stott especially remarkable
[00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:44.460]   is the way the evangel set him free
[00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:46.660]   from his cultural location.
[00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:50.460]   He began inside, deeply inside,
[00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:55.460]   a highly privileged, very economically wealthy family.
[00:41:55.460 --> 00:42:00.620]   John leveraged the gifts of privilege,
[00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:03.140]   but he did so attuning himself as he grew
[00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:04.980]   and matured as a disciple
[00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:07.900]   to an entirely different vision of a kingdom
[00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:12.020]   that was not about empire, English or otherwise,
[00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:15.740]   and a normativity that was not about his own power,
[00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:19.060]   but was about trying to be evidence
[00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:23.380]   of the reflective power of Christ in vulnerability
[00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:25.460]   that was not about success,
[00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:29.300]   but about truth and obedience and servanthood.
[00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:36.020]   Gestures of kindness, cultural relocation
[00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:39.300]   shows up in a prominent way in the Lausanne Covenant.
[00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:42.860]   At the first Congress called jointly
[00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:44.860]   by Billy Graham and John Stott,
[00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:49.140]   when the voices and lives of non-Western Christian leaders
[00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:52.340]   were finally heard and trusted
[00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:54.860]   on an international evangelical stage
[00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:58.900]   in a way that one could argue had never happened before,
[00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:02.060]   the evangelical world changed by its adoption
[00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:05.980]   because it was the story of the evangel confronting culture
[00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:10.980]   and hearing voices that are not powerful, successful,
[00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:15.300]   mega, popular, or dominantly white or male.
[00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:20.300]   This is the fruit of a wise life centered in Christ,
[00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:24.500]   a Christology that trumps culture, not the other way around.
[00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:28.500]   So culture or Christology,
[00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:33.860]   Christians cannot and should not deny or reject culture.
[00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:36.260]   And we must not pretend
[00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:39.420]   that we are not shaped and compromised by it.
[00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:41.860]   What we must discover is how much more sway
[00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:45.340]   culture typically has than our Christology.
[00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:48.540]   It is not clear the American white evangelicals
[00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:51.500]   understand culture seriously enough.
[00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:53.180]   But what does seem clear
[00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:55.940]   is that they do not allow our Christology
[00:43:55.940 --> 00:44:00.420]   to be transformative enough, self-critiquing enough
[00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:03.220]   of the water in which they swim.
[00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:05.260]   Without that deeper work,
[00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:09.180]   we are to speak and to show the evangel to the world
[00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:14.180]   it will fail the God that we claim to honor and to serve.
[00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:21.580]   Let me stop there and turn to our evening's respondents.
[00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:25.060]   - Thank you, Mark, for the inspiring lecture
[00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:27.180]   and to invite us to reflect on
[00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:29.620]   how should we allow our Christology
[00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:32.700]   to transform our culture and the way we live
[00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:36.380]   that's about truth, obedience, and servanthood.
[00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:39.620]   Now, two members of our faculty
[00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:43.420]   will give their responses to Dr. Labotin's lecture
[00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:47.980]   and the Q&A session will immediately follow the responses.
[00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:50.180]   Just a quick reminder again,
[00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:52.860]   if you have any questions or comments,
[00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:57.020]   you can post them on our website in the live streaming page.
[00:44:57.020 --> 00:44:59.020]   You can scroll down to the webpage
[00:44:59.020 --> 00:45:02.780]   and after the live streaming in Putonghua,
[00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:04.820]   there is a Q&A session
[00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:07.740]   where you can input your questions or comments
[00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:09.520]   after inputting your names.
[00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:14.620]   So let us now welcome our respondents.
[00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:18.900]   Dr. Celine Yun, Assistant Professor of Theological Study,
[00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:22.780]   and then later we'll have reference Dr. King Yip Lui,
[00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:26.240]   Heavenly Blessing Professor of Theological Study.
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:27.080]   So welcome.
[00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:30.820]   (audience members murmuring)
[00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:43.800]   - Thank you, Mark, for another inspiring lecture.
[00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:50.720]   I appreciate your remark that theological scholarship
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:57.160]   is personal narrative,
[00:45:57.160 --> 00:46:01.720]   so I guess I'll fill everyone in with my own history here.
[00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:07.440]   I grew up in a Christian home here in Hong Kong.
[00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:10.220]   I would describe myself as a conservative,
[00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:19.400]   ephedraical, if that means respecting
[00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:24.400]   the outmost authority of scripture
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:29.840]   and believing that the mission of the church
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:33.000]   is to convert people to Christ.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:37.360]   My exposure has been as such
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:40.400]   until I found myself setting foot
[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:45.400]   in Princeton Theological Seminary five years ago
[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:50.520]   in New Jersey where I did my PhD in theology.
[00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:59.560]   New Jersey is a deeply democrat state,
[00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:06.960]   and that is to say as a conservative.
[00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:09.480]   I spent five years in a very
[00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:11.900]   (stammering)
[00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:14.480]   a very
[00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:20.980]   liberal place.
[00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:26.300]   I will spare you all with the details
[00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:31.300]   of my adventure in Princeton as a conservative woman,
[00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:36.360]   but for now I'll just say that while I agree with Mark
[00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:41.400]   that American evangelicals are in a crisis,
[00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:45.120]   I like to give them at least some credit.
[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:51.160]   My experience at Princeton was that ironically,
[00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:56.320]   it is often the conservative evangelicals
[00:47:56.320 --> 00:48:01.320]   who befriend international students
[00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:06.060]   and go out of their way to help us.
[00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:10.440]   I went to many churches near my area,
[00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:15.440]   and it was almost impossible to find a congregation
[00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:19.660]   that is multiracial.
[00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:25.700]   They are always either all white or all black or all Asians,
[00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:31.700]   but the only one church I came across
[00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:38.580]   that was truly multiracial with roughly 1/3
[00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:43.400]   of the congregation white, 1/3 black,
[00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:48.300]   and 1/3 Hispanic was in fact an
[00:48:48.300 --> 00:49:01.660]   evangelical church led by a white couple.
[00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:06.660]   In these two lectures,
[00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:18.900]   I think Mark has highlighted a clear
[00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:21.660]   and present danger in the church
[00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:27.420]   that what we hold as Christian faith
[00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:31.480]   may in fact not be the true gospel.
[00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:37.280]   But only a reflection of our own ideology.
[00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:42.120]   In the words of
[00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:49.200]   Grand Louis Segundo,
[00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:55.440]   we are capable of deforming doctrine
[00:49:57.820 --> 00:50:02.820]   in order to protect our own interests.
[00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:11.100]   This warning also reminds me of Caleb Barthes' warning
[00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:14.820]   of happy little hyphens.
[00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:16.060]   The hyphens we
[00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:21.980]   intentionally or unintentionally
[00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:28.140]   put between the gospel and our own culture.
[00:50:28.140 --> 00:50:34.580]   Chinese Christians, for example,
[00:50:34.580 --> 00:50:36.460]   without very
[00:50:36.460 --> 00:50:42.140]   competitive culture
[00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:49.620]   tends to equate a good Christian kid
[00:50:49.620 --> 00:50:52.020]   with being hardworking.
[00:50:52.020 --> 00:50:56.780]   And achieving good academic results.
[00:50:56.780 --> 00:51:05.480]   We like to listen to testimonies
[00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:10.180]   that highlight success as some form of divine
[00:51:10.180 --> 00:51:14.860]   blessing.
[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:21.960]   Yet this reflect more
[00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:29.360]   a social location than the content of the gospel.
[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:35.640]   While a lot of churches are active
[00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:43.260]   in social services in Hong Kong,
[00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:46.640]   a lot of the church leaders think the church
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:51.360]   should take on a quiet attitude
[00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:52.780]   towards politics.
[00:51:52.780 --> 00:51:56.800]   Even during the heated
[00:51:56.800 --> 00:52:01.320]   and anti-extradition protests
[00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:05.960]   since June 2019 that rocked the whole city.
[00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:10.560]   This attitude, however,
[00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:14.880]   coincides with that of a particular generation
[00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:16.100]   here in Hong Kong.
[00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:19.660]   Who, who, who, who,
[00:52:19.660 --> 00:52:26.260]   who treasure prosperity and stability.
[00:52:26.260 --> 00:52:32.420]   In,
[00:52:32.420 --> 00:52:39.500]   in today's lecture,
[00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:41.920]   (stuttering)
[00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:48.820]   Mark has offered an
[00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:49.820]   overwhelming
[00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:56.820]   contrast between two
[00:52:56.820 --> 00:53:00.520]   evangelical figures.
[00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:09.300]   Both grew up in,
[00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:15.980]   in privileged families.
[00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:20.980]   But one managed to be free from his own culture and class.
[00:53:20.980 --> 00:53:27.580]   While the other seems to proclaim a gospel
[00:53:27.580 --> 00:53:29.660]   that only
[00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:35.300]   reflects his own
[00:53:35.300 --> 00:53:37.620]   (stuttering)
[00:53:37.620 --> 00:53:40.200]   social location.
[00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:45.460]   I think Mark has helped us,
[00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:50.020]   I think Mark has helpfully shown us
[00:53:50.020 --> 00:53:50.860]   how the two
[00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:55.860]   differ not so much in the content of their
[00:53:55.860 --> 00:54:02.300]   Christology as in the integration of their faith.
[00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:06.980]   As a systematic theologian, I hope to,
[00:54:06.980 --> 00:54:14.140]   to reiterate a little bit more
[00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:16.940]   on, on, on what
[00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:21.320]   Christology amounts to.
[00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:24.100]   First,
[00:54:24.100 --> 00:54:31.060]   Christology attempts to speak of the unspeakable cross.
[00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:35.260]   The unspeakable horror of the cross
[00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:38.140]   on which God in the person of the son
[00:54:38.140 --> 00:54:40.300]   condemned all human sin.
[00:54:40.300 --> 00:54:47.340]   The cross precisely
[00:54:47.340 --> 00:54:51.380]   denounces the human status quo.
[00:54:51.380 --> 00:54:55.460]   I believe that we fail to understand the cross
[00:54:55.460 --> 00:54:57.420]   if we fail to understand
[00:54:57.420 --> 00:55:01.860]   this divine no.
[00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:02.700]   Or if we
[00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:07.320]   restrict it only to our personal lives
[00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:09.160]   or to spiritual matters
[00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:15.460]   instead of the whole human condition.
[00:55:15.460 --> 00:55:24.960]   One way of letting Christology
[00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:29.540]   reform our lives is to acknowledge that
[00:55:29.540 --> 00:55:33.360]   all that is taken for granted in our culture
[00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:36.380]   has to be transformed.
[00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:41.160]   And this first person pronoun is important.
[00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:48.080]   The cross does not only condemn our opponents
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:49.580]   but our ways as well.
[00:55:49.580 --> 00:55:51.760]   Second,
[00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:55.760]   Christology attempts to speak of the
[00:55:56.840 --> 00:56:00.120]   humiliation and suffering of God
[00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:02.000]   in the person of the son.
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:09.740]   Jesus Christ identified with the poor
[00:56:09.740 --> 00:56:12.220]   and loved to surround himself with
[00:56:12.220 --> 00:56:15.620]   social outcasts and sinners.
[00:56:15.620 --> 00:56:19.040]   He was himself a refugee and a
[00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:24.100]   political criminal.
[00:56:25.700 --> 00:56:29.300]   I notice however that the Chinese churches
[00:56:29.300 --> 00:56:34.300]   love to preach the disciplinary and authoritative poor
[00:56:34.300 --> 00:56:37.580]   a lot more than the lowly and even
[00:56:37.580 --> 00:56:42.940]   politically sensitive Christ.
[00:56:42.940 --> 00:56:48.340]   And even with Christ, our culture makes us focus more
[00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:50.700]   on the victorious side of him.
[00:56:55.360 --> 00:57:00.020]   Instead of the humble and compassionate side of him.
[00:57:00.020 --> 00:57:04.340]   One way of letting Christology reform our lives
[00:57:04.340 --> 00:57:09.340]   is to rediscover the Christ
[00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:11.940]   who is for the sinner.
[00:57:11.940 --> 00:57:16.180]   In some I've learned that
[00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:22.000]   that Christology is not only asking a who question
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.080]   as in who is Christ
[00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:29.080]   but equally a whom question.
[00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:33.420]   For whom is Christ proclaimed?
[00:57:33.420 --> 00:57:34.540]   We have to ask
[00:57:34.540 --> 00:57:40.880]   does the Christology we proclaim
[00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:44.340]   only serve the interest of a certain group?
[00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:52.100]   Thank you again Mark for your lecture.
[00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:54.940]   (footsteps)
[00:57:54.940 --> 00:58:06.440]   - Well thank you Mark for your two illuminating lectures.
[00:58:06.440 --> 00:58:09.360]   I'm so glad I can hear this reflection
[00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:12.000]   from a KOL or key opinion leader
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.780]   of American evangelicalism.
[00:58:14.780 --> 00:58:19.600]   Since Mark begins his lectures with some personal story
[00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:22.840]   I would do the same to let Mark and others
[00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:25.160]   understand where I come from.
[00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:29.000]   I went to a conservative reformed theological seminary
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:32.000]   Westminster Theological Seminary Philadelphia
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:33.860]   for my MDiv degree.
[00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:37.260]   To broaden my theological perspectives
[00:58:37.260 --> 00:58:40.140]   I took classes in Princeton Seminary
[00:58:40.140 --> 00:58:43.100]   and in Union Seminary New York.
[00:58:43.100 --> 00:58:48.060]   And I almost went to a fuller for my PhD studies
[00:58:48.060 --> 00:58:49.460]   but that's another story.
[00:58:49.460 --> 00:58:53.220]   I still identify myself as a child
[00:58:53.220 --> 00:58:55.940]   of American evangelicalism.
[00:58:55.940 --> 00:59:00.620]   I wrote my doctoral dissertation on Jonathan Edwards.
[00:59:00.620 --> 00:59:04.740]   And I have taught on American fundamentalisms
[00:59:04.740 --> 00:59:08.340]   and evangelicalism here in CGST.
[00:59:08.340 --> 00:59:11.340]   So thank you Mark for speaking on a topic
[00:59:11.340 --> 00:59:12.960]   that is dear to me.
[00:59:14.020 --> 00:59:19.020]   I concur with Mark that American white evangelicalism
[00:59:19.020 --> 00:59:23.220]   is very sick today or at least parts of it.
[00:59:23.220 --> 00:59:27.060]   And we need to pray for God's mercy upon his church.
[00:59:27.060 --> 00:59:30.900]   President Trump has somehow managed
[00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:34.140]   to bring out some of the worst characteristics
[00:59:34.140 --> 00:59:35.680]   of evangelicalism.
[00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:41.580]   Yes I understand why some Christians would vote for Trump
[00:59:41.580 --> 00:59:43.500]   in the recent election.
[00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:47.740]   But when some of my Christian friends denounce
[00:59:47.740 --> 00:59:52.740]   the New York Times as a tabloid from the radical left
[00:59:52.740 --> 00:59:56.900]   while they totally ignore the many unfounded claims
[00:59:56.900 --> 01:00:00.600]   that Trump has told, I'm troubled.
[01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:03.940]   Yes I don't want school children to have the freedom
[01:00:03.940 --> 01:00:06.380]   to declare their own sex.
[01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:10.460]   And I don't believe that it is a violation of human right
[01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:14.380]   to differentiate between a naturally born woman
[01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:16.840]   and a transgender woman.
[01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:21.840]   However I'm also appalled by the gun violence in America
[01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:26.200]   and the abject poverty of the city ghettos
[01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:28.640]   among all the riches in America.
[01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:34.540]   Why does the church make the LGBTQ movement
[01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:38.300]   into an apocalyptic calamity
[01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:42.000]   while ignoring the sufferings of the black community?
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.660]   Yes I believe in the authority of the Bible.
[01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:50.560]   Yet when someone quotes Genesis 2
[01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:54.420]   and then claims that there is a divine given right
[01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:58.640]   of breathing and this right means that the government
[01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:03.640]   cannot ask people to wear a mask even in a pandemic.
[01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:07.600]   I feel baffled by such theological reasoning.
[01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:13.520]   Why does culture trump Christology, pun intended,
[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:16.920]   in white evangelicalism?
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:20.000]   I would like to suggest a few reasons.
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.000]   Perhaps speaking with the prejudice
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.020]   of a church historian which I am.
[01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:30.760]   White evangelicalism buys into the mythology
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:35.760]   of a once golden era of American Christianity.
[01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:39.080]   I.e. it's a question about eschatology.
[01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:42.720]   What is our theology of eschatology?
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:45.320]   In my years in Westminster,
[01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:49.840]   the Puritans are exhorted as model Christians
[01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:53.880]   and Machen and Van Thiel which they are founders
[01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:56.760]   of my seminary, are the bugwack
[01:01:56.760 --> 01:02:00.020]   against anti-Christian modernism.
[01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:02.840]   While these people are heroes of faith to me
[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:05.480]   in their own ways, they did not address
[01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:08.480]   the burning issues of our days.
[01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:10.680]   Sometimes they even choose to ignore
[01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:13.840]   the burning issues of their time.
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:16.400]   For example, the civil rights movement
[01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:19.100]   is invisible in Van Thiel's writing.
[01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:25.000]   John Murray defends slavery as not being per se evil
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.880]   in his book on biblical ethics.
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:31.400]   The book is called Principles of Conduct
[01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:34.960]   which was written in 1957 and was still used
[01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:38.500]   as a textbook when I studied there at Westminster in 1992.
[01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:44.440]   And Trump's slogan, "Make America Great Again,"
[01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:47.840]   again, notice the words, suggests that
[01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:52.840]   the once golden era of America is now ruined
[01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:56.760]   by immigrants, by the liberals, by the radical left,
[01:02:56.760 --> 01:03:00.820]   by the Chinese government, or by unpatriotic Americans.
[01:03:01.660 --> 01:03:05.980]   According to Trump or white evangelicalism,
[01:03:05.980 --> 01:03:10.860]   we need to build endless wars, both physical wars
[01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:15.380]   and psychological wars, to reign in these evil forces.
[01:03:15.380 --> 01:03:19.820]   Mark has told us how the white church
[01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:23.240]   has failed African people in the past
[01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:25.640]   and even in the present.
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:29.380]   White evangelicals need to read their past
[01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:34.380]   with a critical spirit, without an unhealthy nostalgia
[01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:40.380]   or an unhealthy sense of the superiority of the past.
[01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:43.220]   But we need to understand that
[01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:47.440]   the golden Christian America never exists.
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:53.580]   With a rereading of the past, we can then be open
[01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:56.460]   to a more flexible future.
[01:03:56.460 --> 01:04:00.820]   Yes, white Anglo-Saxon Protestant, or WAPF,
[01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:05.220]   is no longer the dominant cultural force in America,
[01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:08.700]   but that does not mean that America
[01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:13.040]   is on a slippery slope to Satan's kingdom.
[01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:18.040]   White evangelicals need to see that God has not left America
[01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:22.140]   and will never leave America,
[01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:24.500]   not even with a Biden presidency.
[01:04:25.900 --> 01:04:29.180]   If we Christians can give thanks
[01:04:29.180 --> 01:04:31.620]   for the heritage of the Puritans,
[01:04:31.620 --> 01:04:35.300]   we can also give thanks for Martin Luther King,
[01:04:35.300 --> 01:04:38.020]   for the concern for ecology,
[01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:41.100]   or for the push towards diversity in government
[01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:42.620]   and in the corporate world.
[01:04:42.620 --> 01:04:48.080]   America will not go back to a nostalgic past,
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:49.940]   and it should not.
[01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:54.200]   Sure, not all social changes in America are good,
[01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:57.500]   but evangelicals should have the confidence
[01:04:57.500 --> 01:05:01.620]   that God is still working today in America.
[01:05:01.620 --> 01:05:06.260]   In many ways, white evangelicals have bought
[01:05:06.260 --> 01:05:09.540]   into a lot of secular values,
[01:05:09.540 --> 01:05:14.040]   even as they claim to be upholding biblical values only.
[01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:18.980]   Mark will discuss some of these values in the next lecture.
[01:05:18.980 --> 01:05:23.140]   Here, I will just single out one particular example,
[01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:25.920]   the postmodern hermeneutics of suspicion.
[01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:29.940]   According to postmodernism,
[01:05:29.940 --> 01:05:33.580]   the society is fragmented into many subgroups
[01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:35.520]   and subcultures.
[01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:40.000]   Postmodernism has lost faith in objectivity
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.940]   or procedural justice.
[01:05:41.940 --> 01:05:46.540]   All truth claims are power grabs,
[01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:49.720]   and we need to unnerve conspiracies
[01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:52.940]   and hypocrisies all the time.
[01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:55.260]   We need to fight at all costs,
[01:05:55.260 --> 01:05:58.260]   including demonization of opponents
[01:05:58.260 --> 01:06:02.900]   or disinformation campaign to maintain our own turf.
[01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:07.900]   We see a lot of this postmodern behavior recently
[01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:10.780]   in the white evangelical church.
[01:06:10.780 --> 01:06:14.100]   For example, a lot of medically sound
[01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:18.220]   pandemic control policies are perceived as tactics
[01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:22.380]   by the liberals to control religious liberty.
[01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:26.500]   Talks of diversity are automatically classified
[01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:29.100]   as LGBTQ ideology.
[01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:33.580]   Key opinion leaders who dare to build bridges
[01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:37.660]   with non-evangelicals, such as Tim Keller,
[01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:42.180]   are sometimes vilified as giving up their orthodox faith.
[01:06:42.180 --> 01:06:48.260]   Jesus dined with tax collectors and with the Pharisees.
[01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:52.700]   As Mark has said, the church needs to reflect
[01:06:52.700 --> 01:06:56.300]   more on incarnation Christology
[01:06:56.300 --> 01:07:00.820]   in order to overcome such agonistic mentality,
[01:07:00.820 --> 01:07:04.220]   you know, that everyone else who disagree with us,
[01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:06.420]   they are our enemies, you know.
[01:07:06.420 --> 01:07:12.100]   Lastly, white evangelicalism needs to evaluate
[01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:14.660]   their own beneath critically.
[01:07:14.660 --> 01:07:18.020]   There is no pure Christian faith
[01:07:18.020 --> 01:07:21.780]   devoid of all cultural bias,
[01:07:21.780 --> 01:07:25.740]   i.e. in their search for a so-called pure Christian faith,
[01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:30.740]   actually they turn a blind eye to their own cultural bias.
[01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:34.900]   All theology are in some way culturally biased,
[01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:36.500]   for we are but humans.
[01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:41.580]   We can try to be aware of our own bias as much as possible
[01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:46.540]   by studying the history of evangelicalism critically
[01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:49.580]   and by listening to how others,
[01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:51.380]   including others' ethnic groups,
[01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:53.580]   other Christian traditions,
[01:07:53.580 --> 01:07:56.580]   even social scientists or people of other faith,
[01:07:56.580 --> 01:08:01.380]   we evangelicals can perceive,
[01:08:01.380 --> 01:08:05.020]   can have a better perception of the pressing evils of today.
[01:08:05.020 --> 01:08:08.580]   And then perhaps evangelicals can now
[01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:12.700]   and can then work with others to make America
[01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:17.460]   and even the world a better place to live for all peoples.
[01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:18.740]   Thank you.
[01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:19.580]   - Thank you.
[01:08:19.580 --> 01:08:24.740]   Thank you both very much.
[01:08:24.740 --> 01:08:41.220]   - Thank you, Kin, and thank you, Celine, for your responses.
[01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:43.780]   So now we are in our Q&A session.
[01:08:43.780 --> 01:08:46.460]   We have about 45 minutes.
[01:08:46.460 --> 01:08:48.940]   We have been receiving some questions already
[01:08:48.940 --> 01:08:51.100]   on the internet, but for those of you
[01:08:51.100 --> 01:08:54.300]   who have any questions or comments
[01:08:54.300 --> 01:08:58.820]   regarding Dr. Laputin's lecture or for the response then,
[01:08:58.820 --> 01:09:00.660]   you're welcome to post your question
[01:09:00.660 --> 01:09:02.900]   on our live streaming page.
[01:09:02.900 --> 01:09:04.940]   You can scroll down at the end of the page
[01:09:04.940 --> 01:09:06.580]   and you will see a Q&A session
[01:09:06.580 --> 01:09:09.520]   where you can enter your questions and also your name.
[01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:15.660]   So let me read the question we have already.
[01:09:15.660 --> 01:09:20.780]   So Dr. Laputin, maybe you can respond to this question.
[01:09:20.780 --> 01:09:24.860]   So this audience appreciate very much
[01:09:24.860 --> 01:09:29.860]   about your critiques of the American white evangelical church
[01:09:29.860 --> 01:09:32.820]   which understand her identity more in social
[01:09:32.820 --> 01:09:36.980]   and cultural terms rather than through a Christological lens.
[01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:39.140]   And to risk oversimplification,
[01:09:39.140 --> 01:09:43.100]   I want to see how a true understanding of Christology
[01:09:43.100 --> 01:09:46.660]   will help faith communities which are not in power
[01:09:46.660 --> 01:09:49.940]   but subdued, not perpetrator of oppression,
[01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:54.780]   but oppressed to gain a transformed vision of the identity.
[01:09:54.780 --> 01:09:57.020]   Maybe, Mark, you can speak a little bit
[01:09:57.020 --> 01:09:59.980]   and then respondents, you're welcome to jump in.
[01:09:59.980 --> 01:10:04.220]   - I want to be sure that I'm understanding.
[01:10:04.220 --> 01:10:07.820]   So the question is, how does a Christology
[01:10:07.820 --> 01:10:11.100]   influence the experience and perceptions
[01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:12.940]   of people who are without power,
[01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:14.580]   not just people who have power?
[01:10:14.580 --> 01:10:17.060]   - Right, so how can a true Christology
[01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:20.900]   can help us to have a more transformed identity
[01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:23.300]   of our Christian identity?
[01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:24.860]   - Right.
[01:10:24.860 --> 01:10:28.500]   Well, let me use the example that I did earlier
[01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:35.020]   about the influence of the gospel
[01:10:35.020 --> 01:10:37.420]   in slave culture, for example.
[01:10:37.420 --> 01:10:41.500]   So often, if you go to the Museum of African American
[01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:43.300]   Studies in the United States,
[01:10:43.300 --> 01:10:47.340]   what you'll find is that this museum has what were called,
[01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:50.140]   quote, slave Bibles.
[01:10:50.140 --> 01:10:54.620]   And the slave Bibles had sections of the biblical text
[01:10:54.620 --> 01:10:59.620]   cut out that would have given power and value and dignity
[01:10:59.620 --> 01:11:03.540]   to people who were without power,
[01:11:03.540 --> 01:11:06.220]   namely to the slaves themselves.
[01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:09.500]   And the slave masters didn't want the whole Bible
[01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:12.900]   to be handed out to people who are learning to read.
[01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:15.900]   They wanted them to only have parts of the text
[01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:18.060]   in order to subjugate them.
[01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:20.580]   What of course happens is that over time,
[01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:23.780]   they are readers of the whole Bible.
[01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:26.180]   And part of the planting, the deep planting
[01:11:26.180 --> 01:11:31.060]   of Christian faith among slaves in the United States,
[01:11:31.060 --> 01:11:34.180]   and still to this day among African Americans,
[01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:39.180]   is that the Bible itself is a book of social transformation.
[01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:42.820]   And though they may be devalued by culture,
[01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:46.820]   they may be misrepresented in government and in business.
[01:11:46.820 --> 01:11:50.420]   They may be poor and marginalized culturally.
[01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:54.540]   They are given value and dignity and worth
[01:11:54.540 --> 01:11:59.460]   because of the way that the Bible reveals to them
[01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:03.500]   the character and meaning of their lives.
[01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:07.140]   Now, this experience of course is evident around the world.
[01:12:07.140 --> 01:12:09.500]   We can probably all give examples
[01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:11.220]   of the way this has occurred.
[01:12:11.220 --> 01:12:14.580]   But I think it is in part letting the Bible
[01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:18.620]   have its own full voice and not be heard
[01:12:18.620 --> 01:12:21.700]   only through the lens of a dominant interpreter,
[01:12:21.700 --> 01:12:25.180]   whether white and male and American
[01:12:25.180 --> 01:12:27.700]   or some other kind of dominant expression
[01:12:27.700 --> 01:12:30.220]   of biblical authority.
[01:12:30.220 --> 01:12:33.380]   So I think that's one key.
[01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:35.780]   I think another key is meant to be,
[01:12:35.780 --> 01:12:38.660]   and often isn't for the reasons I've tried to give,
[01:12:38.660 --> 01:12:41.540]   one of the ways that it's meant to be experienced
[01:12:41.540 --> 01:12:45.260]   and discovered is through the church itself,
[01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:49.020]   a communion of unlike people who come to know
[01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:52.300]   and love one another because Jesus Christ alone
[01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:55.340]   breaks down the dividing walls of hostility
[01:12:55.340 --> 01:12:58.260]   and welcomes the rich and the poor,
[01:12:58.260 --> 01:13:03.020]   the white, the black, the Asian, the Latino,
[01:13:03.020 --> 01:13:05.020]   that welcomes people who are educated
[01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:06.260]   and people who have no education,
[01:13:06.260 --> 01:13:07.780]   people who are public sinners
[01:13:07.780 --> 01:13:12.380]   and people who are private sinners or both, et cetera.
[01:13:12.380 --> 01:13:16.580]   And in that unexpected communion,
[01:13:16.580 --> 01:13:19.540]   we wake up to our deeper identity,
[01:13:19.540 --> 01:13:22.980]   which is not the social status into which we were born
[01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:24.860]   or that we've supposedly earned
[01:13:24.860 --> 01:13:27.820]   and fought our way into achieving,
[01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:31.780]   but instead into a gift that only God's grace can create
[01:13:31.780 --> 01:13:34.820]   called the body of Christ.
[01:13:34.820 --> 01:13:37.940]   So the tragedy of all the divisions
[01:13:37.940 --> 01:13:41.300]   within the body of Christ is not only a wound against God
[01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:44.500]   and a wound against Jesus who gave his life
[01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:49.180]   for a new communion, but then a failure for people,
[01:13:49.180 --> 01:13:52.180]   wherever they might be on the social spectrum,
[01:13:52.180 --> 01:13:55.580]   to rediscover their identity through the Bible
[01:13:55.580 --> 01:14:00.580]   and by the embodiment of its teaching in the church itself.
[01:14:00.580 --> 01:14:03.740]   So when all of that is broken, the Bible is dismissed,
[01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:05.780]   let's say, or it's put to the uses
[01:14:05.780 --> 01:14:09.540]   of only some ranks in social hierarchy
[01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:13.340]   and used against other ranks in social hierarchy,
[01:14:13.340 --> 01:14:16.820]   then in fact, it is literally a dismemberment
[01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:21.020]   of the body that Jesus Christ died to save
[01:14:21.020 --> 01:14:26.020]   and aches and longs and weeps to make one new humanity.
[01:14:26.020 --> 01:14:28.980]   So I think I'll stop there
[01:14:28.980 --> 01:14:31.580]   just as an introductory set of comments.
[01:14:31.580 --> 01:14:35.820]   - So allowing the Bible to speak the full voice
[01:14:35.820 --> 01:14:38.220]   and also through the church community,
[01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:41.580]   we can embody what the Bible says.
[01:14:41.580 --> 01:14:45.060]   - Right, and yet we know, I think, around the world
[01:14:45.060 --> 01:14:46.980]   that typically the churches reflect
[01:14:46.980 --> 01:14:50.020]   certain social categories and racial categories
[01:14:50.020 --> 01:14:54.900]   and gender types and a social expression,
[01:14:54.900 --> 01:14:58.020]   which does not embody the whole gospel.
[01:14:58.020 --> 01:14:59.500]   And often we're not committed to that
[01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:01.180]   even as a hope or a goal.
[01:15:01.180 --> 01:15:03.460]   - Thank you.
[01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:06.940]   - I just add two more remarks.
[01:15:06.940 --> 01:15:09.460]   I think sometimes when we read the Bible,
[01:15:09.460 --> 01:15:11.580]   we tend to take the Bible's message
[01:15:11.580 --> 01:15:14.180]   out of the social context.
[01:15:14.180 --> 01:15:17.980]   For example, we say Jesus is apolitical,
[01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:22.140]   but actually if you read Jesus' criticism of the Pharisees,
[01:15:22.140 --> 01:15:24.860]   it's a very political move.
[01:15:24.860 --> 01:15:27.820]   The other remark I will add is
[01:15:27.820 --> 01:15:32.780]   we need to read Christology written by different people.
[01:15:32.780 --> 01:15:35.540]   For example, when I was in America,
[01:15:35.540 --> 01:15:38.060]   I took a course from James Cone,
[01:15:38.060 --> 01:15:40.940]   a back theologian on back theology.
[01:15:40.940 --> 01:15:41.940]   Now at the end of the day,
[01:15:41.940 --> 01:15:43.540]   I don't, there are a lot of things
[01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:45.300]   I don't agree with James Cone.
[01:15:45.300 --> 01:15:46.340]   But on the other hand,
[01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:48.900]   that course was just an eye opener for me.
[01:15:48.900 --> 01:15:50.940]   I mean, I see things in the Bible
[01:15:50.940 --> 01:15:54.740]   that I would never see if I stay just in Westminster.
[01:15:54.740 --> 01:15:58.260]   So we need to listen to people who speak
[01:15:58.260 --> 01:16:00.940]   from different backgrounds, different ethnic groups,
[01:16:00.940 --> 01:16:03.620]   to just to see how things,
[01:16:03.620 --> 01:16:06.580]   how different people can see things quite differently
[01:16:06.580 --> 01:16:07.540]   from the Bible.
[01:16:07.540 --> 01:16:09.420]   - Right.
[01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:16.460]   - So we have another two questions
[01:16:16.460 --> 01:16:18.540]   that are related to the relationship
[01:16:18.540 --> 01:16:21.020]   between the church and the government.
[01:16:21.020 --> 01:16:22.620]   So I'm just gonna read both of them
[01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:25.060]   and then maybe you can answer them together.
[01:16:25.060 --> 01:16:30.340]   So evangelicals and Republicans go hand in hand.
[01:16:30.340 --> 01:16:32.420]   The relationship is very deep.
[01:16:32.420 --> 01:16:36.100]   Is it possible for evangelical to take a neutral position
[01:16:36.100 --> 01:16:39.260]   to both parties in the near future?
[01:16:39.260 --> 01:16:40.980]   And another related question,
[01:16:40.980 --> 01:16:46.180]   people like Jerry Falwell and other famous pastor
[01:16:46.180 --> 01:16:49.700]   and powerful evangelicals use their position
[01:16:49.700 --> 01:16:53.100]   to influence presidents and lawmakers
[01:16:53.100 --> 01:16:55.220]   to advance their causes.
[01:16:55.220 --> 01:16:58.620]   A lot of people, especially non-Christians, resent this.
[01:16:58.620 --> 01:17:00.340]   What is your opinion?
[01:17:00.340 --> 01:17:02.780]   That's a quote from the question online.
[01:17:02.780 --> 01:17:07.300]   So Mark, do you have any response to those questions?
[01:17:07.300 --> 01:17:11.140]   - They're both very good questions.
[01:17:11.140 --> 01:17:13.540]   Can you read the end of the first question again?
[01:17:13.540 --> 01:17:14.380]   - Sure.
[01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:16.420]   Is it possible for the evangelical
[01:17:16.460 --> 01:17:21.460]   to take a neutral position to both parties in the near future?
[01:17:21.460 --> 01:17:23.060]   - Right.
[01:17:23.060 --> 01:17:26.820]   Republicanism has been taken to be socially consortia
[01:17:26.820 --> 01:17:29.180]   as a party.
[01:17:29.180 --> 01:17:34.380]   And Democrats have been taken to be social progressives.
[01:17:34.380 --> 01:17:38.540]   That question is, does one or the other belong
[01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:40.860]   to the church as an identity?
[01:17:40.860 --> 01:17:44.380]   And I would say, no, not as an identity.
[01:17:45.420 --> 01:17:46.980]   There are things about the gospel
[01:17:46.980 --> 01:17:48.620]   which are socially conservative,
[01:17:48.620 --> 01:17:50.540]   and there are other things about the gospel
[01:17:50.540 --> 01:17:53.140]   which are socially progressive.
[01:17:53.140 --> 01:17:56.220]   And the thought of a church or a church leader
[01:17:56.220 --> 01:17:58.820]   being identified with a single party
[01:17:58.820 --> 01:18:01.780]   seems by definition, from my point of view,
[01:18:01.780 --> 01:18:04.860]   to be enormously problematic
[01:18:04.860 --> 01:18:06.900]   because it suggests that the gospel
[01:18:06.900 --> 01:18:09.340]   then that you're preaching is being filtered
[01:18:09.340 --> 01:18:12.220]   through one political sectarian lens
[01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:14.700]   rather than actually accountable to something
[01:18:14.700 --> 01:18:16.340]   that's much richer.
[01:18:16.340 --> 01:18:19.540]   For one thing, the gospel is itself not binary.
[01:18:19.540 --> 01:18:22.940]   That is, it's not a choice simply between one and the other
[01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:25.060]   as though there's only two options.
[01:18:25.060 --> 01:18:28.700]   We're talking about the God who holds all things together,
[01:18:28.700 --> 01:18:31.100]   the God who is the Lord over all,
[01:18:31.100 --> 01:18:34.780]   the firstborn of creation and the firstborn from the dead.
[01:18:34.780 --> 01:18:36.860]   That's the God that we're worshiping.
[01:18:36.860 --> 01:18:41.180]   So the idea somehow of thinking that our Christology
[01:18:41.180 --> 01:18:44.860]   could be reduced to allegiance to one political party
[01:18:44.860 --> 01:18:46.860]   seems like pure folly to me.
[01:18:46.860 --> 01:18:52.180]   I think there are ways that I'm personally democratic
[01:18:52.180 --> 01:18:54.860]   and there's ways that I'm personally a Republican,
[01:18:54.860 --> 01:18:56.900]   but I don't really care about those labels.
[01:18:56.900 --> 01:18:59.580]   They do not hold any intrinsic value
[01:18:59.580 --> 01:19:00.940]   or particular meaning to me.
[01:19:00.940 --> 01:19:03.940]   They're reference points in social conversation,
[01:19:03.940 --> 01:19:06.260]   but they are not reference points
[01:19:06.260 --> 01:19:11.260]   in my own theological or political philosophy or actions.
[01:19:11.260 --> 01:19:14.620]   So I don't think there is such a thing
[01:19:14.620 --> 01:19:15.860]   as a neutral position,
[01:19:15.860 --> 01:19:18.260]   nor do I think there should be a neutral position.
[01:19:18.260 --> 01:19:20.380]   I'm not arguing for a neutral position.
[01:19:20.380 --> 01:19:24.420]   What I'm arguing for is a deeply vested position
[01:19:24.420 --> 01:19:28.900]   in a whole gospel for all people
[01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:33.900]   and a gospel that speaks at the most profound levels
[01:19:34.100 --> 01:19:38.340]   internally, but also at the most public levels as well.
[01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:40.180]   That's not a neutral position.
[01:19:40.180 --> 01:19:43.380]   It's not a way of quote, staying out of politics.
[01:19:43.380 --> 01:19:46.780]   I don't think a Christian should stay out of politics.
[01:19:46.780 --> 01:19:49.100]   If you mean politics by politics,
[01:19:49.100 --> 01:19:53.340]   sectarian politics divided along party lines,
[01:19:53.340 --> 01:19:55.220]   that's a different conversation.
[01:19:55.220 --> 01:19:58.380]   But if you mean it's possible for a Christian leader
[01:19:58.380 --> 01:20:02.940]   to stay neutral about the uses of power
[01:20:02.940 --> 01:20:05.140]   in the culture that we're a part of,
[01:20:05.140 --> 01:20:08.540]   I don't see how a Christian who calls Jesus Lord
[01:20:08.540 --> 01:20:10.100]   can remain neutral about that.
[01:20:10.100 --> 01:20:14.540]   If I'm seeking to follow Jesus as Lord,
[01:20:14.540 --> 01:20:16.500]   it reorders all power.
[01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:18.540]   It calls my power in question.
[01:20:18.540 --> 01:20:21.100]   It calls any other person's power in question.
[01:20:21.100 --> 01:20:24.380]   It talks about how to rightly order power
[01:20:24.380 --> 01:20:26.780]   in a way that reflects the goodness and justice
[01:20:26.780 --> 01:20:28.980]   and truth of God.
[01:20:28.980 --> 01:20:33.700]   So I don't think neutrality is or should be a goal.
[01:20:33.700 --> 01:20:36.060]   And I don't think I would encourage it really
[01:20:36.060 --> 01:20:39.340]   for anyone who might be listening to these lectures.
[01:20:39.340 --> 01:20:42.020]   Working out how we live that out, of course,
[01:20:42.020 --> 01:20:43.100]   is a hard challenge.
[01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:46.220]   And that's partly why we're having these conversations.
[01:20:46.220 --> 01:20:48.940]   Now, the second question,
[01:20:48.940 --> 01:20:51.300]   can you read the end of that again as well?
[01:20:51.300 --> 01:20:53.780]   - Let's see.
[01:20:53.780 --> 01:20:57.380]   So many famous or powerful evangelical pastor
[01:20:57.380 --> 01:21:00.180]   used their position to influence presidents
[01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:02.620]   and lawmakers to advance their cause.
[01:21:02.620 --> 01:21:07.020]   And a lot of people, especially non-Christian, resented it.
[01:21:07.020 --> 01:21:09.180]   What is your opinion on this?
[01:21:09.180 --> 01:21:12.700]   - Well, there's a number of things to say about that.
[01:21:12.700 --> 01:21:14.820]   But fundamentally, I would side with the people
[01:21:14.820 --> 01:21:15.660]   who resent it.
[01:21:15.660 --> 01:21:20.540]   And the reason I put it that way is that often,
[01:21:20.540 --> 01:21:24.620]   when Christians are given access to political power,
[01:21:24.620 --> 01:21:27.180]   especially when their power is primarily located
[01:21:27.180 --> 01:21:30.180]   in the church or in the Christian community,
[01:21:30.180 --> 01:21:33.300]   they go to the government trying to get the government,
[01:21:33.300 --> 01:21:35.500]   quote, "on their side,"
[01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:39.100]   as though it is about seeking governmental favoritism,
[01:21:39.100 --> 01:21:41.380]   rather than bringing to the government
[01:21:41.380 --> 01:21:43.820]   a Christian critique of their government
[01:21:43.820 --> 01:21:46.100]   or of the problem that we're looking at,
[01:21:46.100 --> 01:21:47.740]   whatever it might be.
[01:21:47.740 --> 01:21:51.020]   So often, in the cases of people like Terry Falwell
[01:21:51.020 --> 01:21:54.140]   and in President Trump's Evangelical Advisory Board,
[01:21:54.140 --> 01:21:57.700]   for example, I know from knowing a number of people
[01:21:57.700 --> 01:21:59.540]   that are in that group,
[01:21:59.540 --> 01:22:01.620]   that one of the things that they would all say
[01:22:01.620 --> 01:22:06.260]   is true of that group is that they are not self-critiquing.
[01:22:06.260 --> 01:22:10.300]   They go because they want the president to do their bidding.
[01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:14.980]   So for a pluralist culture to watch Christian people
[01:22:14.980 --> 01:22:17.980]   look for special favor from the government
[01:22:17.980 --> 01:22:20.580]   feels to me as though that's not looking for justice
[01:22:20.580 --> 01:22:22.860]   from the government, which includes,
[01:22:22.860 --> 01:22:24.220]   yes, justice toward the church,
[01:22:24.220 --> 01:22:26.460]   that's legitimate to argue for,
[01:22:26.460 --> 01:22:28.300]   justice for society in general,
[01:22:28.300 --> 01:22:31.180]   that's also part of the work of the church,
[01:22:31.180 --> 01:22:34.180]   to argue for justice for different racial groups,
[01:22:34.180 --> 01:22:36.460]   genders, et cetera.
[01:22:36.460 --> 01:22:40.820]   Those are justice issues around which we should be
[01:22:40.820 --> 01:22:43.460]   not looking for favor
[01:22:43.460 --> 01:22:46.060]   that's going to preference our agenda,
[01:22:46.060 --> 01:22:51.060]   but instead hold the government accountable to God's agenda
[01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:54.420]   for what is actually true and good and righteous,
[01:22:54.420 --> 01:22:56.500]   not just for the church,
[01:22:56.500 --> 01:22:59.700]   but for people made in God's image.
[01:22:59.700 --> 01:23:02.380]   Now that's a delicate balance that has to be done
[01:23:02.380 --> 01:23:04.020]   in a whole variety of different ways
[01:23:04.020 --> 01:23:06.420]   in order to be able to be wise
[01:23:06.420 --> 01:23:08.540]   and discerning about these things.
[01:23:08.540 --> 01:23:11.220]   I'm not suggesting this is easy at all,
[01:23:11.220 --> 01:23:15.220]   but I think that's more like the model that I would command
[01:23:15.220 --> 01:23:19.500]   standing into the conflicts
[01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:23.940]   and trying to bring a more adequate Christian worldview
[01:23:23.940 --> 01:23:28.580]   rather than seeking favor from the government for Christians,
[01:23:28.580 --> 01:23:31.220]   which I don't think is actually what we're called to.
[01:23:31.220 --> 01:23:34.980]   - Right, so standing in conflict
[01:23:34.980 --> 01:23:37.500]   and bringing the critique to the government
[01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:40.420]   instead of trying to gain flavor from it.
[01:23:40.420 --> 01:23:41.460]   - Right.
[01:23:41.460 --> 01:23:42.300]   - Thank you.
[01:23:42.300 --> 01:23:46.540]   - I want to add something again.
[01:23:46.540 --> 01:23:49.820]   I think the evangelical church in America,
[01:23:49.820 --> 01:23:53.620]   sometimes they are too fixated on specific issues,
[01:23:53.620 --> 01:23:55.820]   like abortion, for example.
[01:23:55.820 --> 01:23:58.500]   They're thinking about overturning Roe versus Wade
[01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:02.860]   all the time, but I think the Bible actually teach
[01:24:02.860 --> 01:24:04.620]   many things about justice.
[01:24:04.620 --> 01:24:06.380]   It's not just one thing.
[01:24:06.380 --> 01:24:08.940]   And I think no political party
[01:24:08.940 --> 01:24:11.900]   fulfill the biblical model completely.
[01:24:11.900 --> 01:24:13.540]   So there's a bit diversity.
[01:24:13.540 --> 01:24:15.900]   So some Christians study Republicans,
[01:24:15.900 --> 01:24:18.700]   some Christians study Democrats.
[01:24:18.700 --> 01:24:20.900]   I think that would be a healthy situation.
[01:24:20.900 --> 01:24:22.020]   - Yes, yes.
[01:24:22.020 --> 01:24:25.820]   - So you just pursue things that is nearest to your heart,
[01:24:25.820 --> 01:24:29.180]   but there is no one issue that defines
[01:24:29.180 --> 01:24:32.340]   so-called the Christian political position.
[01:24:32.340 --> 01:24:35.540]   And secondly, I would suggest individual Christian,
[01:24:35.540 --> 01:24:38.420]   of course you can support Republicans,
[01:24:38.420 --> 01:24:39.460]   you can support Democrats,
[01:24:39.460 --> 01:24:41.780]   you can even join their political machine
[01:24:41.780 --> 01:24:45.420]   and lobby for the party and so on, so on.
[01:24:45.420 --> 01:24:49.500]   But for church leaders, for pastor in particular,
[01:24:49.500 --> 01:24:52.780]   I would suggest that pastors should refrain
[01:24:52.780 --> 01:24:55.340]   from political activity directly.
[01:24:55.340 --> 01:24:59.700]   I mean, you can visit a president or a senator
[01:24:59.700 --> 01:25:01.220]   and pray with him, that's okay.
[01:25:01.220 --> 01:25:03.540]   On a personal level, of course that's okay.
[01:25:03.540 --> 01:25:06.140]   But if it's a political event,
[01:25:06.140 --> 01:25:10.020]   I think the pastor or church leaders to remember
[01:25:10.020 --> 01:25:13.700]   the main role of the church is witnessing the truth.
[01:25:13.700 --> 01:25:15.220]   We are not an interest group.
[01:25:15.220 --> 01:25:19.700]   Our main job is to witness God's justice.
[01:25:19.700 --> 01:25:23.860]   And if this justice can come to fruit in the world,
[01:25:23.860 --> 01:25:26.940]   that's God's work, that's not our effort.
[01:25:26.940 --> 01:25:31.620]   And we witness what is the faithful truth of God.
[01:25:31.620 --> 01:25:33.740]   And then sometimes we just have to trust God
[01:25:33.740 --> 01:25:38.060]   to see how God will realize his kingdom on earth.
[01:25:38.060 --> 01:25:42.380]   - Right, but I think I agree with what you've just said.
[01:25:42.380 --> 01:25:45.260]   And I think your points are very well taken.
[01:25:45.260 --> 01:25:47.860]   The only thing I would want to be sure that,
[01:25:47.860 --> 01:25:49.940]   at least from my point of view,
[01:25:49.940 --> 01:25:53.500]   is that if I'm having access to talk to political leaders,
[01:25:53.500 --> 01:25:56.020]   I do want to talk to them about political things
[01:25:56.020 --> 01:25:57.460]   in the name of Jesus Christ
[01:25:57.460 --> 01:25:59.820]   and in light of God's standards of justice,
[01:25:59.820 --> 01:26:02.460]   which then means talking to them about things
[01:26:02.460 --> 01:26:05.780]   around which there may be political division.
[01:26:05.780 --> 01:26:07.860]   My interest isn't the political division.
[01:26:07.860 --> 01:26:10.380]   It's about trying to bear witness to the justice of God,
[01:26:10.380 --> 01:26:11.740]   which is, I think, what you were just saying.
[01:26:11.740 --> 01:26:14.900]   But I just want to put it that way.
[01:26:14.900 --> 01:26:16.260]   Have we just said the same thing,
[01:26:16.260 --> 01:26:17.580]   or do you think what I'm saying
[01:26:17.580 --> 01:26:19.860]   is different than what you were saying?
[01:26:19.860 --> 01:26:21.140]   - No, it is the same thing.
[01:26:21.140 --> 01:26:23.780]   It just means in public events,
[01:26:23.780 --> 01:26:25.980]   we are not trying to support or pass this
[01:26:25.980 --> 01:26:28.780]   and not try to say, you know, "Roll for Democrat."
[01:26:28.780 --> 01:26:30.780]   But of course they can raise those issues
[01:26:30.780 --> 01:26:33.540]   with individual political leaders.
[01:26:33.540 --> 01:26:34.860]   - Yes, yes, thank you.
[01:26:34.860 --> 01:26:37.300]   - Yeah, thank you.
[01:26:37.300 --> 01:26:40.460]   I want to concur with your trying
[01:26:40.460 --> 01:26:45.460]   to make a distinction between being neutral in politics
[01:26:45.460 --> 01:26:51.340]   versus being neutral with respect to political parties.
[01:26:51.340 --> 01:26:56.540]   I think that distinction is very helpful.
[01:26:56.540 --> 01:26:59.980]   And I think that distinction is helpful
[01:26:59.980 --> 01:27:03.820]   for the churches in Hong Kong too,
[01:27:03.820 --> 01:27:05.860]   because it is very common here
[01:27:05.860 --> 01:27:08.180]   that they want to stick to the,
[01:27:08.820 --> 01:27:13.820]   the principle of the separation between church and state.
[01:27:13.820 --> 01:27:20.100]   And a lot of them understand that to mean
[01:27:20.100 --> 01:27:23.860]   that church therefore should be neutral
[01:27:23.860 --> 01:27:27.580]   with respect to politics.
[01:27:27.580 --> 01:27:31.380]   But I think that goes against our,
[01:27:35.060 --> 01:27:38.540]   the command to love our neighbors,
[01:27:38.540 --> 01:27:42.020]   because politics is what affects our neighbors
[01:27:42.020 --> 01:27:48.100]   the most in a lot of situations.
[01:27:48.100 --> 01:27:51.820]   So thank you for making that clear.
[01:27:51.820 --> 01:27:54.180]   - Yes, thank you very much.
[01:27:54.180 --> 01:27:59.780]   - There is a related question asking about,
[01:27:59.780 --> 01:28:01.620]   you know, there's observation that, you know,
[01:28:01.620 --> 01:28:03.180]   there are lots of minority
[01:28:03.180 --> 01:28:06.060]   or even Chinese American Christians
[01:28:06.060 --> 01:28:10.780]   seems to be joining, you know, the Trump wagon this year.
[01:28:10.780 --> 01:28:14.500]   You know, they are not for, you know, the white racism.
[01:28:14.500 --> 01:28:17.260]   What do you explain, you know,
[01:28:17.260 --> 01:28:21.060]   this people when they're having this post-Trump attitude?
[01:28:21.060 --> 01:28:25.060]   Like how would you, what are their motivation, you think?
[01:28:25.060 --> 01:28:26.460]   - Right.
[01:28:26.460 --> 01:28:28.300]   Well, it comes down, I think,
[01:28:28.300 --> 01:28:30.860]   to the fact that a great deal of the Christian life
[01:28:30.860 --> 01:28:32.700]   is about reordering power
[01:28:32.700 --> 01:28:35.580]   and how we understand power in the world.
[01:28:35.580 --> 01:28:39.580]   And there are many people that are attracted to Trump
[01:28:39.580 --> 01:28:41.620]   because of the way that he demonstrates
[01:28:41.620 --> 01:28:46.620]   a kind of strong man view of governance, right?
[01:28:46.620 --> 01:28:51.300]   That has to do largely with the exercising of force
[01:28:51.300 --> 01:28:56.300]   and the demonstration of decisiveness
[01:28:56.300 --> 01:28:59.300]   and direction and authority.
[01:28:59.300 --> 01:29:03.060]   This is one of the reasons why, for example, in Africa,
[01:29:03.060 --> 01:29:05.860]   there are a lot of African Christians
[01:29:05.860 --> 01:29:09.300]   who are really very, very enthusiastic Trump supporters.
[01:29:09.300 --> 01:29:12.300]   And it's partly because of the fact
[01:29:12.300 --> 01:29:16.260]   that the residue of tribal life in Africa
[01:29:16.260 --> 01:29:20.860]   and its emphasis on the strong man
[01:29:20.860 --> 01:29:23.020]   who's going to lead the tribes
[01:29:23.020 --> 01:29:27.940]   is a person that sometimes speaks and acts like Trump.
[01:29:27.940 --> 01:29:32.580]   This is one of the reasons why I find it very ironic
[01:29:32.580 --> 01:29:36.180]   that it's the church in Uganda this week
[01:29:36.180 --> 01:29:39.460]   that will vote if they follow the past.
[01:29:39.460 --> 01:29:41.260]   It will be Christian people
[01:29:41.260 --> 01:29:46.260]   who will be some of Museveni's strongest supporters.
[01:29:46.260 --> 01:29:47.420]   Why?
[01:29:47.420 --> 01:29:49.540]   Museveni is a strong man.
[01:29:49.540 --> 01:29:51.740]   He's so strong that many, of course,
[01:29:51.740 --> 01:29:53.460]   would call him a dictator.
[01:29:53.460 --> 01:29:55.300]   Who supports that?
[01:29:55.300 --> 01:29:59.300]   Interestingly and thankfully, I would say the church.
[01:29:59.300 --> 01:30:02.300]   So Museveni does not pay attention to people
[01:30:02.300 --> 01:30:05.420]   who are poor and in need.
[01:30:05.420 --> 01:30:09.820]   Women and children are abused by his government.
[01:30:09.820 --> 01:30:14.620]   Whereas the church wants to speak up for Museveni
[01:30:14.620 --> 01:30:16.980]   because he uses Christian language
[01:30:16.980 --> 01:30:20.260]   and because he's seen to be quote strong.
[01:30:20.260 --> 01:30:24.660]   Now, I don't know if that's true for that justification
[01:30:24.660 --> 01:30:27.540]   in the among Asians and Asian Americans,
[01:30:27.540 --> 01:30:32.020]   but I think Trump's language of strength, success,
[01:30:32.020 --> 01:30:35.340]   power, money, influence,
[01:30:35.340 --> 01:30:40.340]   and then tying it to certain hot button issues,
[01:30:40.340 --> 01:30:42.660]   as has already been named,
[01:30:42.660 --> 01:30:47.460]   like abortion or human sexuality or immigration,
[01:30:47.460 --> 01:30:50.620]   that those things are taken all together
[01:30:50.620 --> 01:30:54.300]   as a way of first getting what we want materially
[01:30:54.300 --> 01:30:55.420]   and otherwise,
[01:30:55.420 --> 01:30:58.860]   then getting a leader who's going to defend what we want
[01:30:58.860 --> 01:31:01.420]   and keep the enemy at bay.
[01:31:01.420 --> 01:31:04.860]   And then that's going to protect our values,
[01:31:04.860 --> 01:31:06.980]   namely things like abortion
[01:31:06.980 --> 01:31:11.260]   or a conservative approach to LGBTQ issues.
[01:31:11.260 --> 01:31:13.580]   So I don't know, you'd have to tell me
[01:31:13.580 --> 01:31:16.540]   whether you think that's a reasonable explanation
[01:31:16.540 --> 01:31:21.540]   for the attraction to Trump of some Chinese Americans.
[01:31:21.540 --> 01:31:26.540]   - Well, yeah, I think, you know, strong leader,
[01:31:26.540 --> 01:31:31.740]   that image is certainly part of it.
[01:31:31.740 --> 01:31:33.540]   I think the other part is, you know,
[01:31:33.540 --> 01:31:37.620]   Mark, you mentioned already about social conservative.
[01:31:37.620 --> 01:31:41.380]   Trump represent a more conservative voice
[01:31:41.380 --> 01:31:44.540]   on many social issues, family and so on.
[01:31:44.540 --> 01:31:45.860]   And I have to say, yes,
[01:31:45.860 --> 01:31:49.020]   Trump has done something I agree to,
[01:31:49.020 --> 01:31:53.460]   his emphasis on protecting religious liberty, for example.
[01:31:53.460 --> 01:31:56.300]   That's something that we can identify with.
[01:31:56.300 --> 01:31:59.940]   So, but in general, I think many Chinese
[01:31:59.940 --> 01:32:03.060]   want to preserve a conservative social order,
[01:32:03.060 --> 01:32:05.100]   like respect of the parents and so on.
[01:32:05.100 --> 01:32:06.900]   So those things.
[01:32:06.900 --> 01:32:09.580]   And that may explain some of the Latino support,
[01:32:09.580 --> 01:32:11.820]   you know, that Trump get to.
[01:32:11.820 --> 01:32:15.780]   And so at least in the rhetorics of Trump
[01:32:15.780 --> 01:32:18.780]   and so-called the conservative wing,
[01:32:18.780 --> 01:32:22.700]   the Democrat is, you know, painted as radical.
[01:32:22.700 --> 01:32:26.780]   You know, they want to, how to uproot the whole social order
[01:32:26.780 --> 01:32:28.820]   so that everyone is equal
[01:32:28.820 --> 01:32:31.180]   and there's no more respect to person,
[01:32:31.180 --> 01:32:33.700]   no, and everyone is equal in that sense.
[01:32:33.700 --> 01:32:36.220]   So I think a lot of the fear
[01:32:36.220 --> 01:32:39.260]   of the upsetting of the social order,
[01:32:39.260 --> 01:32:40.940]   I think it's what drive, you know,
[01:32:40.940 --> 01:32:44.820]   some Chinese Christian or other ethnic Christian
[01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:46.580]   to support Trump.
[01:32:46.580 --> 01:32:47.540]   - Yes, yes.
[01:32:47.540 --> 01:32:48.380]   Thank you for that.
[01:32:48.380 --> 01:32:49.580]   I think that's true.
[01:32:49.580 --> 01:32:50.420]   I agree.
[01:32:50.420 --> 01:32:53.260]   - I don't know if,
[01:32:53.260 --> 01:32:56.340]   I don't think I can speak for a lot of people,
[01:32:56.340 --> 01:32:59.260]   but for some of the people I know,
[01:32:59.260 --> 01:33:02.620]   it could be because of Trump's foreign policies,
[01:33:02.620 --> 01:33:08.860]   because of the way that he's so strong
[01:33:08.860 --> 01:33:13.780]   against some governments,
[01:33:13.780 --> 01:33:14.620]   such as
[01:33:18.020 --> 01:33:18.860]   CCP.
[01:33:18.860 --> 01:33:23.020]   I think that could be part of the reasons.
[01:33:23.020 --> 01:33:24.620]   And also in America,
[01:33:24.620 --> 01:33:28.540]   I don't know if I get it right,
[01:33:28.540 --> 01:33:31.380]   but the Christian, the Bible belt
[01:33:31.380 --> 01:33:36.380]   is also where the Rust Belt is, roughly.
[01:33:36.380 --> 01:33:39.300]   And before Trump's era,
[01:33:39.300 --> 01:33:42.020]   a lot of the jobs were lost to countries
[01:33:42.020 --> 01:33:44.260]   like Mexico and China.
[01:33:44.260 --> 01:33:47.260]   So a lot of people have lost their jobs.
[01:33:47.260 --> 01:33:52.260]   So maybe partly why they want to make America great again
[01:33:52.260 --> 01:33:55.380]   is such that jobs could come back to them,
[01:33:55.380 --> 01:34:00.380]   so that such that they can actually have their jobs back.
[01:34:00.380 --> 01:34:02.860]   I think that could be partly why.
[01:34:02.860 --> 01:34:05.540]   - I agree with that as well.
[01:34:05.540 --> 01:34:06.900]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:34:06.900 --> 01:34:10.220]   But often what that, all of that,
[01:34:10.220 --> 01:34:11.420]   both of your answers, I think,
[01:34:11.420 --> 01:34:14.260]   are ones I certainly would accept.
[01:34:14.260 --> 01:34:19.260]   I think often what's less visible inside those answers
[01:34:19.260 --> 01:34:24.500]   is really an interest, finally, of simply self-protection.
[01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:27.580]   And there's something about the gospel, Christology itself,
[01:34:27.580 --> 01:34:29.860]   this is why I chose that word,
[01:34:29.860 --> 01:34:32.260]   that is about vulnerability
[01:34:32.260 --> 01:34:35.220]   and about becoming interested in the other,
[01:34:35.220 --> 01:34:39.540]   not just in what we have a prerogative to grasp.
[01:34:39.540 --> 01:34:43.460]   So I'm not saying anything that that leads to a direct plan
[01:34:43.460 --> 01:34:47.700]   for economics or for job security or those kinds of things.
[01:34:47.700 --> 01:34:50.620]   But I think it's based on an assumption,
[01:34:50.620 --> 01:34:52.020]   a cultural assumption, I would say,
[01:34:52.020 --> 01:34:53.700]   not a gospel assumption,
[01:34:53.700 --> 01:34:57.100]   that self-interest should come first
[01:34:57.100 --> 01:35:00.780]   or often legitimately can come first.
[01:35:00.780 --> 01:35:02.380]   And I think from a Christian point of view,
[01:35:02.380 --> 01:35:04.700]   that has to be at least wrestled with.
[01:35:04.700 --> 01:35:08.620]   And if I saw those that were surrounding Trump
[01:35:08.620 --> 01:35:11.620]   critiquing that, even while they're also affirming it,
[01:35:11.620 --> 01:35:13.260]   in other words, setting it boundaries
[01:35:13.260 --> 01:35:17.060]   as well as giving it its own head,
[01:35:17.060 --> 01:35:20.220]   then I think I would feel differently about those arguments,
[01:35:20.220 --> 01:35:21.780]   which I think do have a place
[01:35:21.780 --> 01:35:24.460]   in things that we should carefully consider.
[01:35:24.460 --> 01:35:27.940]   - Thank you.
[01:35:27.940 --> 01:35:30.060]   So for our next question,
[01:35:30.060 --> 01:35:34.300]   if the current trend among the white evangelicals continue,
[01:35:34.300 --> 01:35:39.020]   what, in your opinion, would become of evangelicalism?
[01:35:39.020 --> 01:35:41.060]   Another related question,
[01:35:41.060 --> 01:35:43.140]   do you think now is a turning point
[01:35:43.140 --> 01:35:46.620]   for the white evangelical churches to reflect their value,
[01:35:46.620 --> 01:35:49.300]   or you would think that they would move on
[01:35:49.300 --> 01:35:50.860]   to the extreme ends?
[01:35:50.860 --> 01:35:54.500]   - Well, based on where we are right now,
[01:35:54.500 --> 01:35:58.140]   I have to say that I'm more skeptical than optimistic.
[01:35:58.140 --> 01:36:01.340]   I'm not saying that with any pleasure
[01:36:01.340 --> 01:36:03.700]   or with any feeling that I'm even being dramatic.
[01:36:03.700 --> 01:36:06.940]   I just think it's descriptive of where we are right now.
[01:36:07.940 --> 01:36:12.140]   Despite all that's going on, even right now,
[01:36:12.140 --> 01:36:15.820]   there are people who are still defending in every way
[01:36:15.820 --> 01:36:19.220]   the legitimacy of the complaints against the election
[01:36:19.220 --> 01:36:23.740]   and of the violence that was used and all of that, right?
[01:36:23.740 --> 01:36:26.860]   So there's not a pervasive sense I have
[01:36:26.860 --> 01:36:30.380]   of deep reflection about this.
[01:36:30.380 --> 01:36:34.940]   It's much more intuitive and reactionary
[01:36:34.940 --> 01:36:39.060]   rather than self-critical and repentant.
[01:36:39.060 --> 01:36:42.500]   And I think people are showing their true colors,
[01:36:42.500 --> 01:36:45.420]   that they're more aligned to this agenda
[01:36:45.420 --> 01:36:48.260]   rather than humbling themselves before God
[01:36:48.260 --> 01:36:52.540]   and asking for God to give us new eyes and a new heart
[01:36:52.540 --> 01:36:56.060]   and a new mind to perceive ourselves and our neighbor
[01:36:56.060 --> 01:37:00.140]   and our nation and the world around us in a different way.
[01:37:00.140 --> 01:37:04.260]   I certainly think that there are some institutions,
[01:37:04.260 --> 01:37:08.620]   for example, even today, there are maybe four,
[01:37:08.620 --> 01:37:11.220]   three or four institutions that I'm aware of
[01:37:11.220 --> 01:37:14.540]   that have put out some really very strong
[01:37:14.540 --> 01:37:18.740]   and repentant statements of their own sense of complicity
[01:37:18.740 --> 01:37:20.060]   in this narrative.
[01:37:20.060 --> 01:37:24.140]   And in the letter that I put out last week,
[01:37:24.140 --> 01:37:28.340]   I was trying to say, we have to call ourselves into account,
[01:37:28.340 --> 01:37:31.140]   though Fuller would not wanna see itself
[01:37:31.140 --> 01:37:34.020]   as part of this narrative that I'm describing.
[01:37:34.020 --> 01:37:37.620]   There's no way that we are not in some way entangled in it
[01:37:37.620 --> 01:37:39.940]   and guilty of some of the same things,
[01:37:39.940 --> 01:37:44.060]   even though we may occupy a different social location
[01:37:44.060 --> 01:37:46.740]   and have a different social critique,
[01:37:46.740 --> 01:37:51.340]   we can still be caught up in the same problematic issues.
[01:37:51.340 --> 01:37:54.380]   So let's admit that of ourselves.
[01:37:54.380 --> 01:37:56.700]   I think what I'm being invited into
[01:37:56.700 --> 01:37:59.300]   and what I'm inviting others into here
[01:37:59.300 --> 01:38:02.140]   is into a sustained conversation
[01:38:02.140 --> 01:38:06.140]   with different people from different racial,
[01:38:06.140 --> 01:38:10.180]   theological and denominational contexts
[01:38:10.180 --> 01:38:14.420]   to have some sustained conversations about the crisis itself
[01:38:14.420 --> 01:38:18.420]   because to some degree, we have to feel our way
[01:38:18.420 --> 01:38:23.420]   toward as much of a fresh narrative that we can all share in
[01:38:23.420 --> 01:38:29.020]   in order to be able to then share in acting together
[01:38:29.020 --> 01:38:32.780]   in a way that could be really more publicly productive.
[01:38:32.780 --> 01:38:36.780]   Right now, there are just endless stories.
[01:38:36.780 --> 01:38:42.700]   I wonder if all of you are aware of a quite wonderful video.
[01:38:42.700 --> 01:38:45.100]   I don't know if it's been translated into Chinese,
[01:38:45.100 --> 01:38:50.100]   but it's one of the TED Talks given by a Nigerian woman
[01:38:50.100 --> 01:38:56.580]   named Adichie is her last name, Chimamanda Adichie.
[01:38:56.580 --> 01:39:00.140]   And it's called "The Danger of the Single Story."
[01:39:00.140 --> 01:39:02.660]   "The Danger of the Single Story."
[01:39:02.660 --> 01:39:07.660]   And she basically offers us a kind of social anthropology
[01:39:07.660 --> 01:39:12.740]   of why there is almost never one story.
[01:39:12.740 --> 01:39:14.980]   So what I'm not trying to argue for is
[01:39:14.980 --> 01:39:17.420]   we all need to come together and tell the same story.
[01:39:17.420 --> 01:39:21.260]   That's not a good idea, even as a goal,
[01:39:21.260 --> 01:39:23.940]   let alone as a possibility.
[01:39:23.940 --> 01:39:28.940]   So, but what I am saying is a shared narrative,
[01:39:28.940 --> 01:39:31.980]   even in our differences in our narratives,
[01:39:31.980 --> 01:39:34.420]   that could bring us close enough together
[01:39:34.420 --> 01:39:38.020]   that we could then begin to conceive the church in America
[01:39:38.020 --> 01:39:39.700]   in a different way.
[01:39:39.700 --> 01:39:41.660]   And we've not been very good at this.
[01:39:41.660 --> 01:39:44.260]   We're inventive around secular values.
[01:39:44.260 --> 01:39:47.340]   We're not very inventive around gospel values.
[01:39:47.340 --> 01:39:49.020]   How do we become more Christ-like
[01:39:49.020 --> 01:39:51.700]   is not the dominant question in the American church.
[01:39:51.700 --> 01:39:55.020]   And that's partly what I've been trying to say this evening,
[01:39:55.020 --> 01:39:56.940]   or tomorrow morning, rather,
[01:39:56.940 --> 01:40:01.940]   is that we are called to become conformed to Jesus Christ
[01:40:01.940 --> 01:40:06.820]   individually and communally.
[01:40:06.820 --> 01:40:09.900]   But that's not our goal,
[01:40:09.900 --> 01:40:13.660]   not predominantly within the white evangelical movement.
[01:40:13.660 --> 01:40:18.660]   It's how do we retain being white and dominant and male
[01:40:19.060 --> 01:40:22.620]   and successful and powerful and influential?
[01:40:22.620 --> 01:40:24.940]   Those are the questions that have driven so much
[01:40:24.940 --> 01:40:26.420]   of the American church,
[01:40:26.420 --> 01:40:29.980]   not how do we become conformed to Jesus Christ?
[01:40:29.980 --> 01:40:32.180]   How do we lay down our power?
[01:40:32.180 --> 01:40:35.340]   How do we surrender in the name of Jesus
[01:40:35.340 --> 01:40:39.220]   to our friends, our neighbors, our family,
[01:40:39.220 --> 01:40:43.300]   and including our enemies in ways that represent
[01:40:43.300 --> 01:40:46.620]   the unexpected love and sacrifice of Jesus?
[01:40:46.620 --> 01:40:49.380]   Those are surely the qualities that are meant to be part
[01:40:49.380 --> 01:40:51.780]   of what the body of Christ throughout history,
[01:40:51.780 --> 01:40:53.100]   when it's been at its best,
[01:40:53.100 --> 01:40:54.980]   that's what the church has been called to.
[01:40:54.980 --> 01:40:57.820]   That's what we are called to in this moment.
[01:40:57.820 --> 01:41:01.380]   And I've been trying to highlight the way that the church,
[01:41:01.380 --> 01:41:04.140]   the evangelical white church in America,
[01:41:04.140 --> 01:41:06.860]   loves using that language.
[01:41:06.860 --> 01:41:09.900]   And it preaches it, it writes about it, it teaches it,
[01:41:09.900 --> 01:41:12.620]   but it does it within the confines
[01:41:12.620 --> 01:41:15.300]   of a social structure that is so much more
[01:41:15.300 --> 01:41:18.580]   than the confines of a social structure,
[01:41:18.580 --> 01:41:20.900]   which actually makes becoming Christ-like,
[01:41:20.900 --> 01:41:24.300]   by definition, actually not the goal.
[01:41:24.300 --> 01:41:26.700]   It's actually to be white, male, American,
[01:41:26.700 --> 01:41:30.060]   dominant, successful, powerful, et cetera.
[01:41:30.060 --> 01:41:32.260]   That's, it's our destruction.
[01:41:32.260 --> 01:41:35.220]   So when I think about will evangelicals
[01:41:35.220 --> 01:41:36.980]   be different parties, you know,
[01:41:36.980 --> 01:41:41.980]   different political point of views and ethnic groups?
[01:41:41.980 --> 01:41:44.380]   - Right, right.
[01:41:44.380 --> 01:41:46.260]   - And I remember when I was a pastor,
[01:41:46.260 --> 01:41:48.660]   there was a period of time in the congregation
[01:41:48.660 --> 01:41:51.100]   that I was serving in Berkeley, California,
[01:41:51.100 --> 01:41:54.420]   that we were working on some of these issues,
[01:41:54.420 --> 01:41:57.660]   and we developed a simple liturgy
[01:41:57.660 --> 01:42:00.060]   that we used for several months
[01:42:00.060 --> 01:42:02.340]   as a way of trying to just keep remembering
[01:42:02.340 --> 01:42:03.820]   these first order things.
[01:42:03.820 --> 01:42:06.300]   So it went something like this.
[01:42:06.300 --> 01:42:07.420]   I would get up and I,
[01:42:07.420 --> 01:42:10.180]   (audio cuts out)
[01:42:12.060 --> 01:42:13.540]   I'm not God.
[01:42:13.540 --> 01:42:16.660]   And I would say to them, you are not God.
[01:42:16.660 --> 01:42:19.620]   And they would say, we are not God.
[01:42:19.620 --> 01:42:23.180]   And then we would name a number of other categories
[01:42:23.180 --> 01:42:26.620]   where we wanted to remember at the start of our worship
[01:42:26.620 --> 01:42:29.700]   that these are not the things that we're here to worship,
[01:42:29.700 --> 01:42:31.300]   that we have to lay these things down.
[01:42:31.300 --> 01:42:33.540]   So it was a repentance, yes,
[01:42:33.540 --> 01:42:38.540]   but it was also a denial, a rejection, yes.
[01:42:38.580 --> 01:42:43.300]   It was a seeking after what is the right ordering of power,
[01:42:43.300 --> 01:42:45.140]   where everyone is called into account,
[01:42:45.140 --> 01:42:48.460]   not just the left or the right or anyone else,
[01:42:48.460 --> 01:42:50.940]   and then trying to figure out how do we live together
[01:42:50.940 --> 01:42:54.980]   in the newly ordered power of the kingdom of God.
[01:42:54.980 --> 01:42:58.940]   - Thank you.
[01:42:58.940 --> 01:43:01.020]   - I want to repeat actually something
[01:43:01.020 --> 01:43:03.220]   I've said already in my response.
[01:43:03.220 --> 01:43:06.780]   I think being a Christian is the adventure.
[01:43:06.780 --> 01:43:11.060]   We are open to what God is doing today.
[01:43:11.060 --> 01:43:15.180]   I think we evangelicals tend to be conservative
[01:43:15.180 --> 01:43:19.340]   in the sense we don't want to go into anything controversial
[01:43:19.340 --> 01:43:21.540]   unless somehow we are persuaded
[01:43:21.540 --> 01:43:24.220]   we have the absolute correct answer.
[01:43:24.220 --> 01:43:27.780]   Like for example, whatever, in some sexual issue,
[01:43:27.780 --> 01:43:29.540]   we think we have the right answer.
[01:43:29.540 --> 01:43:33.060]   So we just keep repeating that right answer.
[01:43:33.060 --> 01:43:36.300]   But I think the church need to be open to things
[01:43:36.300 --> 01:43:38.940]   that we don't have a final answer.
[01:43:38.940 --> 01:43:41.860]   I mean, we may have, for example,
[01:43:41.860 --> 01:43:45.860]   abortion is not pleasing to God in some way,
[01:43:45.860 --> 01:43:49.220]   but does it mean making abortion illegal
[01:43:49.220 --> 01:43:51.140]   in our situation is a good thing?
[01:43:51.140 --> 01:43:54.540]   I mean, there are a big step between the two.
[01:43:54.540 --> 01:43:59.380]   Abortion is morally okay versus banning of abortion.
[01:43:59.380 --> 01:44:01.660]   But I think a lot of times we Christian are afraid
[01:44:01.660 --> 01:44:05.180]   to discuss about things we are not sure.
[01:44:05.180 --> 01:44:08.940]   We listen to one another and see how we can find a path
[01:44:08.940 --> 01:44:10.900]   that everybody can walk in.
[01:44:10.900 --> 01:44:13.580]   I think that's something the evangelical church
[01:44:13.580 --> 01:44:18.580]   need to take the courage to walk in this road.
[01:44:18.580 --> 01:44:21.020]   And secondly, just the question about
[01:44:21.020 --> 01:44:22.980]   what would happen to white evangelical
[01:44:22.980 --> 01:44:26.300]   if it continues the way it is now.
[01:44:26.300 --> 01:44:28.740]   And I think, well, it will just decline.
[01:44:28.740 --> 01:44:32.460]   I think the democracy of the United States,
[01:44:32.460 --> 01:44:35.460]   it's just, they will have declining influence
[01:44:35.460 --> 01:44:37.220]   and something new will come up.
[01:44:37.220 --> 01:44:40.220]   Like Mark has said, the evangel will never die.
[01:44:40.220 --> 01:44:42.540]   So the church will just have a new face.
[01:44:42.540 --> 01:44:43.660]   What will the new face be?
[01:44:43.660 --> 01:44:47.020]   We don't know, but I know the church will survive.
[01:44:47.020 --> 01:44:47.860]   - Right.
[01:44:47.860 --> 01:44:51.540]   Well, and I do think, I agree with all of
[01:44:51.540 --> 01:44:52.700]   what you've just said.
[01:44:52.700 --> 01:44:55.660]   And I think that one of the really quite exciting things
[01:44:55.660 --> 01:44:58.620]   is that some of the most wonderful demonstrations
[01:44:58.620 --> 01:45:00.700]   of the gospel that I'm seeing in the United States
[01:45:00.700 --> 01:45:04.380]   are coming from multi-ethnic, multi-racial communities
[01:45:04.380 --> 01:45:09.300]   that are literally creating a new kind of church
[01:45:09.300 --> 01:45:12.020]   for the 21st century that does not look like
[01:45:12.020 --> 01:45:13.500]   and is not structured like,
[01:45:13.500 --> 01:45:17.220]   it does not defer to authority in the same way
[01:45:17.220 --> 01:45:19.780]   as typical churches have done in the past.
[01:45:19.780 --> 01:45:21.260]   So that's an example of something new
[01:45:21.260 --> 01:45:24.060]   that's coming out of the brokenness.
[01:45:24.060 --> 01:45:27.180]   And I like the word adventure very much.
[01:45:28.140 --> 01:45:32.460]   Another word that I think fits alongside adventure
[01:45:32.460 --> 01:45:34.940]   is that God is a God of surprise.
[01:45:34.940 --> 01:45:37.820]   And he does things that we would never be able to
[01:45:37.820 --> 01:45:40.260]   have anticipated if we're open to that.
[01:45:40.260 --> 01:45:42.900]   And that often does then call in question,
[01:45:42.900 --> 01:45:46.980]   not endlessly and not at every point,
[01:45:46.980 --> 01:45:49.820]   but it calls in question tradition and structures
[01:45:49.820 --> 01:45:53.740]   and formalities that we might've become overly used to.
[01:45:56.500 --> 01:46:00.140]   - So the next question probably for Dr. Yun.
[01:46:00.140 --> 01:46:03.340]   So an audience comment on Dr. Yun,
[01:46:03.340 --> 01:46:06.540]   you make a good observation that conservative,
[01:46:06.540 --> 01:46:09.780]   quote unquote, churches welcome ethnic minority.
[01:46:09.780 --> 01:46:13.220]   I too have similar experience being a Chinese seminary
[01:46:13.220 --> 01:46:14.820]   student in America.
[01:46:14.820 --> 01:46:18.260]   What set churches apart from other white evangelical
[01:46:18.260 --> 01:46:21.020]   churches in your experience?
[01:46:25.060 --> 01:46:29.700]   - Actually what I meant was that in my experience,
[01:46:29.700 --> 01:46:34.020]   at least maybe I could not speak for a lot of people,
[01:46:34.020 --> 01:46:37.620]   but in my own experience at Princeton,
[01:46:37.620 --> 01:46:42.620]   it's really often is the case that it is white
[01:46:42.620 --> 01:46:51.020]   evangelicals who are friendly to international students.
[01:46:53.820 --> 01:46:55.780]   It's not something that I could explain,
[01:46:55.780 --> 01:46:57.980]   but that's actually the case.
[01:46:57.980 --> 01:47:00.580]   And a lot of them I have to say.
[01:47:00.580 --> 01:47:02.660]   So that's why in my response,
[01:47:02.660 --> 01:47:05.980]   I wanted to say that I want to give them at least some.
[01:47:05.980 --> 01:47:08.300]   - Yes.
[01:47:08.300 --> 01:47:09.140]   - Some credit.
[01:47:09.140 --> 01:47:11.420]   - I agree.
[01:47:11.420 --> 01:47:12.260]   Thank you for that.
[01:47:12.260 --> 01:47:16.660]   - I feel that again, it's my own experience.
[01:47:16.660 --> 01:47:21.580]   A lot of the liberals in Princeton,
[01:47:21.580 --> 01:47:26.580]   I think they are very conscious that they have to be
[01:47:26.580 --> 01:47:35.180]   in the right place along the political spectrum.
[01:47:35.180 --> 01:47:42.220]   A lot of them, I feel that they like to point their finger
[01:47:42.220 --> 01:47:44.900]   to the people on the other side,
[01:47:44.900 --> 01:47:46.940]   but they don't really,
[01:47:47.940 --> 01:47:50.340]   (stuttering)
[01:47:50.340 --> 01:47:57.140]   reflect on how they actually treat the people
[01:47:57.140 --> 01:48:00.820]   they claim to love.
[01:48:00.820 --> 01:48:03.020]   That's actually my experience.
[01:48:03.020 --> 01:48:07.820]   So I think both sides have their own blind spots.
[01:48:07.820 --> 01:48:08.660]   - Yes.
[01:48:08.660 --> 01:48:12.140]   - Something.
[01:48:12.140 --> 01:48:15.380]   Anyway, so I think that we've been critical
[01:48:15.380 --> 01:48:19.740]   of the evangelicalism, quite critical in this lectures,
[01:48:19.740 --> 01:48:22.540]   but there's something good about evangelical tradition.
[01:48:22.540 --> 01:48:25.620]   For example, the concern to spread the gospel.
[01:48:25.620 --> 01:48:28.860]   I think that's one motive, a strong motive
[01:48:28.860 --> 01:48:32.380]   to let the evangelical church to try to invite people
[01:48:32.380 --> 01:48:34.020]   from different backgrounds.
[01:48:34.020 --> 01:48:37.300]   It's not the lack of motivation to invite people.
[01:48:37.300 --> 01:48:40.500]   It's what happened when you do get people into your church.
[01:48:40.500 --> 01:48:42.500]   Can you make those people comfortable?
[01:48:42.500 --> 01:48:44.580]   I mean, that's another issue.
[01:48:44.580 --> 01:48:46.660]   And we talk about the liberal church.
[01:48:46.660 --> 01:48:49.380]   Actually, in my experience, the liberal church
[01:48:49.380 --> 01:48:51.300]   in some way is not that liberal at all.
[01:48:51.300 --> 01:48:53.420]   I mean, I studied in, as I said,
[01:48:53.420 --> 01:48:55.660]   I took courses in Union Seminary.
[01:48:55.660 --> 01:48:57.780]   I think Union Seminary in some ways
[01:48:57.780 --> 01:49:00.380]   as narrow-minded as Westminster Seminary.
[01:49:00.380 --> 01:49:02.900]   It's just narrow-minded in their different ways.
[01:49:02.900 --> 01:49:06.540]   So, I mean, the evangelical church
[01:49:06.540 --> 01:49:10.900]   does not has a monopoly on being narrow-minded.
[01:49:12.340 --> 01:49:14.740]   And thirdly, you know, I actually,
[01:49:14.740 --> 01:49:18.140]   I was a pastor in a church in New York City.
[01:49:18.140 --> 01:49:22.420]   And my church in New York City is a multi-ethnic church.
[01:49:22.420 --> 01:49:25.180]   We have a Hispanic congregation, an English congregation,
[01:49:25.180 --> 01:49:27.100]   and a Chinese congregation.
[01:49:27.100 --> 01:49:28.940]   I preach in the Chinese congregation.
[01:49:28.940 --> 01:49:30.620]   I preach in the English congregation too.
[01:49:30.620 --> 01:49:32.860]   I don't know Spanish, so can't preach there.
[01:49:32.860 --> 01:49:36.220]   Anyway, so for a while, the church,
[01:49:36.220 --> 01:49:39.140]   the church was my church, First Baptist Church of Flushing,
[01:49:39.140 --> 01:49:43.260]   was founded in the 19th century, I think.
[01:49:43.260 --> 01:49:47.820]   But anyway, for a while, we actually have a Chinese person
[01:49:47.820 --> 01:49:52.140]   as the senior pastor of this multi-ethnic church.
[01:49:52.140 --> 01:49:54.740]   Now it's a white American again,
[01:49:54.740 --> 01:49:56.940]   but there was a while when, there was a time
[01:49:56.940 --> 01:49:59.780]   when there was a Chinese pastor who was the senior pastor.
[01:49:59.780 --> 01:50:03.540]   So there are evangelical church who try to, you know,
[01:50:03.540 --> 01:50:07.700]   be, try to be multicultural, like American societies.
[01:50:07.700 --> 01:50:11.260]   So I don't want, so I want people to know
[01:50:11.260 --> 01:50:16.060]   that the evangelical church in America is also diverse.
[01:50:16.060 --> 01:50:20.220]   White evangelicalism is just part of the evangelical church.
[01:50:20.220 --> 01:50:22.940]   It's not the whole of the evangelical church.
[01:50:22.940 --> 01:50:29.420]   - I'm just mindful of our time.
[01:50:29.420 --> 01:50:34.420]   And thank you, Mark, for your inspiring sharing
[01:50:34.420 --> 01:50:36.340]   and lecture today.
[01:50:36.340 --> 01:50:39.700]   Do you have a few words that you would like to say to us
[01:50:39.700 --> 01:50:42.100]   before we finish our lecture today?
[01:50:42.100 --> 01:50:45.380]   - Just that I appreciate very much, of course,
[01:50:45.380 --> 01:50:47.780]   the good word for American evangelicalism,
[01:50:47.780 --> 01:50:51.780]   because there's many, many good words to say about it.
[01:50:51.780 --> 01:50:55.380]   And if I wasn't speaking under the title,
[01:50:55.380 --> 01:50:58.620]   the crisis of American white evangelicalism,
[01:50:58.620 --> 01:51:01.220]   I would have a very great deal to say
[01:51:01.220 --> 01:51:04.100]   about what is healthy and positive.
[01:51:04.100 --> 01:51:07.900]   But the assignment that I've been working on has been,
[01:51:07.900 --> 01:51:09.540]   how do we describe the crisis?
[01:51:09.540 --> 01:51:12.500]   And while it is certainly the case
[01:51:12.500 --> 01:51:16.300]   that there are many manifestations of evangelicalism
[01:51:16.300 --> 01:51:19.740]   that are not marked by this culture of whiteness
[01:51:19.740 --> 01:51:24.220]   and maleness that are thriving,
[01:51:24.220 --> 01:51:25.740]   not only in the United States,
[01:51:25.740 --> 01:51:29.420]   but obviously in places around the world.
[01:51:29.420 --> 01:51:30.660]   And I'm very grateful for that.
[01:51:30.660 --> 01:51:33.540]   There is still a dominant presence
[01:51:33.540 --> 01:51:35.660]   of white American evangelicalism
[01:51:35.660 --> 01:51:36.980]   that I think is the problem
[01:51:36.980 --> 01:51:40.420]   that I'm trying to work out this week.
[01:51:40.420 --> 01:51:43.140]   But I'm grateful for anyone who wants to speak
[01:51:43.140 --> 01:51:45.900]   about the positiveness of what's happening
[01:51:45.900 --> 01:51:48.300]   as an antidote to my critique.
[01:51:48.300 --> 01:51:50.820]   I would just also say that one resource
[01:51:50.820 --> 01:51:54.020]   that I would like to point you to is a book
[01:51:54.020 --> 01:51:56.860]   that was first a set of lectures
[01:51:57.820 --> 01:52:01.180]   that were given at Fuller by a number of people.
[01:52:01.180 --> 01:52:04.580]   But the title of the book is "Can White,"
[01:52:04.580 --> 01:52:09.580]   and that's in quotes, "Can White People Be Saved?"
[01:52:09.580 --> 01:52:14.180]   And it's a book in which the leading lecture
[01:52:14.180 --> 01:52:16.340]   and the title came from his lecture,
[01:52:16.340 --> 01:52:20.100]   was given by Dr. Willie Jennings at Yale,
[01:52:20.100 --> 01:52:22.220]   who is actually a Fuller alum,
[01:52:22.220 --> 01:52:26.420]   and who gave a lecture, which you can find online
[01:52:26.420 --> 01:52:29.980]   under that title, "Can White People Be Saved?"
[01:52:29.980 --> 01:52:31.460]   And it's Willie Jennings,
[01:52:31.460 --> 01:52:33.860]   and then it's me giving a response
[01:52:33.860 --> 01:52:36.700]   to Willie Jennings' lecture.
[01:52:36.700 --> 01:52:39.660]   And in that lecture, he's defining whiteness,
[01:52:39.660 --> 01:52:42.820]   not about melatonin color, as it were,
[01:52:42.820 --> 01:52:44.380]   the color of our skin,
[01:52:44.380 --> 01:52:48.940]   but about a social framework called whiteness,
[01:52:48.940 --> 01:52:51.420]   which is what I've been primarily talking about.
[01:52:51.420 --> 01:52:56.420]   And so if people are wanting a specific resource
[01:52:56.420 --> 01:52:59.420]   to follow up on, that would be one, two.
[01:52:59.420 --> 01:53:01.380]   You can easily find online the lecture,
[01:53:01.380 --> 01:53:02.900]   the video of the lecture,
[01:53:02.900 --> 01:53:06.980]   and my response to the book, you can find online as well.
[01:53:06.980 --> 01:53:09.820]   Thank you again for tonight and for your attentiveness,
[01:53:09.820 --> 01:53:11.860]   and I look forward to two more sessions together.
[01:53:11.860 --> 01:53:12.820]   Thank you.
[01:53:12.820 --> 01:53:14.260]   - Thank you, Mark.
[01:53:14.260 --> 01:53:15.900]   Do you have any, this one?
[01:53:15.900 --> 01:53:16.740]   Okay.
[01:53:16.740 --> 01:53:19.340]   Thank you, Mark, for your inspiring lecture.
[01:53:19.340 --> 01:53:21.620]   And so that is for us today,
[01:53:21.620 --> 01:53:23.940]   and I'm looking forward to see you tomorrow
[01:53:23.940 --> 01:53:26.260]   and two more days of lecture.
[01:53:26.260 --> 01:53:27.100]   Bye-bye.

[01:53:32.500 --> 01:53:35.100]   (gentle music)
[01:53:35.100 --> 01:53:37.700]   (gentle music)
