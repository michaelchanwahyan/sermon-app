00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,400
(音樂)

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:17,440
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,

3
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,800
fellow sisters and brothers in Christ.

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,320
Welcome back to the fourth and final lecture

5
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:28,600
of this year's Josephine So Culture and Ethics lectures.

6
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,280
In this session, our distinguished speaker,

7
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,600
Reverend Dr. Christopher Wright,

8
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,720
Langham's Global Ambassador and Ministry Director,

9
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,120
will continue to speak to us

10
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,400
on the relevance of the Old Testament to our Christian faith.

11
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,200
In the previous three lectures,

12
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,240
he finally elucidated for us

13
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,920
how the Old Testament may bear on our understanding

14
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,080
of our Christian identity, missions and ethics.

15
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,800
Tonight, he'll stretch our horizon a bit forward

16
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,800
and cast a look into the future.

17
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,600
Tonight's topic is

18
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,280
The Old Testament and Christian Hope,

19
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,720
Where Will It All End?

20
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:18,040
Over the dinner, I confessed to Dr. Wright that

21
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,200
the Chinese translations are written by me.

22
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,880
So all the distortions and mistakes were on me.

23
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,040
Accompanying our speaker on stage tonight

24
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,000
is our Emeritus President, Dr. Stephen Lee.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,480
Dr. Lee shares the same enthusiasm as our speaker

26
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,160
in helping Christians to reckon the Old Testament

27
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,800
as an indismissible part of their faith.

28
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,600
Some 20-odd years ago,

29
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,800
I listened to one of his talks on the cassette tape.

30
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,840
Do you know cassette tapes ever existed on this earth?

31
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,240
No, okay.

32
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,200
And the title of his talk is

33
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,640
A Bible with Only the Upper but No Ground Floor

34
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,520
只有樓上沒有樓下的聖經

35
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,120
in which he explained that

36
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,040
our Christian faith is grounded

37
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,360
in both the Old and the New Testament.

38
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,600
As for tonight,

39
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,080
Dr. Wright and Dr. Lee

40
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,040
will have a dialogue on this interesting topic

41
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,600
Old Testament and Christian Hope.

42
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:35,080
Dr. Wright will give his first lecture

43
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,520
will give the lecture first

44
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,360
a 25-minute speech

45
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,040
followed by Dr. Lee's response

46
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,880
of about the same length.

47
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,360
Then, they will further exchange their views

48
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,960
for another half an hour.

49
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,640
And then the discussion

50
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,520
will be open to the floor.

51
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,360
So for the time being,

52
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,320
you may ask our ushers

53
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,720
for a piece of paper or a piece of note

54
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,040
to write down your questions or thoughts.

55
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,040
And without further ado,

56
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,680
let's welcome Dr. Wright.

57
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:17,280
Thank you so much, Simon, Dr. Chung.

58
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,120
And welcome again.

59
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,240
And if you have been with me

60
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,640
all through these four, well done.

61
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,160
It's a kind of a marathon for all of us,

62
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,360
but it's good to see you again.

63
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,480
Let me just get to my right page on the notes.

64
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,000
There we are.

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,440
So yes, our title this time is

66
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,440
Where Will It All End?

67
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,520
We've seen, haven't we,

68
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,320
in these previous three lectures

69
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,160
how the Old Testament shapes

70
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,080
the identity and the mission

71
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,880
and the ethic of God's people.

72
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,520
Those of us who are in Christ,

73
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,280
as Paul says in Galatians,

74
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,800
are in Abraham.

75
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,160
We are part of that people

76
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,280
believing Jews and Gentiles.

77
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,440
And we are shaped together

78
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,400
by the scriptures as a whole,

79
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,160
the scriptures of our Lord Jesus Christ,

80
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,200
of course, what we now call the Old Testament.

81
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,040
So the Old Testament then,

82
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,520
topped by the New,

83
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,160
tells us who we are,

84
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,680
why we are here,

85
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,600
and how we are to live.

86
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,120
That's what we've been thinking about

87
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,280
over the three lectures.

88
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,120
But what's the point?

89
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,120
Where is it all going to end?

90
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,040
Where does this story go?

91
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,720
All human religions and philosophies

92
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,960
and ideologies

93
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,840
express some elements of narrative or story

94
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,280
to explain how things are

95
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,440
and how they got to be the way they are

96
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,360
and how we could make them better

97
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,280
if we want to.

98
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,720
And the Bible as a canonical whole,

99
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,640
the whole scripture that we have,

100
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,480
is also in that sense a narrative,

101
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,440
indeed, a metanarrative.

102
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,440
It tells the big story

103
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,800
that runs from creation,

104
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,600
right through to new creation,

105
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,520
from Genesis to Revelation.

106
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,640
But it's not just a story.

107
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,080
It claims to be the story,

108
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,760
the true story of the whole universe.

109
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,720
Now,in other places

110
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,000
and in some of my books,

111
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,280
I've tried to pick up an idea

112
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,480
that I first got from,

113
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,520
well,originally from Tom Wright

114
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,000
and then from Michael Goheen

115
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,080
and Craig Bartholomew,

116
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,800
who talk about the Bible

117
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,760
as rather like a great drama,

118
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,840
that is a great cosmic play

119
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,520
that has taken several acts,

120
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,520
you know how dramas

121
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,600
have different acts,

122
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,680
in which God is the author

123
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,760
and, of course, the chief character,

124
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,960
but there's a cast of thousands as well.

125
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,400
And one way in which

126
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,080
I've tried to portray this

127
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,600
is in a kind of diagram

128
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,600
which I put into

129
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,720
one of my other books

130
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,720
called The Great Story

131
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,120
and the Great Commission,

132
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,000
which is published by Baker,

133
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,960
like this, with sort of symbols

134
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,560
that express the different acts

135
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,280
of the Bible.

136
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,280
So here it is

137
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,640
as a drama in seven acts.

138
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,600
I'll try to go through this

139
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,160
fairly quickly, watching my time,

140
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,280
because I'm very aware

141
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,960
that there are two of us this evening.

142
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,000
Act one of the Bible story,

143
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,760
of course, is the creation.

144
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,640
In the beginning,

145
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,400
God created the heavens and the earth.

146
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,320
And I've put this as a triangle

147
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,240
because there is God.

148
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,120
He created the earth

149
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,360
and he put human beings in it.

150
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,520
Act one, all a good start.

151
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,720
But then, of course,

152
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,080
we know that everything went wrong

153
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,720
because we chose

154
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,560
to rebel against our Creator,

155
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,160
to distrust his goodness,

156
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,280
to disobey his instructions.

157
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,160
And so that symbol expresses

158
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,240
the sense of rebellion.

159
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,920
Act two of the story

160
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,560
is where all the problems begin.

161
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,960
And then act three is basically

162
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,400
the rest of the Old Testament.

163
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,960
It's a very long act

164
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,760
and there's an awful lot in it.

165
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,080
And it's not just a story.

166
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,920
Of course, it's full of other things

167
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,240
like poetry and psalms

168
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,280
and wisdom and everything else.

169
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,880
But the arrow pointing forward

170
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,920
has this sense of movement

171
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,160
that it is going somewhere

172
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,760
because it's based on

173
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,560
God's promise,

174
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,080
the promise that he made to Abraham

175
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,120
that he would be a nation

176
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,120
and through him the nation

177
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,760
is to be blessed

178
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,800
as we've been thinking

179
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,040
repeatedly through these

180
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,280
last couple of days.

181
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,600
Act three, therefore,

182
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,160
is a story which ultimately

183
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,640
leads up to act four,

184
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,400
which, of course, is the coming

185
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,680
of the Lord Jesus Christ

186
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,280
when the God of Israel

187
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,400
keeps his promise,

188
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,120
enters into human history

189
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,000
as a human being,

190
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,280
the Word becomes flesh

191
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,480
and then lives and teaches,

192
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,960
dies the atoning death

193
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,600
on the cross

194
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,960
and rises again

195
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,560
and returns to his father.

196
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,080
So that cross symbol at the centre

197
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,440
is not just the crucifixion

198
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,640
but is intended to represent

199
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,640
everything we have in the Gospels,

200
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,000
from the conception

201
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,280
by the Holy Spirit

202
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,800
through to the ascension

203
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,440
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

204
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,200
But the Bible doesn't end there,

205
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,080
does it? Of course not.

206
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,960
It moves on through the book of Acts

207
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,480
into the outpouring of God's Spirit

208
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,280
on his people,

209
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,840
sending the people of God

210
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,800
out in mission

211
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,920
to the ends of the earth.

212
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,040
We live within that era of mission

213
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,320
begun in the New Testament

214
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,960
and continuing to this day,

215
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,720
which leads to the last two

216
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,240
great acts of the story.

217
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,920
I put a tick here

218
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,080
for the final judgment.

219
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,760
It might seem a wrong symbol,

220
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,480
but in a sense,

221
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,520
that is when God puts everything right.

222
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,560
It's when God deals with evil,

223
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,680
so evil will not have the last word.

224
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,280
Thank God.

225
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,640
The judgment is actually good news

226
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,880
in Paul's thinking

227
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,080
because it is when God rectifies

228
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,200
all that went wrong

229
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,360
in the story.

230
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,400
And that then leads

231
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,480
to the new creation,

232
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,680
the new heavens and the new earth

233
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,120
that we read about there

234
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,360
in Revelation 21 and 22,

235
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,680
but of course actually promised

236
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,440
in the book of Isaiah.

237
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,080
Now,that's simply trying to portray

238
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,720
the whole Bible story

239
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,800
on the back of an envelope,

240
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,480
in a sense,

241
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,400
which is where I first saw it done,

242
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,400
actually with a friend of mine

243
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,840
in the US with some other

244
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,840
slightly different symbols,

245
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,800
but the same idea.

246
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,040
I've even done this

247
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,160
on the back of a napkin

248
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,120
in a restaurant

249
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,320
sitting beside somebody

250
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,360
and say,

251
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,600
what do you think the whole Bible is?

252
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,920
Well,just draw it like this.

253
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,360
Here's the whole story of the Bible

254
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,960
in one piece.

255
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,160
And this helps us to see,

256
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:53,600
of course,

257
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,080
that we now,

258
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,480
we are somewhere in Act 5,

259
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,200
that is to say,

260
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,520
we are in between

261
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,160
the resurrection of Christ

262
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,320
and the return of Christ.

263
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,120
We are in the Bible.

264
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,160
Did you know you're in the Bible?

265
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,040
We are.

266
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,560
We are actually participating

267
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,480
in this drama.

268
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,600
We are part of the story.

269
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,320
This is the story we are in.

270
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,600
And of course,

271
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,280
this Act 5 is not the end.

272
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,880
We know that ultimately

273
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,280
this story is leading

274
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,840
to a glorious future,

275
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,640
which gives us hope.

276
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,560
That's why I use the word hope

277
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,000
in the title of the lecture.

278
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,760
Now,hope,of course,

279
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,400
is one of those massive

280
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,880
New Testament words.

281
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,600
In fact,

282
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,840
the Apostle Paul puts it

283
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,960
in his favourite three,

284
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,520
doesn't he?

285
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,120
Now abide faith,

286
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,680
hope and love.

287
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,360
But Christian hope

288
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,040
is not just optimism.

289
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,080
It doesn't just mean,

290
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,120
oh,we like to think

291
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,760
that everything's going

292
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,800
to get better and better.

293
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,160
That's the myth of modernity,

294
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,240
that somehow human progress,

295
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,760
science and wisdom

296
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,640
will eventually

297
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,760
create a better world.

298
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,440
Well,Jesus told us

299
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,320
that things may well get worse

300
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,120
as they get better.

301
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,920
In other words,

302
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,080
the wheat of the kingdom of God

303
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,280
and the weeds of the evil one

304
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,240
work together

305
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,360
all the way through history.

306
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,000
So Christian hope

307
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,960
is not optimism.

308
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,840
Rather,it is the certainty,

309
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,440
the biblical certainty

310
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,480
that the future of this planet,

311
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,920
indeed,the future of the universe

312
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,120
is in God's hands

313
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,160
and God's sovereign purpose

314
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,320
will be accomplished

315
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,080
in the reconciliation

316
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,520
of his whole creation

317
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,360
and the ingathering of people

318
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,280
from every tribe

319
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,360
and nation and language

320
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,720
and that that hope

321
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,240
has indeed already

322
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,240
been accomplished

323
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,560
in anticipation

324
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,480
through the cross

325
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,680
and resurrection of Christ,

326
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,560
as we shall see.

327
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,920
Now,what I want us to see

328
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,160
is that this sense of Christian hope

329
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,000
didn't just sort of drop

330
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,640
into the Apostle Paul's mind

331
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,520
from nowhere.

332
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,040
It actually comes

333
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,480
very deeply rooted

334
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,720
in his scriptures

335
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,040
even before his conversion.

336
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,200
In other words,

337
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,000
Paul tells us,

338
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,360
doesn't he,

339
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,680
that he was a Hebrew-speaking Jew,

340
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,600
that he was a Torah-observant Pharisee.

341
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,160
He tells us that in Philippians.

342
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,800
So he knew the scriptures.

343
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,080
He probably chewed masses

344
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,840
of the Old Testament by heart.

345
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,960
So therefore,

346
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,360
he knew about the God of hope

347
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,200
as he speaks in Romans 15.

348
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,040
Indeed,I think if you had asked

349
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,680
Saul of Tarsus

350
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,760
before his experience

351
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,760
of the Damascus Road,

352
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,080
what gave him hope for the future,

353
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,800
he would have taken you

354
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,840
to some of the texts

355
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,960
that we're just going to look at

356
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,880
in a moment,

357
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,280
to multiple scriptures.

358
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,000
He would have believed

359
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,320
that the future would include

360
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,520
God's restoration of Israel.

361
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,800
That's what would happen.

362
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,240
And then after the restoration

363
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,040
of Israel would come

364
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,400
the ingathering of the nations

365
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,080
and then ultimately would come

366
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,600
a new heaven and a new earth,

367
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,840
which he would have read about

368
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,560
in Isaiah.

369
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,520
And if you were to ask

370
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,800
the same question

371
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,400
to Saul of Tarsus

372
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,240
after he had become

373
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,320
the Apostle Paul,

374
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,240
after his experience

375
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,240
on the Damascus Road,

376
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,640
then he would have done the same

377
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,040
because he actually did.

378
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,000
When he wants to talk

379
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,560
about the hope that we have,

380
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,280
he uses the Old Testament

381
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,400
scriptures to do so.

382
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,920
And that's why I wanted

383
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,320
to use this text

384
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,880
as a kind of control text

385
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,520
here from Romans chapter 15

386
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,400
because hope figures

387
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,640
again and again in it.

388
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,120
Romans chapter 15 verse 4

389
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,080
says this.

390
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,360
He says, Paul says,

391
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,760
that everything that was

392
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,080
written in the past,

393
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:18,840
and of course he means

394
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,000
the scriptures of what we call

395
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,720
the Old Testament,

396
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,640
was written to teach us

397
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,360
so that through the endurance

398
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,480
taught in the scriptures

399
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,360
and the encouragement

400
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:26,960
they provide,

401
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,680
we might have hope.

402
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,000
Paul says the whole Old Testament

403
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
was to give us hope.

404
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,360
Have you ever thought of that?

405
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,640
The Old Testament

406
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,560
gives you a lot of problems

407
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,600
and a lot of classes

408
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,400
and a lot of exams

409
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:37,960
and everything else.

410
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,720
But Paul says

411
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,440
the Old Testament

412
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,280
was given to us

413
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:41,960
to give us hope.

414
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,680
And then immediately

415
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,640
in the following verses,

416
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,520
verses 8 and 9,

417
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,560
he summarizes

418
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,560
what I just described

419
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,000
as Acts 3, 4 and 5

420
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,040
of the biblical narrative.

421
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,080
Because he says,

422
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,120
I tell you, says Paul,

423
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,000
that the Messiah Christ

424
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,520
has become a servant

425
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,680
of the Jews,

426
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,440
that's the story

427
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,280
of the Gospels, isn't it?

428
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,920
on behalf of God's truth

429
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,160
so that the promises

430
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,200
made to the patriarchs

431
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,160
might be confirmed

432
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,280
and moreover,

433
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,320
that the Gentiles

434
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,400
might glorify God

435
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,200
for his mercy.

436
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,480
So Paul says,

437
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,720
Jesus came

438
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,200
as the servant of the Lord,

439
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,680
that's Act 4,

440
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,000
the Gospel story there,

441
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,080
the cross narrative,

442
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,280
as portrayed in Isaiah,

443
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,280
but he had come

444
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,400
in order to fulfill

445
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,240
God's promises

446
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,080
to the patriarchs,

447
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,560
meaning, of course, Abraham.

448
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,080
So that was Act 3

449
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,960
of the drama.

450
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,000
And he says,

451
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,080
that was so that

452
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,200
all nations,

453
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,000
the Gentiles,

454
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,280
would come to find

455
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:32,800
their hope

456
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,720
and their blessing

457
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,160
and the glorifying God

458
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:35,880
for his mercy,

459
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,360
which was now happening

460
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,560
in Act 5,

461
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,600
because Paul was taking

462
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,760
the Gospel to the nations

463
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,680
and seeing the

464
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,000
responding to God's mercy.

465
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,760
And then,

466
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,880
in order to

467
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,120
reinforce that

468
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,520
climactic point,

469
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:48,920
which is,

470
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,600
let's remember that

471
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,200
Romans 15

472
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,080
is the climax

473
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:52,800
of the whole letter.

474
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,800
Paul didn't write

475
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,880
a postcard to the Romans,

476
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,080
which ended at Romans 8.

477
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,360
He wrote a whole letter

478
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,040
to the Romans,

479
00:13:59,040 --> 00:13:59,760
which comes right up

480
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,200
to chapter 15 and 16.

481
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,920
So let's hold it all together.

482
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,000
He said that God's intention,

483
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
his intention,

484
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,200
from chapter 1,

485
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:07,960
was to bring about

486
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,120
the obedience of faith

487
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,000
among the nations.

488
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,080
That's what the Gospel

489
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:11,760
is all about.

490
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,960
And so Paul,

491
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,280
when he gets to this point,

492
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,680
that it's for the glory of God

493
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,760
among the nations,

494
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,920
throws in

495
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,280
four Old Testament quotations

496
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,400
immediately afterwards.

497
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,200
I referred to this

498
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,200
in an earlier lecture

499
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,280
from the Psalms,

500
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,000
the Torah,

501
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,720
and the Prophets,

502
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,160
all of which

503
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,800
speak about the Gentiles,

504
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,640
the nations,

505
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,880
rejoicing along with Israel.

506
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,240
Because now,

507
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,840
under the reign of

508
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,520
the Messiah,

509
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,480
King Jesus,

510
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,640
Son of David,

511
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,960
they have hope

512
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,360
for the future of the world.

513
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,440
Here's how Paul

514
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,680
concludes that list.

515
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,840
It's in,

516
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,240
again,

517
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,000
still in Romans,

518
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,560
sorry,

519
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,880
in Romans,

520
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,720
chapter 15.

521
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,840
He says,

522
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,000
"Therefore I will praise you

523
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,080
among the Gentiles,

524
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,480
rejoice you Gentiles,

525
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,160
praise the Lord,

526
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:54,920
you Gentiles.

527
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,040
The root of Jesse

528
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:56,680
will arise,

529
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,000
and in him

530
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,200
the Gentiles will hope."

531
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,880
That's his climax.

532
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,360
Hope for the world,

533
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,040
hope for the nations,

534
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,320
is the climax

535
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,200
of the Book of Romans,

536
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,040
because Jesus of Nazareth

537
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,680
has fulfilled the promises

538
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,240
of the Old Testament Scriptures,

539
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,320
and the mercy

540
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,320
and the glory of God

541
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,480
is now going to the ends

542
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,200
of the earth.

543
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,280
That vision is now being fulfilled

544
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,120
through Christ and his victory.

545
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,400
And it's being extended

546
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,800
to every sinner

547
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,160
and to all nations

548
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,400
and indeed to the whole

549
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,160
of creation.

550
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,400
So that was simply

551
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,400
a kind of a glimpse

552
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,840
at Romans 15.

553
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,880
It's a significant passage.

554
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,240
Please don't overlook it

555
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,960
because you can't get past

556
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,000
Romans 9 to 11

557
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,520
or something.

558
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,560
It's a very important way

559
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,320
in which Paul draws his letter

560
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,440
to a conclusion.

561
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,000
So I want us to think of this

562
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,240
hope then, the God of hope,

563
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,160
briefly in three areas.

564
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,920
As I said, hope for sinners,

565
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,320
hope for the nations,

566
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,800
and hope for creation.

567
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,320
So first of all then,

568
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,520
hope for sinners

569
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,920
goes, takes us right back,

570
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,240
of course, to the big problem

571
00:15:59,240 --> 00:15:59,760
that we have,

572
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,200
which is in Genesis 3,

573
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,400
which is because we chose

574
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,440
in Adam and Eve

575
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,440
to distrust and disobey God

576
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,200
The result was sin, evil

577
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:08,680
and death

578
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,880
and that penetrates

579
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,160
to every dimension

580
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,800
of the human personality.

581
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,840
It's remarkable

582
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,480
in that little story there

583
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,120
in Genesis chapter 3

584
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,320
of how when Eve is,

585
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,640
you know, confronted

586
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,720
by this temptation

587
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,520
from the serpent

588
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,400
that the evil

589
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,520
that is somehow there

590
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,600
and it's not explained

591
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,560
where this has come from

592
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,480
or why it has happened,

593
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,280
but it speaks into her

594
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,800
spiritual relationship

595
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,440
with God.

596
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,640
Did God really say

597
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,720
you don't want to believe him?

598
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,440
It penetrates her mind

599
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,320
because she now rationalizes

600
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,480
the fruit of the tree.

601
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,920
It's good, beautiful.

602
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,640
It's good to eat.

603
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,640
It makes you wise.

604
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,240
And then also it enters

605
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,440
her physical body.

606
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,840
She takes, she eats,

607
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,680
and then it enters

608
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,080
into her social relationship

609
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:54,720
with her husband

610
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,200
because she gives it to him.

611
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,760
He was with her,

612
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,560
the text says.

613
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,760
Please notice, you men,

614
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,080
including myself.

615
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,400
Adam was not

616
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,480
somewhere else in the garden.

617
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,800
He was with her

618
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,080
while this was happening.

619
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,520
So he was a witness to it.

620
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,840
So sin enters

621
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,080
into every dimension

622
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,280
of the human person

623
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,320
and indeed to all of us

624
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,520
because as Paul would say,

625
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,280
all of us have sinned in Adam.

626
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,120
And so that leads, of course,

627
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,680
to the promise of God

628
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,240
in Genesis 3, verse 15,

629
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,360
sometimes called

630
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,400
the first gospel

631
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,640
of the Proto-Evangelium,

632
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,960
where God says

633
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,160
even in the context

634
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,160
of that, the fall,

635
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,880
God says to the serpent

636
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,320
that I will put enmity

637
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,480
between you and the woman

638
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,920
and your offspring and hers.

639
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,240
He, that is,

640
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,360
the seed of the woman,

641
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,440
a human being,

642
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,360
he will crush your head,

643
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,520
the head of the serpent,

644
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,280
and you will strike his heel.

645
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,600
So there will be warfare

646
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,000
between the serpent

647
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,480
and what the serpent represents

648
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,960
and the human race

649
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,080
represented by the seed of Eve.

650
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,680
But it will be a human being

651
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,560
who ultimately

652
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,680
will be the serpent crusher,

653
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,600
as it were,

654
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,160
and destroy that evil.

655
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,240
Now, very quickly to say,

656
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,200
the rest of the Old Testament

657
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,520
shows not just the fact

658
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,200
that we are all sinners,

659
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,840
but that there is an awareness

660
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,280
that God's forgiveness

661
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,480
and mercy and grace

662
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,080
is available to sinners.

663
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,080
It's there in the Psalms

664
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,200
at an individual level

665
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,120
when the psalmist

666
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,560
celebrate the fact

667
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,000
that when they confess their sin,

668
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,880
God forgives it.

669
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,320
Psalm 32, Psalm 51,

670
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,480
Psalm 130, for example.

671
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,160
God, if you kept a record of sin,

672
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,240
who could stand?

673
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,160
But with you there is forgiveness.

674
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,440
Amazing words

675
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,280
of personal, individual,

676
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,520
forgiveness.

677
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,000
But how is that happening?

678
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,240
Well, you look at Isaiah 53,

679
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,600
and as we saw earlier

680
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,600
in an earlier lecture,

681
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,840
the servant of the Lord,

682
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,360
the climax of those songs

683
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,000
is when he will bear

684
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,480
the sins of many,

685
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,920
and because he would

686
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,960
bear their sins,

687
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,880
they would then be

688
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,440
received the righteousness

689
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,960
of God or be right with God.

690
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,720
That's in Isaiah 53,

691
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,360
that he took up our pain,

692
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,640
bore our suffering,

693
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,440
crushed for our transgressions

694
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,440
and the punishment

695
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,760
that brought us peace

696
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,760
was on him

697
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,040
and by his wounds

698
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,480
we are healed,

699
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,760
which of course is picked up

700
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,640
in the New Testament

701
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,440
by Jesus and by Peter.

702
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,800
But the passage

703
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,920
that I wanted particularly

704
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,720
to take us to

705
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,040
is that one on the screen

706
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,440
of Romans chapter 5,

707
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,400
where Paul explicitly

708
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,080
makes the link

709
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,560
between the sin

710
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,400
that entered the world

711
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,120
through Adam

712
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,920
and the forgiveness

713
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,120
that enters the world

714
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,560
through the Lord Jesus Christ.

715
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,440
Romans 5, verse 12.

716
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,560
Therefore just as sin

717
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,320
entered the world

718
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,240
through one man

719
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,960
and death through sin

720
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,000
and in this way

721
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,280
death came to all people

722
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,760
because all have sinned,

723
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,840
that's what comes

724
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,720
into the world.

725
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,000
Then says Paul

726
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,800
in verse,

727
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,040
a little bit later

728
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,080
in verse,

729
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,120
have I got it?

730
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:47,840
19.

731
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,600
He says,

732
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,800
therefore just as

733
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,680
the disobedience

734
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,560
of the one man,

735
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,480
many were made sinners,

736
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,920
so also through

737
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,520
the obedience of the one man,

738
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,520
Jesus of course,

739
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,720
the many will be made righteous.

740
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,320
So that just as sin

741
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,440
reigned in death,

742
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,960
so also grace

743
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,520
might reign

744
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,520
through righteousness

745
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,960
to bring eternal life

746
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,440
through Jesus Christ our Lord.

747
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,080
So that's the first point

748
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,120
of the hope

749
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,320
of the future

750
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,600
of eternal life

751
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,560
which we have in Christ

752
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,920
is because we can have

753
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,200
our sins forgiven.

754
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,840
There is hope for sinners

755
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,960
and it's promised

756
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,880
in the Old Testament

757
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,640
and accomplished by Jesus.

758
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,440
And for some people

759
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:25,840
that's it,

760
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,760
that's the gospel,

761
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,080
that's all we ever preach,

762
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,200
which I think is true

763
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,880
but very short-sighted

764
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,760
because it's not all the Bible says

765
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,680
about what God has accomplished

766
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,040
through the cross of Christ

767
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,200
because there's also,

768
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:38,560
of course,

769
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,040
secondly,

770
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,160
hope for the nations.

771
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,280
You see,

772
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,160
the opening chapters of Genesis,

773
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,560
that Act 1 and 2,

774
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,440
present not just that

775
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,240
all human beings are sinners

776
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,680
but also the problem

777
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,520
of the nations,

778
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,800
that the nations too

779
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,560
are scattered

780
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,920
and broken and divided.

781
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,880
God's got a very big problem

782
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,600
on his hands.

783
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,240
It's not just that we are sinned

784
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,520
and the earth is cursed

785
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,040
but that nations are also

786
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,160
scattered and divided.

787
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,040
And the chapters 4 to 11

788
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,120
of Genesis show very clearly

789
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,600
that sin isn't just personal,

790
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,440
it affects society

791
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,920
and cultures and generations.

792
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,560
So much so that by the time of Noah,

793
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,240
we are told several times

794
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,000
in those chapters

795
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,600
that God saw that the earth

796
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,040
was filled with corruption

797
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:22,920
and violence.

798
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,160
Now those are social things.

799
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,200
That's what people do

800
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:26,840
to each other.

801
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,480
And so that's why,

802
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,840
as we've been seeing earlier on,

803
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,760
the promise of Genesis 12

804
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,560
is so important

805
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,040
that God says to Abraham

806
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,720
in the context of the Tower of Babel

807
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,680
in chapter 11,

808
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,360
God says that through you,

809
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,920
all nations on earth

810
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,160
will be blessed,

811
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,640
not just experiencing that curse.

812
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,960
The blessing of God

813
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,240
is to go far as the curse is found

814
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,560
in Isaac Newton's great hymn,

815
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,520
Joy to the World.

816
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,800
Unfortunately,

817
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,480
the modern translation of that hymn

818
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,800
has spoiled Isaac Newton's meaning

819
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,600
because you know that

820
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,320
where it says,

821
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,080
"No more at thorns and thistles

822
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,760
grow or sin infest the ground.

823
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,280
He comes to make his blessings flow

824
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,320
far as the curse is found."

825
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,320
That's explicitly relating

826
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,120
Genesis 12, 11 and 12.

827
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,720
The more recent version of that hymn

828
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,640
says,far as guilt,

829
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,960
wherever guilt is found,

830
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,040
which again reduces

831
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,480
theological reductionism,

832
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,240
as if somehow God's blessing

833
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,840
was only because of human guilt,

834
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,080
whereas actually the text

835
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,480
and what Isaac Newton was saying

836
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,760
was that God's blessing

837
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,760
is for the whole of creation

838
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,360
as well, wherever the curse is found,

839
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,200
not just wherever guilt is found.

840
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,200
Anyway, that was an aside.

841
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,000
It isn't in my text.

842
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,440
So sorry, Stephen.

843
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,800
You didn't have that earlier.

844
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,280
Now what we see then

845
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,880
is that God's promises

846
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,960
you see then speak of

847
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,640
his blessing for nations

848
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,360
as well as for individuals.

849
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,120
And we saw some of that in the Psalms

850
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,720
in the second lecture,

851
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,040
Psalms which speak about

852
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,800
all the nations you have made

853
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,000
will come to worship you,

854
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,640
all the families of the nations.

855
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,120
But in Isaiah,

856
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,600
which of course is so influential

857
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,400
on Paul,

858
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,560
it's particularly the case

859
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,800
that this is seen as part of

860
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,160
the hope of the reign

861
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,720
of the Messiah, Son of David,

862
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,000
that when he comes to reign,

863
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,920
then it's good news

864
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,320
for the nations specifically.

865
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,520
So Isaiah chapter 2,

866
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,920
when the mountain of the Lord

867
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,600
is lifted up

868
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,280
and all the nations

869
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,160
will stream to it,

870
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,480
many peoples will come and say,

871
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,240
"Hey, let's go up to

872
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,840
the mountain of Yahweh, the Lord,

873
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,400
the temple of the God of Jacob.

874
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,000
He will teach us his ways.

875
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,640
We will walk in his ways."

876
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,000
And then he will judge

877
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,320
between the nations

878
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,840
and settle disputes.

879
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,640
Wouldn't that be great?

880
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,760
And they will beat

881
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,160
their swords into plowshares

882
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:35,800
and their spears

883
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,680
into pruning hooks.

884
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,840
And nations will not

885
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,240
take up sword against nation.

886
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,760
They won't train for war anymore.

887
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,440
What a hope for the nations,

888
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,680
the ending of war.

889
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,560
And that's what

890
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,040
Isaiah specifically says.

891
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,360
And then he repeats it

892
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,240
in Isaiah chapter 11,

893
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,120
that the shoot of Jesse,

894
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,560
i.e. the Son of David,

895
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,080
will come and it will bring

896
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,640
blessing and righteousness

897
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,000
and justice to the nations

898
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,600
and indeed to creation.

899
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,160
Isaiah chapter 60

900
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,680
speaks about all the nations

901
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,440
coming to worship God.

902
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,240
And at the very end of Isaiah,

903
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,920
in Isaiah chapter 66,

904
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,720
we read God saying this.

905
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,480
God says that I,

906
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,800
because of what they have

907
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,680
planned and done,

908
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,920
I am about to come

909
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,000
and gather the people

910
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,840
of all nations and languages

911
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,040
and they will come

912
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,360
and see my glory

913
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,000
and I will set my sign

914
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,560
among them.

915
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,560
And then it says,

916
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,160
they will proclaim my glory

917
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,360
among the nations.

918
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,120
So you see,

919
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,080
when Paul talks

920
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,200
in Romans 15,

921
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,640
about the hope of the nations,

922
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,120
of the God of that hope,

923
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,680
it's speaking about all the nations

924
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,440
and it comes from the Old Testament

925
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,320
and it comes,

926
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:38,720
of course,

927
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,480
to its climax,

928
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,680
as you can see on the screen

929
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,840
in Romans chapter,

930
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,800
in Revelation chapter 7,

931
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,920
verses 9 and 10.

932
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,440
I've referred to this earlier

933
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,800
where John says that

934
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,360
there I saw a great multitude

935
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,560
from every tribe,

936
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,280
nation,

937
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,480
people and language

938
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,080
standing before the throne

939
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,320
and before the Lamb.

940
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,520
That's there in Revelation 7

941
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,840
and it isn't forgotten

942
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,760
in the rest of the book

943
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,440
because in Revelation 21,

944
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,800
we read this

945
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,440
in verses 24 to 26

946
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,640
that the nations

947
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,600
will walk by its light,

948
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,360
that is the light of the city of God

949
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,880
and the kings of the earth

950
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,080
will bring their splendor

951
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,720
into the city of God.

952
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,400
The glory and the honor

953
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,520
of the nations

954
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,320
will be brought

955
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,320
into the city of God.

956
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,560
Now that's astonishing

957
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,680
because all through

958
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,760
the book of Revelation,

959
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,680
the kings and the nations

960
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,800
are the bad guys.

961
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,880
They're the ones

962
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,320
who are in rebellion against God.

963
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,280
They're persecuting

964
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,200
the people of God.

965
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,040
They've got the blood

966
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,200
of the martyrs on their hands.

967
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,280
So in some radical transformation,

968
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,080
the kings and the nations

969
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:37,680
of the world

970
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,320
are there in this new creation

971
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,240
as nations,

972
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,800
as kings bringing their glory

973
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,320
into the kingdom of God.

974
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,800
So much so that

975
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,080
the book of Revelation

976
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,360
can end almost

977
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,760
in its closing verses

978
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,880
in chapter 22

979
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,400
with the tree of life

980
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,320
and the leaves of the tree

981
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,240
are for the healing

982
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,240
of the nations.

983
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,840
An incredible statement

984
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,720
there right at the end

985
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,320
of the Bible.

986
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,600
So from the old

987
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,640
through to the new,

988
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,640
there is hope.

989
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,520
Hope not only for sinners,

990
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,240
but hope for the nations.

991
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,440
Now,

992
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,880
I don't know what that means.

993
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,080
I don't know how to

994
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,120
get my head around that

995
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:14,720
in terms of

996
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,880
what is that going to mean

997
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,000
in our human history.

998
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,480
It's bigger than I can imagine.

999
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,560
That's because it comes from God.

1000
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,320
And God is always bigger

1001
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,200
than we can imagine.

1002
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,680
But it gives us hope

1003
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,440
for the future,

1004
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,320
for this planet,

1005
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,440
that God ultimately has a plan

1006
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,760
that will bring blessing,

1007
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,200
peace,

1008
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:30,720
healing

1009
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,400
and the end of war and strife

1010
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,680
to the nations of this world.

1011
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,280
Isn't that good?

1012
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,040
Good news.

1013
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:35,640
Hallelujah.

1014
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,320
Thank you.

1015
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,040
But more than that,

1016
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:38,600
finally,

1017
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,960
there is hope for creation itself.

1018
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,200
You see,

1019
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:42,880
again,

1020
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,800
God's big problem

1021
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,000
wasn't just that Adam and Eve

1022
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,640
had sinned.

1023
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,280
It wasn't just

1024
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,840
that the nations were scattered,

1025
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,720
but that he said,

1026
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,960
"Cursed is the earth,

1027
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,440
the ground because of you."

1028
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,880
There is something in creation

1029
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,080
that is not the way

1030
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,280
it was intended to be.

1031
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,640
Now,

1032
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,640
there's all sorts of ways

1033
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,400
of talking about that

1034
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,440
that I don't want to go into,

1035
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,760
but the apostle Paul

1036
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,960
in Romans 8 agrees.

1037
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,320
He says that creation

1038
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,520
was subjected to frustration.

1039
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,160
He uses the word "mataiotes,"

1040
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,360
which is the same

1041
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,360
in the Greek translation

1042
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,920
of Ecclesiastes' Hevel,

1043
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,600
which was translated "vanity."

1044
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,720
It's all something

1045
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,840
about this world

1046
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,880
which is,

1047
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,680
you know,

1048
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,440
frustrated

1049
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,720
and not the way it should be.

1050
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,720
Yes,

1051
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,880
we can say that creation

1052
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,000
gives glory to God,

1053
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:25,880
and indeed,

1054
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,040
the Psalms will tell us that.

1055
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:27,880
The whole creation

1056
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,640
is singing the praises

1057
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,520
and glory of God,

1058
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,240
and yet,

1059
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,640
even though it is doing that,

1060
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,160
it's still,

1061
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:33,880
in some sense,

1062
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,160
frustrated in it.

1063
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,680
And I have to say

1064
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,440
that there are times

1065
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,000
when I look out

1066
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,320
at the glories of our world

1067
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,600
on a wonderful day

1068
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,280
or the mountains

1069
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,440
or the grandeur

1070
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,480
of some great scene,

1071
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,520
and I say to myself,

1072
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:44,880
"Wow,

1073
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,200
if this is what it looks like

1074
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,080
when it's frustrated,

1075
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,520
what's it going to look like

1076
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,360
when it's liberated

1077
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,560
in God's new creation?"

1078
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,440
So,

1079
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,680
the creation itself,

1080
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:53,840
then,

1081
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,160
is frustrated,

1082
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,600
but God says,

1083
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,080
in both the Psalms

1084
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:57,920
and in Isaiah,

1085
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,880
that his plans are indeed

1086
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,520
for a whole new heaven

1087
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,280
and a new earth,

1088
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,360
not in the sense

1089
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,720
of a complete replacement

1090
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,400
heaven and earth,

1091
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,520
but a renewal,

1092
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,560
a restoration

1093
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,720
of what the earth

1094
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,720
was intended to be.

1095
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:14,320
So read Isaiah 65:17-25.

1096
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:14,520
Yes,

1097
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,000
there it is.

1098
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,640
See,

1099
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,840
I am creating,

1100
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,400
says God.

1101
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,320
It's a participle.

1102
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,840
I am creating new heavens

1103
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,680
and a new earth.

1104
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,240
And then it describes

1105
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,160
that new heavens

1106
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:24,680
and new earth

1107
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,120
in the most wonderfully

1108
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,360
earthy language.

1109
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,360
It talks about human life,

1110
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,920
about family.

1111
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,960
It talks about work.

1112
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,520
It talks about

1113
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,400
building houses

1114
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,520
and vineyards

1115
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,320
and satisfaction

1116
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,120
and no more frustration

1117
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:38,640
in our work

1118
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,000
and so on.

1119
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,120
It's a wonderful picture

1120
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,480
of the new creation

1121
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,880
there in Isaiah 65.

1122
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,640
It's repeated in chapter 66.

1123
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,320
And of course,

1124
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,440
it influenced John

1125
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,360
in Revelation chapter 21

1126
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,440
of the new creation.

1127
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,760
But it's also there

1128
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,720
in the Psalms

1129
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,400
and elsewhere

1130
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,800
where the psalmist

1131
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,360
portrays the whole of creation

1132
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,200
as rejoicing.

1133
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:57,960
And,

1134
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,640
you know,

1135
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,000
yes,

1136
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,840
it's poetic.

1137
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,120
And we need to understand it

1138
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,280
in that sense.

1139
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,600
But it is still

1140
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,520
pretty marvelous

1141
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,920
that when you have said

1142
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,320
among the nations

1143
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,520
that the Lord reigns,

1144
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,400
the kingdom of God

1145
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,560
in among the nations,

1146
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,640
then let the heavens rejoice,

1147
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,720
let the earth be glad,

1148
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,720
let the sea resign

1149
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,360
and all that's in it.

1150
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,960
Let the fields be jubilant

1151
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,720
and everything in them.

1152
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,080
Let all the trees of the field

1153
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,520
sing for joy.

1154
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,360
Let all creation

1155
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,000
rejoice before the Lord.

1156
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:25,680
Why?

1157
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,880
Because he's coming.

1158
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,280
Because he comes.

1159
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,480
And what's he going to do?

1160
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,840
He comes to judge

1161
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,400
the world with righteousness.

1162
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,520
In other words,

1163
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,400
he's coming to put things right.

1164
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,760
Because that's what it means

1165
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,040
when God acts as judge.

1166
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,480
He gets things sorted out.

1167
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,480
He puts things right.

1168
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,200
And the whole of creation

1169
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:42,880
is rejoicing

1170
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,040
and waiting for that day

1171
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,920
when God puts everything right.

1172
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,520
That's,

1173
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:46,880
I think,

1174
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,040
what influenced Paul

1175
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,080
in Romans 8

1176
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,600
when he says in Romans 8

1177
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,040
verses 18 to 25

1178
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,600
that the whole of creation

1179
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,800
is just longing for that day

1180
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,800
when it will be liberated

1181
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,200
at the same time as we experience

1182
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,720
the redemption of our bodies.

1183
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,240
Paul puts together

1184
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,640
the resurrection of the body

1185
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,520
with the redemption of creation.

1186
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,080
That's a fascinating parallel.

1187
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,440
It's actually very important

1188
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,160
when people try to think of,

1189
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:11,720
well,

1190
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,400
what is the new creation

1191
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,120
going to be like?

1192
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:14,480
Well,

1193
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,200
it's going to be like

1194
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,520
our resurrection bodies.

1195
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,240
And our resurrection bodies

1196
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,480
are like the body of Jesus

1197
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,560
who was risen from the dead.

1198
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,120
And when you ask,

1199
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:22,640
well,

1200
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,000
the risen Jesus,

1201
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,040
was he the same

1202
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,400
as the earthly Jesus

1203
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:26,920
or different?

1204
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,480
Yeah,

1205
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,000
both.

1206
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,080
It was the same Jesus.

1207
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,200
They recognized him.

1208
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,080
They saw the wounds in his hands

1209
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,120
and his feet and his side.

1210
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,480
So it was the same Jesus.

1211
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:35,840
And yet,

1212
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,880
it was a resurrected Jesus.

1213
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,240
He was a whole new mode of being

1214
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,880
in the new creation,

1215
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,480
the first fruits of the new creation.

1216
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,680
And so in that sense,

1217
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,080
I think,

1218
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,600
when we talk about the new heavens

1219
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,320
and the new earth,

1220
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,680
will it be just like this old heaven?

1221
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,280
Well,

1222
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,080
yes and no.

1223
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,200
It will be this earth.

1224
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,200
It will be this heaven.

1225
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,360
But it will be now restored,

1226
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,640
refreshed,

1227
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,400
renewed,

1228
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,040
cleansed,

1229
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:57,720
purged

1230
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,200
in the new creation.

1231
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,560
That's what I think Paul

1232
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,000
was talking about in Romans 8.

1233
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,320
And he says that's already

1234
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,120
been accomplished

1235
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,960
in Colossians 1:15-20.

1236
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,520
That marvelous passage

1237
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,200
where Paul,

1238
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,520
it's just incredible

1239
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,120
what he says.

1240
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,600
About five times

1241
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,440
he talks about all things,

1242
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,520
all things in heaven and earth.

1243
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,200
He couldn't make it any more clear

1244
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:18,920
that he's talking about

1245
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,880
the whole of creation.

1246
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,000
And he says Christ is the origin.

1247
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,760
He's the head.

1248
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,760
He's the source.

1249
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,880
He holds it all together.

1250
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,440
And through him,

1251
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,280
through Christ,

1252
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,440
God was pleased to reconcile

1253
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,200
to himself all things,

1254
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,360
whether things in earth

1255
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,200
or things in heaven,

1256
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,640
by making peace

1257
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,120
through his blood shed on the cross.

1258
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,880
Have you ever thought about that?

1259
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,320
That the cross is cosmic

1260
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,240
in its scope.

1261
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,120
It brings me salvation,

1262
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,280
brings you salvation.

1263
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,800
It also brings salvation

1264
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,800
to the whole of creation.

1265
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,040
So we're not going to be saved

1266
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,080
out of this world.

1267
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,680
I wish we didn't have

1268
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,960
so many hymns and songs

1269
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,520
which talk about

1270
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,560
going somewhere else.

1271
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,760
You know,

1272
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,840
they're really not biblical.

1273
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,840
In fact,

1274
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,880
I get my music leaders

1275
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,480
at All Souls

1276
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,920
to change the words sometimes.

1277
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,120
Even great hymns like,

1278
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,640
you know,

1279
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,320
How great thou art!

1280
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,720
When Christ shall come

1281
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,960
with shout of acclamation

1282
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,920
and take me home.

1283
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,000
He's not coming

1284
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,200
to take me anywhere.

1285
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,160
He is coming to make his home here.

1286
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,240
So we sing that

1287
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,240
when Christ shall come

1288
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,360
and make his home.

1289
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,160
That's the way we sing it

1290
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:21,720
at All Souls

1291
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,840
because that's what it says

1292
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,360
in the Bible.

1293
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,280
The Bible does not end

1294
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,160
with us going up to heaven.

1295
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,520
The Bible ends

1296
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,120
with God bringing heaven to earth,

1297
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,080
bringing the city of God here.

1298
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,120
Then the dwelling place of God

1299
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,520
will be with us,

1300
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,840
it says in Revelation 21,

1301
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,960
three times.

1302
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,480
Revelation 21

1303
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,360
is the great Emmanuel fulfillment,

1304
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,480
God with us.

1305
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,520
Emmanuel means God with us,

1306
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,440
not us going somewhere

1307
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,160
to be with God,

1308
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,960
but God coming to restore

1309
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,800
his creation

1310
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,280
in Revelation 21 and 22.

1311
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,280
We could go on about that.

1312
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,360
Perhaps the last thing

1313
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,280
to say then is

1314
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,800
very close to the end

1315
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,320
of the Bible

1316
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,920
in Revelation 22,

1317
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,560
verse 3,

1318
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,840
immediately after it says

1319
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,440
that the leaves of the tree

1320
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,480
will be for the healing

1321
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,480
of the nations,

1322
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,160
the next verse says

1323
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,880
no longer will there be

1324
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,240
any curse.

1325
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,120
The curse on the earth

1326
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,160
will be gone

1327
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,480
in the new creation.

1328
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,000
So therefore,

1329
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,520
we need our whole Bible,

1330
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,960
I will end by saying

1331
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,040
to tell us who we are,

1332
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,240
to tell us why we're here,

1333
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,480
to tell us how we should live,

1334
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,960
and to tell us

1335
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,240
what we can look forward to

1336
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,560
in the hope of sinners,

1337
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,520
of the nations,

1338
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,640
and of creation.

1339
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,360
So may the God of hope

1340
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,720
fill you with all joy and peace

1341
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,880
as you trust in him

1342
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,440
so that you may overflow

1343
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,040
with hope

1344
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,280
by the power of the Holy Spirit.

1345
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,680
Amen.
