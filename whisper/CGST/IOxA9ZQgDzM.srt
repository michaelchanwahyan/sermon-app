2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 Good evening, everyone. Thank you for coming to CGST and joining our lecture this evening.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 This lecture is co-organised by CGST and Institute of Sino-Christian Studies.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 The Institute of Sino-Christian Studies is committed to promote the contextualisation of Christianity

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 as well as the dialogues between different cultures and religions.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 This lecture is indeed a rare and wonderful opportunity for us to dialogue with orthodox tradition.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 We are very delighted to have Dr. Augustin Sokolovsky in our midst this evening.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Dr. Augustin Sokolovsky is Director of the Orthodox Community in Bien, Switzerland

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 and guest professor of the Institute of Sino-Christian Studies.

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 He is also an academic board member of the Institute for Ecumenical Studies at the University of Freiburg.

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 The topic he is going to present this evening is "When East Meets West",

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 Augustin of Hippo and the Western Fathers in Orthodox Theology and Piety.

13
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 After Dr. Sokolovsky's presentation, we will have Mr. Andrew Wong to give us his response.

14
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 Andrew is our Assistant Professor at CGST. He is a doctoral candidate at the University of Oxford.

15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 His academic interest and expertise is on the thought and spirituality of Augustin of Hippo,

16
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 so we cannot have a better respondent this evening.

17
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 So please let us welcome our speaker, Dr. Sokolovsky.

18
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 [Applause]

19
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 Hello everyone, thank you for inviting me.

20
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 I am very happy to speak here before you about St. Augustine and Orthodox Theology and Piety.

21
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 Before we begin to consider the reception of Augustine in Orthodox Theology and Piety,

22
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 it is important to outline what actually Orthodoxy is.

23
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 It is very important because it helps to better understand specifics that simply need to be taken into account

24
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 before starting to consider one or another theological issue.

25
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 In their theological discourse, representatives of the Orthodox tradition talk about Orthodoxy.

26
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 Typically, they mean two things at the same time, but normally this is not indicated.

27
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Firstly, by Orthodoxy we mean the entire ancient theological, moral, and ascetic tradition created in the Christian East,

28
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 that is, in Palestine, Syria, Egypt, Asia Minor, and Constantinople.

29
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 Everything that comes from this original matrix is considered Orthodox by default.

30
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 This is a very important hermeneutical attitude.

31
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 As a rule, Orthodox theologians necessarily adhere to it, but at the same time they are not aware of it.

32
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 Let us note that in this context, the Western fathers of the Church, and mainly Augustine,

33
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 seem to immediately fall out of sight of Orthodox authors.

34
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 In other words, Orthodoxy in this sense means ancient Eastern Christianity.

35
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 Secondly, by Orthodoxy we mean the Church and tradition which at a certain point in history came into conflict with the Roman Church,

36
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 and the Churches that at that time were subject to its authority.

37
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 After the break in communion between Rome and Orthodoxy, so it is commonly said,

38
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 Orthodoxy began a separate existence.

39
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 For a very long time it was generally accepted that the date of the separation of the Churches of the East and West was 1054.

40
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 Indeed, then the leadership of the Churches of Rome and Constantinople excommunicated each other from Church communion and anathematized each other.

41
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 Since then, these decisions have not been reversed.

42
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 However, in modern times, through the works of Professor Christoph Zutner from Vienna,

43
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 and Klaus Wirwoll from Regensburg and others, this date has been called into question.

44
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 In my opinion, the year 1453 should be considered the date of the division of the Churches.

45
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 Then Constantinople was taken by the Ottomans, and the Eastern Roman Empire ceased to exist.

46
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 This empire outlived the Roman Empire by a thousand years.

47
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 At the same time, of the Ottoman triumph, Constantinople was a small city-state with a population of only a few tens of thousands of people.

48
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 However, the symbolic significance of this event was enormous.

49
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 Moreover, the Ottoman sultans considered themselves not destroyers, but successors to the emperors of Constantinople.

50
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 Therefore, they immediately began territorial expansion.

51
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 In my opinion, I propose the date of separation of Churches of East and West is 1453, the fall of Constantinople.

52
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 It is interesting that shortly before the fall of Constantinople in 1439,

53
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 the unity of the Churches of Rome and Constantinople was restored at the Council of Florence.

54
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 Despite the fact that this decision did not have time to undergo the necessary reception,

55
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 formally by 1453 this unity existed.

56
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 Ottoman power took control of Constantinople, the Ottomans refounded the empire,

57
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 from now on they themselves became its center.

58
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 At the same time, they reformated the Orthodox Church.

59
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 In this context, it will be important to define what orthodoxy is.

60
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 The complexity of such a definition lies in the fact that within one term,

61
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 various historical, theological, philosophical, and even political factors are combined.

62
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 Therefore, we will try to simply list such definitions.

63
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 So, first, orthodoxy is Christianity, which in the first centuries of the history of the Church

64
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 was formed in the territories of Palestine, Syria, Egypt, Asia Minor,

65
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 and subsequently spread to other countries.

66
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 Second, it's the Church that existed on the territory of the Eastern Roman Empire

67
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 with its capital in Constantinople, as well as those churches on the territory of Syria, Palestine, Egypt, Asia Minor, Russia,

68
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 later in Slavic countries, that until a certain point in history formed a single whole with it,

69
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 and then they continued to be in liturgical and Eucharistic communion.

70
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 These two definitions are based on origin, geography, history, and ecclesiastical organization.

71
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 If we analyze the role of St. Augustine in the context of such definitions of orthodoxy, it will be minimal.

72
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 The reason for this is the fact that Augustine lived in a different historical, geographical, and ecclesiastical context.

73
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 His Christianity was African, Roman, Western.

74
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 As he himself said about himself, "I am an African," "Africanus sum."

75
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 Further, orthodoxy is right, correct, orthodox faith. It's about etymology.

76
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 And also, the Greek word "doxa," which is the basis of the term "orthodox," also means glory, glorification, doxology.

77
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 For instance, "glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit" is the same term.

78
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 Therefore, the word "orthodoxy" can mean a way of properly glorifying God.

79
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 This definition of orthodoxy can be called not only theological, but also aesthetic.

80
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 It largely became popular during the postmodern era.

81
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 We also find it by Dostoevsky that the beauty will save our world.

82
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 And finally, this is maybe my personal definitions of what orthodoxy is.

83
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 It is the official confession of faith adopted in the Roman Empire at the level of religious legislation during the Christian period of its history.

84
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 By default, this definition applies to the Ottoman Empire as the legal successor of the Eastern Roman Empire.

85
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 To the Russian Empire, in some forms of orthodox statehood, we have here an icon of the exaltation of the Holy Cross,

86
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 one of the twelve greatest feasts of the Orthodox liturgical year.

87
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 And it is a unique feast which can be called a political feast,

88
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 because it is about the triumph of the Holy Cross in the universe.

89
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 A very important example of what orthodoxy actually is.

90
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 Also, the official confession of faith.

91
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 In this context, consideration of the role of St. Augustine in orthodox theology seems most difficult.

92
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 For instance, the decisions of the Fourth Ecumenical Council 451 in Chalcedon on Christology are based on the theology of Augustine.

93
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 The Council itself does not refer to Augustine, but follows the Christology of the Roman Church of the era of Pope Leo the Great.

94
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 In the doctrine of Christ, he was a follower of Augustine.

95
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 In turn, the decisions of the Seventh Council of Nicea in 787 on iconography rather contradict the logic of Augustine's thinking,

96
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 although he did not write about iconography.

97
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 But rules were part of the official confession of the empire in their respective eras.

98
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 Now, Augustine, is he sent or blessed?

99
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 In orthodox literature, in European languages as well as in Russian,

100
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 it is customary to call Augustine of Hippo blessed.

101
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 Therefore, not only in secular literature, in theology, in philosophy, but also in the liturgical calendar,

102
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 Augustine is called not Saint Augustine, but Blessed Augustine.

103
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 Many theologians and philosophers as well as outside observers presume that this appellation is not accidental.

104
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 They claim that this is a sign that allegedly indicates the following factors.

105
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 First, insufficient holiness.

106
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 Let us remember that in the Roman Catholic Church, there is a difference between saints and blessed.

107
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 A saint is the right person canonized by the Church who is revered by the entire Church.

108
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 It's an obligation for the universal Church to celebrate the memory of a saint.

109
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 He and this person is commemorated as a saint.

110
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 His or her name is placed in the liturgical calendar.

111
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 This veneration and invocation extend to all Church dioceses and regions.

112
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 A blessed is a righteous person whose canonization took place only at the local level.

113
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 He or she is venerated in individual dioceses.

114
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 It is possible that it will be subsequently spread in the whole universal Church,

115
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 but it is also possible that this will not happen.

116
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 The holiness of the blessed is, as it were, incomplete holiness or holiness in the process of waiting.

117
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 The Orthodox Church also distinguishes between local and universal saints, but does not know such terminology.

118
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 There is no formal difference in terminology between saints and blessed.

119
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 However, by analogy taken from the Catholic tradition, many Orthodox believe that Augustine is not a saint who is venerated in Orthodoxy.

120
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 Second, in addition, righteous people who are revered in popular piety,

121
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 but are not formally canonized by the Church, are often called blessed.

122
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 This is modern terminology.

123
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 However, by the logic of anachronism and appropriation, it is often applied to Augustine.

124
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 One more question.

125
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 Blessed, in the proper sense in Orthodoxy, are the saints who have been canonized by the Church

126
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 and are revered at the universal level as fools for Christ's sake.

127
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 In Orthodox ideology, it is generally accepted that holy fools voluntarily assumed the appearance of madness and dementia.

128
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 They have abandoned the full use of their rationality in their mental facilities, faculties,

129
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 in order to acquire humility and avoid praise and pride.

130
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 Although neither Augustine nor, for instance, Saint Jerome is also called blessed in the Orthodox tradition,

131
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 they were ever perceived as holy fools.

132
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 Calling them blessed helps to take their theologian legacy with some skepticism.

133
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 Automatically, if you say Saint Augustine is only blessed people,

134
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 start thinking about those fools in Christ who were a little bit strange people

135
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 and didn't do and didn't practice theology.

136
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 It is very difficult to enter discussion because as soon as they hear this notion of being blessed,

137
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 they stop reflection on the theological meanings and teachings of Augustine.

138
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 This is some kind of semantic anachronism that also works.

139
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 It is important to note that the very name blessed in relation to Augustine in Orthodoxy is a trace of deep archaism.

140
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 The fact is that the name of Augustine has appeared in various legends about saints over the centuries.

141
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 It is found in ancient editions of the Psalter.

142
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 However, such mention of him has always been abstract.

143
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 In the strict sense of the word, neither Augustine nor, for instance, Jerome were known in the Orthodox world.

144
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 The name of both was absent from the Orthodox liturgical calendar.

145
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 Theologian and mystic reformer of piety and Eucharistic life of Greek Orthodoxy,

146
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 Nicodemus the Agile-Wright, supplemented the liturgical calendar and added the names of Augustine and Jerome to it,

147
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 but it was in the beginning of the 19th century.

148
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 It doesn't mean anything because the Orthodox liturgical calendar at that time was simply incomplete.

149
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 But some people think that this is the main proof that Augustine is somebody who is not considered a saint in the Orthodox world.

150
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 Moreover, the very date of memory of Saint Augustine was chosen arbitrarily.

151
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 June 15 does not have any connection with the biography of the saints.

152
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 Probably there was an abbot on the Mount Athos in Greece who celebrated his birthday or something else like this.

153
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 And that's why they put the memory of Saint Augustine on the same day.

154
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 The archaic Tito blast is a consequence of such acceptance into the calendar without any official reception or theological reflection.

155
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 It is interesting that in modern Greek Orthodoxy, Augustine is sometimes called Eros, sacred.

156
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 That is how saints are called in the Greek tradition, saints whose memory is especially important for the Church.

157
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 For instance, John Chrysostom is called sacred, and his veneration in Eastern Orthodoxy is a long-standing and extremely important tradition.

158
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 Here we have three authors I prepared, analyzing the role of Saint Augustine.

159
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 Here I would like to put the picture of Nicodemus Agiorite, who put the name of Augustine into the liturgical calendar.

160
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 He was a very interesting theologian. He was also a missionary ascetic.

161
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 He was one of the pioneers of frequent communion, because before him in Greek Orthodoxy,

162
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 they got communion maybe once a year, once in some months, during Easter maybe, but he was a pioneer of continuous communion.

163
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 And that's very interesting that he put the name.

164
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 And he was also one of the publishers and authors of the Philokalia edition in Greek language.

165
00:19:50,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 So it's very interesting that he got in touch with the memory of Saint Augustine.

166
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 And now, what I would like to mention.

167
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 Throughout its history, the Orthodox tradition has existed in specific contexts.

168
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 The main factors that radically changed the mode of existence of Orthodoxy were the revolution in Russia in 1917,

169
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 the Aegean Minor disaster, that's in the year 20 of the 20th century,

170
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 Pan-Arabism, and the beginning of the collapse of Levantine Christianity.

171
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 In the 20th century, Orthodox Christianity underwent enormous changes.

172
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 I would identify these three factors.

173
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 As a result of the Bolshevik revolution in Russia, not only the monarchy fell,

174
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 but also the period of Orthodox statehood ended.

175
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 The Orthodox political system, which theologians call the Constantinian period,

176
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 we saw the icon with some emperors having the Holy Cross,

177
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 it was the best image of what we call the Constantinian period in the church history,

178
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 has become a thing of the past.

179
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 As a result of the subsequent civil war, millions of Orthodox Christians found themselves abroad

180
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 and began a new life in the countries of the Western world.

181
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 The second factor was the so-called Aegean Minor catastrophe,

182
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 when, as a result of the Greek-Turkish war, there was an exchange of populations between Turkey and Greece.

183
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 The collapse of the Ottoman Empire resulted in the displacement of millions of Orthodox Greeks towards Greece.

184
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 Since the latter could not accept such a number of immigrants, many of them moved to North America.

185
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 And it is how a huge Orthodox diaspora arose in the Western world.

186
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 Finally, the collapse of the colonial system, the emergence of the ideology of Pan-Arabism

187
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 and Arab nationalism also contributed to the fact that numerous Orthodox Christians,

188
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 who had previously lived for centuries in the Middle East, particularly in Egypt,

189
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 were forced to leave their places of former residence.

190
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 This is how a new era was formed, when the Orthodox world began to come into close contact with the Western world.

191
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 As often happens in globalization processes, the question of self-identification has arisen.

192
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 It was a gradual process. As a symbolic starting point,

193
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 I would like to indicate the expulsion of Russian intellectuals from Russia by Lenin.

194
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 And that was for the first time in history that Orthodox intellectuals found themselves

195
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 in a completely Roman Catholic or Protestant environment.

196
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 An intense process of reflection began.

197
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 The question of how, in fact, Orthodoxy differs from Western Christianity has acquired a particularly extreme actuality.

198
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 To summarize, we can briefly outline what happened at that time.

199
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 Orthodox began to be aware of their belonging to the Church.

200
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 According to the text of the Creed, it was one holy Catholic and apostolic Church.

201
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 However, Western Christians could say the same about themselves.

202
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 It was necessary to find such a special characteristic to identify one's own tradition.

203
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 And this one was Church of the Fathers.

204
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 What means Church of the Fathers?

205
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 If we go to the Ecumenical Councils, we can find a canon from the Fifth Ecumenical Council, 553,

206
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 where it is said, "We follow in everything the Holy Fathers and teachers of the Holy Church of God,

207
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 that is, Athanasius, Hilary, Basil, Gregory the Theologian, Gregory of Nyssa, Ambrose, Theophilus,

208
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 John Chrysostom, Cyril, Augustine, Proclus, Leo.

209
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 And we accept everything that is written, and they explain about the right faith and the condemnation of heretics."

210
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 Here we see that Augustine and Leo represent Western Christianity.

211
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 The other fathers mostly the Eastern one.

212
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 It is very important that the name Augustine is mentioned in this ancient canon,

213
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 and in some way it becomes an obligation to have respect towards Saint Augustine.

214
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 But why he is mentioned in this context is unclear,

215
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 because Saint Augustine was not known in the Orthodox Christianity.

216
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 And that's why it is important to see how some Orthodox theologians treat Augustine,

217
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 what they say about him.

218
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 First, I took one of the Serbian and Russian theologians, Ambrose Pogodin.

219
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 It's very important that he got this double Orthodox origin from Serbia and France,

220
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 and also served in different countries.

221
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 In his article on Saint Augustine, called "Orthodox Church and Blessed Augustine,"

222
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 Ambrose Pogodin outlines his perception of Augustine.

223
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 In doing so, he responds to the harsh criticism of the theology of Augustine,

224
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 which was carried out by certain representatives of the Greek Orthodox conservative circles of the 20th century.

225
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 It is characteristic that already in the title of his article, Ambrose calls Augustine "blessed."

226
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 This means that he is not ready to equate Augustine with other ancient fathers of the Church,

227
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 who are usually, as I said, called "saints."

228
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 According to Ambrose, the Greek theologian Michael Atskou calls Augustine

229
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 "the father of all heretics," the cause of Roman Catholic and Protestant errors.

230
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 He also believes that Augustine is not one of the Orthodox saints,

231
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 and Ambrose Pogodin tries to respond to him.

232
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 The first issue that Pogodin considers is Augustine's teaching on grace and predestination.

233
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 In doing so, he immediately refers his reader to the work of Seraphim Rose,

234
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 another Orthodox theologian of the past century.

235
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 At the same time, he notes that he intends to correct, to complement Rose,

236
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 but also to distance himself from him.

237
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 Ambrose interprets Augustine's teaching on grace as follows.

238
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 "After the fall, man needs grace. However, he can reject grace.

239
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 Grace strengthens the saints in their heroism," states Pogodin.

240
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 In essence, predestination and foreknowledge of God in Augustine's understanding coincide.

241
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 Very strange conclusion, because we know that this distinction between predestination and prescience

242
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 is one of the most important things in the grace theology of Saint Augustine.

243
00:27:51,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 It was also very typical after the fall, the whole development of dogma in the whole Western traditions,

244
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 and we know about it, but he apparently didn't want to know about it.

245
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 It's a very special methodological, it's an emanatical attitude.

246
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 At the same time, Pogodin believes that the Roman Catholic Church rejects Augustine's teaching on grace.

247
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 Why? Since Catholic ethics is built on a person's acquisition of merit before God,

248
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 and because John Calvin subsequently taught about predestination.

249
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 So probably Ambrose Pogodin was a very good specialist in church fathers,

250
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 but he didn't study Western tradition.

251
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 That's why he came to such conclusions that Catholics did reject Saint Augustine,

252
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 and that John Calvin is right, he taught about predestination.

253
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 Ambrose refers to his colleague, Seraphim Rose, who argued that Augustine's teaching was orthodox,

254
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 but it was characterized by exaggerated language, which gave rise to incorrect interpretations.

255
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 Pogodin makes a short excursion into the research of Russian theologians of the 19th century on Augustine,

256
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 and concludes that the Greek fathers of the church were dogmatics,

257
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 while Blessed Augustine is an excellent moralist.

258
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 Very interesting remark, because I would say Pelagius was a moralist, but not said Augustine.

259
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 Nevertheless, for Ambrose Pogodin, Augustine was a moralist.

260
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 That's very important, because such clichés are still alive.

261
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 If you speak with an orthodox Christian who knows about Saint Augustine,

262
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 he will probably respond the same thing.

263
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 The second question of Augustine's theology which Pogodin discusses

264
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 is the famous question of the procession of the Holy Spirit.

265
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 Here, his answer is, "Augustine's doctrine of the Trinity is not formulated with precision.

266
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 It is incomplete."

267
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 Sometimes I read Augustine's work on the Trinitate, on Trinity,

268
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 and I doubt whether it is incomplete.

269
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 We see this hermeneutical attitude, which is a very special one.

270
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 Unlike the doctrine of grace and predestination,

271
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 where Ambrose simply puts his own point of view into Augustine's mouth,

272
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 it is not possible for him to do the same on the issue of the procession of the Holy Spirit.

273
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 Subsequent tradition, and most importantly, the Carolingian theologians themselves,

274
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 refer to Augustine in this matter.

275
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 It is too obvious.

276
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 That's why Pogodin quotes photos of Constantinople, Archbishop of Constantinople in the 9th century,

277
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 who says that works of Augustine were probably falsified.

278
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 He didn't teach about filioque or about the double procession of the Holy Spirit

279
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 from the father and from the son, but his works were falsified.

280
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 It's an interesting opinion, which matched probably for that time,

281
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 but Pogodin, he is a theologian from the 20th century, and he still repeats this opinion.

282
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 Another theologian about whom I would like to speak is a Greek theologian from Boston,

283
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 George Papadimitriou.

284
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 What is interesting about him, already the title of his article,

285
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 "St. Augustine in the Greek Orthodox Tradition."

286
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 He rightly points out that within the framework of a single Orthodox Christianity,

287
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 various independent traditions have already formed,

288
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 therefore the theology of each must be studied separately.

289
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 If we speak in detail, we have to speak about St. Augustine in Greek Orthodox Tradition,

290
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 Serbian, in Russian, maybe there is also a small Polish Orthodox Church with its own theologians,

291
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 but we have no time.

292
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 Anyway, we see that in his article he already points to it,

293
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 that St. Augustine in the Greek Orthodox Tradition.

294
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 Papadimitriou consistently examines the place of Augustine in the works of those authors

295
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 who, in his opinion, can obviously be considered as a kind of topoi of Greek Orthodox history.

296
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 This is Photios of Constantinople, we spoke about him,

297
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 and Gregory Palamas, teacher of grace in the Orthodox Tradition,

298
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 and also that this new personality in this Augustinian study in the Orthodox world,

299
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 the patriarch of Constantinople, the first Ottoman patriarch, Gennadius Holarius.

300
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 After this, he moves on to the modern period.

301
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 The conclusion of this review is also quite characteristic,

302
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 and the periodization is very typical.

303
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 For instance,

304
00:33:43,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 he also speaks about Marcus of Ephesus and the Union of Florence.

305
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 What is important, speaking about the Council of Florence,

306
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 Papadimitriou admits that Augustine was a pro-Latin theologian.

307
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 And in this moment, some kind of new confession is emerging,

308
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 because here Augustine's authority is very limited by Papadimitriou,

309
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 and he says if his theology, or if Augustine in his theology,

310
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 differs in some way from others,

311
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 Augustine had to be subordinated to the general teaching of the Orthodox Church.

312
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 We see this balance between West and East,

313
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 which is very important to understand how Orthodox theology speaks about Saint Augustine.

314
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 Apparently, we have here, under the pen of Papadimitriou,

315
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 some kind of instrumentalization of Augustine,

316
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 characteristic of all subsequent Orthodoxy.

317
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 There is no reception of his theology,

318
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 but a conditional reference to it is necessary,

319
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 since it proves the utterance of the Orthodox to patristic authorities.

320
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 Speaking about the role of Augustine in the modern Greek Orthodox tradition,

321
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 Papadimitriou also mentions that it was Nicodemus the Agiorite

322
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 who included the name of Augustine in the liturgical calendar of saints.

323
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 The name of Nicodemus, as I said, is associated with the revival of religious life,

324
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 and Papadimitriou also says that Nicodemus wrote about Augustine with all prize-worthy epithets.

325
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 Papadimitriou lists several authors who have called for the integration of Augustine

326
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 into the life and theology of the Orthodox Church today.

327
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 He also writes that some modern Greek theologians subjected Augustine to harsh criticism.

328
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 Thus, one involuntarily gets the impression that Orthodox piety,

329
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 Nicodemus, and the monastic tradition obliges to respect the authority of Augustine,

330
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 while Orthodox theology, as theology, Romanides and other theologians,

331
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 characteristic of the modern Greek Christian traditions,

332
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:35,000
 judges Augustine on the basis of their own criteria, methodology, and hermeneutics.

333
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 The question arises about the criteria.

334
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 Should Augustine's theology be taken as a matrix for conclusions

335
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 about the theology of later times, or vice versa?

336
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 One more theologian, it's very famous in the English-speaking Orthodox world,

337
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 Seraphim Ross.

338
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 He was very knowledgeable about modern Western philosophy and culture.

339
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 His perception of Augustine is extremely interesting.

340
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 He dedicated a separate small monograph to Augustine.

341
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 The reception of Seraphim is important because it is not just theological treatise,

342
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 but a kind of exercise in piety.

343
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 Ross consistently strives to remind his modern Orthodox reader

344
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 of the good name of Augustine.

345
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 The audience he was addressing was Western.

346
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 During the Iron Curtain period, his work simply could not be accessible

347
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 to readers in most Orthodox countries.

348
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 Unlike Omros Pogodin, who was a scholar in patristics and translator

349
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 of the Church Fathers, Seraphim Ross obviously mastered

350
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 contemporary philosophical issues.

351
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 He studied modern religiosity, sects, wrote on philosophical issues,

352
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 and was keenly interested in everything happening in the world.

353
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 This was to give his work on Augustine and Orthodoxy special interest.

358
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 in which Ross studies Augustine?

359
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,000
 There are the times of forties of Constantinople.

360
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 We have the Union of Florence, Mark of Ephesus,

361
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:44,000
 and also we have some modern issues.

362
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:51,000
 It is very interesting that all three authors speak about Nicodemus

363
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:56,000
 from the Holy Mountain.

365
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:12,000

 to speak about necessity to venerate Augustine

367
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 in their particular private piety.

377
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 We know that later tradition after Augustine

378
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:17,000
 called teaching about grace and freedom, called "Synergia," "Semi-Pelagian."

379
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 According to some scientists, this happened quite late.

380
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 It was probably Martin Luther who first discovered

381
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 that this doctrine contradicted Augustine's theology.

382
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
 Seraphim Rose doesn't know about it.

383
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 He doesn't know probably that Luther called it "Semi-Pelagianism"

384
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
 and accused the modern Catholic Church of holding it,

385
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 that is, in his opinion, of being in heresy.

386
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 This brief information is given here only as an excursion.

387
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 Rose most likely did not know about this issue.

388
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,000
 In his argument, Seraphim Rose contrasts John Cassian and Augustine.

389
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 He considers the theology of Augustine to be orthodox,

390
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
 but his teaching one-sided and close to error.

391
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
 To justify Augustine, Rose argues that his theology

392
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,000
 was too conditioned by personal experience.

393
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:19,000
 And St. Augustine would have responded by the experience of grace,

394
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
 not personal experience.

395
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,000
 At the same time, Rose argues that Augustine was too Western

396
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
 and therefore wanted to subordinate the doctrine of God

397
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 to the laws of human logic.

398
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
 In essence, it seems that the American orthodox theologian,

399
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
 Seraphim Rose, is trying to justify Augustine,

400
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
 but does not know how to do it.

401
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:50,000
 He is too different if he is compared with the Eastern Orthodox Church fathers.

402
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
 On the last pages of his work, he says that thanks to the works

403
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,000
 of John Maximovich, we have him here,

404
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 a revival of the veneration of Augustine began in Orthodox piety.

405
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:09,000
 At one time, biblical scholarship in the 19th century

406
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,000
 started speaking of the contrast between the historical Jesus

407
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
 and the Christ of dogma.

408
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,000
 Modern orthodoxy, modern orthodox theology, in fact,

409
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:29,000
 reproduces this hymn, this example in relation to St. Augustine.

410
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,000
 It accepts and honors Augustine in piety

411
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,000
 and distances itself from Augustine in theology.

412
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:46,000
 Nevertheless, John Maximovich, John of Shanghai,

413
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:52,000
 because he was bishop for Russian people during 15 years in Shanghai,

414
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,000
 wrote a worship liturgy to St. Augustine.

415
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,000
 Here we have a small text dedicated to Augustine.

416
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
 "Let us praise the great Augustine,

417
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
 "the divine hierarch of Christ's church and wise guide,

418
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,000
 "renowned theologian of the city on high, city on high, city of God,

419
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
 "a lover of prayer and a pillar of repentance."

420
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
 We have this ascetical approach to St. Augustine,

421
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:23,000
 very special because characteristic for the Orthodox tradition.

422
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:29,000
 And one more thing, we know that around 720,

423
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:35,000
 Augustine's body was transferred to the Lombard capital of Paris in northern Italy.

424
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,000
 It was placed in the church where already the relics

425
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:44,000
 of the philosopher Severinus Boetius were located.

426
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:52,000
 And we started a tradition, new one, to celebrate once per year

427
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:58,000
 a common liturgy, Eucharistic prayer, Orthodox service,

428
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
 of all Orthodox clergy named after St. Augustine.

429
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:08,000
 Last time there were four, a metropolitan from Ukraine,

430
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:14,000
 a priest monk from Russia, an archimandrite from South Italy, and me.

431
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:20,000
 So we hope that we start with piety and we come to a recognition

432
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:26,000
 of the merits of St. Augustine also in Orthodox theology

433
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
 and to help Orthodox people to know him better.

434
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:37,000
 First of all, because he is one of the greatest theologians of all times

435
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:42,000
 and his teachings were not known for Orthodox tradition,

436
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:48,000
 and I think it's very important that we finally meet him

437
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:54,000
 in our post-modern era and can enrich our own understanding

438
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
 of Christian ethics and dogma. Thank you very much.

440
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:13,000
 [silence]

441
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:18,000
 Thank you, Dr. Sokolowski, for this very informative lecture.

442
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,000
 I've been enriched by knowledge of Orthodox history and liturgy,

443
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,000
 together with an account of how Augustine has been received

444
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
 in the Orthodox tradition.

445
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:34,000
 You began by discussing the different senses of the term "Orthodoxy."

446
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:41,000
 You then explained why Augustine is called "Blessed" rather than "Saint."

447
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:46,000
 You introduced the major historical events which led Orthodoxy

448
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,000
 to embrace the identity being the Church of the Fathers.

449
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:57,000
 You argued that having been named in the Act of the Fifth Ecumenical Council

450
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,000
 should guarantee Augustine's place in Orthodox theology.

451
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:07,000
 You also named the Orthodox thinkers who have been engaged in the study of Augustine,

452
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:13,000
 but regretted to find that these attempts have so far failed to do justice

453
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
 to the true worth of Augustine's thought.

454
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:23,000
 Having outlined these key points, there are a few areas into which

455
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
 I'd like to make further inquiry.

456
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,000
 The first is about the place of the Saints and the Fathers

457
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,000
 in the liturgy and theology of the Orthodox Church.

458
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:42,000
 To my understanding, liturgy and theology are absolutely inseparable in Orthodoxy,

459
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:50,000
 given that both genuine faith and Orthodox theology are embedded in the Byzantine Rite.

460
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:56,000
 Although the Rite is celebrated in the vernaculars of the different peoples,

461
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:01,000
 it goes back to the same authors who are Saints and Fathers of the Church.

462
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:08,000
 Here, I think, lies the significance of the Saints and Fathers in Orthodox life.

463
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:15,000
 I'd like to inquire further into the area of Sainthood in Orthodoxy.

464
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:23,000
 In your lecture, you suggested the reason for Augustine being called "Blessed" rather than "Saint"

465
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:32,000
 is due to a complex web of factors involving a paradoxical mix of archaism and anachronism.

466
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:38,000
 You mentioned that there's no formal difference between the terms "Blessed" and "Saint".

467
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:43,000
 Also, you brought to our attention that the title used for Augustine is somewhat different

468
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
 in the different Orthodox communities.

469
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:51,000
 For whereas, he is usually referred to as "Blessed" in Russian Orthodoxy,

470
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:56,000
 he is called "Sacred" in the Greek Church.

471
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
 My question is twofold.

472
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:06,000
 Is the idea of Sainthood in Orthodoxy something subject to local variations?

473
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:12,000
 If that is the case, how does this square with the practice in the liturgy of the Orthodox Church

474
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:18,000
 where lists of Saints are read out during the Divine Liturgy?

475
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:27,000
 I understand the liturgy is common and shared among the Orthodox communities

476
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,000
 in different geographical locations.

477
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:39,000
 Also, I'd like to understand whether the idea of Sainthood in Orthodoxy is a greater concept,

478
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:48,000
 as in whether a father may be more authoritative than another father.

479
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:59,000
 And if that is the case, does the degree of authority depend on the place of a particular father,

480
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:04,000
 how it is occupied in the liturgy?

481
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:13,000
 For example, like John Chrysostom, he has got a Divine Liturgy that is named after him.

482
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:21,000
 Would that for some reason mean that he is more authoritative than some other fathers

483
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
 who are mentioned otherwise?

484
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:33,000
 Coming from a Protestant background, in which denominationalism is a key phenomenon,

485
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:39,000
 I think Protestants can learn a lot from the Orthodox understanding of communion

486
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:45,000
 founded upon unity in liturgical practice.

487
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:53,000
 My second area of interest is about the turn to logistic heritage.

488
00:49:53,000 --> 00:50:05,000
 You have mentioned a few names of Orthodox authors who have done study on Augustine.

489
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:16,000
 You told us about Ambrose Pagodin, Seraphim Rose, George Papadimitriou, and John Maksimovich.

490
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:29,000
 It seems that in the last century, there has been a period of renewal in the study of patristics in various quarters.

491
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:39,000
 In Roman Catholicism, there was the Fresou-Simon movement, or I guess it should be "resourcement" in English,

492
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:45,000
 that emphasised Church reform through a return to patristic sources.

493
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:52,000
 Similarly, in Protestantism, there are theologians like T.F. Torrance and Colin Gunton

494
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:58,000
 who were engaged in retrieving patristic resources in their doctrinal works.

495
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:05,000
 One of the Fresou-Simon theologians, Henri de Lubac, goes so far as to say that

496
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:16,000
 "Each time in our West, that Christian renewal has flourished under the sign of the Fathers."

497
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:23,000
 Being certain that these efforts in returning to patristic heritage have been as rewarding,

498
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
 if not more so in the Eastern Church as in the West,

499
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:34,000
 I am interested in learning about the fruits borne by embracing the identity of the Church of the Father.

500
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:41,000
 My question is, what does the Orthodox self-understanding being the Church of the Fathers mean

501
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:49,000
 in terms of practical life and piety on the one hand, and output in theological writings on the other?

502
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:57,000
 I've been interested in looking at this more broadly, going beyond Augustine,

503
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:07,000
 so that like how the Fathers have been appropriated in general in Orthodoxy during the last century.

504
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:17,000
 Finally, I'd like to return to Augustine, more specifically about the place of Augustine in an East-West dialogue.

505
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:23,000
 In the description of this lecture, you have raised the question,

506
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:32,000
 "Is it generally legitimate to divide the representative of patristic into East and West?"

507
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:37,000
 I'd like to hear a little bit more from you on this question.

508
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:46,000
 Responding to the common way of dividing patristic Trinitarian doctrines into Eastern and Western formulations,

509
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:52,000
 Lewis Ayres has demonstrated that such an approach cannot be maintained.

510
00:52:52,000 --> 00:53:01,000
 And in your lecture, you have alluded to the relevance of Augustine's theology to Orthodox Christianity.

511
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,000
 The question I'd like to pursue is this.

512
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:15,000
 By singling out Augustine in this lecture, presumably because he is often regarded as the most influential among the Western Fathers,

513
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:29,000
 what would you anticipate to be the unique contribution that he could make to Orthodox Christianity by a more vigorous study into his thoughts?

514
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:35,000
 I think I've raised some questions to keep this dialogue going for a while.

515
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,000
 I look forward to being enlightened by your response.

516
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:45,000
 Before then, I'd like to once again express my gratitude to you, Dr. Sokolovsky,

517
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:55,000
 for coming up with this very meaningful topic on Augustine of Hippo and the Western Fathers in Orthodox theology and piety.

518
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:16,000
 Thank you so much, Dr. Sokolovsky, for giving us such an inspiring lecture and Andrew's response.

519
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:27,000
 In order to deepen our dialogue between East and West, I would like to invite our two speakers to come forward again

520
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:38,000
 so that we will first have a dialogue session between these two speakers before we open the floor for their Q&A session.

521
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
 So, please come forward.

522
00:54:40,000 --> 00:55:05,000
 [Pause]

523
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:23,000
 So, after Andrew's response, maybe Dr. Sokolovsky, do you have some immediate response you would like to give or you would like to answer Andrew's questions?

524
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:36,000
 Yes, maybe it's very important that you mention that this revival of patristics in Orthodox Christianity was not alone.

525
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:50,000
 It was linked with the same revival of patristics in the Catholic Church and also in the Protestant churches and community.

526
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:56,000
 We Orthodox often forget about it, we don't know about it.

527
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:03,000
 Also, if we speak about liturgical renewal, that's the same story.

528
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:26,000
 And that was the immediate fruit or result of the meeting of different Christians from different denominations, which happened after these three crucial immigration processes in the Western and Eastern world.

529
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,000
 It's very important, thank you very much.

530
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:54,000
 What is maybe typical for the Orthodox tradition is that discovering the role of the fathers, Orthodox theologians start speaking or start making or asking who is the church father?

531
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,000
 What is the era of the fathers?

532
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:07,000
 And they came to the conclusion that the era of the fathers of the church never ends.

533
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:15,000
 And that's maybe very typical or the crucial point of the Orthodox understanding of fathers.

534
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:33,000
 It means that every time, every moment, every moment in human history, in every moment, Orthodox Church has to be able to produce new fathers of the church.

535
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:50,000
 From an hermeneutical point of view, it's problematic because we know more or less the patristic era stops with the emergence or with the arrival of Islam.

536
00:57:50,000 --> 00:58:00,000
 Why? I didn't find any sufficient explanation personally, I think, because the whole world view was broken.

537
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:17,000
 The fathers were sure that a complete Christianization of our world started and soon or later the whole world will be Christian.

538
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:27,000
 And then, in that human history follows a logical step towards this Christian, pan-Christian unity.

539
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:38,000
 And then suddenly a new religion emerges and starts conquering new faithful territories.

540
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:44,000
 And especially Eastern Christianity has to resign from all these plans.

541
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:50,000
 And I think that was the end of the patristic era.

542
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:57,000
 A very interesting question about saints, because for me personally it's very important.

543
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:08,000
 As the pandemic began, I had no opportunity as all of us to do academic work offline, so I started writing on saints.

544
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:21,000
 And it seemed to me that I was sure I knew a lot about saints and I discovered that I knew quite a few about saints.

545
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:33,000
 And one of those saints was Saint Augustine. I knew about him, but his personal approach to holiness in our world was very interesting

546
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:38,000
 because he also lived in a very critical moment of human history.

547
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:46,000
 I discovered a lot of very precious and rare saints, for instance, Martyrs of Alexandria,

548
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,000
 who died during the pandemics in the middle of the 3rd century.

549
00:59:50,000 --> 01:00:03,000
 As Bishop Dionysius the Great of Alexandria, he helped sick people during the pandemic and all pagans escaped the city.

550
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:07,000
 And many Christians died because of this social work.

551
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:16,000
 And Dionysius of Alexandria canonized immediately all those martyrs, as he called them, of Alexandria.

552
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
 A very interesting example.

553
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:28,000
 You mentioned liturgy and sainthood. We used to do only two Eucharistic prayers in our tradition.

554
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:34,000
 One is called St. John Chrysostom, the second one, Basil the Great or Basil of Caesarea.

555
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,000
 They lived in the 4th and 5th century.

556
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:50,000
 Actually, some scholars think that both texts were written by John and Basil, but it's not sure.

557
01:00:50,000 --> 01:01:01,000
 Some scholars think that both texts were named because they came from their episcopal cities.

558
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:08,000
 So, from Antioch of John Chrysostom and Caesarea from Caesarea Basil the Great.

559
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:12,000
 What does it mean for Orthodox tradition?

560
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:24,000
 This link or connection between theology, because Eucharistic prayer is always about theology.

561
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:30,000
 It's very theological. It's addressed to the Father, to the Son, to the Holy Spirit.

562
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:38,000
 It's a very theological work, but it is linked and deeply connected with concrete saints.

563
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:44,000
 So, we don't imagine to pray with words by some unknown theologian.

564
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:51,000
 We need some approach to a concrete human holiness.

565
01:01:51,000 --> 01:02:00,000
 If you ask me about St. Augustine and his possible contribution to Orthodox theology,

566
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,000
 I think it's very important to speak about grace.

567
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:14,000
 For sure, we use the word grace in Orthodox tradition, but the meaning is completely different.

568
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:30,000
 For us, grace means ascetical work and results of this ascetical work in our personal life for perfection and holiness.

569
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:36,000
 Grace is deeply connected with liturgical life and personal life and prayer,

570
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:43,000
 but we don't know about the redemptive meaning of grace.

571
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:54,000
 What is crucial, if we read St. Paul, is his understanding of the whole history of salvation.

572
01:02:54,000 --> 01:03:01,000
 Grace also means Jesus Christ given to us for the salvation of the whole world.

573
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:07,000
 It also may be political theology because after Constantine the Great,

574
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:17,000
 Eastern Christianity started being connected or linked with the Empire.

575
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:27,000
 Why? Because many authors, but the most important was, I think, Eusebius of Caesarea.

576
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:39,000
 He was quite sure that in this Christianization of biography of Constantine the Great,

577
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:47,000
 his baptism on the dead bed and so on, was given a great blessing not only to the church,

578
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:51,000
 but also to the history of the world.

579
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:58,000
 And this hermeneutical approach goes on. It was never questioned.

580
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:06,000
 And Augustine was outside of all those stories. Eusebius was very close to the Emperor.

581
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:11,000
 He knew him personally. Augustine was in his native Africa.

582
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:23,000
 He got 2,000 bishops at that time. And if we take a patriarch or a bishop of Caesarea as a basil,

583
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:30,000
 they were very highly positioned. And Augustine was between first and second thousand of bishops.

584
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:39,000
 And he didn't care about the Empire. For him, what was important was the salvation of his flock.

585
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:48,000
 And that's why in his De Civitae Dei, he said, "It's okay. It's a very happy event that the Empire became Christian,

586
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:56,000
 but one day maybe it will not be Christian anymore. We have to stay and to be Christian."

587
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:07,000
 And I think we need this more skeptical approach in our own understanding of, I would call it, political theology.

588
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:19,000
 And Augustine is, in this sense, among fathers. He is unique who could provide us such an answer. Thank you.

589
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:27,000
 Thank you. So, Andrew, do you have any follow-up questions on this area?

590
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:46,000
 Yes. Thank you for your response. It's very helpful to know that the fathers in Orthodoxy,

591
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:53,000
 you have the idea of, like usually we think about patristic, we think about endpoints,

592
01:05:53,000 --> 01:06:00,000
 but you mentioned that the Church should, there should be fathers at all times.

593
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:15,000
 So, I would like to follow up on this. I think the fathers' place in Orthodoxy is quite significant to the self-understanding of the Orthodox Church.

594
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:33,000
 You mentioned that in the last century, there has been a few momentous historical events which impacted the Orthodox Church quite significantly.

595
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:46,000
 You mentioned that the world was supposed to become Christian, but then all of a sudden, it had to fight for its own existence.

596
01:06:46,000 --> 01:07:00,000
 So, did these events in any way change the self-understanding of the Orthodox Christian, and also the way they think about the fathers?

597
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:07,000
 That's my, that's a point I would like to follow up on.

598
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:16,000
 I think that Orthodox understanding of the fathers became much more personalistic and ascetic.

599
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:24,000
 So, first fathers were also, first of all, were teachers of dogmatics and true theologians.

600
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:33,000
 After, they started being more personal saints in some kind.

601
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:37,000
 It was a process of methodologization of fathers.

602
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:45,000
 You mentioned also that St. Augustine is very different if you compare him to other fathers.

603
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:49,000
 Why? Because his biography is very known.

604
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:54,000
 Even some moments, we can restore it day by day.

605
01:07:54,000 --> 01:08:03,000
 But not only him is very known, but also if we read Gregory of Nazianzus, he is very personal.

606
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:15,000
 Sometimes he is happy, he calls, "Oh, my Trinity, I'm happy defending my Orthodox faith in Constantinople."

607
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:27,000
 Sometimes he is very depressive and he quotes Greek ancient pagan authors and he forgets about his theological roots.

608
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:42,000
 I think Orthodox people, after this huge reform, I would say, after the arrival of Islam,

609
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:53,000
 they start rethinking the role of the fathers and they start also forgetting about their personal dimension.

610
01:08:53,000 --> 01:09:03,000
 Fathers became figures on the firmament of the Orthodox faith,

611
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:17,000
 but not concrete personalities who needed also analysis and also chronology, biography, personal approach.

612
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:29,000
 I think this revival of the patristic theology was also due to the fact that even if the Orthodox world was very separated from the rest of the world,

613
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:35,000
 academic theology, especially in the Russian Empire, was very high level.

614
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:43,000
 I don't know if you know, but even theological teaching was given in Latin language.

615
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:54,000
 Imagine people praying Church Slavonics, speaking Russian dialects, you have la noblesse, nobility in Russian Empire, speaking French,

616
01:09:54,000 --> 01:10:01,000
 and priests and theologians doing theology in Latin language.

617
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:11,000
 It means that theological educational parkour was the same as in the West, but contents were different.

618
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:18,000
 It was so difficult to understand that nobody cared about it.

619
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:28,000
 I think this discovery of the fathers in the 20th century was very important because we finally started studying ourselves

620
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
 and understand that we are different.

621
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:36,000
 It's not bad or good, but difference is a gift given by God.

622
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:43,000
 I think that was the most important meaning of the patristic revival in the 20th century.

623
01:10:43,000 --> 01:11:07,000
 So, from your original script, I have read some message from your speech that the Orthodox tradition has skipped some historical moments,

624
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:20,000
 which is very important to the Western tradition, like the Renaissance, Reformation, Enlightenment, and all these important historical moments.

625
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:30,000
 So, do you think this is a theological pro or a theological con for the Orthodox tradition?

626
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:47,000
 For many who become Orthodox in our time, it's a huge pro because you have a church which didn't compromise itself with today's world.

627
01:11:47,000 --> 01:12:00,000
 Also, in history, it's very easy to be Orthodox and if you hear inquisition, no idea, persecution of heretics, we didn't do it, and so on.

628
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:12,000
 But when people are already Orthodox, they start questioning about philosophical issues, how to deal with the Reformation,

629
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:27,000
 with all those immense themes and topics and challenges we live, we don't always have appropriate questions because we didn't have this experience.

630
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:36,000
 That's why I think a communicable dialogue is so important, because we can enrich each other and learn from each other.

631
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:50,000
 We cannot in a moment leave all those things we didn't leave, like Enlightenment, Renaissance, Reformation, modernity, maybe post-modernity,

632
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:58,000
 but let's leave it together in order not to repeat our errors before.

633
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:09,000
 Well, we are coming from evangelical tradition, so Protestant, basically.

634
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:17,000
 So for the Protestant tradition, the scripture is very important. We have scripture principles, sola scriptura.

635
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:27,000
 So compared with the Orthodox Church, it seems to me that the church fathers is very important to your tradition.

636
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:37,000
 So in your opinion, or in your observation, what is the place of scripture in the Orthodox tradition compared with the church fathers?

637
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:48,000
 It's a very important question. As I teach in theological academy, seminary, dogmatics,

638
01:13:48,000 --> 01:14:01,000
 one of my first questions was, did somebody read the whole Bible? And almost nobody answered yes.

639
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:13,000
 Also, second question, do you read sometimes the fathers? And whom do they quote? Each other or their predecessors?

640
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:21,000
 No. Usually, all their spirituality, theology is in the Bible.

641
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:29,000
 They knew that by heart. The question of how did they interpret it is a different question.

642
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:36,000
 But anyway, all the fathers were deeply rooted in the scripture.

643
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:45,000
 And I think in our Orthodox tradition, it's a huge lack of this immediate approach to the Bible.

644
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:54,000
 We have to read and to re-read it. And still, maybe we lived already a liturgical revival, a patristical revival.

645
01:14:54,000 --> 01:15:00,000
 Maybe let's now start with biblical revival. I think it's important.

646
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:07,000
 So do you expect an Orthodox version of Martin Luther coming up?

647
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:18,000
 Martin Luther was too Augustinian. First we have to study Augustine and then...

648
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:25,000
 Okay, Andrews, do you have other questions for Dr. Zukolowski?

649
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:31,000
 Yeah, I think I have one more question. I know your interest is in ecumenism.

650
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:38,000
 And so I would like to hear more about the work that you have been doing.

651
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:52,000
 Do you see ecumenism as primarily something that can be fulfilled academically or through dialogue?

652
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:59,000
 It's a topic that interested me and I think it's a very important subject too.

653
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:06,000
 The fact that we are having dialogue here, I think, is part of the effort towards Christian union.

654
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:12,000
 So I would like to hear you share about your expertise.

655
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:22,000
 I think we are in a very difficult situation because the ecumenical movement started in the beginning of the 20th century.

656
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:28,000
 It has become very disappointed and weak.

657
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:34,000
 And all those great hopes are not actual anymore.

658
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:43,000
 Why different answers? Maybe because we were in modernity, now in post-modernity.

659
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:46,000
 Maybe difference become too important.

660
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:52,000
 Maybe theological and philosophical dimensions also not so important.

661
01:16:52,000 --> 01:17:00,000
 We have to be in aesthetics and also huge political issue about what we are.

662
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:06,000
 Is it not better to be separated than to be united?

663
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,000
 There is no quest for unity anymore.

664
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:19,000
 And I think it also has its repercussions for the ecumenical movement.

665
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:27,000
 The best example of ecumenism in my personal experience was when I was in a conference in Singapore.

666
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:33,000
 I didn't know that it was a huge conference.

667
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:39,000
 I was sent by Fribourg and I was sure I will meet some Catholics, Orthodox, Protestants.

668
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:44,000
 But I was almost alone in a huge Protestant congregation.

669
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:49,000
 And people I discussed with were Russian Baptists.

670
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:55,000
 They are very conservative, very true Baptists.

671
01:17:55,000 --> 01:18:06,000
 But I discovered that they didn't know at that time enough about their classical Baptist theology.

672
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:14,000
 And I asked, "What do you mean about Trinity, about redemption, grace, baptism?"

673
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:19,000
 And answers in my understanding were not enough good.

674
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:29,000
 So I said, "Guys, you are Baptists. You were born from heaven in your tradition.

675
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:39,000
 Probably you will be always Baptists until you are in heaven where there is no confession in the sense of denomination.

676
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:47,000
 Let me please teach you a little bit about the Johan doctrine."

677
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:58,000
 And I also want other Christians to teach me about the Orthodox faith, tradition, understanding.

678
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:06,000
 And what actually I noticed also studying in a different context in Fribourg,

679
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:15,000
 that I learned a lot about my own tradition from non-Orthodox people, Catholics, Protestants.

680
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:21,000
 The best way to pray I learned from some Protestant Christians.

681
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:27,000
 I mean the best way in the sense of being able to pronounce the word of prayer immediately.

682
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:31,000
 You know, immediately, this immediate way of addressing God.

683
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:38,000
 And I think maybe it's one of the possibilities or hopes for a future ecumenical dialogue,

684
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:45,000
 to share experiences of each other and to understand that we are not perfect.

685
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:57,000
 Let's think about our roots and also go towards the future because Christians in the world are now in minority.

686
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:05,000
 Even in statistics maybe not, but Christian faith was never about statistics.

687
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:23,000
 And let's go very small flock towards a true ecumenical dialogue where we are all different but all together.

688
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:32,000
 Okay, so I think we are now opening the floor to the Q&A session.

689
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:39,000
 So you are most welcome to raise your question to two of our speakers.

690
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:50,000
 So if you have any questions, please come forward and use the mic in the middle of our room.

691
01:20:50,000 --> 01:21:01,000
 And for the sake of time, each one, please raise one question and finish it within a minute.

692
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:18,000
 So we can now start.

693
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:22,000
 Hello, my name is Keen. I teach church history here.

694
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:27,000
 So just broadening your scope a little bit.

695
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:33,000
 First, I'd like to thank you. You are so humble in presenting the Orthodox tradition.

696
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:38,000
 I find that sometimes it's not true in some other Orthodox writers.

697
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
 So very good.

698
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,000
 Secondly, just that's my question.

699
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:52,000
 Actually, in terms of purely population statistics, the Orthodox tradition is in a pretty bad situation.

700
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:57,000
 Russians, Eastern Europeans, they are not reproducing children.

701
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:08,000
 So my question is that in the Orthodox community, do they have a sense like how the church can survive,

702
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:15,000
 the Orthodox church can survive both the decline of the church and the attack of modernity and so forth and so on.

703
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:33,000
 Do they have a sense of crisis facing the church or do they have any discussion how to face the problem of the Orthodox community at large today?

704
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:44,000
 First of all, Orthodoxy is not anymore Orthodoxy in a definite country or somewhere on earth.

705
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:51,000
 But you have everywhere Orthodox communities in the diaspora.

706
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:58,000
 And actually, we speak about 14 Orthodox churches which are independent.

707
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:06,000
 And if you compare it, it's more or less the model of the Anglican communion.

708
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:19,000
 It's not, it wasn't a project, but it's going this direction, being a kind of confederation of churches.

709
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:31,000
 And you have to speak about each tradition differently because in different countries you have different situations.

710
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:44,000
 But I think that we lived the time of persecution during the Soviet past and we were so happy that it ended

711
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:51,000
 that we still not questioned ourselves what will come in the future.

712
01:23:51,000 --> 01:24:06,000
 And Orthodoxy has a very strong identity with culture, ethnicity, history, particular history of its own land, country.

713
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:15,000
 If you want to compare, it's a little bit like Polish Catholicism.

714
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:23,000
 You know, everybody was happy with a lot of people in churches during the Soviet time.

715
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:33,000
 Then John Paul II was the greatest Polish of all times.

716
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:40,000
 Now everything changed, but Polish Catholics are still inside this reality.

717
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:44,000
 I think it's more or less that answer.

718
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:55,000
 But you have also Orthodoxy in the United States, in South America, you have in South Africa,

719
01:24:55,000 --> 01:25:08,000
 strong Greek community, they are more aware of all these challenges we face or we will face.

720
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:12,000
 I think the answer is yes and not.

721
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:23,000
 But not in such a, you know, if you compare with the West, with Catholics or Protestants,

722
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:45,000
 we are still not aware yet of all those new challenges we will face in the coming future.

723
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:49,000
 My name is Cherry. I'm also a church historian.

724
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:56,000
 And thank you so much for Father Sokolowsky's presentation and Andrew's response,

725
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:04,000
 which are both very helpful for us who all claim ourselves as the descendants of the Latin tradition,

726
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:10,000
 while we're having mostly Asian faces, ethically.

727
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:20,000
 But this is a great opportunity for all of us to learn about how the Orthodox community has been receiving Augustine's teaching.

728
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:28,000
 I actually had three questions.

729
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:33,000
 I'm trying to combine two of them.

730
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:48,000
 So did Father Sokolowsky, do you notice any similar negation occurred in some other church fathers

731
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:58,000
 considered as Latin fathers, such as Amboise, Jerome, and perhaps a little bit later, Gregory the Great,

732
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:04,000
 which is related to this question, is that,

733
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:14,000
 do you believe that the primary obstacles in introducing Augustine's teaching in the Orthodox community

734
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:24,000
 is the lack of sainthood or do controversial theological differences play a more significant role?

735
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:33,000
 So what I mean is that because Amboise, Jerome, and perhaps Gregory the Great are the fathers

736
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:44,000
 who did not engage in the controversy of filioque, but Augustine was a very significant one.

737
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:54,000
 Did this actually hinder the popularity of Augustine's teaching a lot in the Orthodox church?

738
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
 This is my question, thank you.

739
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:03,000
 Okay, thank you. First question, I would point to St Cyprian of Carthage.

740
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:08,000
 You know that Gregory, he wasn't known in the East,

741
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:14,000
 but his teaching on sacraments outside the church and salvation outside the church

742
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:18,000
 was very important for all Latin tradition.

743
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:26,000
 And what he was saying was that he didn't actually recognize sacraments outside the church.

744
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:31,000
 How did he practically respond to it, we don't know.

745
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:37,000
 But it was a very hard position, and St Augustine corrected it.

746
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:47,000
 And after, more or less, in the ancient tradition, we don't have a practice of,

747
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:56,000
 you know, don't recognize sacraments as such, but he wasn't known in the East

748
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:02,000
 because St Gregory, not only because of St Gregory, but Gregory of Nazianzus

749
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:09,000
 confused him with another theologian, not theologian, but bishop called Cyprian of Antioch.

750
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:15,000
 And Cyprian of Antioch was a magician who converted to Christian faith

751
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
 and produced a lot of miracles.

752
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:27,000
 So they confused him, and that's why his theology was not studied and accepted

753
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:31,000
 and had no reception.

754
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:37,000
 And in the beginning of the 20th century, one of the Russian theologians

755
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:46,000
 adopted this teaching of St Cyprian, Hilarion, bishop Hilarion,

756
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:52,000
 not our contemporary, but another one, and applied it to the ecumenical movement,

757
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:59,000
 saying that outside the church there is no salvation, let's stop every ecumenism.

758
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:06,000
 One of the examples of how other fathers were received in today's Orthodoxy,

759
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:12,000
 you spoke about Ambrose and Jerome and Gregory the Great.

760
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:16,000
 I'm not sure that it's because of the filioque.

761
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:25,000
 I think that they lived in an area which was much more close to the Eastern Christianity

762
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:33,000
 because Ambrose was in Milano and the empire was still more or less united.

763
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:40,000
 That's why he was known and he also criticized harshly the emperor Theodosius

764
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:44,000
 who was after the emperor in Constantinople.

765
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:47,000
 So they knew each other very good.

766
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:53,000
 Also you have Gregory the Great who was an ambassador in Constantinople

767
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
 before he became Pope.

768
01:30:55,000 --> 01:31:02,000
 And Jerome, he moved to Palestine, so he involved himself in a lot of controversies

769
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:06,000
 of that time which were very actual for the East.

770
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:10,000
 And Augustine was in Carthago.

771
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:16,000
 This church didn't exist anymore since the 7th century.

772
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:22,000
 So virtually he was one of the Western Latin fathers,

773
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:27,000
 but in reality he belonged to a generation already lost.

774
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:36,000
 All this huge tradition started with Tertullian to Hermian of Facunda

775
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:41,000
 and Fulgencius of Ruspe ended.

776
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:49,000
 And it's a great luck that we have almost all the works of St. Augustine preserved,

777
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:52,000
 but his tradition was lost.

778
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:59,000
 That's why he was too far away from the Orthodox tradition, I think.

779
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:13,000
 Any other questions?

780
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:22,000
 In your lecture you have mentioned that in the 18th century

781
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:27,000
 there is a, how to say, a breakthrough.

782
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:33,000
 Nicodemus, the reformer of the liturgical calendar,

783
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:39,000
 he added the name of Augustine and Jerome into the liturgical calendar.

784
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:44,000
 So what's the motivation behind this ad,

785
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:49,000
 I mean, addition of the name of a Latin father?

786
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:55,000
 There were very few signs in our calendar

787
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:59,000
 and many great saints were not in.

788
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:03,000
 That was his first motivation.

789
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:10,000
 He also lived in, actually we say Greece, but it was not Greece,

790
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:14,000
 it was future Greece, Greek Republic, Hellenic Republic,

791
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:18,000
 where population were mixed.

792
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:23,000
 You have a lot of Turkish people, Muslim people, Christian people,

793
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:30,000
 and I think for him the purpose was to educate people through the calendar

794
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:38,000
 because theology, it wasn't yet the independent state of Greece,

795
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:43,000
 that's why theologians, there were no theological schools or faculties,

796
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
 only for small children.

797
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:49,000
 And he wanted through this liturgical, all day,

798
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:54,000
 to educate people to go deeper to the roots.

799
01:33:54,000 --> 01:34:01,000
 Also, when he spoke about frequent communion, he was criticized,

800
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:07,000
 and people, his adversaries, they said,

801
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:15,000
 "Nicodemus is taking with him always in pocket Eucharist, he is a magician."

802
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
 And what does it mean?

803
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:23,000
 It means that people criticizing him were very obscurantist,

804
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
 but also not educated enough.

805
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:34,000
 And I think it was a kind of enlightenment in Christian sense of word

806
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:39,000
 to bring to his own people, I think so.

807
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:42,000
 But why Augustine?

808
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
 Because he wasn't in the calendar.

809
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:48,000
 [laughter]

810
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:56,000
 You have also some fathers very important for the Orthodox tradition,

811
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:02,000
 as Evagrius from Egypt, you have also Theodoret of Cyrus,

812
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:07,000
 but they are more problematic because they got formal condemnation

813
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:15,000
 by some ecumenical councils, and I spoke about church of the fathers,

814
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:16,000
 that's one definition.

815
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:22,000
 Another definition of the Orthodoxy formulated in the 20th century

816
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:27,000
 was church of the seven ecumenical councils, also very important.

817
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:31,000
 That's why Augustine didn't participate in any council,

818
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:35,000
 that's why he remained unknown for the most Orthodox.

819
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:41,000
 And those fathers I mentioned, they did not participate,

820
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
 but they were condemned by the councils.

821
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:47,000
 That's why he could not put them in the calendar.

822
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:58,000
 So the second question for Tim.

823
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:02,000
 You know, for us Protestants, you know we are a Protestant church,

824
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:08,000
 our church fathers is Calvin and Luther and the Anabaptists and so forth.

825
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:15,000
 So I just wonder for the Orthodox tradition, do people actually discuss Calvin and Luther?

826
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:21,000
 How much they know about this reformer, hero, our church fathers, so called?

827
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:29,000
 We have still comparative theology in our theological faculties,

828
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:38,000
 and there we study Roman Catholic dogma and also Protestant tradition.

829
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:46,000
 And we are very critical towards the Roman Catholics

830
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:49,000
 and very sympathetic towards Protestants,

831
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:56,000
 because we say they were our friends but they didn't know about us.

832
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:59,000
 [laughter]

833
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:11,000
 But unfortunately we didn't go to some concrete theological problematics

834
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:17,000
 of that time of Martin Luther, Jean Calvin, which were very important,

835
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:20,000
 very interesting also.

836
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:26,000
 Once I spoke to a Lutheran theologian, Christoph Felmy from Germany,

837
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:32,000
 and I just shared some theological views, and he said,

838
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:38,000
 "You are like Martin Luther in your theology, but you are not Lutheran. That's good."

839
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
 [laughter]

840
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:44,000
 "And you know also about Lutheran Orthodoxy."

841
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:47,000
 [silence]

842
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,000
 [thud]

843
01:37:49,000 --> 01:38:17,000
 [silence]

844
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:21,000
 So we have Old Testament question, right?

845
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
 There's a long way to walk.

846
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:27,000
 Thank you, Father.

847
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:37,000
 You brought us a fresh perspective that Augustine was a heretic,

848
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:44,000
 according to the Eastern Orthodox tradition, which is refreshing.

849
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:51,000
 Because I'm interested in this different perspective,

850
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:56,000
 as it has been very difficult for me this evening,

851
01:38:56,000 --> 01:39:02,000
 imagining someone from Switzerland representing the East,

852
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:08,000
 whereas a Chinese young theologian from Hong Kong coming back from Oxford

853
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
 representing the West.

854
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:14,000
 It's paradoxical, but it's true.

855
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:22,000
 Different perspectives no longer divided by ethnicity, background.

856
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:30,000
 Say for Chinese Church, if the Nestorian missionary back in the 7th century

857
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:33,000
 was successful enough,

858
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:41,000
 then we would be under the Eastern Orthodox tradition rather than the West missionary movement.

859
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:49,000
 You mentioned that Augustine was called "Blessed" rather than "Saint" Augustine.

860
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:57,000
 Virgin Mary is called "Blessed," not "Saint."

861
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:07,000
 Does it imply any hierarchical order, or was it just a difference in language?

862
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:13,000
 I noticed from your three definitions of Eastern Orthodoxy,

863
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:21,000
 you did not include the word "Greek" in either of your three definitions.

864
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:25,000
 And you mentioned "Greek" quite later on.

865
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:30,000
 But according to our education from the West,

866
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:35,000
 they were the Greek fathers and the Latin fathers.

867
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:41,000
 Augustine apparently did not know any Greek or Hebrew.

868
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:44,000
 He was the Latin father.

869
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:54,000
 Was it because of language that he was misunderstood or categorized as a heretic?

870
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:58,000
 Was it language that is dividing the Church?

871
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:02,000
 Or was it, as you said, political, historical?

872
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:09,000
 I noticed that this evening we have an ecumenical language, which is English.

873
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:13,000
 It is no longer Latin in the West, in Europe.

874
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:16,000
 It's not German, but now it's English.

875
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:21,000
 And what about the 22nd century? Would it be Chinese?

876
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:31,000
 The number of Christians from mainland China will overtake all the other communities.

877
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:42,000
 What would you say about this issue of language from history, and also looking into the future?

878
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:46,000
 Please.

879
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:53,000
 That's interesting that we call all the Oriental fathers "Greek fathers," but they weren't Greek.

880
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:59,000
 And we know now more than we knew before.

881
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:05,000
 And Teodorato of Cyrus, I mentioned, he was a Syriac father.

882
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:11,000
 And John Chrysostom lived a huge Syriac experience.

883
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:18,000
 And one of the greatest fathers of the East was Meletius of Antioch.

884
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:24,000
 He sent Gregory of Nazianzus to Constantinople to preach on Trinity.

885
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:27,000
 He sent Basil the Great.

886
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:32,000
 Basil wanted to be ascetical, and he sent him to be bishop.

887
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:37,000
 And he also ordained John Chrysostom.

888
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:42,000
 But he unfortunately died during the Second Ecumenical Council of 381.

889
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:45,000
 But he was Armenian.

890
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:53,000
 And I think we have to discover this multiplicity of the ancient church.

891
01:42:53,000 --> 01:43:03,000
 And I think there is something very imperialistic in this logic of Greek or Latin, Latin or Greek.

892
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:12,000
 And I think the problem is that Latins, they usually knew about Greek fathers.

893
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:17,000
 And Greek fathers didn't read Latin fathers.

894
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:25,000
 The first translations of the Trinitate of Augustine, this famous work,

895
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:31,000
 which is actually, you cannot understand Philioque without having read this work,

896
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:37,000
 it was first translated in the 13th century in Constantinople.

897
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:46,000
 And many details like this, I'm unhappy with.

898
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:59,000
 I think that also German and French and Italian and Spanish and in future

899
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:08,000
 many other languages will become more and more Christian and important for theology, I think.

900
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:13,000
 Not only English, because language is also a question of thinking.

901
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:16,000
 And we all think differently.

902
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:19,000
 And if you impose one language to everybody,

903
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:30,000
 you impose your own rules of some internal hermeneutic you even don't see and don't get it immediately.

904
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:36,000
 And that's why also I think St. Augustine was not understood enough,

905
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
 because he thought differently.

906
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:43,000
 And many Orthodox theologians in the 19th century,

907
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:49,000
 they discovered Augustine in an academic way, not in a theological way.

908
01:44:49,000 --> 01:45:04,000
 And they were noticing that Augustine got a lot of lacks in his thinking.

909
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:11,000
 For instance, he identifies Platonism and Plato and Aristotle.

910
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:19,000
 For him, new Platonism is only Platonic philosophy developed.

911
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:22,000
 In Christian theology, even more.

912
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:27,000
 Now some scholars think that he didn't know Greek, but he didn't want to put it ahead.

913
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:35,000
 What is important is that now we are a little bit different compared to modernity.

914
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:41,000
 And we know that not knowing about something is not always bad.

915
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:50,000
 That's why Augustine could develop his own theology without knowing Greek theology.

916
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:57,000
 That's why it's so amazing, sometimes very paradoxical, very tragical, but different.

917
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:09,000
 And that's a very interesting story, what would happen if Nestorian missionaries came to China at that time.

918
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:17,000
 But it's also a very interesting question, because it's linked with all political developments of that time.

919
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:22,000
 You know that the Roman Empire became Orthodox,

920
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:30,000
 and all Christians outside of it had to disappear because they were in some way adhering to the Roman faith.

921
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:37,000
 Or to become different, to become monophysites or Nestorians or something like this.

922
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:47,000
 And I think this question of Augustine is also linked with the coronation of Charlemagne in the year 800,

923
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:52,000
 when he proclaimed himself the emperor.

924
01:46:52,000 --> 01:47:03,000
 At that time, they did believe in one God, one Jesus Christ, one scripture, one Caesar.

925
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:09,000
 And that was a huge challenge to the imperial church in Constantinople.

926
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:16,000
 That's why they started also distancing themselves from the Latin tradition.

927
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:24,000
 And you have this coronation of Charlemagne and Fortius of Constantinople,

928
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:33,000
 almost at the same time simultaneously polemics arose between Greek and Latin Christianity.

929
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:53,000
 So from language, any related question about language, culture, from the missionary perspective?

930
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:56,000
 Anyway, I'm not forcing you.

931
01:47:56,000 --> 01:48:00,000
 Okay, any other questions?

932
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:08,000
 I have a rather practical question this time.

933
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:19,000
 It's about whether it's easier for people like you to promote Augustine's work in countries or areas

934
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:23,000
 which is outside the former Byzantine areas.

935
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:29,000
 Because I noticed that in your presentation, you mentioned a lot about different theologians doing the same work.

936
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:38,000
 But most of them work in areas like in Europe, like yourself, and also in the United States.

937
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:50,000
 So I wonder, is it difficult, maybe more difficult for you to promote Augustine's work in eastern,

938
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:54,000
 the former historically eastern countries?

939
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:57,000
 Or is it more or less the same?

940
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
 This is my question. Thank you.

941
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:09,000
 In some way, yes, because there is a cliche that St. Augustine was a teacher of,

942
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:12,000
 or an example of Christian penitence.

943
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:18,000
 And the focus is on his biography.

944
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
 He was not Christian.

945
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:30,000
 He was a heretic before, he adhered to Manichaeism, after he was baptized by St. Ambrose, and that's all.

946
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:37,000
 Why? Because orthodoxy is focused on asceticism.

947
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:38,000
 It's enough.

948
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:46,000
 It's very hard, very difficult to combine theology, dogmatics, and ascetics

949
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:50,000
 lived in such a way.

950
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:58,000
 And also, it's very good to speak about yourself, Church of the Fathers,

951
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
 but you need to study Fathers.

952
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:08,000
 But if you already called yourself Church of the Fathers, you don't study the Fathers, usually like this.

953
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:12,000
 That's why it's very difficult to speak about St. Augustine,

954
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:18,000
 because everybody thinks that we know about him, everything.

955
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:23,000
 In the Western or Eastern context, outside orthodox countries,

956
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:30,000
 it's easier because you share your opinion and we are open for every kind of discussion.

957
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:38,000
 Any other questions?

958
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:49,000
 I know nothing about Augustine, and I know nothing about the Church history,

959
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:52,000
 but I know something about Psalms.

960
01:50:52,000 --> 01:51:00,000
 My question would be, what is the position of reciting the Psalms in the Orthodox liturgy?

961
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:14,000
 How would that recitation be a way to form the piety and also the spirituality of the Orthodox believers?

962
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:21,000
 In order to keep Andrew not so bored,

963
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:29,000
 what do you think the position of Psalms in Augustine's own spirituality?

964
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:35,000
 It's a big question, but anyway, I think you can have something to tell us about that.

965
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:40,000
 Augustine said, "Psalms are the voice of Christ."

966
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
 That was his saying.

967
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
 And what about Psalms in the Orthodox tradition?

968
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:49,000
 I often compare it to the role of the Koran in the Islamic piety,

969
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:59,000
 because the Koran is compared to Psalms.

970
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:05,000
 We have 150 Psalms, and the Koran has 114 parts.

971
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:15,000
 And if you call it an Arabic psalm book, it would be easier to understand the structure.

972
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:22,000
 And I think Orthodox liturgy and Orthodox piety recite Psalms.

973
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:28,000
 It depends on language, because if you do it in English or in French, you have immediate understanding.

974
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:34,000
 But in Russia, Ukraine, Belorussia, we do use Church Slavonic language,

975
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:37,000
 which is not always understandable.

976
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:44,000
 So we recite Psalms in a very, sometimes very anonymous way.

977
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:49,000
 We just repeat, but some sayings are not understandable,

978
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:55,000
 because of a lack of precision in translation at that time.

979
01:52:55,000 --> 01:53:06,000
 And that's why we need to also study it and to find the voice of Jesus Christ.

980
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
 That's the Augustinian approach.

981
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:14,000
 What is very interesting is that the Book of Psalms is,

982
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:19,000
 I spoke about the Bible in the Orthodox everyday life,

983
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:25,000
 and usually we don't, unfortunately, read the Bible as much as you do.

984
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:34,000
 But Psalms, we read Psalms, and the whole Book of Psalms is repeated many times during Great Lent,

985
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:38,000
 and also in ordinary time.

986
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:43,000
 Many times you have from Psalm 1 to 150 during the week,

987
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:48,000
 it's all Psalms read in our worship.

988
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:51,000
 Very interesting, because it's a unique book,

989
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:59,000
 which is very, very, quite, very often known by heart.

990
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:05,000
 Maybe I was comparing that to the Koran, because many Orthodox say it by heart,

991
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:08,000
 you know, like it comes automatically.

992
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:18,000
 Even some calculation, I was in seminary, I went to a monastery to do some work with monks,

993
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:27,000
 and they told me, "This work, you recite Psalm 50, and when you finish, it's done.

994
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:34,000
 Go."

995
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:40,000
 The Psalms, I think, are very important in Augustine.

996
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:44,000
 His confessions, you can find the Psalms everywhere.

997
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:50,000
 And the Psalms is about prayer to him, just like the confessions.

998
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:56,000
 The confessions can be seen as extended, long prayer.

999
01:54:56,000 --> 01:55:02,000
 And I think he, in the confessions, after his return to the Church,

1000
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:06,000
 return to his childhood faith, he went on retreat,

1001
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:17,000
 and a session of the confessions actually took the form of a commentary of one of the Psalms.

1002
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:26,000
 So I would say that he internalized the Psalms into his prayer and his life.

1003
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:29,000
 Yeah, so I think he doesn't read the Psalms like us.

1004
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:32,000
 He prays the Psalms.

1005
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:38,000
 And John Calvin not only recites the Psalms, he sings the Psalms.

1006
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:44,000
 So we are pretty in line together.

1007
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:48,000
 Any questions?

1008
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:51,000
 A sad one from you.

1009
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:54,000
 I only ask one question each time, so I didn't break the rule.

1010
01:55:54,000 --> 01:56:00,000
 Anyway, you mentioned, I mean the discussion we mentioned about liturgy.

1011
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:06,000
 Of course, in the Orthodox tradition, they emphasize liturgy is something that passed on from the past.

1012
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:11,000
 So, you know, the Christendom liturgy is supposed to be from Christendom.

1013
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:17,000
 Anyway, my question is that in the modern age, we talk about colloquial language,

1014
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:22,000
 we talk about being engaged with the current culture,

1015
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:31,000
 and obviously the Orthodox traditional liturgy is very out of touch with the modern culture in many ways.

1016
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:36,000
 So in the Orthodox Church, the discussion about like,

1017
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:41,000
 do we need to change some of the liturgies and some of the contemporary music

1018
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:48,000
 instead of just reciting the Psalms in some, you know, reciting.

1019
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:51,000
 Do we need some contemporary music in worship?

1020
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:55,000
 Do they have this kind of discussion in the Orthodox community? I wonder.

1021
01:56:55,000 --> 01:57:01,000
 In such a degree, we do discuss about language,

1022
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:08,000
 Church Slavonic, Russian, and different questions like this,

1023
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:13,000
 but not changing completely our liturgy.

1024
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:22,000
 For me personally, it was very astonishing that I discovered many meanings of our liturgy.

1025
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:30,000
 I knew since many years as I started celebrating in French in Paris,

1026
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:38,000
 as I served there, those translations were made by those intellectuals

1027
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:45,000
 exposed by Lenin to France, and French was their mother tongue.

1028
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:50,000
 And they were educated in philosophy and theology,

1029
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:54,000
 and that's why they translated it in a magnificent way,

1030
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:59,000
 very precisely, very good, very correct, very theological and profound.

1031
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:04,000
 When I take a German translation of Orthodox liturgy,

1032
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:08,000
 it's something I don't understand, even German people don't understand.

1033
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:16,000
 We wanted to be the Calvinia, the Protestant pastor from Zurich,

1034
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:25,000
 she's a pastor there, and we wanted to translate it together into a normal German language.

1035
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:29,000
 You get the impression that people who translated it into German

1036
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:34,000
 wanted to say, "We are not like you, we are different,

1037
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:44,000
 we create another language to demonstrate what does it mean to be Orthodox among Germans."

1038
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:49,000
 But they were Germans, you know, and the same story with Polish language.

1039
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:54,000
 You know that the Polish Orthodox Church, it is very small, half a million people,

1040
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:57,000
 but it's a very traditional church of Poland.

1041
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:04,000
 We don't know about it, but it exists, and they do use Church Slavonic language.

1042
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:12,000
 In some Polish translations, I try to celebrate in Polish language,

1043
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:16,000
 but it's not Polish we use in our today's life,

1044
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:23,000
 and it's very difficult, especially in questions of how to understand Orthodox liturgy.

1045
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:28,000
 I wanted to show it to my Catholic friends, just what we pray,

1046
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:32,000
 but the language was so strange that I felt ashamed.

1047
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:36,000
 I think to respond to your question,

1048
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:41,000
 no, we don't discuss about modern music in our liturgy, we separate both.

1049
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:47,000
 If you want to pray with maybe young youth communities,

1050
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:51,000
 you can sing something like Psalms, but not in the liturgy.

1051
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:57,000
 Liturgy is more for us a classical way of doing things,

1052
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:00,000
 but the question of language is very important.

1053
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:07,000
 It seems to me we are really in the mood of exchange now,

1054
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:12,000
 but our colleagues are a bit mindful of the time,

1055
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:20,000
 so we really have a very rich exchange this evening.

1056
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:25,000
 Thank you very much for all of you for your participation,

1057
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:32,000
 and especially for those who contributed your questions during the Q&A session.

1058
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:43,000
 And above all, a big thank you to Dr. Sokolowski and Andrew for your message and your response.

1059
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:53,000
 So I would like to invite Dr. Sokolowski to conclude our meeting, our fellowship, with a prayer.

1060
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:54,000
 Okay?

1061
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:15,000
 Our Lord, we thank you for our meeting, for our discussion.

1062
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:22,000
 Help us to be good Christians in today's world,

1063
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:28,000
 through the prayers of St. Augustine and all your saints,

1064
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:35,000
 by the power of the Holy Spirit in your Son, Jesus Christ.

1065
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
 Thank you.

1066
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
 Thank you very much.

1067
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:47,000
 I wish you a very good evening.

1068
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
 Thank you.

1069
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:52,000
 [Applause]

1070
02:01:53,000 --> 02:02:04,000
