[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (gentle music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:15.000]   - I'll have to spend a minute to say that I'm very honored
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.680]   to be invited by Dr. Wong and to be in this occasion
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.160]   with esteemed teachers and scholars.
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.880]   I really don't know what I'm talking about,
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.160]   but I'm sure they'll bail me out.
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.000]   So I'll just fly away. (laughs)
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.320]   And I have to admit that Dr. Lepton was my teacher,
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.920]   so I have to agree 100% with what he says. (laughs)
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.240]   Speaking of that, yeah,
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.500]   I'll just share a little bit of my thoughts.
[00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.080]   Eugene Peterson, once in his introduction
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.760]   to the book of James, says, "When Christian believers
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.400]   "gathered in churches, everything that can go wrong
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.160]   "sooner or later does."
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.920]   So when people gathered, whether we call it a church
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.320]   or whatever social club, things will go wrong.
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.980]   So we have to at least accept that.
[00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.960]   And from the sharing of Dr. Lepton and I,
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.840]   I'm not in agreeing with him.
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.840]   Rather, I'm warmly reminded by him that,
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.280]   yes, the first topic we have to talk about
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.760]   is not about church relevance, but it's about God.
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.000]   God is a sustainer, God is a maker,
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.300]   God is a creator of everything.
[00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.760]   So first and foremost, we have to think and rethink
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.040]   about God first.
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.800]   Other than that, without this foundation,
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.440]   we're still talking about earthly establishment
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.100]   and how to be quote-unquote relevant to the people.
[00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.360]   And also, he reminds me that, and I'm part of the problem,
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.940]   is the foreign nature of humans,
[00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.940]   the brokenness of our lives, but we are still called
[00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.360]   and sent to this broken and sinful world
[00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.800]   and sometimes we do more harmful things
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.640]   than beneficial things.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.800]   But still, God sends us as his ambassador
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.420]   and witnesses to this world.
[00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.360]   So there is a history, I think,
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.720]   in the history of Hong Kong churches too.
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.040]   That's why there is a period that churches
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.080]   will encourage believers to work hard,
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.080]   to have upward mobility to the upper levels of the society
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.980]   so we will have a bigger influence
[00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.100]   and a wider influence to the society
[00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.100]   so we thought there will be a good for the city.
[00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:15.760]   But when looking back of all these past 50 years or so,
[00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.880]   we may have a different perspective of that.
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.020]   So there's another point that sometimes
[00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.500]   we may be just borrowing the methods
[00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.080]   from the world, from business world.
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.640]   We want to compete with them.
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.500]   We want to be like them, to be relevant,
[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.020]   quote-unquote, to the society,
[00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:43.020]   but end up, we're just like them instead of who we are.
[00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.300]   And even though he doesn't have this time to say,
[00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.420]   but from the note that is,
[00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.700]   he is very frankly and harshly to say
[00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.020]   that so much of the US white churches
[00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.820]   reflect the self-interest, individualistic safety
[00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.480]   and security of the culture.
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.380]   No wonder Christian nationalism
[00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.700]   are so prominent right now.
[00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.220]   Even in this statement, I think somehow
[00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.520]   it can apply to Hong Kong churches too, right?
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.500]   Of course, there's much to say.
[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.500]   I'm sure he will speak more about that.
[00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.580]   But true, I think we do share a lot of the issues
[00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.660]   that we are facing from the Western churches
[00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.560]   and as well as the Hong Kong churches.
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.220]   Dr. Leblon also continues to say
[00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.580]   that the true relevance of the church
[00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.100]   must be on the ground.
[00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.100]   Must be in dialogue to the contemporary life,
[00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.860]   connects the questions, pains, injustice,
[00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.100]   hopes, communion and social transformation,
[00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.800]   stewardship of the earth, spiritual void and more.
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.720]   And I am in 100% agree with that.
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.020]   But just like students,
[00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.760]   I have more question marks than response.
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:21.260]   I think when we are trying to talk about church relevance
[00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.420]   to the time and space that the church,
[00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.620]   the local churches that they are in,
[00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.620]   I still think besides the theological foundation,
[00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:37.380]   there's also some preliminary steps,
[00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.860]   preliminary issues that we have to face head on
[00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.720]   before discussing the topic of church relevance.
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:53.660]   Number one, there's an article a few years ago
[00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.780]   from the UK media, The Guardian.
[00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:02.540]   The topic catches my memory to now.
[00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.560]   The topic says, now is the age of rage.
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.820]   The age of rage.
[00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:13.020]   Of course, there's arguments trying to argue that,
[00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:18.020]   is it that nowadays people are more angrier than before?
[00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.500]   Of course, there are pros and cons,
[00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.620]   there are some studies and some like
[00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.100]   objective observation or whatever.
[00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:31.100]   But yeah, in the sense that the article concludes that
[00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:36.120]   we can say that because we, a generation of angry people,
[00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:41.620]   including believers, but sometimes I feel that
[00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:45.280]   we really do not discuss this topic enough.
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.960]   Because we are believers, we just brush this aside.
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.960]   We want to live above this phenomenon
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.420]   because we have more to say to the world,
[00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:01.900]   but actually I think, at least for me, it may be my problem.
[00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.740]   So we are as angry as the society.
[00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.220]   When we are reading the news,
[00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:09.780]   when we are hearing the voice,
[00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:14.780]   we are watching the YouTubes or TikToks or whatever, right?
[00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:19.460]   All the things happening around us,
[00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:22.020]   no matter if it's big news or small news,
[00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.380]   or the daily lives, it makes me angry.
[00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:29.240]   Do we admit that?
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:33.420]   If we do not deal with this raw emotions,
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:39.080]   at least to me, because not only about the emotion,
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:43.080]   but because of the maybe hurt or puzzles
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:47.140]   or the whatever reason,
[00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:53.200]   we might not be ready to talk about relevance.
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:08:00.920]   And ironically, even after this article in The Guardian,
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.680]   they have an ad to encourage people
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:09.820]   to write more articles for this media.
[00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:14.500]   It says, "When you have an army of lawyers after you,
[00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:17.020]   "when you want to say something
[00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:19.200]   "that some people want to stop you,
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.400]   "come to us, we will help you."
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:26.640]   See, we are discussing about the age of rage,
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:27.880]   but on the other hand,
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:32.080]   we are still promoting a competitive mentality.
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:37.960]   How we move on to the topic of relevance,
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:40.780]   if we are ready to fight.
[00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:42.800]   That's one thing.
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:47.320]   And the second point I want to raise
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.680]   instead of respond is,
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.760]   yeah, there was a period of time
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:56.540]   that churches may try to pursue power.
[00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:02.540]   To want to reach out to the greater audience
[00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:05.180]   because power is influence.
[00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:10.820]   But for the past few years, at least to me personally,
[00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:14.020]   when the people of God actually
[00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:18.820]   are also have some thirst for power too.
[00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:21.940]   How do I say that?
[00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:27.500]   Because I'm thinking that this thirst for power
[00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.900]   is not just a traditional view
[00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:33.740]   that we try to gain power
[00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:37.380]   to have a personal gain or something.
[00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:40.100]   A lot of people, believe us or not,
[00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:43.140]   have the thirst for power
[00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:45.840]   because they want to make some changes.
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:49.340]   They want to make some differences.
[00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:52.980]   But without that power, whatever that is,
[00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:54.420]   we feel powerless.
[00:09:54.420 --> 00:10:01.380]   So if we do not feel some kind of power,
[00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:07.060]   talking about church relevance is still up there.
[00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:13.800]   Because, yeah, in Hong Kong we have many, many sayings,
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:17.620]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:20.220]   I don't know how to translate it in English.
[00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:23.020]   People who speak louder will be heard,
[00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:24.380]   something like that, right?
[00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:25.220]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:28.340]   Yeah, right, right, yeah, something like that.
[00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:32.100]   Without that, yeah, we feel powerless.
[00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:34.660]   So it leads to the third point.
[00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:36.300]   This is the age of rage.
[00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:40.640]   We thirst for spiritual power, physical power,
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:41.700]   whatever power.
[00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:45.380]   And leads to the third point is
[00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:49.740]   this is also a time or culture of indifference.
[00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:54.500]   Meeting all these big issues, right,
[00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:57.180]   when we are talking about injustice,
[00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:02.180]   about war, about race, about sexual identities,
[00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:06.220]   about whatever public,
[00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:13.300]   I think the powerlessness draw us into indifference.
[00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:17.800]   We don't care.
[00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:22.020]   Because I'm not saying,
[00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:25.220]   I do not agree that we are giving up.
[00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:28.600]   But because of this heavy sense of powerlessness,
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:33.180]   we just do not know what to do.
[00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:36.140]   And because of that,
[00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:38.540]   we are not talking about church relevance,
[00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:41.600]   we are talking survival.
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:46.380]   With our offices, with all the bullying
[00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:48.980]   because of the lack of workforce,
[00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:52.100]   we have all the family issues,
[00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:53.220]   we have the health issues
[00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:57.180]   because the society is getting old.
[00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:04.980]   The financial uncertainties in the future.
[00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:08.420]   We are talking about survival instead of relevance.
[00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:12.380]   Who cares about relevance now?
[00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:16.180]   I just want to live a decent life.
[00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:21.180]   I just want to be a possible believer
[00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:23.100]   in this days and age.
[00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:29.820]   Before, if we do not deal with these issues head on,
[00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:32.340]   talking about church relevance,
[00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:33.900]   just like in the 90s,
[00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:36.500]   we were talking about church growth.
[00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:38.740]   Let's do something together, right?
[00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:40.580]   Let's have some new ministries.
[00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:48.700]   So, from the personal individual faith
[00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:59.500]   to the public expression of our confession,
[00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:05.060]   at least to me, the gap is getting huge.
[00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:06.620]   It's getting bigger and bigger.
[00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:12.320]   So for a lot of believers nowadays,
[00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:17.940]   yeah, we are just trying to preserve ourselves
[00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:20.460]   not to fall into temptations
[00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:24.820]   or not doing something really bad.
[00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:26.220]   And I thank God for that.
[00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:29.680]   To have a bigger dream,
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:33.740]   to have a more complex discussion,
[00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:37.220]   for a lot of people, we do not have the capacity anymore
[00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:42.000]   because our brain is just so stuck with all these things,
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.640]   all these complex things already.
[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:52.080]   Yeah, so to learn how to live sacrificially
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:59.860]   beyond our personal space,
[00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:05.040]   and then in Hong Kong context,
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:11.380]   I hope I do not offend a lot of people,
[00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:13.820]   we do not have much imagination.
[00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:20.320]   Our educational system trains us to,
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:24.920]   how do you say, the examination machine
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.200]   or something like that, right?
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.020]   Yeah, we just fill in the blanks,
[00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:32.200]   fill in the correct answers, and that's it.
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:36.280]   To have imagination, well, I'm using all the words
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:39.000]   from the topic, right? (laughs)
[00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:45.160]   Yeah, we're talking about, as he, Dr. Levin,
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:50.160]   beautifully say that the relevance from God,
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.200]   the description of the gospel,
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:15:00.120]   and a lot of beautiful terminology,
[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:05.120]   descriptions, words, but to a lot of people in Hong Kong,
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.760]   it's just a fussy picture.
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.420]   What does it look like?
[00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:15.420]   To be a relevant church to either to American
[00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:18.020]   or to the Hong Kong people, right?
[00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:19.180]   What does it look like?
[00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:24.240]   We have words only, we have descriptions only.
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:32.140]   So, therefore, but I do agree that not only
[00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:37.140]   not just because the difficulties of the points
[00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:47.740]   I presented, we stop talking about it.
[00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:52.500]   One of the reason I really like Fuller is
[00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:58.860]   if they're allowed, they will have courageous conversation
[00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:01.680]   on a lot of topics to the society,
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:03.940]   not only to theologic schools,
[00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:08.940]   but to different religious communities.
[00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:13.020]   I think in Hong Kong churches, at least,
[00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:19.060]   we should try to have a conversation to the society.
[00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:24.700]   And as I borrow one of the phrases that during the dinner
[00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:26.140]   that we talked about,
[00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:29.940]   evil in the risk of having aches in our face.
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:34.840]   Because we just don't talk about things.
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.960]   We just don't talk about a lot of things in Hong Kong churches
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:42.600]   therefore the people from the outside just think
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:45.320]   we are living in a different universe, right?
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:49.460]   Or maybe if I'm a Marvel fan, like a multiverse, right?
[00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:51.580]   We are doing different things.
[00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:54.180]   We do not know what is going on outside
[00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:57.560]   and the outside world doesn't know what's going on inside.
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:02.040]   But at least we open the door to have the courage
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.740]   at least to start conversation to the society.
[00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:10.120]   But at least in Hong Kong,
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:13.800]   just like in America when you're talking,
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:16.160]   like this year is election year, right?
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.340]   Who do you vote?
[00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:20.240]   And they will have a fist fight, right?
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:24.180]   We are talking about politics, at least to me.
[00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:29.100]   If we are talking about having our personal,
[00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:34.100]   individual, private faith to step outside to the public,
[00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:37.340]   we are touching the topic of politics.
[00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:39.860]   But in Hong Kong churches,
[00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:43.160]   at what cost?
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:47.140]   Which are beneficial,
[00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:51.800]   which are the red line.
[00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:56.940]   This is still the ongoing underlying tone
[00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:01.680]   of church relevance to us here.
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:05.840]   But I still encourage people to use our brain,
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.780]   to think hard, to study hard,
[00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:11.640]   and learn how to imagine.
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:15.460]   Because if God is not talking about
[00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:17.760]   an abstract kingdom of God thing,
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:20.980]   we have to do our job,
[00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:23.580]   use different languages to different people
[00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:26.220]   so we both can understand
[00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:29.620]   there is a concrete future in hand.
[00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:32.460]   If we do not give up the world right now,
[00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:37.060]   but to redeem, we have to use all our means,
[00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:40.420]   all our creative ideas, all our imagination
[00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:44.460]   to present to the world, to present to this Hong Kong.
[00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:46.760]   God is still in hand.
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:48.500]   God is still here.
[00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:53.500]   But we have to find our means and languages
[00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:59.140]   to encourage the imagination to continue.
[00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:02.140]   And I think that for the past few years,
[00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:05.060]   because of border restriction or whatever,
[00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:06.720]   I see hope too.
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:08.420]   Because Hong Kong people,
[00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:13.900]   no matter how you say (speaking in foreign language)
[00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:16.100]   the spirit of Man Rock, something like that,
[00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:18.620]   people are creative.
[00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:21.100]   People are creative.
[00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:26.100]   So keep imagining, keep thinking,
[00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:28.620]   keep trying things out.
[00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:32.980]   Because we are no in a moral high ground.
[00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:35.140]   We are not living in a different universe.
[00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:39.180]   We are just the same, just as weak,
[00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:42.580]   just as confused with the people outside.
[00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:49.700]   With a glass wall or whatever, it doesn't really matter.
[00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:50.540]   We are together.
[00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:53.820]   That's my humble response.
[00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:58.380]   (audience applauding)
[00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:05.300]   - Okay, thank you, Dr. Lebeden, for your excellent lecture.
[00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:07.220]   I will try to make it short.
[00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:11.460]   Some of the things, actually, Reverend Dr. Jackie
[00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:14.440]   has already said some of my points.
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:16.980]   Okay, I'll just concentrate on three words
[00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:18.980]   that Dr. Lebeden has mentioned
[00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:21.740]   at the beginning of his talk.
[00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:25.620]   He mentioned that the church should be embodied,
[00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:29.460]   it should be credible, and it should be beautiful.
[00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:31.900]   And I will just concentrate on these three words.
[00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:35.060]   And I just want to share a little bit
[00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:39.580]   the difficulty of trying to do these three things.
[00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:44.580]   I am a professor here in the College of Public Theology.
[00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:48.120]   And one of the things I get to do is,
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:49.480]   oh, my computer's gonna turn off.
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:51.520]   Anyway, one of the things I get to do
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:54.920]   is churches invite me to talk.
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:58.440]   And when there's some things the senior pastor,
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:01.080]   when he doesn't want to talk about that issue,
[00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:03.960]   he will invite me to talk about that issue
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.960]   because I can talk and I walk away, okay?
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:07.800]   And they can never invite me again.
[00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:11.900]   So I get to talk to different difficult issues,
[00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:15.900]   including issues about faith and politics.
[00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:20.900]   So I want just to share how difficult sometimes it is
[00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:24.980]   to have a gospel message which is both embodied,
[00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:27.180]   credible, and beautiful.
[00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:28.800]   Start with embodied.
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:33.800]   The difficulty with embodied gospel or gospel message,
[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:36.620]   whether in words or in deeds,
[00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:40.220]   is sometimes it's gonna be very painful to be embodied.
[00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:43.620]   Now, there was a time when, you know, in the '50s,
[00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:47.140]   Hong Kong churches is a very embodied church, it was,
[00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:50.960]   because we gave out a lot of food for the refugees.
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:54.140]   Those were easy days, in a sense, to be embodied.
[00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:56.960]   The main restriction is maybe you don't have enough money
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:59.820]   to buy enough food for those refugees.
[00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:02.620]   And but then nowadays, it's a little bit different
[00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:06.480]   because today the main problem is not hunger
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:09.340]   although there's always hungry people in Hong Kong
[00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:11.580]   as in anywhere else in the world.
[00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:13.460]   But the main issue is not, you know,
[00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:16.740]   a lot of Hong Kong people are dying of hunger.
[00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:18.900]   The issue confronting us, a lot of it,
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:22.180]   like Reverend Jackie said, is very political.
[00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:27.100]   For example, some of the embodiment is enforced from above.
[00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:31.380]   The Chinese government tells us that the Hong Kong church
[00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:33.820]   should start with signification.
[00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:38.040]   We should have a Chinese version of Christianity.
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:43.040]   So for example, can we have a prayer day on October 1st,
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:45.160]   our national day?
[00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.960]   Now, somebody, for some churches,
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:50.720]   if we have a prayer meeting on October 1st,
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.900]   it's very appropriate.
[00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:56.000]   We are being embodied, we pray for our nations.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.960]   But for some other people in Hong Kong,
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:00.920]   that will be a sign of your political situation
[00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:05.680]   that you're trying to appease the Chinese government.
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:08.600]   So if you're embodied in something,
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:11.420]   you make some other people angry.
[00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:13.700]   Or take another example,
[00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:16.520]   can we have a prayer meeting in June 4th?
[00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:19.840]   Dr. Ledbetter knows what's June 4th, right?
[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:24.800]   Will police start knocking on our door
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:27.760]   if our church has a prayer meeting on June 4th?
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:33.560]   So when you try to be embodied in the concerns
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:35.920]   of some group of Chinese people,
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:37.800]   sometimes it can be dangerous,
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.140]   sometimes it can be painful,
[00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:42.960]   sometimes you can make part of the church very angry.
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:45.760]   So sometimes people don't,
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:49.760]   the church don't talk about issues in the society
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:51.720]   because like Dr. Jackie said,
[00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:53.440]   because it's too divisive.
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:56.280]   We don't want to get into all the pain
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:58.280]   and all the arguments.
[00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:00.600]   And I have no easy answer for that.
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:03.720]   I mean, it's not fair to expect Dr. Ledbetter
[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:06.360]   to have an answer since it's not in Hong Kong.
[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.880]   But that's something I struggle, you know?
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:13.120]   If being embodied means a lot of arguments and pain,
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:16.160]   how embodied the church should be?
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:18.580]   Or maybe the church should talk about heaven
[00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:20.840]   and just be appraised and let people forget
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:22.680]   about the pains of the world.
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:25.120]   Maybe, is it a better choice?
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:26.960]   I don't know, sometimes it may be.
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.680]   As a second thing about credible,
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:31.400]   I will try to make it real short.
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:35.080]   Sometimes when you are credible to one group of people,
[00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:39.480]   you become not credible to another group of people.
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:44.160]   For example, many of you know I am a board member
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:46.640]   of Society for the Truth and Light,
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:50.580]   which is respond to the LGBTQ movement.
[00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:55.580]   We try to deconstruct the arguments of the LGBTQ arguments.
[00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:58.720]   I have the experience of just writing something
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:02.680]   on Facebook because at that time there was an argument
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:06.680]   saying people like us, the Society for Truth and Light,
[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:08.480]   they are worse than the Nazis.
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:13.480]   They want to kill all those LGBTQ people and so on.
[00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:17.880]   I wrote something in response to that kind of discourse.
[00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:20.760]   And then someone wrote on my Facebook,
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:23.100]   underneath my comment on my Facebook,
[00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:25.080]   on the comment section, they said,
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:28.800]   if people like me is ruling Hong Kong,
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:32.480]   we will just imprison all the LGBTQ people.
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:35.040]   I feel so sad about it.
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:37.520]   I mean, if I say something you don't like
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:38.960]   and you think it's wrong, that's fine.
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.440]   Criticize me, something I've said.
[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:44.400]   But you are criticizing something I've never said.
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:48.040]   I never said anything about how to treat the LGBTQ people.
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:50.800]   I just try to deconstruct some of the arguments
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:51.920]   of that movement.
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:55.080]   And that guy, whoever that person is,
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:57.640]   just assume that's what I want to do.
[00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:01.160]   And I found that, so it's hard to be credible this way
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:03.400]   because if you are credible to one group,
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:06.060]   the other group, the opposite group,
[00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:09.840]   assume all kinds of discourse that you haven't spoken.
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:12.200]   So how to be credible?
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:13.480]   Must I choose side?
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:15.500]   If I choose to be credible to this group,
[00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:19.400]   I have to give up hope to be credible to another group.
[00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:20.960]   Must I choose side?
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:23.020]   The third point, being beautiful.
[00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:29.400]   I wish Dr. Leberton can say a little bit more about that.
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:32.800]   I find that that is being more and more important,
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:36.380]   particularly for the younger generation today.
[00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:41.200]   To use the vocabulary of Jonathan Evers,
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:43.800]   one of the greatest American theologians,
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:47.520]   the younger generation look for affections.
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:51.460]   They don't want good truth.
[00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:54.340]   They want words and pictures and actions
[00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:57.960]   that can arouse their affections.
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:01.420]   And I found the Hong Kong churches
[00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:04.640]   is not very good at that.
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:07.780]   I think me, the older generation,
[00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:10.680]   usually trained to think in a moralistic way.
[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:14.240]   So any issue come up, the first question they ask,
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:16.280]   is it right or is it wrong?
[00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:21.000]   We always want to put it in a category called right or wrong.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.120]   Sometimes the action of me doing that,
[00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:28.120]   laboring everything either as right or as wrong,
[00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:31.720]   looks offensive to the young people.
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:34.320]   And we break the communication
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:37.800]   without them really listening to what we are talking about.
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:40.620]   Beautiful means we do things and say things
[00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:44.240]   in a way that is attractive to people,
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:46.640]   appeal to their emotions,
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:49.560]   as well as proclaiming the truth.
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:51.560]   How can a church do that?
[00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:55.740]   Or how can a church train itself to do things in this way?
[00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:57.760]   I'm not sure.
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:58.940]   I honestly don't know.
[00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:01.880]   So this is a question I just pose to Dr. Lebutin
[00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:05.560]   and pose to all of you in case any one of you
[00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:07.720]   have some wisdom to share with us.
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:09.800]   So I'll stop my sharing here.
[00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:10.640]   Thank you.
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:13.640]   [audience applauding]
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:16.220]   [gentle music]
[00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:18.800]   [gentle music]
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:22.340]   [gentle music]
[00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:24.920]   (upbeat music)
