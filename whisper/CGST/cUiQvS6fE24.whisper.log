[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920]   (soft piano music)
[00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:13.320]   - Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.480]   fellow Christian brothers and sisters,
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.360]   gathered greetings in our Lord Jesus Christ to you all.
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.360]   Welcome to join us in our CJSC Josephine Stoll
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.880]   Culture and Ethics Lecture.
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.600]   What a wonderful moment to have us all back here
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.360]   gathering together in person for lectures.
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.440]   My name is Grace L, your host this afternoon.
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.000]   Since 1985, CJSC has been hosting this lecture series
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.600]   on a biannual basis to commemorate Josephine Stoll,
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.480]   an influential Christian thinker and leader in Hong Kong
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.960]   after her untimely death in 1982.
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.000]   This year, our lecture series is entitled,
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.160]   "Written for Us, the Old Testament as Christian Scripture."
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.360]   It is said to take a look at how the scripture,
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.600]   in particular, the Old Testament,
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.960]   is relevant to us as Christians today.
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.640]   And it is our honor to have Dr. Christopher Wright
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.280]   as our distinguished and keynote speaker.
[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.240]   Dr. Wright is the global ambassador
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.600]   and ministry director of Langham Partnership.
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.800]   He is also a prolific writer.
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.960]   He has numerous profound publications,
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.480]   "The Mission of God," "Cultivating the Fruits of the Spirit,"
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.040]   "Old Testament Ethics for the People of God,"
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.840]   just to give you a few examples.
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.560]   As you can see from this book list,
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.840]   Dr. Wright's passion to bring to life
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.680]   the relevance of the Old Testament
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.360]   for Christian mission and ethics is more than obvious.
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.080]   Following the first two lectures
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.560]   on Christian identity and mission,
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.840]   this afternoon, Dr. Wright will deliver the third lecture
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.520]   entitled, "The Old Testament and Christian Ethics,
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.920]   "How Should We Live?"
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.120]   Without further ado, please join me
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.240]   in welcoming Dr. Christopher Wright.
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:08.400]   - Thank you, Dr. Ah.
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.360]   That was a very kind and warm welcome.
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.880]   And it's lovely to be here on a sunny day today.
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.480]   It's not quite like London,
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.800]   but still very, very much more like the Hong Kong
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.840]   that I remember from previous visits.
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.280]   Let me again, as I did yesterday,
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.120]   just in case you're here today, this afternoon,
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.960]   for the first time, say that I bring greetings
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.040]   from my home church of All Souls Church,
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.680]   Langham Place in London,
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.080]   from which the Langham Foundation gets its name,
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.640]   from that street in London where John Stott
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.200]   used to live and minister,
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.040]   and founded the Langham Partnership,
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.080]   which is here in Hong Kong, known as Langham Foundation.
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.240]   So greetings to you from us and from them.
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.760]   So now, as I said, we are moving today
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.320]   into the third of our lectures in this topic.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.000]   And in our first lecture, as you remember,
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   we saw how our Christian identity is deeply rooted
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.800]   and shaped by the identity of Israel in the Old Testament.
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.680]   And in Christ, we, the multinational community of believers,
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.840]   Jews and Gentiles, Paul says, are the seed of Abraham.
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.680]   And we observed in that lecture
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.520]   how there are various metaphors
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.360]   within that great story of Israel,
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.720]   which describe them as a people,
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.680]   which are then picked up in the New Testament
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.400]   and applied with Christ-centered significance
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.040]   to God's people in all nations.
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.120]   And then in our second lecture,
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.680]   we saw how that identity of Israel
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.880]   generated a missional purpose of being a people
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.600]   who are created and called by Yahweh, their God,
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.320]   to be something for him in the world.
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.520]   God had declared his intention to Abraham
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.160]   to bring blessing to all nations on earth through him.
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.400]   And when we turn to the New Testament,
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.400]   we saw that our mission, as we think of it
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.960]   as Christian people, derives ultimately from God's mission,
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.280]   God's objective of bringing blessing to the world.
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.560]   And therefore, our mission includes being a blessing,
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.320]   serving, witnessing, terms which all go back
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.640]   to the scriptures.
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.520]   And so today then, in our third lecture,
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.840]   we are seeing how that missional identity of Israel
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.880]   generated a distinctive ethic.
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.400]   That's to say, Israel was not just to be the people of God,
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.320]   but to live as the people of God
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.320]   in ways that would reflect the character
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.920]   and the demands of Yahweh, their God, in everyday life,
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.400]   in the ordinary things of life as a nation.
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.820]   And what we're going to observe today
[00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.800]   is that this powerfully ethical dimension
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.520]   of Israel's faith in the Old Testament
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.080]   became the motivation, the source, the impact
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.920]   for what is written for our learning
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.880]   as we also strive to walk in the ways of the Lord.
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.880]   And once again, what we're going to do today
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.280]   is to follow the same pathway
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.760]   that we did in our last two lectures,
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.480]   which is to see the trajectory of Israel's journey with God
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.080]   through election, chosen in Abraham, in Genesis,
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.680]   through the story of redemption in the Exodus,
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.000]   in the book of Exodus,
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.800]   and then to the covenant that God made with Israel
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.880]   at Mount Sinai, and to have a look
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.800]   at the book of Deuteronomy.
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.800]   So first of all then, Abraham and election
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.640]   and missional ethics.
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.900]   This phrase, missional ethics,
[00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.320]   is really just my shorthand way of trying to say
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.120]   living as God's people for the sake of God's mission.
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.440]   We are to be living in a certain way,
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.000]   that's ethics for the sake of mission.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.760]   So missional ethics just means that,
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.680]   and here we're thinking of Abraham and election.
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.640]   Because we saw, didn't we, right in our first lecture,
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.040]   that our identity goes right back to Abraham
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.640]   because it is through him and through the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.360]   that we are the seed of Abraham.
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.560]   And therefore that sense of being a blessing
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.640]   to the nations comes from him.
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.120]   What we see now is that God's election of his people
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.080]   through Abraham was not only a missional thing
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.680]   for the sake of the nations,
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:22.120]   but had an explicitly ethical intention.
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.920]   And the text that I want us to focus on here,
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.280]   as you can see on the screen,
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.320]   is another one from Exodus, from Genesis,
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:29.760]   but not this time chapter 12,
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:34.080]   but chapter 18, verses 18 and 19,
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.080]   where God says this.
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.860]   This is God actually speaking to himself in Genesis 18.
[00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.800]   God says, "Abraham will indeed become
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.200]   a great and mighty nation,
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.560]   and all nations on earth will find blessing through him."
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.560]   This is my own translation.
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:56.560]   "For I have known or chosen him for the purpose that,
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.040]   for the sake and in order that,
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.560]   he will teach his sons and his household after him
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.240]   so that they will keep the way of Yahweh,
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:08.040]   the way of the Lord, by doing righteousness and justice,
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.760]   for the purpose that, in order that,
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.960]   Yahweh can bring about for Abraham
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.300]   what he has promised to him."
[00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.340]   That's the verse that I want us to concentrate on
[00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.820]   in this first part of the lecture.
[00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:22.460]   Now, this little divine soliloquy,
[00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.260]   God talking to himself,
[00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.540]   comes in the middle of a narrative
[00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:30.020]   which really spans chapters 18 and 19
[00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:31.540]   of the book of Genesis.
[00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:34.840]   It's the story of God's judgment on Sodom and Gomorrah.
[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:37.460]   And in the context of that,
[00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.980]   God has a meal with Abraham and Sarah,
[00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:43.060]   and then makes this renewed promise of blessing
[00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:44.580]   that they would have a son,
[00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:46.540]   and the purpose of that,
[00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:48.580]   which is to bring blessing to all nations.
[00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:51.980]   So this, in many ways, is a reminder by God
[00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:53.220]   to God's own self,
[00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:56.280]   it's a kind of note to self by God,
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:00.420]   in the story of his original purpose in choosing Abraham,
[00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:02.980]   but in the context of bringing judgment
[00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:04.880]   on Sodom and Gomorrah.
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:06.040]   So we need to think, first of all,
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.160]   for a moment or two,
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.540]   about that aspect of these chapters,
[00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:12.360]   which is that Sodom stands here
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:15.160]   very much as a picture of our world.
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.320]   And I always use the word Sodom,
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:17.560]   I mean Sodom and Gomorrah,
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.480]   I'm talking about those both cities,
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.400]   but just for short, speaking of Sodom.
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.240]   Now, as you know, Sodom and Gomorrah
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.440]   stand in the scripture as a kind of prototype,
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.940]   a proverbial prototype of human wickedness,
[00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.100]   and of the judgment of God
[00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:36.280]   that will ultimately fall upon evildoers.
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.800]   But it's quite important,
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:42.140]   because the word Sodom has been used in a particular way
[00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:45.400]   in the West, in Western culture and biblical history,
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.760]   to recognize that the Bible portrays
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.900]   the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah in a very broad way.
[00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:54.600]   Here in this chapter, in verses 20 and 21,
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.360]   immediately after our verse,
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:59.880]   the Lord says, "The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.480]   "is so great, and their sin is so grievous,
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.420]   "that I will go down and see if what they have done
[00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:08.440]   "is as bad as the outcry that has reached me."
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:11.880]   Now, that word coming twice there in verses 20 and 21
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.440]   is the Hebrew word tza'akah,
[00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.200]   which is one of those onomatopoeic words,
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.720]   and it means what it sounds like.
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.480]   It is a cry for pain, ah!
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:25.920]   It's a yell, a scream, a technical word, indeed,
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.480]   is used in a number of places in the Old Testament
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:32.420]   of a cry for help from someone who is suffering,
[00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:34.680]   either blows or cruelty or oppression,
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.880]   or indeed, sexual assault,
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.200]   as in the case of a woman being raped
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.200]   in the book of Deuteronomy.
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.240]   It's a cry for pain.
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:46.300]   Now, earlier in the book of Genesis, in chapter 13,
[00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:48.940]   we read that, quote, "The men of Sodom were wicked
[00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:51.080]   "and were sinning greatly against the Lord."
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.920]   So we've already been told that in chapter 13,
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.720]   and here we're told that the sin specifically
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.640]   is that of what was causing an outcry,
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:02.160]   the oppression, the suffering, the cruelty
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.200]   that was happening in the city.
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:07.840]   Some people in Sodom and Gomorrah are crying out
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.560]   against that, and God hears it.
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.640]   He says, "I've heard that, and I'm coming down
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.500]   "to see if it's as bad as it sounds."
[00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:18.340]   Then, of course, as we move on into Genesis chapter 19,
[00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:22.920]   we read further of the hostile, violent, attempted rape
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:26.520]   by, quote, "All the men from every part of the city
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:29.240]   "of Sodom, both young and old," all of them,
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:32.040]   "on the two men," who are actually angels,
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:34.760]   but the two apparently men who had come
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.040]   to the home of Lot and his family.
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:40.520]   That's in chapter 19, the violent, attempted rape.
[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:43.060]   The prophets go even further in describing
[00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:44.280]   the sin of Sodom.
[00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:49.060]   Isaiah, for example, accuses Jerusalem and says,
[00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:51.000]   "If the Lord had not spared us," he says,
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.520]   "we would have been like Sodom.
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:54.640]   "We would have been like Gomorrah."
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:56.240]   And you can hear the kind of protest
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.080]   that would have come to that.
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:58.600]   Who are you calling Sodom and Gomorrah?
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.920]   We're Jerusalem.
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.560]   So verse 10, Isaiah chapter one, verse 10,
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.640]   "Hear the word of the Lord, you rulers of Sodom.
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.280]   "Listen to the instruction of our God,
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:08.800]   "you people of Gomorrah."
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.720]   That's Isaiah talking to the people
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.000]   of Israel and Jerusalem.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:12.960]   Why?
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.920]   Well, you read the rest of the chapter
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:16.920]   and he's condemning them for their bloodshed,
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.140]   their corruption, their injustice,
[00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:21.580]   their failure to help the poor and needy.
[00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:23.840]   That's what made them like Sodom and Gomorrah.
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.600]   That's Isaiah chapter one.
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.080]   And Ezekiel is even more caustic
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:31.320]   in the way he describes the Israelites,
[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:32.800]   in fact, the Northern Kingdom,
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:35.960]   of being even worse than Sodom and Gomorrah.
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:39.400]   This is Ezekiel chapter 16, verse 49.
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:42.320]   He says, "This was the sin of your sister Sodom.
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.760]   "She and her daughters,"
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:47.080]   that means the villages, the towns around the city,
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:52.080]   "they were arrogant, overfed, unconcerned.
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:55.200]   "They did not help the poor and needy."
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.480]   Sodom's sin, says Ezekiel, was arrogance,
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:01.680]   affluence, and callousness to the needy,
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:05.760]   overproud, overfed, and underconcerned.
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:09.720]   It's a very modern-sounding list of accusations.
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.440]   So that's why, when you put all that together,
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.800]   that Sodom stands as a kind of model
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:19.480]   or a picture or paradigm of human society at its worst
[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:22.040]   and the inevitable consequences of God's judgment
[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:23.640]   that falls upon that.
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:27.160]   It was a place that was full of oppression,
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.760]   cruelty, violent sexual abuse, idolatry,
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:33.600]   pride, greedy consumption,
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:38.600]   but empty of compassion and care for the needy.
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.040]   And that's a picture, surely,
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:42.680]   of the world that we still live in.
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:46.760]   And it's precisely that world that God comes to
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:50.160]   in both judgment, but also, remarkably,
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.640]   in redemption in relation to Lot,
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:55.080]   but also what he now says to Abraham.
[00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:58.080]   And it's on his way to bring judgment onto that world
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:02.200]   that God stops off for a meal with Abraham and Sarah.
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:05.000]   God didn't need to do that, did he?
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.040]   I mean, he could've just zapped down from heaven to Sodom
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.320]   and do what he did, but he stops.
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.840]   He pauses on the way and renews his promise
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:17.920]   to Abraham and Sarah that they will have a son next year.
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:19.960]   They'd been waiting for 25 years already,
[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.480]   so that's what made Sarah laugh a bit.
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.160]   And God says, "Why did you laugh?"
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.000]   "No, I didn't."
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:25.840]   "Yes, you did."
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:26.680]   "No, you didn't," and so on.
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.800]   It's a wonderfully told narrative.
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:32.360]   So here, you see, is God on his way to judgment,
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:36.840]   who stops to remind himself of his ultimate purpose
[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:41.600]   of blessing to all nations through this elderly couple,
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:45.040]   Abraham and Sarah, who haven't yet had a child at all.
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.560]   So we need to see what God says here now
[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:49.160]   in these verses that we're looking at
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:52.400]   in that context of God's ultimate judgment
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:54.960]   on the world of Sodom, but with his purpose
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.520]   of bringing redemption into the world
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.600]   through the children of Abraham.
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:00.360]   And that brings us, therefore, to the next point
[00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:02.560]   that I want to bring from these verses,
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:05.800]   which is the way of the Lord, as we read there,
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.920]   as a model or a picture for God's people
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:10.240]   and for how they're to live.
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:13.640]   Coming back now to Genesis 18, verse 19.
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.200]   Let me read it to you again.
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:18.020]   God says, "I have chosen him," that is Abraham,
[00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:20.080]   "so that he will direct his children
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:23.880]   "and his household after him to keep the way of the Lord
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:26.800]   "by doing righteousness and justice,
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.780]   "so that the Lord will bring about for Abraham
[00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:30.280]   "what he has promised him."
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:31.880]   But what has God promised him?
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:33.360]   To bring blessing to all the nations.
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:34.960]   It's in the previous verse.
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:36.600]   That's why God chose Abraham
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.360]   to bring blessing to the nations.
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:42.560]   So you have election on one side, I have chosen him,
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:45.160]   and you have mission at the end of the verse
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.680]   to bring blessing to the nations, that's God's promise,
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:51.660]   and right in the middle comes this ethical component
[00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:54.620]   of the whole thing, the way of the Lord,
[00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:57.160]   doing righteousness and justice.
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:01.140]   God says that he's chosen Abraham to be a teacher,
[00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:04.720]   to be an instructor in the ways of the Lord
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:07.500]   and a teacher of righteousness and justice.
[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:09.960]   Both of those phrases, the way of the Lord
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:12.160]   and righteousness and justice,
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:14.380]   are worth just pausing with for a moment.
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:19.800]   If you'd asked the average Old Testament Israelite,
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:22.360]   "Can you tell me about Old Testament ethics?"
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:24.240]   They wouldn't have said,
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.300]   "Well, you need to read the book by Chris Wright."
[00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:28.060]   They'd probably have looked very blank
[00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:30.440]   and not known what you were talking about.
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:31.280]   But if you'd asked them,
[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:34.040]   "Can you tell me about the way of the Lord?"
[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:36.640]   They'd say, "Ah, now I know what you mean."
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:39.000]   Because that was a common expression in the Old Testament
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   for a life lived in righteous obedience to God's law,
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.960]   in faithful obedience to God.
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:50.160]   You get a lot of it in the Psalms and elsewhere.
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:54.140]   And the way of the Lord implies a contrast.
[00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:57.640]   It's walking in Yahweh's way
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:01.160]   as distinct from the way of other gods
[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:06.160]   or of other nations or of oneself
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:10.040]   or the way of sinners, as for example in Psalm 1.
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:12.400]   Walk in Yahweh's way.
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:15.000]   And in this verse, of course, this context,
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.960]   the contrast is very clear
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:20.080]   between the way of Yahweh the Lord
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:23.480]   and the way of Sodom that immediately follows it.
[00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.480]   So walking in the way of the Lord
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:27.600]   means something different
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:30.380]   from the world that God is about to judge.
[00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:33.920]   As a metaphor, it seems to have had
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:37.520]   two possible ways of understanding it,
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:39.560]   which were more or less complementary.
[00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:42.840]   One, to walk in somebody's way means to follow them.
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:45.400]   You watch their footsteps, you watch where they're going,
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:46.720]   and you follow their way.
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:49.640]   It's an aspect of imitation of God.
[00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:51.540]   You observe what Yahweh is like,
[00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:52.960]   and you try to do the same.
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:56.960]   You follow suit, follow in his footsteps, as it were.
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:00.720]   Or it can be taken more in the way of an instruction.
[00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:04.040]   You ask somebody, "What is the way to that place?"
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:05.560]   And they say, "Well, follow this road.
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:06.680]   Go there. Don't turn that way.
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:08.560]   Don't turn that. Go this way."
[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:12.160]   You follow the instructions to the way that they tell you
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.560]   without turning off to the left or the right
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:17.560]   to what might be a wrong way or a dangerous way.
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:20.400]   And those two ideas go well together, I think,
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:24.080]   for what the Israelites meant by obedience to the law of God
[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:26.800]   to reflect the character of God
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:29.440]   and to follow the instructions of God.
[00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:30.680]   The two go together.
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:34.560]   A very good example of this, I think,
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:38.200]   comes in the book of Deuteronomy 10,
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.800]   where Moses, in the text,
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:44.840]   is kind of summarizing what God really wants.
[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:46.660]   Like many a preacher, they say,
[00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:48.240]   "Well, what is it really all about?
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:49.800]   What does it all boil down to?
[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:51.800]   What's the bottom line?"
[00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:56.320]   And so in Deuteronomy 10, verse 12,
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:57.600]   we read, "Now, Israel,
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:00.000]   what does the Lord your God ask of you
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.240]   but, one, to fear the Lord your God,
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:05.720]   to walk in all his ways,
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:09.000]   to love him, serve him, and observe his commands?"
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.280]   That's all God wants, okay?
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:12.640]   That's all it is, just those five things,
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:15.780]   fear, walk, love, serve, and obey.
[00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:18.080]   And there you see that expression,
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:19.920]   "to walk in the ways of the Lord."
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:23.280]   In my NIV, it says, "to walk in obedience to him."
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:25.720]   It's actually, "walk in the ways of the Lord."
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:27.520]   So what are the ways of the Lord?
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.440]   You can imagine some Israelite asking.
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.400]   That's all very well.
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:31.320]   We'll try to do that,
[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:34.360]   but tell us, what are the ways of the Lord?
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.560]   So a little bit later in the same chapter,
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:38.280]   just a couple of verses later,
[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:40.120]   this is what Yahweh is like.
[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:42.520]   "The Lord shows no partiality.
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:44.600]   He does not accept bribes."
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:46.280]   So you can't corrupt him.
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:50.080]   "He defends the cause of the fatherless and the widow,
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:53.760]   and he loves the alien, giving him food and clothing."
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:56.520]   That's what Yahweh God is like.
[00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:58.760]   If you want to walk in his ways,
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:01.600]   you need to find out where he is.
[00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:03.880]   And where you will find Yahweh God
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:06.560]   is not at the top of the social pile
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:09.040]   with the kings and the government and the powers that be.
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:12.200]   You will find Yahweh God right at the bottom
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.920]   with the widows, the orphans, the poor,
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:15.960]   the foreigners, the immigrants,
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.440]   feeding them, clothing them.
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:19.440]   That's what he is like.
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.680]   Oh, and by the way, Israel, you know that
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:23.540]   because you were like that once
[00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:25.280]   when you were aliens in Egypt,
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:28.040]   and God saved you and clothed you and fed you
[00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:29.720]   and watered you and led you.
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:31.400]   So the very next verse says,
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:32.760]   "That's the way of the Lord,
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:36.720]   and you therefore are to love those who are foreigners,
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:39.160]   for you yourselves were aliens in Egypt."
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:41.000]   So to walk in the way of the Lord then
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   means doing for others what God wishes to be done for them,
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.400]   or in Israel's case, doing for others
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:52.000]   what God had already done for Israel
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.720]   in delivering them and providing for them.
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:56.220]   So to walk in the way of the Lord
[00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:59.640]   has that very practical, ethical emphasis
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:01.760]   that you find throughout Deuteronomy
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:03.640]   and the Psalms and elsewhere.
[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.820]   And therefore, doing righteousness and justice
[00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:07.840]   is a kind of explication of that,
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:10.220]   just in case you didn't quite catch
[00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:12.640]   what it means to walk in the way of the Lord.
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:16.120]   The narrator expands it, walk in the ways of the Lord
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:20.000]   and doing righteousness and justice,
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.720]   a pair of words which would come very high up
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:26.720]   on any list of Old Testament ethical values.
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:31.000]   They occur individually, but they often occur together.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.200]   One, the word translated justice is mishpat,
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.040]   which is a fairly active word.
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:40.040]   It usually means doing something, you do mishpat.
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:45.360]   It's to do something which will restore a situation back
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:48.320]   to what is right and fair in relationships,
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:50.000]   which is more what the other word means,
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.120]   righteousness, tzedak or tzedakah.
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:57.120]   Mishpat is a kind of set of actions, it's something you do,
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.400]   whereas tzedakah is a state of affairs,
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:03.120]   it's what you're trying to achieve, fairness and justice.
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:05.560]   And these two words go together so often
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:07.080]   in the Old Testament that they form
[00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:10.160]   what is technically known as a hendiodes,
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:15.160]   that is, expressing a single idea with two related words,
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:18.680]   like law and order or health and safety.
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:21.000]   We often put two words together,
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.560]   and probably the nearest kind of English translation
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:26.500]   of these two words together
[00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:28.980]   would be something like social justice,
[00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:32.360]   doing what is right and just in society.
[00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:34.880]   Okay, Abraham then, says God,
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:38.120]   is to be the founding teacher, as it were,
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:40.960]   of an academy of ethical instruction
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:44.440]   in the way of the Lord and doing righteousness and justice.
[00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:46.900]   And God says, that's why I chose him,
[00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:51.480]   that he would be that, that this ethical core
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:55.480]   to Abraham's purpose in God's mission and his descendants,
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:57.680]   not just him, but his household after him.
[00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:01.040]   But let's come back to that verse 19,
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:02.440]   because I'd like us to see
[00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:05.500]   the missional logic of it in there.
[00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:08.340]   I tried to read it in this way
[00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:11.620]   in order to express the point I'm trying to make,
[00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:14.800]   because here's a verse which has three clauses
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:18.040]   joined together by two expressions of purpose.
[00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.620]   And I've translated it in this way,
[00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:25.000]   I have known him, that is, I have chosen him,
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.800]   for the purpose that he will teach his household
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:30.560]   and children after him to keep the way of the Lord
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:33.600]   and so on, for the purpose that the Lord
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.760]   will bring about for Abraham what he has promised.
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:37.080]   And the reason why I've put it like that
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:39.520]   is because the word in the Hebrew
[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:41.840]   is quite emphatically meaning that.
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:44.880]   It's, as you may know, if you study Hebrew at all,
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:46.940]   it's a very kind of paratactic language.
[00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:49.280]   They tend to just to put things side by side
[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:51.200]   and stick what in the middle,
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:55.800]   and you just read the intention of the sentence into it.
[00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:57.560]   But here it is quite explicit,
[00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:02.560]   the word that means in order, l'ma'am, is here twice.
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:06.800]   So God says, I chose him, election, l'ma'am,
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:09.520]   so that he will do these things, l'ma'am,
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:13.240]   so that I will be able to keep my promise to him.
[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:16.200]   So here is a verse then which binds together
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:20.040]   in one sentence, election, I chose him,
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:23.000]   ethics, where the Lord and righteous justice,
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.360]   and mission.
[00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:26.320]   They're together syntactically
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.880]   in the grammar of the sentence
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:32.640]   and theologically in the purposes of God,
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:36.320]   'cause this is God speaking about God's own self.
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:37.940]   I mean, this is pretty pure theology.
[00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:39.480]   If you want pure theology,
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:42.120]   it's God talking to God about God,
[00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:43.840]   and that's what's happening here.
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:47.960]   God expresses his own intention that this is what he wants.
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:51.440]   And it's a relatively easy step, it seems to me,
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:55.360]   from this verse here in Genesis 18
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:57.200]   to the way the apostle Paul
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:00.060]   expressed the purpose of his mission,
[00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:02.040]   which he says twice in Romans,
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:03.400]   at the beginning and the end of Romans,
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:07.080]   Romans 1, verse five, and Romans 16, verse 26,
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:09.720]   Paul says that his whole life's work
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:14.720]   was to bring about the obedience of faith among all nations.
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:17.280]   Faith among all nations is very Abrahamic.
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:20.000]   The obedience of faith is very Abrahamic,
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.960]   and Paul says he wants to create communities
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:26.920]   among the nations of faith and obedience
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:29.360]   who have been chosen in Abraham
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:32.720]   that are also committed to living in the ways of Abraham.
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.800]   That is an ethical obedience.
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:37.800]   So this, to draw this part to a close,
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:39.920]   this shows us again, doesn't it,
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:44.200]   the importance of recognizing what we mean by election
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:46.720]   when we talk about the election of God's people.
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:48.720]   We saw in our earlier lectures
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:52.000]   that it's not merely soteriological,
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.840]   that is to do with salvation,
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:55.880]   it's also missiological,
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:58.520]   it's to do with the purpose of our election.
[00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:01.040]   And it's not only soteriological and missiological,
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:02.600]   it's also ethical.
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:06.680]   It's in order that we should live in a certain way.
[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:09.740]   God has chosen his community
[00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:12.120]   to be a community shaped by himself,
[00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:14.380]   by his own ethical character,
[00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:17.920]   walking in the ways of this God, the Lord God,
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:21.180]   and a community that is being taught to do that,
[00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:24.200]   to do the way of the Lord in righteousness and justice,
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:29.200]   and being taught to live that way in a world like Sodom,
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.840]   a world filled with oppression and injustice
[00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:34.760]   and perversion and disorder of all kinds.
[00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:36.880]   The people of God are to be a community
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:39.040]   that will bring a blessing to the nations.
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:41.240]   So in other words, according to this verse,
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:43.160]   Genesis 18, verse 19,
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:47.040]   the ethical quality of the life of God's people
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:49.720]   is the vital link in the verse
[00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:52.760]   between their election and their mission.
[00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:56.840]   You can't separate the two or the three in this verse.
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:01.360]   There is no biblical mission without biblical ethics,
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:02.800]   without biblical living.
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:06.040]   So that's what I wanted to say from Abraham
[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:08.440]   and from that text in Genesis 18.
[00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:11.360]   Let's move on then to the Exodus
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:13.600]   and back again to the verse
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.600]   where we were the other day, yesterday.
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:19.240]   And here we've moved on from election
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:22.240]   to redemption and missional ethics,
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:24.520]   because of course the book of Exodus
[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:27.640]   is the whole story of Israel's redemption out of Egypt
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:29.940]   and all that then flowed from that
[00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:33.560]   in terms of the covenant and the law and so on.
[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:36.040]   So here's the verse that we had yesterday.
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:39.920]   I've read it before, Exodus chapter 19, verses four to six,
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:41.560]   where God says to the Israelites,
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:44.520]   and again, this is my own translation,
[00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:47.200]   "You yourselves have seen what I did,
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:49.740]   "what I have done to Egypt,
[00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:51.920]   "and I carried you on wings of eagles
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:53.560]   "and brought you to myself."
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:55.220]   Here you are at Mount Sinai.
[00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:57.760]   "Now then, if you really obey my voice
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:59.440]   "and keep my covenant,
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:02.120]   "you will be for me,"
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:06.360]   li, for me, "a special personal possession
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.720]   "among all the peoples.
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:11.280]   "For to me," it's the same word,
[00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:13.180]   "belongs the whole earth.
[00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:16.160]   "But you, you will be for me,"
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:17.240]   the same word again,
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:20.120]   "a priestly kingdom and a holy nation."
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:23.040]   So here is God claiming, as it were,
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:26.320]   this possessive relationship with Israel.
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:29.200]   You are my people, my special possession,
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.040]   that possessive word, li,
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:33.400]   but also is expressed in terms of,
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:36.600]   you will be that for me
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:38.960]   in the context of all the peoples
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:39.800]   and the whole earth,
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:41.720]   which also belongs to me.
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:43.680]   To me belongs the whole earth.
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:45.520]   You will be, for me,
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:47.400]   a people within that context.
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:51.120]   This is very much a hinge text
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:52.400]   in the book of Exodus.
[00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:57.160]   The earlier chapters, chapters one to 18,
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:00.120]   have all been the narrative of redemption,
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:01.640]   the great story of the Exodus,
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:03.440]   plagues of Egypt, crossing the Red Sea,
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:04.680]   and all of that.
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:05.920]   And the rest of the book
[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:07.840]   will be about the giving of the law
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:08.880]   and the covenant,
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:11.560]   and then the building of the temple.
[00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:13.600]   And here is this verse right in the middle,
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:17.040]   in a sense, looking back to God's past action.
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:18.960]   You've seen what I have done.
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:22.120]   And also setting that within the universal context
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:24.320]   of God's ownership of the whole earth
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:25.800]   and all the nations.
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:28.480]   So God's intention for Israel
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:31.240]   is again being set within the framework
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:33.680]   of God's intention for all the nations,
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:35.840]   as per Abraham.
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:38.320]   Now, in the last lecture,
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:39.880]   the second lecture yesterday,
[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:41.680]   we thought about what it meant for Israel
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:43.640]   to be God's priesthood
[00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:45.560]   in the midst of the nations,
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:47.880]   as the people who would be for God,
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:48.840]   for the nations,
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:51.040]   bringing the knowledge of God to the nations,
[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:53.320]   bringing the nations to the experience of God,
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:55.520]   God's representatives in the world.
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:56.640]   But as I said yesterday,
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.960]   how would Israel be that?
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:00.720]   They could only be a priestly nation
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:02.720]   if, like their own priests,
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:04.880]   they were a holy nation,
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:07.160]   that is set apart for God.
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:09.520]   And that's the word that I'm picking up now.
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:12.160]   Now, like the word priest itself,
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:13.880]   the word holiness or holy,
[00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:16.560]   in Eastern English,
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:21.440]   I don't know what that sounds in Cantonese or Chinese,
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:22.960]   holiness is one of those words
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:25.360]   which is easily misunderstood
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:28.280]   because it sounds very religious.
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:29.680]   It sounds like God is saying,
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:31.880]   you will be the most religious people on earth,
[00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:32.720]   or something like that,
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:34.880]   which is not what he's saying at all.
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:38.400]   To be holy basically meant to be different,
[00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:39.800]   to be set apart,
[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:41.400]   to be distinctive.
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:44.880]   So, you've got lots of plates and cups
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:47.720]   and vessels and things that people use,
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:50.160]   but some will be set apart
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:52.680]   to be used for God's service in the temple.
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:55.160]   And there are lots of people around,
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:56.320]   you know, men, women, and so on,
[00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:59.520]   but some are going to be set apart to be priests.
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:03.840]   There's a distinctiveness about that holiness.
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:05.480]   And so that's what God is saying here
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:08.160]   about Israel as a nation.
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:09.840]   It means being a distinctive,
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:11.920]   different kind of people
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:14.360]   because they worship Yahweh,
[00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:16.200]   who is a very different God
[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:18.320]   from the gods of the nations.
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:19.440]   Now, you'll see in the text
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:22.360]   that I mentioned two passages in Leviticus,
[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:24.240]   and the first says this very clearly.
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:27.280]   It's Leviticus chapter 18, verses three to four,
[00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:30.360]   where God says this, I quote,
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:34.480]   "You must not do as they do in Egypt,
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:35.640]   "where you used to live.
[00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:39.360]   "And you must not do as they do
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:42.360]   "in the land of Canaan, where I'm bringing you.
[00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:45.240]   "Do not follow their practices.
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:47.280]   "You must obey my laws
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:49.720]   "and be careful to follow my decrees
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:53.320]   "because I am Yahweh the Lord, your God.
[00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:56.000]   "You shall be holy for I am holy,"
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.560]   says Leviticus 19, verse two.
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:01.160]   In other words, Israel was to be distinctive,
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:04.400]   as distinctive from the other nations
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:07.440]   as Yahweh was different from all the other gods.
[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:10.960]   That emphasis there comes very clearly
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:12.800]   in the past and the future.
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:14.200]   Don't be like the Egyptians.
[00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:15.920]   They worship the gods of empire,
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:19.120]   of armies, of power, of glory and splendor, all that.
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:20.560]   You don't need to be like that.
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:22.680]   And don't do as they do in Canaan,
[00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:25.160]   where they worship sex, health, wealth, and all that
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:28.640]   because that's what Baal stands for, the god of fertility.
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:30.200]   You don't need to go like that either
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:33.000]   because you're following me and my ways.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.800]   In other words, Israel was to be Yahweh-like,
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:39.160]   just like we use the word Christ-like.
[00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:44.120]   They were to be Yahweh-like rather than like the nations.
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:45.840]   And the tragedy was that later on,
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:48.960]   they would want to be precisely like the other nations
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:50.840]   when they demanded a king.
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:54.680]   So they were to do as Yahweh does,
[00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:57.480]   not as the other nations do.
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:59.800]   So holiness then, you see, for Israel
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:03.320]   was a very practical down-to-earth thing.
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:07.920]   It meant, as it were, imitating the transcendent holiness
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:11.320]   of Yahweh, their God, but doing it in the practical,
[00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:13.560]   everyday, down-to-earth things of life.
[00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:16.440]   Now, of course, at one level,
[00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:19.400]   there were ritual or symbolic ways
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:22.840]   in which this holiness, this distinctiveness was expressed.
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:26.640]   We know about the laws of clean and unclean food and so on.
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:29.000]   And that clean-unclean distinction
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   is explicitly rationalized in Leviticus 20,
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.760]   verses 25 and 26,
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:39.000]   to symbolize Israel's separation from the nations.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.640]   God says, "You must respect what's clean
[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:43.040]   "and what's unclean
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:46.000]   "because I have set you apart from the nations."
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.120]   So the clean-unclean distinction was symbolic
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:51.120]   in the Old Testament of the distinction
[00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:53.280]   between Jews and Gentiles,
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:56.160]   which, of course, is why in the New Testament,
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:59.960]   when that distinction is dissolved in Christ,
[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:02.120]   that in Christ there is no Jew or Gentile.
[00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:04.800]   We become one in him, that at that point,
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:06.840]   that clean-unclean law distinction
[00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:09.040]   then disappears for those who are in Christ.
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:10.560]   There's no need to observe that.
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:12.120]   That's a theological reason.
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:18.080]   But alongside that ritual or symbolic kind of holiness,
[00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:21.200]   the most comprehensive list of holiness that we have
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:25.560]   is in Leviticus 19, which is why that text is there.
[00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:28.120]   It's a passage, a chapter, of course, which begins,
[00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:32.000]   "You shall be holy as I, the Lord your God, am holy,"
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.680]   which colloquially means
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:35.240]   you've got to be a different kind of people
[00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:37.200]   'cause I'm a different kind of God.
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:39.840]   You've got to be like me, not like the other nations
[00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:41.960]   there in Leviticus chapter 19.
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:43.920]   And here's something I used to do
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:46.800]   when I used to teach the Old Testament in India.
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:50.880]   I used to, we'd get to this chapter
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:52.720]   in my course on the Pentateuch.
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:54.600]   I used to have 50 lectures on the Pentateuch.
[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:58.560]   Can you imagine that in India at the time,
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:00.080]   back in the 1980s?
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:01.680]   And we'd get to Leviticus,
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:04.720]   and I would ask the class to read this chapter,
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:07.640]   quietly in the class, and then say,
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:10.240]   "How many of the laws in this chapter
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:12.400]   "are about, quote, religion?"
[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:15.520]   And there are a few, you know,
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:18.680]   about the kind of sacrifices you offer,
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:20.240]   one or two things about, you know,
[00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:22.200]   distinctions in meat and stuff like that.
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:23.600]   So there's a few which you could say
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:25.600]   are ritual or religious.
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:29.040]   And so, "So what is most of the rest of the chapter about?"
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:32.000]   And the obvious answer is that it's about every day,
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.320]   down to earth, practical life on the farm,
[00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:37.680]   in the marketplace, in the neighborhood,
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:39.360]   in the market stall, and so on.
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:41.800]   And then I would ask the class,
[00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:45.040]   "So if these laws in Leviticus 19
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:48.880]   "were to become statute law in India today,
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:51.040]   "what difference might they make?"
[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:52.360]   And they would look at the chapter again,
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:54.360]   and then they would start to sort of giggle a bit,
[00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:57.200]   and laugh, and realize that actually,
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:01.200]   some of these laws are very profoundly related
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:04.160]   to social and economic issues,
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:06.600]   which we find all around us today.
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:08.520]   So, for example, there are laws here
[00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:10.320]   which have to do with respect for the family
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:12.480]   and the community, the treatment of the elderly,
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:14.200]   and the treatment of your children.
[00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:17.360]   There are laws which to do with economic generosity
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:20.040]   in agriculture, how you run your farm,
[00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:22.560]   and how you provide for the needy.
[00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:24.680]   There are commandments about economic justice
[00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:27.480]   in employment rights, how you treat your workers
[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:29.560]   and pay them, in verse 13.
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:33.320]   Do not hold back the wages of a hired worker overnight.
[00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:36.520]   There are laws about judicial integrity,
[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:38.600]   in verses 12 and 15.
[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:42.680]   Don't swear falsely, don't pervert the course of justice,
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:45.000]   in verse 15, don't show partiality
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.160]   to the poor or the rich.
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:49.920]   There are laws about sexual integrity.
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:53.880]   There are laws about the treatment of ethnic minorities
[00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:56.800]   in the society, so that the foreigner who lives among you
[00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:59.080]   must be treated as the native born.
[00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:01.520]   We haven't got there yet,
[00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:03.600]   in even any modern society, have we?
[00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:05.840]   But in Israel, whatever it is,
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:08.520]   1300 years before Christ, they were being told,
[00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:11.160]   treat foreigners the way you treat yourselves.
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:12.080]   Very interesting.
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:14.160]   And then there's the law about commercial honesty,
[00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:17.320]   also at the end of the chapter, verses 35 and 36.
[00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:20.040]   Don't have separate weights for when you're buying
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:23.040]   or selling, so that you can sort of, you know,
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:25.600]   sell expensively and buy cheaply.
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:27.560]   Don't cheat in business.
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:30.760]   So here are laws which are then echoed in Exodus,
[00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:34.840]   Deuteronomy, and elsewhere, and reflected in the prophets,
[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:37.440]   and in the Psalms, and in the wisdom literature,
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:40.120]   and indeed, you'll find some of these laws
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:42.960]   that are deeply impactful on Jesus
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:44.400]   in the Sermon on the Mount,
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:47.160]   and the apostle Peter in his first letter,
[00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:48.760]   and the book of James.
[00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:51.680]   This is one of the most influential chapters in the Bible,
[00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:52.800]   Leviticus 19.
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:55.560]   When I get to the new creation,
[00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:58.320]   I look forward to asking Moses,
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:00.400]   you know, why did you leave it to that chapter
[00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:01.480]   before you said all this?
[00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:03.760]   Because, you know, didn't you know nobody's ever gonna get
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:05.760]   to chapter 19 with Leviticus?
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:08.680]   They all give up after about chapter two.
[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:11.960]   It's a very important chapter, Leviticus 19.
[00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:13.560]   And you see, the point I'm trying to make here
[00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:17.160]   is this is not some kind of socialist charter.
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:22.760]   This is biblical holiness, according to Leviticus.
[00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:26.360]   This is where that famous verse that Jesus called
[00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:28.360]   the second greatest commandment of the law comes,
[00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:30.280]   love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:32.040]   It's from Leviticus chapter 19.
[00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:36.480]   So in all of these ways, then, I need to keep moving along.
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:38.680]   Down to earth, practical social ethics.
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:42.440]   Israel was summoned to respond to their redemption.
[00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:45.400]   You are the people whom God has redeemed out of Egypt.
[00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:48.920]   Now you must live in a way which reflects the character
[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:51.000]   of the God who has redeemed you.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.760]   If Israel were to be God's priesthood
[00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:54.120]   in the midst of the nations,
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:56.800]   that is, Yahweh's representatives,
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:59.600]   then they have to be ethically different from the nations,
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:02.120]   not just religiously different.
[00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:03.960]   It wasn't just that they would say to the Canaanites,
[00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:05.640]   oh, you worship Baal, that's very interesting.
[00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:07.480]   We worship Yahweh, let's have a conversation.
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:10.140]   No, their whole lives would be different
[00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:12.880]   as a result of the worship of Yahweh,
[00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:14.040]   which is illustrated, by the way,
[00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:15.920]   in the story of Naboth, isn't it?
[00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:20.040]   Because when Ahab wanted to buy some land off Naboth,
[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:21.320]   Naboth said, oh, I can't do that
[00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:22.840]   because the law doesn't allow it.
[00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:23.960]   And Ahab knew that he couldn't
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:27.440]   'cause he was an Israelite king, and the law prohibited it.
[00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:30.280]   But his wife was Jezebel, and his wife wasn't Israelite.
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:31.160]   She was Canaanite.
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:33.640]   She came from up Tyre and Sidon.
[00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:37.640]   And where she lived, under the rule of Baal,
[00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:39.920]   kings and queens could have whatever they want.
[00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:41.200]   And so she says to Ahab,
[00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:44.160]   is that the way you behave as a king in Israel?
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:46.520]   Ahab said, well, actually, yes,
[00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:47.800]   because that's what the law says.
[00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:48.760]   She said, well, let me do it then.
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:51.640]   She gets the land, and she uses Israel's law
[00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:54.240]   to get rid of Naboth so that the land could be stolen.
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:56.200]   So you see this contrast between people
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:58.440]   who live under the reign of Yahweh
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:01.080]   will live with the security of economic viability
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:03.420]   for themselves and their families into the future
[00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:06.160]   because God has given them an economic system
[00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:07.720]   which will support them.
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:09.420]   But if you live under the reign of Baal,
[00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:11.440]   then it's just whoever takes whatever they want
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:13.240]   if they've got the power to do so.
[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:15.920]   Very different ethical system altogether.
[00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:20.600]   So Exodus 19 then, with the expansion in Leviticus 19,
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:24.760]   makes this basic insistence that if God's people
[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:27.400]   are going to fulfill their God-given mission,
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:30.920]   then they need to be what they are,
[00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:34.340]   that is, the holy people of the holy God.
[00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:38.500]   Israel's identity as a priestly kingdom
[00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:41.860]   generates a mission to the nations,
[00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:43.620]   and that mission to the nations
[00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:47.500]   demands an ethic to be a holy nation.
[00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:50.780]   So that's the first two, Genesis, election and ethics,
[00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:53.300]   Exodus, redemption and ethics,
[00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:56.300]   and that leads, therefore, lastly, to Deuteronomy
[00:39:56.300 --> 00:40:00.640]   and the covenantal community built around this covenant
[00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:03.640]   and how that then affects the way they should live.
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:06.100]   So what have we seen so far?
[00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:08.380]   We saw in Genesis 18, verse 19,
[00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:11.180]   that the ethical response of God required of his people
[00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:15.060]   was integral to the very purpose of election,
[00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:18.400]   and in Exodus chapter 19 and Leviticus 19,
[00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:22.140]   we've seen that obedience to God's covenant law
[00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:24.820]   was the essential response of God's people to grace,
[00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:27.560]   the grace of redemption in the Exodus.
[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:30.200]   When we arrive in the book of Deuteronomy,
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:34.900]   Israel is just across the Jordan from the promised land.
[00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:36.680]   The book of Deuteronomy, as I'm sure you know,
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:40.340]   presents itself to us, the way it's framed and shaped,
[00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:43.280]   presents itself to us as the speeches of Moses
[00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:47.140]   to the Israelites as they consider their future life
[00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:52.060]   in the land, the next phase of the canonical journey.
[00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:55.820]   And there in the land, they would be summoned to live
[00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:58.900]   as this covenantal community,
[00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:02.340]   demonstrating their loyalty to the living God, Yahweh,
[00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:06.660]   and doing so in a context where they would be surrounded
[00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:08.980]   by other nations, by other peoples.
[00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:11.940]   Initially, the Canaanites, although they would be driven out
[00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:15.980]   but those would remain, and then the other nations as well.
[00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:18.540]   And the passage that I want us to look at here,
[00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:19.700]   as you can see on the screen,
[00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:22.700]   is Deuteronomy chapter four, verses six to eight.
[00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:25.660]   But Deuteronomy four, just to give you
[00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:27.620]   a little bit of context,
[00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:30.180]   chapter four of Deuteronomy is almost like a kind
[00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:32.980]   of microcosm of the whole book.
[00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:35.940]   It's a sort of summarizing prologue
[00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:37.800]   of all that's going to follow.
[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:41.820]   It's summoning Israel basically to covenant loyalty
[00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:45.720]   and exclusive worship of Yahweh alone.
[00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:48.860]   That's what really is the heart of the chapter.
[00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:52.060]   And the warning in the chapter is that Israel must
[00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:57.060]   at all costs avoid idolatry, going after other gods.
[00:41:57.220 --> 00:41:59.580]   That's repeated again and again.
[00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:04.500]   But that religious exclusivism, Yahweh alone,
[00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:07.700]   and the worship of Yahweh alone, needs to be seen,
[00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:10.820]   especially in this chapter, the beginning and the end,
[00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:13.100]   of Israel's role in relation
[00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:15.400]   to the nations that surround them.
[00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:18.620]   Let me read just towards the close of the chapter,
[00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:23.300]   verses 32 to 34, where Israel is told by God
[00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:26.520]   that they have a unique experience of the living God,
[00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:29.060]   which no other nation has.
[00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:32.100]   Ask now about the former days long before your time,
[00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:34.620]   from the day God created man, sorry,
[00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:36.500]   created human beings on the earth.
[00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:38.660]   Ask from one end of the heavens to the other.
[00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:42.140]   In other words, the beginning of time and the whole of space.
[00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:45.220]   That's a pretty big research project if you're doing a PhD.
[00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:48.260]   So wherever you look, look wherever you like.
[00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:50.500]   Has anything as great as this ever happened?
[00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:52.620]   Has anything like it ever been heard of?
[00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:56.340]   Has any other nation heard the voice of God
[00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:59.280]   speaking out of the fire as you have and lived?
[00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:01.360]   Meaning, of course, Mount Sinai.
[00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:03.680]   Has any other God ever tried to take for himself
[00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:06.560]   one nation out of another nation by testing signs,
[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:08.600]   wonders, war, mighty hand, and so on?
[00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:10.480]   Like all the things the Lord, your God,
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:12.320]   did for you in Egypt before your eyes?
[00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:13.640]   That's the Exodus.
[00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:16.000]   And the answer to the rhetorical questions are, of course,
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.200]   no, the Mount Sinai experience
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:21.560]   and the Exodus experience are unique.
[00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:24.000]   They're unprecedented.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.920]   They'd not been done before, and they're unparalleled.
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:29.960]   They've not been done for any other nation.
[00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:33.960]   So you, Israel, you have a knowledge and experience
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:38.320]   of the living God, which at this moment in history is unique.
[00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:40.540]   No other nation has this.
[00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:42.960]   You were shown these things, verse 35,
[00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:45.840]   so that you might know what the other nations
[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:49.720]   do not yet know, that the Lord Yahweh is God,
[00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:52.280]   and beside him there is no other.
[00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:55.680]   And he then repeats all of that from verses 36 to 39,
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:58.360]   says it all over again, in order to make absolutely sure
[00:43:58.360 --> 00:43:59.600]   that that is seen.
[00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:03.760]   So you see, given that unique status and privilege
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:07.600]   that Israel has, that of all the nations on the planet
[00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:10.720]   at that time, they are the one nation
[00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:14.880]   who have experienced God's redemption in Exodus
[00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:18.320]   and have experienced and enjoyed God's revelation
[00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:23.040]   in Mount Sinai, given that that is their unique status,
[00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:25.920]   then they must steward that, they must hold that,
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:28.800]   in a sense, on trust for the nations,
[00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:31.680]   and therefore they must live in such a way
[00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:34.160]   that the nations will start asking questions
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:36.920]   about this God and this way of life.
[00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:39.960]   And that's what we read in chapter four, verses six to eight.
[00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:43.200]   Now, as you probably know, again,
[00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:45.120]   if you've done any biblical studies,
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:48.480]   the book of Deuteronomy is a very motivational book.
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:52.920]   It takes many of the laws of Exodus and Leviticus
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:56.040]   and repeats many of them, but it repeats them often
[00:44:56.040 --> 00:45:00.200]   with some motive clauses, why should you obey these laws,
[00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:03.080]   in order for this or that, or whatever it might be.
[00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:07.600]   It's a kind of preached law, as I think Ponrat once said.
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:11.400]   So here in verses six to eight, we read a motivation,
[00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:13.520]   why should you observe these laws?
[00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:16.000]   Verse six, observe these laws carefully,
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.660]   for this will show your wisdom and understanding
[00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:23.360]   to the nations, there they are, all of a sudden,
[00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:25.800]   who will hear about all these decrees and will say,
[00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:29.800]   surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people,
[00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:31.640]   because what other nation is so great
[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:33.480]   as to have their gods near them,
[00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:37.600]   the way Yahweh, our God, is near us whenever we pray to him,
[00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:39.320]   and what other nation is so great
[00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:41.800]   as to have such righteous decrees and laws
[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:44.700]   as this body of laws that I'm setting before you today?
[00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:47.920]   Now these verses then, you see, six to eight,
[00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:51.800]   they said Israel's ethical obedience to God
[00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:54.520]   and to God's law in the land, when they would get there,
[00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:56.960]   within the covenant, they set all of that
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:59.540]   in the context of the watching nations.
[00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:04.400]   Obedience to the law was not for Israel's benefit alone.
[00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:06.880]   In fact, it's a marked feature of the Old Testament,
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:10.720]   isn't it, that Israel lived in a very public stage.
[00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:13.440]   I mean, the history of Israel all through the books,
[00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:16.160]   right through Samuel, Kings, and so on, right on through,
[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:18.520]   the other nations are always there,
[00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:21.560]   most often fighting against Israel, but they're there.
[00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:25.420]   Israel is not in some vacuum-sealed isolation
[00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:26.780]   from the world.
[00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:29.120]   They live on a very open stage
[00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:31.580]   in the international ancient Near East.
[00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:35.680]   But what God is saying here is that that visibility
[00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:39.660]   of Israel has a theological purpose,
[00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:43.560]   that God wants the nations to see his people
[00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:45.320]   and to ask questions.
[00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:48.400]   And indeed, the nations in this passage
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:52.000]   and in a number of other places in the Torah and elsewhere,
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.520]   the nations are presented almost like spectators
[00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:59.920]   in a drama, almost like the audience
[00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:01.340]   of what's happening on stage.
[00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:04.480]   They're witnesses to what God is doing in Israel,
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:07.360]   which may be positive or negative.
[00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:09.400]   In these verses, the hope is that the nations
[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:12.680]   might be impressed with the wisdom of Israel,
[00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:15.700]   but more likely, as we read later in the book,
[00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:17.960]   the nations are gonna be shocked
[00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:22.020]   by the severity of God's judgment on Israel
[00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:23.200]   when they abandon God.
[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:25.280]   That comes at the end of Deuteronomy,
[00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:28.360]   when the judgments and the curses will fall on God's people
[00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:29.800]   and the nations are, "Why is this happening?
[00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:32.280]   "Why are these people being so badly judged?"
[00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:34.680]   And God will say, "Because they disobeyed me."
[00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:38.500]   So either way, whether faithfully obeying God
[00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:41.000]   or unfaithfully disobeying God,
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.360]   the people of God are an open book.
[00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:45.880]   They can be seen by the world around.
[00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:50.080]   And let's be honest, that's as true for the church
[00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:52.240]   as it is for Israel,
[00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:55.160]   and that's part of the challenge of Christian ethics.
[00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:57.080]   So the nations then, in this verse,
[00:47:57.080 --> 00:47:59.360]   they will take notice, they will take an interest
[00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:03.220]   in this phenomenon of Israel as a society.
[00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:06.920]   And the rhetorical questions that are asked in the passage
[00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:11.920]   sharpen the point by speaking about Israel's greatness.
[00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:13.760]   What are the nations so great?
[00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:16.860]   Now, Israel was never a great nation
[00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:20.540]   in any way we would use that word today.
[00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:23.540]   They were never a very big nation or a powerful nation
[00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:26.460]   or a military nation or anything, really.
[00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:27.740]   I mean, to the most extent,
[00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:29.740]   was perhaps under the empire of Solomon,
[00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:31.580]   and that didn't last very long.
[00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:33.080]   But according to this text,
[00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:34.940]   the greatness of Israel will be based
[00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:37.120]   on the nearness of God.
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:38.280]   Our God is nearest.
[00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:41.640]   They have a God with an intimacy of prayer and worship.
[00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:45.200]   And secondly, the righteousness of the Torah,
[00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:47.180]   the quality of their social justice,
[00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:49.740]   which would be greater than any of the other nations.
[00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:51.780]   And these would be the factors
[00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:55.280]   that would lie behind this external reputation
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:57.020]   and curiosity.
[00:48:57.020 --> 00:48:59.160]   As far as the nations could see,
[00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:01.020]   the thing that was different about Israel
[00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:05.440]   was to be seen as a matter of wisdom and understanding.
[00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:08.040]   And it would have to do with the presence of God
[00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:11.320]   and the justice of God being exercised in their midst.
[00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:15.400]   So from the point of view of our concern here
[00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:18.440]   of bringing mission and ethics together,
[00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:22.720]   these verses articulate a motivation for obedience to God,
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:24.980]   which is easily overlooked.
[00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:26.720]   Because what God is saying here is,
[00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:30.260]   if only God's people would live as God intended,
[00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:32.700]   if you would obey these laws,
[00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:35.420]   then the nations would notice.
[00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:38.180]   But then we remind ourselves that Israel, in any case,
[00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:40.100]   only existed for the ultimate purpose
[00:49:40.100 --> 00:49:41.580]   of being a blessing to the nations.
[00:49:41.580 --> 00:49:42.880]   That's the reason for their election,
[00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:44.780]   as we've been saying all through.
[00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:47.620]   And so here we find that one aspect
[00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:50.780]   of being a blessing to the nations
[00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:55.460]   is by providing a model of national social justice
[00:49:55.460 --> 00:49:58.760]   that the nations could observe and ask questions about.
[00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:01.280]   And so the missional challenge of these verses
[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:05.480]   is that the ethical quality of the life of God's people,
[00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:08.400]   their obedience to God's law and his constitution
[00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:11.280]   and the whole economic political system he was giving them,
[00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:15.000]   would be a vital factor in the attraction
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:16.840]   of the nations to the living God.
[00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:21.720]   In the book of Isaiah, this is described as their light.
[00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:24.160]   Nations will come to your light.
[00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:26.820]   But when Isaiah talks about the light of God's people
[00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:29.260]   in chapter 58, he says it has to do
[00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:31.020]   with removing the yoke of oppression,
[00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:33.180]   feeding the poor, caring for the needy,
[00:50:33.180 --> 00:50:35.460]   then your light will break forth
[00:50:35.460 --> 00:50:37.180]   and your righteousness like the dawn.
[00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:38.900]   That's Isaiah 58.
[00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:41.900]   And so the light of God's people
[00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:44.180]   is not just in a sense the light of the gospel
[00:50:44.180 --> 00:50:45.740]   that we know the living God,
[00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:48.860]   it's also the attractional light of living in a way
[00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:50.360]   which draws people to God.
[00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:53.140]   And that was an Old Testament principle
[00:50:53.140 --> 00:50:56.200]   which Jesus picks up when he says to his disciples,
[00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:57.740]   perhaps a bit surprised, he says,
[00:50:57.740 --> 00:51:00.700]   "You know, you guys, you are the light of the world.
[00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:02.220]   "So let your good deeds shine
[00:51:02.220 --> 00:51:05.020]   "so that people may be drawn to God."
[00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:08.260]   Because after all, when you think about this verse again,
[00:51:08.260 --> 00:51:13.260]   what would the nations actually see in Israel?
[00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:16.820]   They wouldn't see the nearness of God
[00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:20.380]   because the nearness of God in a sense by definition
[00:51:20.380 --> 00:51:21.380]   is invisible.
[00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:26.020]   God is not even there as a statue in the temple.
[00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:28.620]   This was part of the scandal of Israel's faith
[00:51:28.620 --> 00:51:32.380]   that they didn't have an image of their God.
[00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:33.940]   So when the nations look at Israel,
[00:51:33.940 --> 00:51:34.780]   "Where are your gods?
[00:51:34.780 --> 00:51:36.060]   "You really haven't got one."
[00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:39.160]   They know our God is in heaven doing what he wants.
[00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:41.620]   And these other gods that you've got
[00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:43.740]   are powerless and useless.
[00:51:43.740 --> 00:51:47.660]   So the nations would not see the nearness of God.
[00:51:47.660 --> 00:51:51.300]   There is a vital link then between the invisible claims
[00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:53.260]   that Israel would make about their God
[00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:55.420]   as they pray to him would be modeled
[00:51:55.420 --> 00:52:00.420]   in the very visible practical way in which they would live.
[00:52:00.420 --> 00:52:03.020]   And the world will only be interested
[00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:05.740]   in the God we say we worship
[00:52:05.740 --> 00:52:08.260]   when they see the way we live
[00:52:08.260 --> 00:52:10.680]   according to the way we worship.
[00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:12.860]   And if people don't see any difference
[00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:16.540]   in the lives of those who make claims about their God,
[00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:18.100]   they're not going to be particularly interested
[00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:19.780]   in the God they say they worship.
[00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:23.780]   So there's a very missional point at stake here,
[00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:26.100]   which certainly hits us as Christians as well.
[00:52:26.100 --> 00:52:30.540]   Well, that leads me just to a few concluding echoes
[00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:31.800]   then in the New Testament.
[00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:34.180]   I haven't picked all of this up into the New Testament,
[00:52:34.180 --> 00:52:36.640]   but I think we need to be doing it in one or two ways.
[00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:38.620]   Because as I've said all the way through,
[00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:42.660]   it's this narrative framework of Old Testament Israel,
[00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:45.760]   which was the framework within which Christ
[00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:48.500]   and his apostles understood the gospel.
[00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:51.760]   They understood that it's the God of Israel
[00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:54.120]   who has kept his promise to the world
[00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:56.660]   by sending his son Jesus as Messiah,
[00:52:56.660 --> 00:52:58.620]   as the savior of the world.
[00:52:58.620 --> 00:53:02.740]   And so what's very clear is that when these Old Testament,
[00:53:02.740 --> 00:53:04.900]   these New Testament apostles thought
[00:53:04.900 --> 00:53:08.160]   about living as Christians in the world,
[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:12.780]   they used these themes of election, redemption, and covenant
[00:53:12.780 --> 00:53:16.260]   and drew from them the kind of ethical implications
[00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:18.260]   that we've been seeing in the Old Testament.
[00:53:18.260 --> 00:53:19.900]   And I just wanted to give two examples,
[00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:23.460]   one from Ephesians and the other from 1 Peter.
[00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:28.400]   In Ephesians, Paul links our election,
[00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:31.660]   which he speaks about right up front in chapter one,
[00:53:31.660 --> 00:53:33.700]   both to its ethical purpose
[00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:36.260]   that we are to be holy and blameless
[00:53:36.260 --> 00:53:38.220]   and to live to the praise of God's glory.
[00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:40.100]   That's what he says we've been chosen for,
[00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:42.460]   to praise his glorious grace.
[00:53:42.460 --> 00:53:46.140]   We are chosen in him to be holy and blameless in his sight.
[00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:48.000]   That's very Old Testament language.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.260]   So there's the ethical purpose,
[00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:54.740]   but also he links that to God's great missional purpose
[00:53:54.740 --> 00:53:56.460]   for the cosmos.
[00:53:56.460 --> 00:53:59.700]   Same chapter, Ephesians chapter one, verses nine and 10,
[00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:02.800]   God's purpose is to bring unity to all things
[00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:04.620]   in heaven and earth under Christ.
[00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:07.420]   So in one, 'cause it's all one sentence in the Greek,
[00:54:07.420 --> 00:54:11.000]   Paul binds together God's election of his people
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:12.780]   with the way his people live
[00:54:12.780 --> 00:54:15.740]   with what God's plan is for the whole universe.
[00:54:15.740 --> 00:54:19.680]   So cosmic unification in chapter one,
[00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:21.940]   that's the oneness of creation,
[00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:24.200]   to bind it all together in Christ,
[00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:29.200]   flows into ethnic reconciliation in chapters two and three
[00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:31.300]   where Paul builds the whole gospel
[00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:35.120]   around how God has created one new humanity
[00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:37.620]   for this one new creation,
[00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:40.360]   a new humanity which is there in Jew and Gentile,
[00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:42.860]   where God has made them one new man,
[00:54:42.860 --> 00:54:45.060]   kainos anthropos, as he said.
[00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:48.660]   And that indeed, he said, is to be proclaimed
[00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:52.980]   to the powers, the wickedness, the wisdom and glory of God.
[00:54:52.980 --> 00:54:55.500]   They will see the wisdom and glory of God
[00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:57.540]   when it's manifested in the church,
[00:54:57.540 --> 00:55:00.860]   which is the people of God who've been united in one
[00:55:00.860 --> 00:55:03.140]   from the dividedness of before.
[00:55:03.140 --> 00:55:07.700]   So cosmic unification becomes ethnic reconciliation,
[00:55:07.700 --> 00:55:11.760]   and that then leads in chapter four into ecclesial unity.
[00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:16.000]   We are to live together in harmony with one another
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.240]   and with ethical integrity,
[00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:22.240]   so that we are to live out that one new man.
[00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:25.960]   It's interesting that many of our English translations
[00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:30.960]   miss the way Paul repeats that God has made Jew and Gentile
[00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:33.840]   one new humanity, one new man,
[00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:35.560]   and then says in chapter four
[00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:38.480]   that we are to put off the old humanity
[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:40.040]   and put on that new man.
[00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:42.760]   We are to live out the newness of humanity
[00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:44.400]   that God has created.
[00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:46.320]   So what I'm trying to say here is that
[00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:51.320]   Ephesians is often portrayed as a kind of two-part book
[00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:55.320]   in which you get gospel doctrine in the first half
[00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:58.280]   and ethical implications in the second half.
[00:55:58.280 --> 00:56:00.520]   And in some ways, that does seem,
[00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:02.040]   but actually I want to say
[00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:04.600]   it's all woven together throughout.
[00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:08.520]   Paul is expounding election and redemption
[00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:10.560]   and living as the people of God
[00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:14.600]   in a way which has ethical dimensions all the way through
[00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:16.040]   in terms of what we are
[00:56:16.040 --> 00:56:18.320]   to live to the praise of glory in God.
[00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:21.880]   So the ethical life of God's people as the new humanity,
[00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:24.120]   the new way of being human,
[00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:26.560]   is in itself part of the gospel.
[00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:29.960]   It's part of the very reason why God brought us together.
[00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:32.680]   And then finally, when we look at 1 Peter,
[00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:36.000]   1 Peter binds the same things together
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:37.880]   right from the start in chapter one.
[00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:40.480]   He binds election, redemption, and sanctification
[00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:42.000]   in his opening verses,
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:43.440]   that we have been chosen,
[00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:45.680]   according to the foreknowledge of God the Father,
[00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:47.880]   through the sanctifying work of the Spirit
[00:56:47.880 --> 00:56:52.080]   to be obedient to Jesus Christ and sprinkled with his blood.
[00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:56.360]   So there's election and holiness and redemption
[00:56:56.360 --> 00:56:58.000]   all within that passage.
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.400]   And then later on in the same chapter,
[00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:05.400]   he says in, I just fire away, in verses 13 to 16,
[00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:09.280]   he says that as obedient children do not conform
[00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:12.200]   to the evil desires you had when you lived in ignorance,
[00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:14.600]   but just as he called you as holy,
[00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:16.160]   so be holy in all you do.
[00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:19.400]   For as it is written, be holy for I am holy.
[00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:23.640]   Quotes Exodus, Leviticus 19, and applies it to Christians.
[00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:25.000]   And then he brings in redemption.
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:26.960]   He says, because you know that it was not
[00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:29.080]   with perishable things like silver and gold
[00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:31.640]   that you were redeemed from the empty way
[00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:33.680]   of the life handed down to you from your ancestors,
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:36.000]   but with the precious blood of Christ,
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:38.080]   a lamb without blemish or defect,
[00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:40.240]   who was chosen before the creation of the world.
[00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:42.360]   And through him, you've been redeemed
[00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:45.920]   by the blood of Christ, therefore purify yourself
[00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:48.400]   and live in the way that he describes.
[00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:51.400]   And so election, redemption, and living
[00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:54.080]   are all put together there in that first chapter.
[00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:55.880]   And in chapter two, as we have seen,
[00:57:55.880 --> 00:57:59.400]   he brings that identity and mission of Israel
[00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:02.920]   in Exodus 19 and applies it to Christian believers.
[00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:05.960]   You are that chosen people, a royal priesthood,
[00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:08.360]   a holy nation, God's special possession,
[00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:10.480]   so that you may declare the praises of him
[00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:13.960]   who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.
[00:58:13.960 --> 00:58:17.080]   Once you were not a people, now you are the people of God.
[00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:20.280]   That's all Exodus, redemption, election language.
[00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:24.680]   Therefore, he says, live such good lives among the nations
[00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:26.800]   that though they accuse you of doing wrong,
[00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:29.520]   they may see your good deeds and glorify God
[00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:31.360]   on the day he visits us.
[00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:33.680]   And when you then move on from that chapter
[00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:35.840]   into the rest of 1 Peter,
[00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:39.080]   he shows that that then can be exemplified
[00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:41.400]   in everyday ordinary life.
[00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:44.120]   For example, that a believing wife,
[00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:47.400]   through her behavior, through the way she lives,
[00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:50.720]   can be instrumental in winning her husband to faith
[00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:52.260]   in chapter three, verse one.
[00:58:52.260 --> 00:58:56.740]   That to go on doing good, which he repeats again and again,
[00:58:56.740 --> 00:58:59.520]   even in the midst of suffering and opposition,
[00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:02.700]   doing good will lead to opportunities
[00:59:02.700 --> 00:59:04.480]   to speak in defense of our faith,
[00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:06.680]   to give a reason for the hope that was in us.
[00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:09.720]   So the ethical quality of the life of Christians
[00:59:09.720 --> 00:59:13.720]   will have an evangelistic and a missional implication.
[00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:16.520]   So let me then draw this all to a conclusion.
[00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:18.440]   Point we're making here is this,
[00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:21.120]   that when we think about the ethical teaching
[00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:24.320]   of the Old Testament and whether and how it relates
[00:59:24.320 --> 00:59:26.680]   in the new, it's not enough.
[00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:29.280]   It's not enough just to ask, well,
[00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:31.240]   what applies to me and what doesn't?
[00:59:31.240 --> 00:59:33.920]   That's usually a fairly fruitless kind of question.
[00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:36.380]   It's not enough to ask, well,
[00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:39.120]   what's the place of the Old Testament law now
[00:59:39.120 --> 00:59:39.960]   in the Christian life?
[00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:41.240]   Because again, that can lead
[00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:43.480]   in all sorts of wrong directions.
[00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:46.140]   We have to ask the first question, which is,
[00:59:46.140 --> 00:59:49.680]   what was the purpose of the law in the life of Israel
[00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:51.840]   to shape them to be God's people?
[00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:54.160]   And before that, we need to ask,
[00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:56.080]   and what was the purpose of Israel existing
[00:59:56.080 --> 01:00:00.520]   in the first place, which was to be a blessing to the world,
[01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:02.720]   to be God's people in the midst of the world?
[01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:05.440]   In other words, there is a missional answer
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:08.320]   which has to be applied to the ethical teaching
[01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:10.940]   of the Old Testament, and then consider
[01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:12.720]   what that means for us.
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:15.160]   The New Testament writers clearly believed
[01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:17.800]   that God had kept his promise to Israel
[01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:21.000]   in the life and death and resurrection of the Messiah,
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.280]   and then in the ingathering of the nations
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:25.440]   through the Gentile mission, and that those
[01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:29.240]   who have now entered into this multinational people of God
[01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:31.740]   by repentance and faith in Christ,
[01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:34.360]   that means us, the global Christian church,
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:38.480]   that we are called to the life of obedience and holiness
[01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:41.440]   in order to participate in the mission of God,
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:44.680]   based upon our redemption, based on the grace of God,
[01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:46.720]   not in order to earn our salvation,
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:50.560]   but we are called to the obedience of faith.
[01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:52.480]   And so let me conclude with the words
[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:54.280]   of the Cape Town Commitment.
[01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:57.320]   I referred to this earlier, the Lausanne Commitment,
[01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:59.480]   because it tries to bind this all together
[01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:00.800]   in one paragraph.
[01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:02.960]   It's paragraph 110a.
[01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:04.880]   It says this, and I'll just quote it.
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:07.240]   I haven't got it on the screen.
[01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:11.160]   "God calls his people to share God's mission.
[01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:15.680]   The church from all nations stands in continuity organically
[01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:18.800]   through the Messiah Jesus with God's people
[01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:19.760]   in the Old Testament.
[01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:23.120]   With them, we have been called through Abraham
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:25.120]   and commissioned to be a blessing and a light
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:26.360]   to the nations.
[01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:29.440]   With them, we are to be shaped and taught
[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:32.280]   through the law and the prophets, all the scriptures,
[01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:35.620]   to be a community of holiness, compassion, and justice
[01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:37.740]   in a world of sin and suffering.
[01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:41.080]   We have been redeemed through the cross and resurrection
[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:44.460]   of Jesus Christ and empowered by the Holy Spirit
[01:01:44.460 --> 01:01:48.000]   to bear witness to what God has done in Christ.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.760]   The church exists to worship and glorify God
[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:56.040]   for all eternity and to participate
[01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:59.440]   in the transforming mission of God within history.
[01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:04.320]   Our mission is wholly derived from God's mission,
[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:07.200]   addresses the whole of God's creation,
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:09.480]   and is grounded at its center
[01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:12.000]   in the redeeming victory of the cross.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000]   This is the people to whom we belong,
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:19.560]   whose faith we confess, and whose mission we share."
[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:22.480]   Amen.
