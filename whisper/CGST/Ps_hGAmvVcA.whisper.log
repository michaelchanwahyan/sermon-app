[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.000]  (國語)
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.500]  Christian brothers and sisters,
[00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.000]  warmest greetings in our Lord Jesus Christ to you,
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.500]  no matter where you are now geographically located.
[00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.000]  Welcome to join us
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000]  at our China Graduate School of Theology
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]  Josephine So Culture and Ethics Lecture Week.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000]  My name is Simon Cheung,
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000]  your host this morning.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000]  Let me first say a few words about this lecture series.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000]  Instituted in 1985,
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000]  this biannual lecture series
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000]  is for commemorating Josephine So,
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000]  the pioneering Christian thinker and leader
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000]  here in Hong Kong
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000]  after her untimely death in 1982.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000]  In the past,
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000]  this lecture series has covered
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000]  a broad swath of topics,
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000]  ranging from a contemporary reading of
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000]  Augustine's "The City of God"
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000]  to pressing cultural and ethical issues
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000]  concerning creation care,
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000]  marketplace theology,
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000]  or contextualizing Christian faith
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000]  in the current Chinese context.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000]  This year,
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]  our lecture series is set to take a look,
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000]  and I may add,
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000]  a scrutinizing and critical look
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]  into the American white evangelicalism
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]  and the crisis it faces today.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]  And our distinguished speaker is
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000]  Reverend Dr. Mark Levitin,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000]  the President of Fuller Theological Seminary
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]  in the U.S.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]  Dr. Levitin,
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000]  it's great to have you here virtually with us.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000]  Would you like to say hi to our audience here?
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]  Thank you so much for this invitation.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]  Thank you, Dr. Levitin.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]  And before we hear your first lecture today,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]  may I first say a few words
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]  to introduce you to our general audience?
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]  Dr. Levitin is a prolific writer,
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]  and his work appears in various kinds of platforms,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]  with the Lord Jesus Christ as a center of passion,
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000]  as Dr. Levitin once expressed in an interview.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]  His work is aimed to wake people up
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]  as to what kind of life and practice
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000]  they are called into by their Savior and by their Lord.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000]  Just by reading the evocative titles of his books like
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000]  "The Dangerous Act of Worship"
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]  and "The Dangerous Act of Loving Your Neighbor,"
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000]  his readers will immediately get the feel that
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000]  the complacent and insipid understanding of our faith
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000]  falls far short of the true calling
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]  to be the followers of Jesus.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000]  Out of a deep conviction in the practice of genuine dialogue,
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000]  Dr. Levitin has been hosting,
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]  as the president of FOLA,
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]  a forum called "Conversing,"
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000]  in which he will speak with a wide spectrum of leaders,
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]  I quote,
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000]  on issues at the intersection of theology and culture,
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]  end quote.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]  This dialogue is meant,I quote again,
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000]  to evoke both the power of conversation
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000]  and the turbulence of our times,end quote.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000]  So one of his latest additions features his interview
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000]  with a Christian writer and activist
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]  who champions racial justice
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]  and seeks to expose the Christian,
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000]  especially white Christians' complicity
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000]  in racism in the U.S.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.000]  Today,Dr. Levitin will begin his reflection
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]  of the issue at hand with the title
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000]  "The Start, the Complicity, the Tsunami and Today,
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000]  the Birth, Original Scene, Development, Growth,
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]  Consumption and Betrayal
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]  of American White Evangelicalism."
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000]  Without further ado,let's welcome Dr. Levitin.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000]  Thank you very, very much.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]  It's a great joy and privilege to be here.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000]  Presently, distinguished faculty, students and guests,
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000]  it's a great honor for me to be participating
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000]  in these lectures in 2021.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000]  We had, of course, all hoped that the lectures
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000]  would be delivered in person,
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000]  but 2020 and the COVID pandemic
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000]  regrettably made that impossible.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000]  I hope that the Canadian philosopher
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000]  Marshall McLuhan is wrong,
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000]  that this medium will not be the message
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]  and that you will remember far more
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]  about what I'm trying to say
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000]  than the medium by which I will be saying it.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000]  I bring all of you very warm greetings
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000]  from Fuller Theological Seminary,
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000]  especially from our board of trustees and faculty,
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000]  and pray for you, for the church
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000]  and for the world of which we are a part
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000]  and for which we serve as we do.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]  Before formally starting,
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000]  let's let first things be first.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000]  In Romans 8, the Apostle Paul traces
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000]  the pervasive, unfinished and agonizing groans of God,
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000]  the church and creation itself.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000]  In these lectures, there will be cause for joy,
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000]  but there will also be evidences of groaning,
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000]  reasons for arguing, causes for crying,
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000]  repenting and lamenting.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]  Yet in the face of all that is wrong and incomplete,
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]  let us first hear the Apostle Paul's words
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]  toward the end of that well-known chapter.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000]  He writes, "What then are we to say to these things?
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000]  If God is for us, who can be against us?
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000]  He who did not spare his own Son
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]  but gave him up for us all,
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]  how will he not also with him
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000]  graciously give us all things?
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000]  In all these things,
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000]  we are more than conquerors
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000]  through him who loved us.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000]  For I am sure that neither death nor life
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000]  nor angels nor rulers,
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000]  nor things present nor things to come,
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000]  nor power nor height nor depth
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000]  nor anything else in all creation
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000]  will be able to separate us
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000]  from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord."
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000]  I offer these lectures as those with hope,
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000]  a hope that is gratefully far beyond ourselves
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000]  or these days.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000]  In the name of the Father and the Son
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000]  and the Holy Spirit. Amen.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000]  Shall we pray together?
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000]  Oh God, how thankful we are
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000]  for the privilege and gift of gathering in this way.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000]  We are in places throughout parts of Asia
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000]  and perhaps around the world,
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000]  aware of your presence and faithfulness,
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000]  which is our only hope,
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000]  the only hope of the Church
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000]  and the only and final hope of the world.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000]  May our days together this week
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000]  be ones that you will bless,
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000]  that our conversation and my reflections
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000]  will combine in useful ways,
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000]  that our understanding of your will
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]  and the future to which you call us
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000]  will be clearer and that our faithfulness will grow.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000]  I ask it to your glory in the name of Jesus.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000]  Amen.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]  To speak about the crisis
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]  of American white evangelicalism
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000]  is to speak about a crisis
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000]  within just part of the body of Christ
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]  and its mission in the world.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000]  As I hope and know you will see,
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000]  I have no difficulty trying to honestly describe
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000]  my understanding of the situation,
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000]  but in doing so,
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]  I want to remind myself and you
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000]  that I am after all talking about
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000]  part of our Lord's beloved bride.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000]  The journey of God with God's people
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000]  from Abraham to today
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000]  has been endlessly fraught with crises
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000]  and still our ever-loving
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000]  and persisting Good Shepherd
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000]  does not let us go.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000]  I believe in the legitimacy
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]  and in fact the necessity of self-critique,
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000]  while conscious that that can easily
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000]  and glibly fall prey
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]  to its own arrogance and presumption.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000]  So I want genuinely to repent even in advance
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000]  and commit to you that I will try
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]  to be both candid and loving,
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000]  honest and fair.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000]  The topic is large enoughand complex enough
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000]  to necessarily state that I'm not addressing
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000]  all dimensions of evangelicalism,of course,
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]  and certainly not addressing the related
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000]  but very different realities
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000]  of global evangelicalism.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000]  Nor would I pretend to adequately trace
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000]  therefore the impact and importance
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000]  of American white evangelicalism
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000]  on the China Graduate School of Theology
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000]  or the Chinese Church.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000]  Instead,I will offer you my thoughts
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000]  about American white evangelicalism
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000]  and ask during our question and answer sessions
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000]  for your partnership
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000]  as brothers and sisters in Christ,
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000]  with whom the Scriptures call us
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000]  to both rejoice with those who rejoice
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000]  and weep with those who weep.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]  Your reflections,critiques,
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000]  and perhaps even weeping
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000]  are truly valuable to me,
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000]  and I look forward to hearing
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000]  your voices and perspectives as well.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000]  We are in one communion in Christ.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000]  Presently,encourage me to deliver lectures
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.000]  in a way that would include
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000]  my own personal experience
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000]  and not only to offer them
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000]  through the lens of a merely academic
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000]  set of categories or ideas.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000]  I was grateful for this and pleased
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000]  since it allows me to do in public
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000]  what we all know to be true in private,
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000]  namely that almost all scholarship
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000]  is also narrative or narratival.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]  That is,our commitments and interests
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]  are inevitably oriented by
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000]  and reflective of our own stories.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000]  A few examples.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000]  I point to Dr.Francis Collins,
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000]  the director in the United States
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000]  of the National Institutes of Health
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000]  in Washington, D.C.,
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000]  and the leader of the Human Genome Project,
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000]  which worked out the first
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000]  complete sequencing of human DNA,
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000]  forever changing the way
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000]  human biological science would proceed
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000]  and affecting the lives of people everywhere.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000]  It was he who said
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000]  that the underlying conviction
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000]  of God's creative and recreative love
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000]  and salvation in Jesus Christ
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000]  is the daily rock on which he seeks
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000]  to do the very best science
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000]  and public health that he can provide.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000]  Dr.Collins can distinguish science from faith,
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000]  but his commitment to science
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000]  and to the evangel
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000]  are together part and parcel
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000]  of one life and one project.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000]  Dr.Martin Luther King,
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000]  the great American civil rights leader,
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000]  was not incidentally black.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000]  It was his blackness
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000]  that informed his experience and his theology
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000]  and also motivated his rhetoric
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000]  and his analysis of the past and present.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000]  His personal story made him more capable,
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000]  not less,of perceiving reality clearly
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000]  in his study of American racial history.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000]  His embeddedness in his story
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000]  and in the larger black narrative
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000]  in the United States,
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000]  including his demonstrations
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000]  in some of the great marches
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000]  and movements of the '60s,
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000]  gave him clearer vision, not less.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000]  In a multiracial nation,
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000]  race is never a neutral factor.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000]  Any claim of neutrality about race in America
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000]  is a warning sign
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:23.000]  that misunderstanding is already at hand.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000]  Jesus was not incidentally
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000]  a first-century Jewish man.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000]  The very character of his divine revelation
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000]  and of the love and healing,
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]  teaching and sacrifice,
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000]  death and resurrection
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000]  are simultaneously objective
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000]  and subjective realities.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000]  This is what we affirm about the incarnation,
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000]  the universal particularity of God.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000]  Postmodernism has succeeded
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000]  in driving us to face
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000]  the inescapable particularity of life.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000]  In the case of Christian faith,
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000]  the particular, however,
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000]  is the lens by which we can see,
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000]  know and encounter the God of the universe.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000]  This is what we hold dear.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:15.000]  This is what we hold together.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:31.000]  Just a moment.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:39.000]  Excuse me.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000]  All of this is to say
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000]  that when President Lee
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000]  invited me to speak personally
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000]  on the subject of
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000]  American white evangelicalism,
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000]  he was allowing me to express in public
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000]  what otherwise is privately
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000]  and inescapably present.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000]  I am allowing,
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000]  I am being allowed through his invitation
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000]  to pixelate the story
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000]  with an acknowledgment of the ways
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000]  my own experience
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.000]  has ordered the arrangement
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000]  and colors and shades
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000]  of my telling
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000]  of the American evangelical story.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000]  On a personal level,
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000]  I come to you to this topic
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000]  first and foremost,
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000]  simply as a brother in Christ,
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000]  seeking, as you do,
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000]  to hear and respond
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000]  to what the Holy Spirit
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000]  may want to say to us
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000]  in these sessions together.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.000]  The primary context
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000]  out of which I speak
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000]  is what we hold in common,
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000]  our life in Christ.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000]  This defining context
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000]  of God's loving redemption
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000]  holds any and all details
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000]  about me,
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000]  my gifts and weaknesses,
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000]  my sins and sorrows,
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000]  my hopes and longings,
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000]  my social location,
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000]  my birth and my new social location
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000]  as part of God's one new humanity.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000]  The same, of course, is true for you.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000]  We find our life's principal location
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000]  together in this one new communion,
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000]  made possible and active
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.000]  as we are held in the love
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000]  of the Father, Son and Spirit.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000]  In this common life,
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000]  we also bring our distinct similarities
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000]  and differences.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000]  I am a tall, white,
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000]  educated American
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000]  born and raised
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.000]  on the west coast
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000]  of the United States,
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000]  and I am 67 years old.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.000]  I've been married
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]  for nearly 37 years,
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000]  and my wife and I
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000]  have two adult sons.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.000]  My family of origin
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000]  had a low or moderate income
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.000]  and lived in
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000]  an agricultural community
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000]  adjacent to a nearby
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000]  Native American community
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000]  and in a place known
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000]  as the Yakama Nation,
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000]  a designation of a
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000]  Native American tribe,
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000]  namely the Yakamas,
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.000]  and in a community
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000]  served by itinerant farm workers
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000]  who traveled each season
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000]  to labor in the agricultural harvest
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000]  around us.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000]  My life as a white American
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000]  was not their life.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000]  We lived in proximate, parallel,
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000]  but utterly different worlds.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000]  I grew up in a tight-knit family
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000]  in which my father saw religion
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.000]  and religious devotion
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000]  as one of the most dangerous
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000]  influences in the world,
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000]  one that he wanted his two sons
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000]  to avoid if at all possible.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000]  So my Christian journey
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000]  began as I started college,
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000]  where I became a Christian
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000]  through reading the Gospels.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000]  I simply had an intellectual
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000]  and social curiosity
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000]  about the Bible
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000]  and felt that since I was
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.000]  on the road to becoming
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000]  I hoped an educated person,
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000]  I should read the Bible,
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000]  and I began with
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000]  the Gospel of Matthew.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000]  My father had committed
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.000]  to do all he could
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000]  to keep his two sons from religion
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000]  and especially from religious devotion.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000]  His argument from history
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000]  and experience
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000]  was that religious people,
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.000]  particularly Christian people
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000]  in his assessment,
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000]  by the influence of their faith,
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000]  take great things,
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000]  the universe,
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000]  the mystery of being human,
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000]  and turn them into something
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000]  that's actually very small.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000]  My father illustrated this
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000]  through the history of science
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000]  and Christianity,
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000]  but also through social
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000]  and political history,
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000]  as well as moral philosophy
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000]  and practice.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000]  To my great shock,
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000]  what I discovered
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000]  in the New Testament
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000]  was first that Jesus
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000]  shared this same concern
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000]  as my father.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000]  Many of his expressions
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000]  address that very concern,
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000]  and yet Jesus' antidote
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000]  to small-making
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000]  is what he announced
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000]  and displayed to be
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000]  the kingdom of God,
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.000]  the reality that cracks
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000]  the whole universe wide open.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000]  This was the gift
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000]  that I was being offered
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000]  through the New Testament,
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000]  the gift that shocked me
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000]  and ultimately has come
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000]  to change my whole life.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000]  My life as a disciple
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000]  to this day
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000]  has been constantly shaped
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000]  by the dialogue
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000]  between my father's anxiety
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000]  about Christian faith,
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000]  which I believe
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000]  was accurate and fair,
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000]  and how it has been
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000]  constructively shaped now
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.000]  by the dialogue
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000]  between that anxiety
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000]  and the comprehensive
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000]  and personal character
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000]  of God's loving reign
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000]  in Jesus Christ
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000]  by the Holy Spirit
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000]  through one new humanity
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000]  that we call the church
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000]  for the sake of the whole
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000]  created order.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000]  The first Christians
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000]  I came to know were and are
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000]  some of the most positive
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000]  spiritual influences in my life.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000]  They referred to themselves
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000]  as evangelical,
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.000]  and the rest is, well, history.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000]  I stepped into a biblical story
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000]  I had not known
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000]  and into a community
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000]  that became home to me.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000]  My spiritual life and journey
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000]  has been full of God
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000]  and full of a ministry
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000]  of resisting smallness.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000]  Let's go back to the beginning
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000]  and all of these sections
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.000]  of this lecture
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000]  will be very, very introductory,
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.000]  and I apologize
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000]  if they seem repetitive
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000]  to what you may already know.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000]  By the 17th and 18th centuries,
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000]  the so-called birth of America
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000]  was already by that time
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000]  long since underway.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.000]  Only in the last quarter
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000]  of the 18th century
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000]  would it become
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000]  a formally united project,
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000]  but for two centuries before that,
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000]  Europeans and European colonies
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.000]  had established
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000]  what became the United States.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000]  Evangelicalism was a spiritual
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000]  and theological renewal movement.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000]  Some would say one
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000]  that emerged from
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000]  the Protestant Reformation
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000]  of the 16th century.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000]  Evangelicalism was both
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000]  a spiritual movement
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000]  and a way of conceiving
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000]  of the Christian life.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000]  It was by no means then a party,
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000]  let alone an organization
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000]  or an institution.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.000]  It was instead
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000]  a fresh experience or movement
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000]  of the Holy Spirit
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000]  that cut across denominational lines,
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000]  that spoke out into town squares,
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000]  that brought influence
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000]  uncontrolled by formal
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000]  Christian structures or histories,
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000]  while declaring and nurturing people
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000]  in what they saw as the first order
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000]  matters of faith.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.000]  By the last quarter
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:04.000]  of the 17th century,
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.000]  the 18th century,
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000]  when the declaration of independence
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000]  and the War of Independence occurred,
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000]  the colonies were clearly hungry
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.000]  for change, expansion, freedom and hope.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000]  This, along with various
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000]  Christian awakenings in Europe
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000]  and in America in the 1730s
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000]  and the 1740s
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000]  by groups such as Anglicans
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000]  and Methodists, Reformed and Puritan,
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000]  meant that institutional religious teaching
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000]  and authority were being modified
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000]  and challenged in various ways.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000]  Together it created a readiness
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000]  for a kind of spiritual awakening
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000]  that was motivated by a readiness
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000]  to receive the spiritual identity
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000]  and life that could freshly ground them
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000]  in this new context, in this new land.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000]  The great awakenings in Europe
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.000]  came to and triumphed in American soil.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.000]  In retrospect,
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000]  a British historian, David Bebbington,
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000]  in his defining work in 1989,
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000]  entitled Evangelicalism in Modern Britain,
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000]  a History of the 1730s to the 1980s,
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000]  set forth that evangelicalism
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000]  was centered on a quadrilateral set of traits,
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000]  that it was Bible-centered,
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.000]  that it was cross-centered,
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000]  that it was conversion-expecting
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000]  and that it was activist-oriented.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.000]  This movement unfolded with undulations
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000]  that responded to external changes,
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000]  to the presence and practice of slavery,
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.000]  for example,
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000]  to the critical study of the scriptures,
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000]  to the anxieties spawned
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000]  during the Enlightenment by science,
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000]  to the realities of world wars,
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000]  to the impact of pandemics,
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000]  to the growing impact of higher education.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000]  It claimed a spiritual, theological
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000]  and experiential legitimacy
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000]  more than an intellectual,
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000]  denominational or formal identity.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000]  It was a movement
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000]  more than it was an institution
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.000]  or an organization.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.000]  And therefore,
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000]  it was adaptable to the East Coast,
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000]  but it was highly flexible enough
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.000]  as the westward expansion
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000]  in the United States occurred.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000]  In the 1920s,
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000]  the fundamentalist-modernist controversy
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000]  drew and debated lines
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000]  that were the fruit of this long history
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000]  that had already been developed
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000]  over that period of time.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000]  By the middle of the 20th century,
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000]  when Fuller Theological Seminary
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000]  and many other evangelical organizations
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000]  and institutions were founded,
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000]  evangelicalism had become a word
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000]  that could serve as a pathway
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000]  between two extremes.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000]  In the case of Fuller Theological Seminary,
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000]  it was a way between fundamentalism
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000]  and a wooden understanding of the Bible
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000]  and its interpretation
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000]  and modernism,
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000]  namely,potentially at least
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000]  an adaptation, if not an abandonment,
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000]  of orthodoxy at times
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.000]  for the sake of being "modern."
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000]  Evangelicalism, as Fuller saw it,
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000]  was an embrace of Christian orthodoxy
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.000]  that was open to more critical study
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.000]  of the scriptures
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000]  and more open to engagement
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000]  with realities around us
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000]  in context and in culture
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000]  than was typically true of fundamentalists
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000]  or wholeheartedly true of modernists.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000]  So evangelicalism quietly and broadly
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000]  remained in this position
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000]  until the late 1970s,
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000]  to which we will comment to the 2000s,
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000]  including the last four years
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000]  in the national and political life
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000]  of the United States.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000]  Please note, again, several things.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000]  The lack of an institutional
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000]  or organizational center,
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000]  the lack of a defining
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000]  or controlling role
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000]  or set of voices
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000]  for what was in fact
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.000]  a diffuse and multiply defined
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000]  and growing movement.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.000]  The claim to knowledge
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000]  that can and must
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000]  define what is true and good
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000]  was clarified by evangelicalism,
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000]  but not with the emphatic certainty
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000]  of fundamentalism.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.000]  It had an orientation
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000]  towards who is in
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000]  and who is out in fundamentalism,
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000]  whereas in growing evangelicalism,
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000]  it was a sense that it was the center
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.000]  that was primary
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000]  and not the boundaries.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000]  We'll return to this as well.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000]  We turn next to the complicity.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000]  Here is complicity
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000]  in a number of social realities
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000]  which create a major problem
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000]  for evangelicalism in America.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000]  From the earliest days in North America,
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000]  Native American tribes were being displaced
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000]  by formal and informal versions
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000]  of the so-called doctrine of discovery
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000]  in which lands and peoples
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000]  could be claimed under the authority
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000]  of various European countries.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.000]  The majority of this
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000]  was theologically justified
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000]  as part of a sense of the mission of God
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000]  that reigned over all.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.000]  The presumption was
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000]  that this was legitimate legally,
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000]  that it was morally right,
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000]  that it was socially beneficial,
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000]  and that it was, most importantly,
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.000]  spiritually redemptive
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000]  for those whose lives
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000]  were now held inside
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.000]  and under Christian
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.000]  and European authority.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000]  The Christian church was manifest
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000]  in a European-defined
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000]  and embodied set of terms.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.000]  This meant that there were Roman Catholics
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000]  and various Protestant churches as well,
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.000]  Anglican and Puritan in particular,
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000]  that were involved in these matters.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000]  The church in America
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000]  imitated the church in Europe,
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.000]  while it also opened the way
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000]  for many who were defining
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000]  religious persecution in Europe
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000]  to be a motivation for immigrants
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000]  to the colonies.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000]  Regional plots along the East Coast
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000]  tagged with different primary European
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000]  and Christian identities.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]  From this intertwined connection
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000]  between the doctrine of discovery
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000]  and Native Americans,
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000]  that is, the readiness
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000]  to dominate Native peoples,
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000]  there developed an abominable extension.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000]  An intertwined connection
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.000]  between white Christians
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000]  and African slavery
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000]  was early and well established
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000]  in the United States.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.000]  The doctrine of discovery
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.000]  established by the Pope in 1493
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000]  created the legal, political
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000]  and religious claim of land
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.000]  and people that were not Christian.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000]  This plain and historic doctrine
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000]  became the driving theological
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000]  and missiological force
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000]  underpinning colonialism
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000]  and its mutating motives
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000]  and expressions to this very day.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.000]  What was fundamentally
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.000]  a political and economic vision initially
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000]  was justified and defended
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000]  even more passionately
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000]  as a theological one,
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000]  trumping and masking
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.000]  the political and economic benefits.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000]  The doctrine of discovery
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000]  provided the theological cover
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000]  and the unlimited possibilities
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000]  for economic expansion
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000]  that were simply too much to resist.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000]  Colonialist condescension
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000]  and rationalization
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.000]  looked away from
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000]  and denied the horror
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000]  of the transatlantic slave trade
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000]  and the practice
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000]  that denigrated and dehumanized
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000]  African men, women and children
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.000]  by the millions,
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000]  all to satisfy the greed
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000]  of colonial and post-colonial families
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000]  in the name of the gospel.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000]  The unpaid labor of black Africans
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000]  was the workforce
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000]  that built America.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000]  Christians saw the expansion
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000]  of agricultural and manufacturing capacity
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000]  as it was neutrally called
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.000]  as the blessing of God.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000]  The reports, as you probably know,
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.000]  in West Africa,
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000]  where kidnapped Africans
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.000]  were imprisoned
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000]  after being taken in horrific conditions
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000]  before rather being taken
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.000]  in horrific conditions
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.000]  across the Atlantic Ocean,
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000]  the Middle Passage,
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000]  for sale in the Caribbean
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000]  and in the colonies.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.000]  In those ports,
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000]  Christian worship happened
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000]  to ask for God's blessing
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000]  in the so-called Middle Passageway.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000]  One such chapel in Ghana, for example,
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.000]  was built across the bridge
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000]  upon which manacled slaves
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000]  would later walk to the place
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000]  where they would be tied and bound
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000]  for the cross-Atlantic trip.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000]  The chapel above this gangplank
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000]  taking slaves on board the ship
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.000]  would be the captors,
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000]  the slave masters,
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000]  the ship's captains and crew
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.000]  singing hymns still familiar today.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000]  They would read the scriptures.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000]  They would pray for safety
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.000]  for all the crew
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000]  and for the trip to be successful
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000]  in the eventual sale
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000]  of fellow human beings.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000]  The church would be the place
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.000]  of the servitude
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.000]  that would define them
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000]  for the rest of their lives
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000]  and the lives of generations
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000]  and generations of slaves
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000]  and slave families to come.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000]  All this being done
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000]  in the name of Jesus Christ,
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.000]  as they would say,
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.000]  the Lord and Savior of the world.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.000]  Among the perpetrators
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000]  on both sides of the Atlantic
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000]  were white evangelicals.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000]  The convergence of the psychological
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000]  and spiritual readiness of colonials
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000]  in relation to this narrative
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000]  of America's original sin
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000]  is hard to trace.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000]  The ability to claim to love God
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.000]  while so obviously hating their neighbors
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000]  was of course not invented
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000]  in the Atlantic slave trade,
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000]  but it was destructively
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.000]  and politically practiced
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.000]  for over 250 years.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.000]  This practice involved
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000]  the death of 2 million lives
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000]  in the Atlantic crossing,
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.000]  the deaths of millions
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000]  en route to their plantations,
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000]  and the sale of 12 to 14 million human lives.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.000]  These are the ones
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000]  who carried out the nation building.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000]  That was the growing, emerging,
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.000]  uniting, and Christian reality
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000]  that became the United States.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000]  In the Constitution of the United States,
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000]  the phrase "we the people"
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:08.000]  meant white, land-owning men.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000]  We the people
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000]  are the people that are referred to
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000]  in our Constitution,
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000]  not the slaves.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000]  African slaves were in fact classed
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000]  by our Constitution
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.000]  as three-fifths human.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000]  All this brought the United States
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000]  to war in the mid-19th century,
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.000]  and the death of more than 650,000 lives
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000]  during that Civil War period.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000]  The war divided families and friends
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000]  and congregations and denominations,
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.000]  and continues to this very week
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000]  to define and explain
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.000]  the American church
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.000]  and political rallies and realities.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000]  The interwovenness for many evangelicals
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.000]  of faith and slavery
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000]  now seems like an unbelievable aberration,
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000]  and yet it reveals the ways
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000]  that culture and economics
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000]  speak more loudly
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000]  than our theology and faith,
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000]  and that we are more capable
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.000]  than we might imagine
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000]  of wrapping desire with faith
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.000]  and calling it God's gift.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000]  The economic labor engine
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.000]  that built the United States
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000]  was unpaid labor,
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:23.000]  unpaid labor for 250 years of slavery.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.000]  It was claimed to be God's blessing
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.000]  for the owner and God's blessing
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000]  for the uncivilized slave and family
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000]  who, because of having been taken captive
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000]  and now "employed" as a slave,
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000]  giving them the opportunity and privilege
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:44.000]  to live in a "Christian nation."
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.000]  The cruelty and sin
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000]  that was right in front of them
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.000]  was apparently invisible.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.000]  In other words, many, by no means all,
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.000]  white evangelicals
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.000]  were seamlessly in the church community
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.000]  and fully complicit in 250 years of slavery,
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000]  followed by 100 more years
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000]  of extended slavery and oppression
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000]  into the assumptions of culture,
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.000]  economics, and evangelical faith.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.000]  Debates continue to this day
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000]  about the cause of the American Civil War
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.000]  from 1861 to '65.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000]  The central matter,
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.000]  the main point of concern,
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000]  was, however, slavery.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000]  In Romans 1, Paul talks about
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000]  our human capacity to hold down
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000]  or to suppress the truth
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000]  in unrighteousness.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000]  We do this in our own lives.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000]  And the culture of Christian churches
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000]  and congregations and institutions
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000]  reflects this in various ways.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000]  But for a very large and focal part
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000]  of white evangelical church in America,
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000]  this habit became deep,
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000]  multigenerationally ingrained.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000]  And the white evangelical movement
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000]  has at times challenged
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:01.000]  and at some times completely conceded
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000]  to this kind of vision.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.000]  There were, of course,
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000]  in the 18th and 19th century,
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000]  white evangelical public leaders
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.000]  who spoke and acted loudly
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:15.000]  and sustainably against slavery.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.000]  But the lowest baseline
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000]  associated with and defended
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000]  in Christian terms
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000]  was the defense of slavery.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000]  Evangelical complicity
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.000]  with slavery,
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.000]  with reconstruction
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.000]  following the Civil War,
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.000]  with imprisoned and indentured labor,
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000]  with Jim Crow,
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.000]  with bank control of real estate and money
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000]  erupted in periodic riots and protests.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.000]  As an example,
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000]  100 years ago this very year
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000]  in Tulsa, Oklahoma,
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.000]  in the heart of southern America
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000]  and south, southern American
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000]  white evangelicalism,
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000]  the most thriving black community
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000]  in the whole country
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000]  was decimated
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000]  and 300 black lives were slaughtered
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.000]  because a black man was alleged
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:07.000]  to try and kiss a white Christian woman.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000]  The most economically thriving black community
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.000]  was burned to the ground,
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.000]  wiping out an entire community
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.000]  who confessed that Jesus Christ is Lord
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.000]  Only this year will this be fully faced,
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.000]  lamented and recognized.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000]  In different but parallel ways,
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.000]  this black narrative
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000]  is not only the Native American story,
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000]  but also in the United States,
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000]  the Latin American story
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.000]  and the Asian story as well.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000]  In all these instances
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000]  and many others besides,
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.000]  many in the evangelical church,
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000]  confessing Christ
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000]  were also participating,
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000]  supportive or passive
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000]  about these abuses,
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000]  cruelties and injustices.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000]  Being perpetrated by those
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000]  our Bible calls
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.000]  are made in the image of God,
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000]  knit together in their mother's womb,
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000]  wounds, wounds,
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.000]  fearfully and wonderfully made.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.000]  Complicity is too mild a word.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.000]  It showed that many evangelical Christians
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000]  had enslaved themselves
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.000]  to the injustice and abuse
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.000]  of fellow human beings for centuries.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000]  People ask,
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.000]  where was the church in Nazi Germany?
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000]  The answer is the same place
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000]  that many white evangelical Christians
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.000]  in North America have been
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.000]  during the past 400 years,
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000]  right here,
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:40.000]  right in the midst of mainstream culture.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000]  This needs to be kept in mind,
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.000]  I might add as a footnote,
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.000]  in understanding the events
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:48.000]  of the United States in the last week.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000]  We move next to the tsunami.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000]  The civil rights movement in America
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.000]  was primarily led by
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000]  the black church in America.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.000]  It has evangelical theology and doctrine,
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.000]  but did not choose for the most part
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.000]  to identify as evangelical
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000]  because they were not white,
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.000]  and because the white evangelical narrative
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.000]  excluded black and brown people.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000]  The narrative the black church knew
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.000]  was the God who knew
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000]  how to set his people free,
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000]  and that narrative,
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000]  led by exceptional black Christian leaders
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.000]  and pastors,
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.000]  was the narrative
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000]  to which their civil rights movement
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.000]  was committed.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.000]  Enormous and positive changes occurred.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000]  But in symbol and in reality,
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000]  the murder of the Reverend
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000]  Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.000]  slowed and diverted the narrative,
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.000]  along with the sacrifice
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000]  of many others as well.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000]  For evangelicals,
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000]  King was too liberal,
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000]  and only very gradually,
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.000]  as the black Christian critique
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:50.000]  of the white story of America
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:51.000]  became domesticated enough
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000]  to accept Dr. King
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.000]  into some white Christian
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.000]  evangelical narratives,
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000]  but only some,
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000]  and only relatively recently.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000]  By the late 1960s,
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.000]  the election of Jimmy Carter
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000]  as a "born-again" Christian,
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000]  evangelicalism began to quickly
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000]  step into the public light
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.000]  in a different way than before.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000]  By the 1980s,
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000]  we have the birth of a movement
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.000]  called the Moral Majority
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.000]  and the rise of various media ministries
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:24.000]  that can propagate arguments of faith
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.000]  in continuous feeds of ideas.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.000]  Simultaneously,
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000]  cable television news channels
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000]  are developing and growing
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.000]  in passive popularity,
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000]  and this development mixes together
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.000]  in a thick media presence
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000]  of culture and religion.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.000]  It's all presented as real,
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.000]  but what emerges is closer to reality TV,
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.000]  that is,
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.000]  not so much an expression of Christian faith
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.000]  as much as a combination
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000]  of entertainment and production.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000]  Audience ratings
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000]  are the most important measure of success.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.000]  This becomes a globally spreading
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.000]  reality and infection.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.000]  The experience of popular
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000]  cable religious programs,
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.000]  most of them fundamentalist
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000]  and Pentecostal,
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000]  hosted by many different TV evangelists,
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.000]  turned to the political sphere in the '80s
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000]  and unleashed a tsunami
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.000]  that flooded the religious airwaves.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.000]  This went on for some time
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.000]  during the '80s and early '90s
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.000]  and increasingly addressed politics,
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000]  especially related to abortion
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.000]  and sexuality debates
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000]  and claimed an enormous
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:30.000]  both American and global audience.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.000]  In 1996,
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.000]  Fox News was established
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.000]  by Robert Murdoch,Rupert Murdoch,
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.000]  and further amplified the voices
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.000]  of popular fundamentalist
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.000]  conservative pastors,
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.000]  TV evangelists,
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.000]  organizations,
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000]  churches and political groups.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.000]  Along the way,
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.000]  these became known
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.000]  as the evangelicals by the media.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000]  It was a title claimed by those
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.000]  that the media amplified
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:56.000]  and made more culturally acceptable
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.000]  than the tag that had been used
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:01.000]  as fundamentalist or Pentecostals
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.000]  who were seen more to be
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.000]  at the margins of culture,
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000]  whereas evangelicals
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.000]  became a more acceptable
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.000]  mainstream term.
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.000]  This was the tsunami
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.000]  that took over the term
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.000]  evangelical in the United States,
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.000]  and it remained so
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.000]  through the late '90s
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.000]  and certainly during the first
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.000]  two decades of the 2000s.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.000]  This all happened
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.000]  as the growth of megachurches
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.000]  in the United States also expanded
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000]  from a few hundred
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000]  to thousands of such congregations.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000]  The pervasive
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.000]  lack or minimalization
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000]  of theological education
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.000]  in most of these movements
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.000]  was quite appalling.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.000]  It created a large collection
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000]  of communicators
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.000]  who were not marked
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000]  by careful thought
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000]  or by accountability.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.000]  It became a tribe of its own
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.000]  with its own regard
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.000]  and disregard for boundaries.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.000]  Effect, popularity, emotion
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.000]  all dominated
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.000]  with a popular,
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:03.000]  unselfcritical frame and attitude.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000]  Typically, a single personality
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.000]  in the four ways
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.000]  dominated the message.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000]  All this is too simplistic.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.000]  Two parallel narratives
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.000]  or realities also need to be acknowledged.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000]  First, the media prominence
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.000]  of white evangelicalism
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.000]  was similar,
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.000]  but always distinct
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.000]  from the rise and growth
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000]  and development of the black church.
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.000]  Some, if not all,
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000]  of the same theological markers
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.000]  describe the rise of the black church,
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.000]  but the social associations
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.000]  do not, quite the opposite, in fact.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.000]  The white evangelical church
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.000]  and the black church
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000]  were distinct, separate
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000]  and had very different characteristics.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000]  The most important one
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.000]  might be assumed
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000]  to be integration of faith
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.000]  and context
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:50.000]  of the love of God
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:51.000]  and the justice of God
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.000]  in Jesus Christ
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:54.000]  and the suffering of blacks,
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000]  including black Christians,
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000]  who suffered from the brutal racism
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000]  and the white supremacy
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.000]  and normativity
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000]  of the American landscape.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000]  More on this in our next lecture.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.000]  The second layer
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.000]  that needs to be acknowledged
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000]  is a smaller reactive movement
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000]  of neo-evangelicals
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000]  who specifically and stridently
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000]  rejected the sociology, policy
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.000]  and politics
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.000]  of conservative, republican, white
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.000]  American evangelicals.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.000]  This cross-current is essential
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000]  to understand the state of affairs
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.000]  today in the U.S. evangelical landscape.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000]  The rabid, condemning response
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.000]  of conservative evangelicals
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.000]  to the HIV/AIDS crisis
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.000]  in the '80s and '90s
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:37.000]  added another layer of judgmentalism
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.000]  and cultural division and separation,
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000]  all justified by, quote,
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.000]  the good news of the gospel, unquote.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.000]  The crisis of today
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.000]  has a long development
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.000]  that precedes it.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.000]  So finally, today.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.000]  Today, American white evangelicalism
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.000]  is publicly and privately
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:59.000]  in a shambles and in confusion.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000]  Publicly and broadly,
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000]  the identification of evangelicalism
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.000]  with Trumpism
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.000]  and the loss of the 2020 election
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000]  was a resounding repudiation
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000]  of American white evangelicalism
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:14.000]  by the broad American public,
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.000]  not least by African Americans,
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.000]  but also by many whites.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.000]  Many up to this point,
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.000]  evangelicals were silent
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000]  or deflective of the racial issues
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000]  and associated with the appointment
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.000]  under Trump of conservative judges
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.000]  at all levels
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.000]  and the dismantling
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.000]  of various social safeguards,
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.000]  the aggressive politics
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.000]  and policies of America First,
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:40.000]  the anti-immigration and anti-LGBT,
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:43.000]  anti-abortion, anti-racial justice
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.000]  and anti-science stances
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:46.000]  that have all been part
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000]  of the Trump administration.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.000]  And then the post-election unwillingness
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:54.000]  since November to acknowledge
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:57.000]  Biden's defeat of Trump.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000]  Over 73 million Americans
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.000]  who voted for Trump
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.000]  in this last election
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:05.000]  included still 80%
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000]  white evangelical voters.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000]  The summer of 2020
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.000]  before the election
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000]  will go down as one of the most prominent
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000]  and provocative seasons
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:17.000]  of racial demonstrations
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.000]  in the United States to date,
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.000]  triggered most directly
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.000]  by the murder of a string of
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:24.000]  and a string of murders
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.000]  of unarmed African Americans
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.000]  and especially the killing
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.000]  of George Floyd by white policemen.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.000]  Somewhere between 15 and 25 million people
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.000]  were active in demonstrations
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:38.000]  over this past summer
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.000]  in cities and towns across the country,
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:42.000]  people of all races and ages
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.000]  and political affiliations.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000]  Virtually nothing was said or done
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:49.000]  by many that the press turned to
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.000]  and called evangelical leaders.
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:54.000]  The height of offense to evangelicals
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.000]  should have been taken
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000]  when Trump aggressively dismissed
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000]  protesters for a photo opportunity
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.000]  in front of a church in Washington, D.C.
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000]  in order to hold up there
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000]  an upside-down Bible.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000]  But instead, Trump's actions
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.000]  were heralded by prominent
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.000]  white evangelical voices.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.000]  The political and public rejection
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.000]  of science in response
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000]  to the coronavirus pandemic
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.000]  added a third layer
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.000]  to the problems of this moment,
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.000]  more fuel yet to the fire
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.000]  that put the voices of political
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000]  and evangelical forces
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.000]  on the side of being,
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.000]  frankly, reality-denying.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.000]  Denial of racism and white supremacy,
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000]  denial of the coronavirus
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000]  and trust in science,
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.000]  denial of the election
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.000]  and its outcome,
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:44.000]  all has many evangelical supporters
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:45.000]  in common.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000]  Typically when these denials
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:48.000]  are offered as an expression
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:49.000]  of Christian faith,
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.000]  then it appears to the wider
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:52.000]  American culture
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000]  and to many Christians
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.000]  and non-Christians
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000]  inside the United States
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.000]  that it appears that evangelicalism
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:01.000]  has less and less to do
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.000]  with ordinary reality,
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.000]  the reality that everyone else
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.000]  lives full time.
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.000]  The tradition that has elevated
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:10.000]  the possibilities of spiritual
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.000]  and theological knowing
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:13.000]  in Jesus Christ
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.000]  appears to have abandoned
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.000]  the possibility of knowledge.
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.000]  This historic theological
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.000]  and cultural stew
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.000]  is the crisis of American
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000]  white evangelicalism.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:26.000]  For me personally,
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:27.000]  it is a crushing,
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:30.000]  maddening and tragic story.
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:31.000]  But far more importantly,
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.000]  and I hope that I am wrong,
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:36.000]  this highly public narrative
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:37.000]  holds every sign
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.000]  of driving a multigenerational
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000]  decimating disaffection
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.000]  with many people,
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:45.000]  not least many young adults
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.000]  in the United States.
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:48.000]  For if this,
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.000]  this that has been demonstrated
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:51.000]  in the last four years
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.000]  and in the last months
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:54.000]  and in the last weeks,
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.000]  if this is the fruit
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.000]  of white American evangelicalism,
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000]  how could it ever be claimed
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000]  that its gospel
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:06.000]  could be received as good news?
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.000]  So in light of all of that,
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.000]  what is the hope?
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.000]  Jesus said,
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:11.000]  "I am the way,
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.000]  the truth and the light."
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:14.000]  This is the word
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.000]  that defines and holds
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.000]  all other words.
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:18.000]  This is the plum line,
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.000]  the true vine,
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:21.000]  the rock that is our origin,
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:24.000]  our redeemer and our sustainer.
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.000]  Behold,
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000]  all things are being made new,
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.000]  the apostle says,
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.000]  even white evangelicalism
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.000]  that promotes that hope for others,
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:34.000]  that hope for others
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:35.000]  when it is a time
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.000]  when we who are white evangelicals
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:38.000]  in America
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.000]  need it more than ever.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.000]  On many levels,
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:45.000]  the white American evangelical population
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000]  does not want to live out
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.000]  its theological identity
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.000]  as much as it wants to justify
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.000]  its social and racial identity.
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:54.000]  And more on this
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.000]  in the next lecture.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000]  There is no joy in sharing
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.000]  what I have said in this lecture.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:01.000]  The story could be told
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:02.000]  in the positive light
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:05.000]  of God's true and faithful bounty.
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:06.000]  In truth,
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.000]  it is a both/and story.
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.000]  God is faithful
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.000]  to white American evangelical church
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.000]  and the white American evangelical church
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:17.000]  is a deep and painful crisis.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:18.000]  In this lecture,
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:20.000]  I have tried to show the scope of the problem.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.000]  Tomorrow,
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:22.000]  I will turn to some
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:25.000]  of the more underlying reasons.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:27.000]  Let me stop there
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:31.000]  and see if there is comment or questions
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.000]  as we engage together.
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:37.000]  Thank you, Dr. Labberton,
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:38.000]  for walking us through
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.000]  the past three centuries,
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.000]  giving us a quick
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.000]  but succinct historical survey
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:47.000]  of how the present evangelical crisis
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.000]  came to be.
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.000]  So in what follows,
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.000]  two members of our faculty
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.000]  will give their response
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.000]  to Dr. Labberton's speech.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.000]  Before introducing them,
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:02.000]  I would like to remind the audience
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.000]  that a question and answer session
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:08.000]  will immediately follow the responses.
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.000]  All the questions can be posted
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:15.000]  on our website in the live streaming page.
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.000]  And you may scroll down the webpage.
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.000]  After the live streaming in Mandarin,
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:22.000]  there is a Q&A session,
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:25.000]  and you are most welcome
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.000]  and strongly encouraged
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.000]  to input your questions there
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:32.000]  after inputting your name.
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.000]  Your questions or comments
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:37.000]  can be either in Chinese or English.
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:41.000]  Now, our two responses...
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.000]  our two response speakers today,
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:47.000]  they are Dr. Chen Wenyan,
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:50.000]  our visiting professor in practical studies,
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:54.000]  and Reverend Dr. Song Jun,
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:57.000]  our Philip Tan associate professor
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:00.000]  in theological studies.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.000]  Their responses will be given
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:05.000]  in English and Putonghua, respectively.
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:09.000]  Let's welcome them with our applause.
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:22.000]  Thank you, Dr. Labberton,
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.000]  for your wonderful lecture,
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:25.000]  and I feel so honored
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.000]  to give my personal response here.
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:31.000]  I was drawn to the Fowler School of Theology
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.000]  long before I entered the CGST.
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:37.000]  I think most of the Hong Kong churches
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:40.000]  know Fowler not only as a seminary
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:41.000]  and a training ground
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:44.000]  for counselors and theologians,
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.000]  but also as the school
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.000]  for training intercultural workers
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:51.000]  and teachers in mission.
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:54.000]  The two CGST mission faculty members
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:59.000]  prior to me both got their D.MITS degrees
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:02.000]  from Fowler School of World Mission,
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:04.000]  which has now changed her name
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:09.000]  to the Fowler School of Intercultural Studies.
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:12.000]  To me, Fowler's intercultural studies
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.000]  excel on issues like gospel and culture,
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.000]  intercultural communication,
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.000]  cultural anthropology,
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:21.000]  and so on and so forth.
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.000]  And we have all benefited
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:26.000]  from the easy-to-grasp concepts
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:28.000]  like 10/40 window,
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:31.000]  unreached people groups,
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.000]  people movement in church growth,
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:34.000]  et cetera,
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:37.000]  developed by the Fowler faculty.
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:40.000]  We are also on the receiving end
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:42.000]  from a lot of American missionaries
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:45.000]  coming to this part of the world.
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:48.000]  Personally, I had great friends
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:51.000]  among the American Southern Baptist missionaries
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:53.000]  when my family was in Sri Lanka
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:55.000]  three decades ago.
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.000]  I had very mixed feeling,
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.000]  experience with them
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:01.000]  who worked closely with me
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.000]  in that country.
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.000]  We were great friends,
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:08.000]  so much so that we had asked
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:10.000]  an elderly couple
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:14.000]  to be the godparents of our infant son.
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:17.000]  But at the same time,
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.000]  we avoided too close a connection
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:23.000]  because of the way they carry themselves.
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:26.000]  Coming in with obvious financial power
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:28.000]  and human resources,
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:32.000]  locals commented that they lived like kings.
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:35.000]  Another difficulty between us
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.000]  was our differences
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:39.000]  in seeing the meaning of the gospel
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:43.000]  in a world more torn land.
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.000]  To our American colleagues,
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:47.000]  their job was to get the message
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:49.000]  of the gospel across
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.000]  without ever touching
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:56.000]  on the problems of inequity and injustice
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:59.000]  that were rampant in the country.
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.000]  A lot of the mission theories
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:03.000]  and conceptual framework
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:06.000]  were generated from social sciences
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.000]  which were excellent tools
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:11.000]  for reaching people outside the church.
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:13.000]  But unfortunately,
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.000]  such techniques did not touch
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:18.000]  on the socioeconomic political aspects
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.000]  of the gospel.
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:24.000]  And the good news of God's mercy and justice
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:28.000]  to a broken world has been missed out.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:31.000]  What is the gospel to a world
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.000]  plagued by systemic oppression
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:37.000]  against the minority and the disadvantaged,
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:41.000]  especially when privileged middle-class Christians
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.000]  were being implicated
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:48.000]  as part of the unjust process?
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:52.000]  After reading Dr.Leviton's lecture script,
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:55.000]  I could suddenly solve the puzzle I have
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:59.000]  regarding the focal areas of American missiology.
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.000]  Now I understand
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:04.000]  why the packaged Kairos mission course
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.000]  did not mention the special needs
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.000]  of the poor and the marginalized
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:11.000]  and why in another classic package
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:13.000]  called Perspectives,
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:15.000]  out of 169 articles,
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:19.000]  only 6, that is 3.5%,
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:23.000]  directly talk about the issues of poverty
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:25.000]  and social ills.
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:27.000]  Now I understand
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.000]  why there is no mentioning of liberation,
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:31.000]  of ethnic equality,
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:34.000]  and of suffering and persecution,
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:36.000]  because the majority of authors
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:39.000]  belong to a majority of white evangelicals
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:41.000]  that have actually turned a blind eye
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:45.000]  on these issues on their own doorsteps.
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:48.000]  Then the problem is getting serious
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:52.000]  because we have imported the whole paradigm
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:55.000]  and repeated the same patterns
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:56.000]  of missionary engagement
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:01.000]  in our Hong Kong and Mainland churches.
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:02.000]  These days,
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:06.000]  we talk a lot about the Silk Road initiatives
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.000]  that have enabled Chinese missionaries
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:12.000]  to venture far beyond the country border,
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:13.000]  going to countries
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:17.000]  that badly need Chinese input in their businesses.
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:22.000]  But in all these Asian and African countries,
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.000]  do we have to ask
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.000]  if our political supremacy
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.000]  and economic advantage
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:31.000]  reflect a God that care for sins
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:34.000]  generated from power imbalance?
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:37.000]  How much are we implicated
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:41.000]  in some of the irregular Chinese trading methods
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:45.000]  and exploitation of people and the land?
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:47.000]  The way we carry our presence
[00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:51.000]  speaks volumes about the gospel we preach.
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.000]  The contemporary Chinese mission movements
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:55.000]  like Back to Jerusalem,
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:58.000]  the Homecoming Chinese Gathering,
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:01.000]  or Mission China 2030,
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:05.000]  have gathered momentum in recent years
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.000]  to mobilize Chinese Christians
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:09.000]  to serve the global church,
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.000]  which is very good indeed.
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:12.000]  However,
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:15.000]  despite all their good intentions,
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:19.000]  they all carry certain air of conquest and entitlement,
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:23.000]  painting the Chinese church as the country
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:26.000]  used by God at the end to finish the task
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:30.000]  to preach the gospel to the ends of the earth.
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:32.000]  Such stance does energize
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:35.000]  and motivate people in positive ways,
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:39.000]  but are we going out as conquerors and saviors
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:44.000]  or as fellow sinners needing redemption?
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.000]  Do we dare to mention that
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:51.000]  we are also being seen against by the social system?
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:55.000]  The same holds true within the Chinese soil
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:58.000]  when a sizable group of Chinese Han Christians
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:02.000]  enter minority groups without any attempt
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:04.000]  to embrace a world of weakness,
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:08.000]  vulnerability and marginality.
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:11.000]  Han Christians often fail to identify
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:14.000]  with the struggles of being minorities,
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:18.000]  refuse to learn minority languages and cultures,
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.000]  and expect ethnic Christians
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:24.000]  to merge into the majority Han churches.
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:25.000]  Thus,
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.000]  they have inadvertently adopted
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:32.000]  a mindset and lifestyle that support inequality.
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:35.000]  Critical self-reflection is truly needed
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:40.000]  for missionaries and their sending bodies.
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:42.000]  Another problem coming out
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:45.000]  from this superiority mentality
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:47.000]  is the lack of partnership
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:51.000]  with the weak in the advancement of the gospel.
[00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:55.000]  We pride ourselves when we play the savior mode,
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:57.000]  sending out workers to places
[00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:59.000]  where the church is poor and depleted
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.000]  and sometimes even persecuted.
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:06.000]  But we are not ready to encounter truth
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000]  in those contexts
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000]  which may change and challenge
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:13.000]  our current position in our theology.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000]  Are we ready to engage with cultures
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.000]  that may be superior to ours,
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:22.000]  not in the modern day economic technical sense,
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.000]  but in the sense of classic moral standards
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.000]  that sometimes have even worked on the archaic,
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000]  like caring for the elderly,
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000]  communal sharing,
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:37.000]  the demand to uphold family name and honor,
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000]  the emphasis on resilience in suffering
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.000]  instead of success, etc., etc.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000]  Are we repeating the failures
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.000]  of American white evangelicalism?
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000]  Coming back to lecture today,
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000]  we might not be able to feel
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.000]  the kind of pain and anguish
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:02.000]  Dr.Leberton has on American white Christians
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:05.000]  because the whole scenario seems so distant.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:09.000]  But we know we are all bundled together
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000]  in this global village.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000]  And it's time for us to confront
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:17.000]  the whole array of misrepresentation of the gospel
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000]  and the darker side of human nature
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:24.000]  being dressed under the cloak of evangelicalism.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000]  I pray that together
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.000]  we might be able to find a way out of this mire.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000]  Thank you.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:46.000]  尊敬的Leberton博士,李思敬院长,各位嘉宾,
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.000]  established guests, colleagues and students,
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.000]  I am most honored to be given the opportunity
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.000]  to respond to Professor Leberton's great speech today.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000]  I'd like to talk about the stories
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:01.000]  of American mission workers in modern China,
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000]  but it would be a totally impossible task
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000]  to do justice to this rich legacy
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000]  within seven minutes' time.
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.000]  However, I am much encouraged by the example
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000]  of the late Reverend Dr. Cheng Chengyi,
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000]  one of the representatives of Chinese churches
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000]  at the World Missionary Conference
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000]  in Edinburgh in 1920.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000]  Rev. Cheng was able to clearly articulate
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000]  the voices of the Chinese Church
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.000]  within a short span of just seven minutes.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:33.000]  Tracing the footprints of the many
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000]  American mission workers in China,
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.000]  from Elijah Coleman Bridgman,
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.000]  the first one to arrive in China in 1830,
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000]  through to Loyal Holding Bartow,
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000]  who finally died in prison in China,
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.000]  we can clearly see the dedication
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:52.000]  and contribution of the American Church in China
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.000]  in those one and a half centuries.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:01.000]  The impact made was enormous and imperishable,
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:05.000]  so much so that even after over 70 years,
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.000]  the new China could not totally remove
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.000]  all the marks and traces they left.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:18.000]  If we push the clock back
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.000]  another 30 years from 1949,
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:26.000]  we will find that the Chinese Communist Party
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:30.000]  had been a competition to Christianity
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.000]  since the Party's inception in 1921.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:39.000]  The competition was vigorous on many, many fronts.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:43.000]  Both sides had wins and losses at different times.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.000]  In respect of a number of reasons,
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:52.000]  in respect of a number of resources and operations
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000]  and other things,
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:59.000]  in the first 30 years of the 20th century,
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:03.000]  Christianity seemed to gain the upper hand,
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:07.000]  except that it didn't have a military presence.
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:14.000]  But by the end of the second 30 years,
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:19.000]  Christianity had lost almost everything.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:24.000]  And during the third 30-year period,
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.000]  the competition ended in a draw
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.000]  if we look at numbers alone.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:35.000]  There is so much that I want to tell about this period,
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:41.000]  so in the remaining five minutes,
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.000]  I should be very, very focused.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:52.000]  In mid-20th century,
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:57.000]  the China Committee of the Division of Foreign Missions
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:02.000]  of the National Council of Churches of Christ in the USA
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:08.000]  conducted a study on the 150-odd American mission workers
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.000]  from 22 sending organizations
[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:14.000]  who withdrew from mainland China.
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:21.000]  The report entitled "Lessons to be Learned
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:25.000]  from the Experiences of Christian Missions in China"
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:30.000]  was published in 1951.
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:35.000]  It represented the common reflections
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:39.000]  of that group of American missionaries in China.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.000]  One of the issues raised in the report
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.000]  caught my special attention.
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:52.000]  Whilst almost all missionary respondents agreed that
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.000]  services in the urban and rural areas,
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:58.000]  common education,
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.000]  improvements in agriculture and so on,
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:06.000]  were all needed to meet the needs of the people of China,
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:12.000]  86% of the respondents pointed out that
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:18.000]  the Church had done very little in helping workers and farmers,
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:26.000]  and 31% agreed that
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:31.000]  the Church's action would build up a community
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:35.000]  that is totally detached from the poor people,
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:39.000]  and 31% agreed that
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:43.000]  missionaries tended to associate much more closely
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:47.000]  with government officials, intellectuals and rich people.
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:51.000]  Since the mid-19th century,
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:56.000]  the most urgent priority for China
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.000]  and the most desperate dream of her people
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:03.000]  had been survival and rebuilding the country.
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:07.000]  For this, different organizations and individuals
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:11.000]  had put forward various proposals and solutions.
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000]  At the same time,
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:17.000]  they were fighting for their share of influence and power
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:21.000]  which was needed to change the country.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:25.000]  That the Communist Party finally won this power struggle
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.000]  might be attributable to many reasons,
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:32.000]  one of which was the ability to hone in precisely
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:38.000]  to the crux which was the farmers and the land.
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.000]  So the Communist Party's
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:45.000]  penetrated into farming communities,
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:49.000]  enticing them with fair distribution of land,
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:54.000]  and tirelessly fought on their behalf,
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:58.000]  thus winning over their support.
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:02.000]  Let me clarify here
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:06.000]  that I'm not trying to say that
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:11.000]  the Chinese Communist Party's goal and efforts
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:15.000]  are not related to the Communist Party's endeavors
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:19.000]  without commenting on the legitimacy of their tactics and actions.
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:22.000]  By contrast,
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000]  many American mission workers
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:30.000]  tried to showcase the Chinese version of America's success story
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.000]  in becoming a strong nation,
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:37.000]  extending the American westward expansion
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.000]  all the way to China,
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.000]  with the promise that
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.000]  this gospel from across the Atlantic
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:52.000]  would bring about democratic political system
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.000]  in the American style,
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:58.000]  free market economy,
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.000]  and the Christian ethos
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:05.000]  that was rooted in the founding of the United States.
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:08.000]  I must admit that this is still
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:14.000]  the dreams of many Chinese Christians today.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:18.000]  But as an agricultural country like China,
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:21.000]  what about the most pressing social issue,
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:27.000]  namely the farming people and the land?
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:31.000]  During the 1920s to 1930s,
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:34.000]  some American mission organizations
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:39.000]  did send some agricultural mission workers to China,
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:42.000]  and in some Christian universities in China,
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:46.000]  agricultural departments were set up.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:49.000]  Some Chinese Christian leaders had championed
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:53.000]  some rural development movements
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:56.000]  and managed to get some financial
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:01.000]  and policy support from the then Kuomintang government.
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:09.000]  But their contribution was limited to symptomatic measures.
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:14.000]  These are like starting education in the rural areas,
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.000]  improving hygiene and farming technologies,
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:22.000]  but without tackling the roots of the problem,
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.000]  which was the land issue.
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.000]  But these efforts were not embraced
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:32.000]  by mainline Chinese churches,
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:37.000]  and indeed,just like a glasshouse flower
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:41.000]  which bloomed only for a short while
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:46.000]  and soon to be destroyed by the Sino-Japanese War.
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:50.000]  Just as advocates for rural development
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:55.000]  were trying hard to persuade the mainline Chinese churches
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000]  to change their focus,
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:00.000]  some mission workers in the tertiary education sector
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000]  cried out in alarm
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:07.000]  that the Communists had stolen from Christian thoughts.
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.000]  The Communists had already put into practice
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:13.000]  the very concept of fighting for social justice
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.000]  for grassroots people.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:20.000]  Pastors at that time also found that
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.000]  they were losing the young people
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:27.000]  to the Communist movements.
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:31.000]  In the summer of 1933,
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.000]  special meetings were held among mission workers
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:39.000]  to discuss how Christianity could be as influential
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:43.000]  among young people as Communism.
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:47.000]  The issue that I wish to bring up today
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:52.000]  is not whether Christianity could win in this competition,
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:55.000]  but rather whether the Church
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.000]  is following the path of life
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:02.000]  after Christ and His cross.
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.000]  Then Jesus said to the disciples,
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:08.000]  "If you want to be a Christian,
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.000]  you must be a Christian,
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:15.000]  and you must follow the way of the Lord."
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:18.000]  Then Jesus said to His disciples,
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.000]  "Whoever wants to be My disciple
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.000]  must deny themselves
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:28.000]  and take up their cross and follow Me."
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:32.000]  The young official in the Gospels
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:35.000]  had great wealth,
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.000]  so the meaning of the cross
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.000]  was to challenge the status
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:44.000]  and challenging the social order
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:47.000]  on which He was established.
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.000]  Jesus answered,
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.000]  "If you want to be perfect,
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:56.000]  go, sell your possessions,
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.000]  and give to the poor,
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.000]  and you will have treasure in heaven.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:07.000]  Then come, follow Me."
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:10.000]  Christ has called His followers
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:13.000]  to tread on a downward path.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.000]  The issue is not whether the Church
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:19.000]  is in the middle class,
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:22.000]  but rather whether she is living out
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:25.000]  a different life,
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.000]  separate from the world trends
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:31.000]  and in accordance with Christ's commands.
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:34.000]  We can list four or more characteristics
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.000]  of evangelicalism,
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:40.000]  but each one may have the peril
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:43.000]  of becoming just a deceiving packaging.
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:46.000]  The crux is whether we are determined
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:49.000]  to internalize it as our inner value
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.000]  and to be recognized as such
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.000]  through our earnest practice.
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:58.000]  Thank you.
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:01.000]  (掌聲)
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:16.000]  Thank you.
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:19.000]  Thank you, Dr. Chen and Dr. Sung
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:22.000]  for responses.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:25.000]  And now in the rest of the...
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:29.000]  we have about 45 minutes of questions and answers.
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:33.000]  And in fact, there have been several questions
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:36.000]  being sent in.
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:41.000]  Dr. Levitin, can we start with a question
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:47.000]  perhaps most directly related to your presentation?
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:52.000]  So I think the first question is
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:56.000]  what factors made evangelical Christians
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:00.000]  so blind to be unable to live out the truth of gospel?
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:03.000]  What can be done to change?
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.000]  What suggestions do you have for Chinese churches
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:10.000]  in America, which tends to so blindly
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:16.000]  follow the white churches in many or in all ways?
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:20.000]  Thank you very much for that good question.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:24.000]  Let me start simply by also saying thank you
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000]  to the respondents.
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000]  I appreciated very much their comments
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000]  and I hope I'll have a chance
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:33.000]  to interact with them at some stage.
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000]  The question is penetrating
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.000]  and I think maybe one way of summarizing it
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:43.000]  is that we are all aware that the gospel
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:47.000]  is far more radical than the church
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:51.000]  that names that gospel as usually ever wanting to be.
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:54.000]  What Jesus did and what he said
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.000]  and how he taught
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.000]  and what he called us to
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:05.000]  is just much more difficult and uncomfortable
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:09.000]  than we are usually willing to actually accept
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000]  or even acknowledge.
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:15.000]  I think Christian history has shown
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:20.000]  that there is a great tendency, a common tendency
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:23.000]  to accommodate the gospel
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:26.000]  to something that we find more acceptable
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:30.000]  than to live in the radical way
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:33.000]  that Jesus exemplified and taught.
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:38.000]  So in talking about American white evangelicalism,
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:41.000]  I'm talking about one way
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000]  that the church throughout history
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:46.000]  has simply accommodated the good news
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000]  to the life that we want to go ahead
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:51.000]  and live apart from the gospel.
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:54.000]  And we want to use the gospel
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:58.000]  as a framework for various purposes,
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:05.000]  for eternal life, for moral clarity,
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:12.000]  for social relationships, for hope,
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.000]  for love, for forgiveness.
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.000]  But the radical call to take up our cross
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:22.000]  and follow Christ has never been
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:26.000]  a popular part of the life of the church.
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:29.000]  And throughout church history,
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:32.000]  the number of people, as Jesus said,
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:36.000]  that are willing to do that are few.
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:41.000]  So let me begin first with saying that.
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.000]  We're talking about the broadness of the church
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.000]  and its unwillingness to actually be
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:50.000]  radical followers of Jesus.
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:53.000]  And in many ways, the white evangelical church
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:57.000]  in America becomes a case study
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000]  in what for different reasons could be said,
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:03.000]  perhaps as the two respondents have indicated,
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000]  in some ways of the Chinese church,
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000]  but it certainly could be true
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:10.000]  of countries all around the world,
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:14.000]  each in their own particular context and culture.
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000]  But in the American setting,
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000]  I would commend a book
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:21.000]  that I'm going to refer to again tomorrow
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:27.000]  called "The Democratization of Christianity in America."
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:31.000]  "The Democratization of Christianity in America."
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:35.000]  It's an exceptionally good book,
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:40.000]  which is an expression of the way
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000]  that American Christianity changed
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:45.000]  as it moved from the east coast
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000]  to the west coast of the United States
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:51.000]  and further into the south as well.
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000]  And a great deal of the theme of the book
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000]  has to do with the way that Christianity
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:19:00.000]  became something which people made up for themselves.
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000]  So they had the Bible,
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000]  but they often didn't have any educated leaders
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:08.000]  they didn't have any kind of Christian community
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:09.000]  around them necessarily.
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:12.000]  They didn't have any educational institutions
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:16.000]  that were helping to guide and form their leadership.
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:20.000]  They just instead took the gospel
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:21.000]  or whatever it is that they thought
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000]  they knew of the gospel
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:26.000]  and put it to work for their own designs,
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:29.000]  sure humbly and earnestly,
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:33.000]  but often very, very specifically and personally.
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:36.000]  Rather than as a response to
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:39.000]  the lordship of Christ over all things.
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000]  And out of that came
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:44.000]  what now we would recognize, for example,
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:47.000]  as consumer Christianity.
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:50.000]  That is, I'm going to take from the gospel
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:51.000]  what I want,
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:54.000]  and I'm going to keep the parts that I like
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000]  that serve me,
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:59.000]  and I'm going to more or less ignore
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:04.000]  or reject the parts that I don't like.
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000]  And that pattern,
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:10.000]  which is one that emerges early in American history,
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:13.000]  is one that continues to this day.
[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000]  So the antidote to that,
[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:19.000]  coming to the question asker's point,
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000]  what is the antidote to that?
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000]  I think the antidote to that
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:28.000]  has to do with how we form genuine disciples,
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000]  not people who are part of
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000]  denomination and a movement
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:35.000]  or an organization or a structure,
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:39.000]  but people who are truly devoted
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:42.000]  to being followers of Jesus.
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000]  And then do it in community,
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:45.000]  because of course we're not meant
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:46.000]  to live this kind of life.
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000]  We can't live this kind of life
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:52.000]  individualistically as Americans also try to do.
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000]  We'll come to that more tomorrow.
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000]  We have to do it in community.
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000]  And in doing it in community,
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000]  then we have to check and balance
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000]  of other people around us.
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:05.000]  And the difficulty is that so often
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:06.000]  what we gather around us
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:09.000]  is a community that looks like us.
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000]  So then the church starts looking
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000]  like the social setting
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000]  into which we were born,
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000]  rather than a community
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000]  like the apostle Paul,
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000]  I would want to argue,
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.000]  suggests is meant to be
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:25.000]  an entirely new humanity.
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:28.000]  One humanity, a new humanity
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000]  that reflects the death
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.000]  and resurrection of Jesus
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000]  by the death and resurrection
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:36.000]  of ourselves in community
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000]  of unlike people.
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:41.000]  That's the place that the church
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:42.000]  has often broken down.
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:43.000]  And that's exactly what happened
[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000]  in American church culture
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000]  in historical terms.
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:50.000]  But it is largely still the case.
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:54.000]  So when a pull was done by the church
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000]  a pull was done by the Pew Foundation
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000]  two years ago,
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000]  about how many white Americans
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:03.000]  have close relationships
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:07.000]  with a person of another race,
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:10.000]  nearly 85% of white Americans
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:11.000]  said they did not have
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:14.000]  any close relationships
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:17.000]  with people that were not of their race.
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:20.000]  Now that's true of society in general.
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000]  But if that's true of society in general,
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:25.000]  then it is tragically certainly true
[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:29.000]  of churches who have a white normativity
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:32.000]  that often excludes people of color
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:35.000]  and does so in cultural and church terms.
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:38.000]  And then we just become a mirror,
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.000]  a hall of mirrors
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:40.000]  that we all look alike
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:43.000]  and act alike and talk alike.
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000]  And therefore we think that's the gospel
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000]  instead of letting the gospel
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:51.000]  radically redefine us.
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000]  Thank you, Dr. Levitin.
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000]  I think you have raised several themes
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:59.000]  like taming the radical nature of the gospel,
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:00.000]  the consumerism,
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000]  and also bringing together
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:06.000]  unlike people in the new created community in Christ.
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:09.000]  So these themes sound also familiar
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:13.000]  here in actually in the Chinese churches
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:16.000]  and the churches around here in Hong Kong as well.
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000]  So I think this leads very naturally
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000]  to a second question.
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:24.000]  Actually, it's a small agenda in nature.
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:27.000]  It says maybe our two response speakers
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:30.000]  have to fill in some of the gaps as well.
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:31.000]  It asks,
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:35.000]  "In what way does American white evangelicalism
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:39.000]  affect churches in Hong Kong now?"
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:42.000]  So, yes, I think we need wisdom
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.000]  from across the Atlantic Pacific.
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:48.000]  The respondent should speak first.
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000]  OK.
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:53.000]  So perhaps I translate the question
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000]  for Dr. Sung-Chun first.
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000]  OK.
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:00.000]  蔣元所說的美國白人福音派的信仰
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:05.000]  對於現在香港的教會有多大影響?
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:08.000]  Maybe we may start with a born Chinese,
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.000]  a Hong Konger.
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.000]  Sorry.
[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:14.000]  Well, I noticed that there are
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:17.000]  quite a few faculty members on the floor.
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:20.000]  So I'm expecting some of your response as well.
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:21.000]  OK.
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:24.000]  We need your input.
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:27.000]  And, yeah, because of my location,
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:30.000]  I mean, I feel more and more distant
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:33.000]  from the Hong Kong current scene, to be sure.
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:38.000]  But I'm just thinking that
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:41.000]  just following up on Dr. Lepperton's remark,
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:45.000]  I think we need to be aware of our inclination
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:51.000]  or this kind of tendency
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:56.000]  to group together with people who are like with us.
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:59.000]  So I mean, this is something very natural
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000]  because you feel so comfortable.
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:04.000]  We will stay in our comfort zone.
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:08.000]  But right now, because of the divisions,
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:11.000]  the divisiveness among the churches in Hong Kong,
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:15.000]  I think we need to sort of alter our mentality.
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:18.000]  We need to keep reminding us
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:21.000]  that we have to keep reading from the other side
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:26.000]  and then to listen from opposing angles and views.
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000]  So I think this is kind of a discipline.
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:32.000]  I call this even spiritual discipline for us
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:40.000]  that we need to constantly keep learning
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:45.000]  and trying to see what we have missed
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:49.000]  in our own framework.
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:52.000]  So this is something that I think should be done.
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:56.000]  But if talking about this whole concept of
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:00.000]  whole tendency of white evangelicalism
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000]  and their influence on the Hong Kong church,
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:07.000]  I'm feeling that whatever American is doing now
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000]  would have global effects.
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000]  Like it or not.
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000]  So we have to acknowledge that
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:16.000]  because of all this online information
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:21.000]  and all because of all the most of the theological material
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:25.000]  we study, imported from the West
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:29.000]  and because of the majority of written material
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:32.000]  from the States,
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:35.000]  I mean, we are really affected
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:44.000]  by the whole concept of
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:52.000]  theology that would underplay the
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:56.000]  emphasis or the look on the weak and the marginalized.
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:00.000]  This is what I'm talking in my response.
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:03.000]  Because of this whole idea of success
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:07.000]  that you can do it, freedom and all this idea
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000]  that is very positive thinking
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000]  and it's really good for us.
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:14.000]  But on the other hand, I think we really lack
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:18.000]  this whole concept of suffering and persecution
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:21.000]  in American theology.
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000]  And we import them.
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:27.000]  And then we tend to talk about,
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000]  say when we talk about suffering,
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:32.000]  we talk about personal suffering as such.
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:35.000]  Instead of social suffering.
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:38.000]  We talk about this whole concept of
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:41.000]  suffering because of illness, of age.
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:44.000]  But we know that
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:50.000]  in the end, actually, most of the suffering
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:54.000]  actually comes from a social setting.
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:58.000]  But because Hong Kong churches are in general
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:01.000]  also very middle class.
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:05.000]  And so we can hide in our small niche
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000]  and then we can feel comfortable.
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:12.000]  And again, we can sort of explain our whole being
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:16.000]  with a very limited kind of framework.
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:20.000]  And so I'm feeling that if we look broader
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000]  into the whole global world
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:25.000]  and read more about the kind of experiences
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:29.000]  and narratives from more of the third world countries,
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000]  from Africa, from Latin America,
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:34.000]  and from say South Asia, etc.
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:38.000]  I think we'll really try to wean ourselves, okay,
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:44.000]  from American evangelicalism.
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:49.000]  Thank you very much.
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:54.000]  Thank you for the question and the response from Wenyan.
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:29:00.000]  I just want to respond to one point.
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:03.000]  From what Dr. Levitin talked about
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:06.000]  American evangelicalism
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:17.000]  true to the critical and put into action.
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000]  I think the churches in Hong Kong
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:24.000]  do have the DNA of evangelicalism.
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:29.000]  But there are three things
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:33.000]  which are also pointed out in the question.
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000]  And as someone coming from mainland China,
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000]  I have such observation.
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:43.000]  The first one, from 1980s onwards,
[01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:48.000]  churches in Hong Kong
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000]  more and more members of them
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:54.000]  are becoming more concerned about social issues,
[01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:57.000]  especially among young Christians.
[01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000]  And this is a very clear sign.
[01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:11.000]  The second point is
[01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:15.000]  in Hong Kong there are also many ethnic problems.
[01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:18.000]  But among Christians in Hong Kong,
[01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:23.000]  very few of them would voice out their response.
[01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:28.000]  Most of them do not admit that there is an ethnic problem.
[01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:31.000]  But as a very international and open community here,
[01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:39.000]  with many, many people from many different ethnic backgrounds living here,
[01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:42.000]  their conditions and their problems,
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:46.000]  their livelihood is not something
[01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:50.000]  that is a concern of the Church of Hong Kong.
[01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000]  The third point is
[01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:58.000]  many churches in Hong Kong are middle class,
[01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:03.000]  neglecting concern about the grassroot people.
[01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:07.000]  But admittedly there are many organizations,
[01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000]  Christian NGOs,
[01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:14.000]  who are helping the underprivileged.
[01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:21.000]  But they also have characteristics of the middle class church.
[01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:22.000]  Thank you.
[01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:27.000]  Dr.Levitin, any further comments after hearing the two?
[01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:36.000]  Augustine was convinced that sin is disordered love,
[01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:43.000]  and every culture has an order of loves that it prioritizes.
[01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000]  And in American culture,
[01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:51.000]  loves that tend to get prioritized are loves like
[01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:55.000]  the love of personal happiness,
[01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:58.000]  the love of pleasure,
[01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:01.000]  the love of success,
[01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000]  which can be monetary,
[01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000]  but it can be other things as well.
[01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:09.000]  The love of power,
[01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000]  the love of beauty,
[01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:16.000]  these are all things that are part of our loves.
[01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:19.000]  And we live in a world of disordered loves,
[01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:23.000]  where we're meant to live and sustain ourselves,
[01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:26.000]  first and foremost out of the love of God,
[01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:32.000]  and in response showing our love to God as our first love.
[01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:35.000]  But of course the nature of the human story
[01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:38.000]  and the nature of the American white evangelical story
[01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:42.000]  is the story of us attaching our lives to other loves,
[01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:47.000]  and then trying to make peace with the way that they do
[01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:51.000]  and don't fit the call of a disciple.
[01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:57.000]  And part of what we're called to is to reorder our loves.
[01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:00.000]  And I think this is where Christian worship
[01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:05.000]  reveals both our sin and the places that American culture
[01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:08.000]  has influenced many places around the world,
[01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:13.000]  and the ways that we are meant to be redeemed.
[01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:17.000]  So ideally we could say public worship
[01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:24.000]  is meant to be an experience of reordering love,
[01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:29.000]  to be regrounded again in our love for God
[01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:32.000]  and our love for our neighbors
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:35.000]  and our love for ourselves.
[01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:38.000]  And within the ordering of loving our neighbors,
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:42.000]  it doesn't mean the neighbors that are like us or who like us,
[01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:45.000]  but as Jesus says in the Sermon on the Mount,
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:49.000]  it even can include those who are our enemies.
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:53.000]  So to live into that kind of reordered love
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:58.000]  means that our public worship has to feed those appetites,
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:02.000]  nurture that desire that we would be those kinds of people.
[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:06.000]  But instead,the American worship that we've exported
[01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:10.000]  is often a worship of entertainment.
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:13.000]  It's about celebrity.
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000]  It's about money.
[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:16.000]  It's about beauty.
[01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:19.000]  It's about fame,etc.,etc.
[01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:22.000]  And not,as Dr. Chan said so beautifully,
[01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:25.000]  it's not about the first law of God,
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:30.000]  particularly for the poor and for the neediest.
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:36.000]  So we are not cultivated to love what God most loves,
[01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:39.000]  and instead we're recultivated in the church
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000]  to love what we already love
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:44.000]  and then to just go on loving it even more
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:49.000]  rather than actually reflecting the love of God for the world.
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000]  So I fear that we've exported that,
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:35:00.000]  and it is its own musical and worship entertainment industry
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000]  that has often been exported,
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:10.000]  and tragically that forms people to love the wrong things.
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:11.000]  Thank you for your comment.
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:18.000]  So your comment has encouraged me to study more closely your two books,
[01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:22.000]  The Dangerous Acts of Worship and The Dangerous Acts of Loving Your Neighbor.
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:26.000]  I think I will take out more answers from your two works.
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000]  Well,actually,bring that to,
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:32.000]  I think your mentioning of loving your neighbor,
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:41.000]  actually it has quite some impact on our present Hong Kong churches as well.
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:45.000]  So there are two questions a bit related,
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000]  but actually there are some details there,
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:54.000]  so maybe it can help Dr.Leviton to help giving your wisdom
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000]  about what we may do,
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:00.000]  how we may react in the certain situation.
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000]  One question is from a pastor,
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:03.000]  and he says,
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:06.000]  Dr.Leviton, your views on complicity
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:09.000]  is something we can relate to greatly in Hong Kong.
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:13.000]  Given the recent circumstances as experienced by Hong Kong,
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000]  most churches are very divided.
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:18.000]  It is those who feel we should speak out
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000]  against present happenings,
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:21.000]  against authority,
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:24.000]  and those who do not wish to at all.
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:25.000]  As a pastor,
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:28.000]  I can say that we struggle greatly with the balancing act
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:33.000]  of wishing to speak against that which we feel is evil,
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:36.000]  and of not wishing to offend those members of the church
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:39.000]  who are strong supporters of authority.
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000]  But you seem to present the view that
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:46.000]  we are either complicit and condone evil acts like slavery,
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000]  or we speak out against it,
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000]  which at least to war,
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:53.000]  and there's highly frowned upon in the Chinese community,
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000]  which is all about harmony.
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000]  So how should we juggle this balancing act,
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000]  speaking or not speaking,
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000]  and not to be complicit?
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:04.000]  So that is the very particular question.
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000]  And in the more general nature
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:09.000]  it's about how to communicate effectively
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000]  and in a loving way
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:15.000]  to those who hold opposite opinions from you.
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:19.000]  So these are, I think, two very related questions.
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:22.000]  Can we hear your wisdom on that?
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000]  Yes, I'll offer what I have.
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:25.000]  Whether you consider it wisdom,
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:28.000]  I'll leave you to decide.
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:29.000]  Let me say first that
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000]  what you've just described by that example
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:34.000]  is precisely what has been going on
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000]  in the American white evangelical church,
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:39.000]  where you end up having some members of a church
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000]  believe that, for example,
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000]  that America and its government
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:48.000]  is not in any way an expression of God's will or desire.
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:49.000]  And in the same congregation,
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:52.000]  you have people who look at what's going on
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000]  and say this at last is the best
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:57.000]  and most supportive government for Christians
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:00.000]  that the United States has ever had.
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:03.000]  So how do they share in the same congregational life?
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:06.000]  So this problem that we're all describing
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:09.000]  manifests under different issues perhaps,
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000]  but the dynamic is really the same.
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000]  So when I think about, first of all,
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:16.000]  how Jesus responds to this dilemma,
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:20.000]  he moves toward the stranger, toward the other,
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:26.000]  and also actually toward the so-called enemy.
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000]  These are such dramatic examples,
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000]  but one of them, for example,
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000]  would be at the end of the Sermon on the Mount
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:36.000]  when Jesus says that we build our house on rock or on sand.
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:39.000]  He's clearly saying that we build our house on rock
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:40.000]  by actually doing the truth,
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:44.000]  not by just affirming it or confessing the truth.
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:45.000]  We live the truth.
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000]  That's how we build our house on rock.
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000]  And what's interesting is that right after that,
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:54.000]  he encounters a person with epilepsy.
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:58.000]  Sorry, not with-- yes, with epilepsy.
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:01.000]  No, sorry, excuse me, with leprosy.
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:02.000]  Excuse me.
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:09.000]  And in that moment, he's invited to heal the person,
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:12.000]  and Jesus moves toward this person
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:13.000]  that was considered unclean,
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000]  touches them and heals them.
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:19.000]  And then if that's not enough of a shock,
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000]  then the very next part of this
[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:25.000]  is that a Roman centurion comes toward Jesus
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:30.000]  and says that a servant of his is in great need.
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:31.000]  Could Jesus come and heal him?
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:34.000]  And Jesus says he's happily willing to do so.
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:35.000]  And the man says, "No, no,
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000]  you don't need to come and do so
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:41.000]  because you just say the word and it will be done."
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:45.000]  And then he pauses everyone around and said,
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000]  "Did you just hear what this man said?
[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:50.000]  I have not heard," these are the critical words,
[01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:55.000]  "I've not heard faithfulness like this in all of Israel.
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:58.000]  There are some people outside the kingdom of God
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:02.000]  who will be in and some who you presume to be in
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000]  who will be on the outside."
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000]  Now I share those stories because for me,
[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:09.000]  they are examples of at least some of the things
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:12.000]  to consider in answering the question.
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000]  I want to first of all move toward people
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:18.000]  that I might consider to be uncomfortable.
[01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000]  They might not be "unclean,"
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:24.000]  but they're not like me or they are not easy
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:27.000]  for me to be with or they are a problem
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000]  in quotes in some way or another.
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000]  And Jesus gives an example in this case
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:34.000]  and in so many other cases as we know
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000]  about what it means to move toward people
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:42.000]  who are difficult, marginalized, awkward, needy,
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000]  potentially unclean.
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:47.000]  I think there's a lot of tendency
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000]  in contemporary culture around the world
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:52.000]  to label people clean and unclean,
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:56.000]  to be mindful that summer should be included
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:59.000]  and others don't deserve to be included.
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000]  What's amazing about these texts
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:05.000]  in the early part of chapter 8 of Matthew's Gospel
[01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:10.000]  is that Jesus moves toward the man with leprosy,
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:18.000]  touches him, calls him a name of attachment,
[01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:23.000]  heals him, and does this completely counter
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000]  to the pressure of the moment.
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000]  The social pressure.
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000]  But then more radically,
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000]  when the centurion appears,
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:34.000]  the representative of dominating Roman authority,
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000]  he receives the man's witness,
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:39.000]  hears it for what it is,
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:42.000]  acknowledges it and lifts it up
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:46.000]  and then goes forward to actually heal the man's servant.
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:49.000]  Now, in both cases,
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000]  I think we learn lessons about what it means
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000]  to try to live together in a different way.
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000]  In the first case,
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000]  how do I learn to lean toward people
[01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:00.000]  that I might marginalize
[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000]  because of different opinions in churches
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:05.000]  over these very issues that you've just raised?
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:08.000]  That has to take practice to develop that ability.
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:13.000]  And I think often churches have small groups
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000]  that meet or prayer groups that meet.
[01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000]  Our ability to pray for one another
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000]  to grow in our capacity to love people
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:22.000]  inside the body of Christ
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000]  is one of the kinds of prayers
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:25.000]  and the sort of work
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:28.000]  that we need to hold one another accountable to doing,
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:32.000]  not just becoming our own little small tribe within a tribe,
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:35.000]  but to actually learn to love one another,
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:36.000]  to see each other,
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:37.000]  to value each other,
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:41.000]  to honor in whatever way we can.
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:45.000]  And then the gold standard of Jesus
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:48.000]  is not whether we love those who love us,
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:51.000]  but whether we love those who don't love us
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:52.000]  or don't like us
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:55.000]  and who may even be our enemies.
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:56.000]  How do we also learn to practice
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000]  loving people like that?
[01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:03.000]  And I think that happens in that case in Matthew 8.
[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000]  It happens first of all by Jesus
[01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:09.000]  just very carefully listening to what the man said.
[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000]  The most amazing part of that text
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000]  is the way that Jesus
[01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:17.000]  hears his actual declaration of faith
[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000]  and then focuses on that,
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:23.000]  letting it fully be absorbed into his own heart and mind
[01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:28.000]  and then responds back to that affirmingly.
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000]  That is deep and profound faith
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:33.000]  unlike anything I've heard in all of Israel.
[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:36.000]  Well, that was scandalous, of course, to Jews.
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:39.000]  It was crazy to think that Jesus would do that.
[01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:42.000]  And yet Jesus listened very carefully
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:46.000]  and affirmed what he could affirm.
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:49.000]  Now, I think often in divided churches
[01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:52.000]  like the ones that we're talking about tonight,
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:55.000]  we have to learn to really listen much more carefully.
[01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000]  And often, not always,
[01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000]  but often within the differences
[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:02.000]  is a failure of really hearing the other person,
[01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000]  really understanding why they're motivated,
[01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000]  what it is that drives them,
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:07.000]  what their fears are,
[01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:10.000]  what controls their anxiety.
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000]  Why are some people so insistent
[01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:15.000]  on holding on to certain forms of authority?
[01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:19.000]  And why do other people find it necessary,
[01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000]  almost required for them
[01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:24.000]  to reject certain kinds of authority?
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000]  Those are conversations
[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:29.000]  that ultimately the body of Christ has to have.
[01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:32.000]  But we have to first be able to simply carry it out
[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:35.000]  in a very respectful, mutual way.
[01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000]  And that's going to require that our hearts be remade.
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000]  It's going to require, in Paul's language,
[01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:42.000]  that we be transformed by the renewing of our minds,
[01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000]  that we have the heart of Christ
[01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:47.000]  and that we do not regard equality with God,
[01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:51.000]  that is, taking our own prerogative and views as first order,
[01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:55.000]  but actually lay them down for the sake of loving
[01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:58.000]  and in some bizarre way,
[01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:02.000]  identifying with the person that we most disagree with.
[01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:05.000]  Those are just some small initial thoughts,
[01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:08.000]  but I think it's in that kind of direction
[01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000]  that some of this work can be sustained.
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000]  But as a pastor, we have to decide,
[01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:15.000]  and I was a pastor for 35 years
[01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000]  before I became involved
[01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:20.000]  in formal theological education as I am now.
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:24.000]  And I was very, very aware every day as a pastor
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:28.000]  that it was about restoring community and communion.
[01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000]  The word "communion" for me
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:33.000]  is one of the most valuable Christian words
[01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000]  in the whole Christian vocabulary.
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000]  And it's through that lens,
[01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000]  communion with God, communion with one another,
[01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:45.000]  communion across the economic, social, political divides,
[01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:48.000]  that communion in Christ is meant to give us
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:54.000]  our ground on which to stand and build our lives.
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:59.000]  I think I do have something to add along this line.
[01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:05.000]  From my experience with the Mainland churches,
[01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:09.000]  because it's divided into the institutional
[01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:12.000]  and non-institutional churches,
[01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:17.000]  and I'm finding that this one major attitude
[01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:20.000]  that we need to have is to be humble
[01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:23.000]  and to know that in spite of all my conviction
[01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000]  and understanding of truth,
[01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000]  I don't have all the truth,
[01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:30.000]  that God is bigger and higher.
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:37.000]  I know I have certain conviction
[01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:42.000]  that I'm following the right way in my choice,
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:46.000]  either it's institutional or non-institutional.
[01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:47.000]  But it's okay,
[01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000]  because I see the other party,
[01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:52.000]  the other churches as brothers and sisters
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000]  and not as satanic work.
[01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:57.000]  So this is important.
[01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:00.000]  And another way,
[01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:04.000]  another solution is for me to be engaged
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000]  together in some joint projects.
[01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:10.000]  Usually I find that some social projects is good,
[01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:14.000]  like some community work projects like that,
[01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:18.000]  together with people from different groups
[01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000]  and denominations.
[01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000]  They don't have denominations,
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:25.000]  but institutions, outside institutions.
[01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000]  And if we work together,
[01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000]  through living together,
[01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000]  we come to appreciate what they have
[01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000]  and what I don't have, okay?
[01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:37.000]  And then by communing together,
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:40.000]  I think this is a way for us to soften our divide.
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:43.000]  And then I have to acknowledge
[01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000]  that the divide is always there.
[01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:48.000]  I mean, I have no way to sort of...
[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000]  You can't pretend.
[01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000]  Yeah, I can't.
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:55.000]  I can't dissolve that, okay?
[01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:58.000]  But I can, to a certain extent,
[01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:02.000]  hold one another's arms
[01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:05.000]  and then we say that we can work together.
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000]  And I always tell my friends
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:10.000]  that our enemies are outside,
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000]  not inside this circle.
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000]  Right. Thank you.
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000]  So even though you mentioned
[01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:19.000]  it's only your small initial thoughts,
[01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:23.000]  it takes a heart which is big
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000]  and that can generate
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000]  a large amount of courage
[01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:30.000]  and also so as to overcome a barrier
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000]  which is as high as a mountain, actually.
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000]  Right. That's the stuff.
[01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:38.000]  We really appreciate that.
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000]  And, well, actually,
[01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:44.000]  this related, but not that political
[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000]  or maybe political,
[01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:49.000]  sexuality has become a political issue as well.
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000]  So one of our faculty members
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000]  raised this question.
[01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:56.000]  Suppose you are talking to
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:59.000]  the conservative white Christians
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:02.000]  who feel threatened by the LGBTQ movement,
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000]  who feel that they are losing
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000]  their once-dominant social influence.
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:11.000]  So how would you encourage them to change?
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:14.000]  Well, I think it's along the very same lines
[01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:15.000]  that we were just discussing.
[01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000]  I think it has to do with beginning,
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:20.000]  first, not with theological assessments,
[01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:25.000]  but with interpersonal relationship building,
[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:29.000]  letting people actually tell you their story.
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:32.000]  Often I find in settings like that,
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000]  this is less and less true, by the way,
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000]  but it has been true,
[01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:37.000]  that people didn't believe
[01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:41.000]  that they knew anyone who was LGBTQIA.
[01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:45.000]  They didn't have any idea
[01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:46.000]  where those people were,
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:47.000]  but they were not in their life.
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:48.000]  Well, it turns out,
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000]  as more and more people
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000]  have been willing to explain
[01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:53.000]  and declare who they are
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:56.000]  and how they approach the world,
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:59.000]  they are discovering that their children,
[01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:00.000]  their grandchildren,
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000]  their neighbors, their friends,
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:07.000]  their colleagues may either be LGBTQ
[01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:12.000]  or they may be related to people who are.
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000]  And when that occurs,
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:17.000]  it's a privilege to actually welcome
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000]  the knowledge of who someone
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000]  actually understands themselves to be.
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:24.000]  So even though I maintain myself
[01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:28.000]  a traditional view of the theological
[01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:31.000]  and moral understandings of human sexuality
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:34.000]  that have been classic in Christianity,
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:39.000]  I don't do so as a wall against LGBT people
[01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:43.000]  or as a battering ram to defeat them.
[01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:44.000]  I want to hear them.
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:45.000]  I want to know them.
[01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000]  I want to love them.
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000]  I want to invite them into communion
[01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:52.000]  with me and with other people.
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000]  I want them to not be isolated.
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:57.000]  I want them to not be self-loathing.
[01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:00.000]  I want them to feel as much welcome
[01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:03.000]  as I can extend to them.
[01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:06.000]  And so I would encourage
[01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000]  such a community, for example,
[01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:11.000]  to think carefully about who they really know
[01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:14.000]  and how they are going to love people.
[01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:17.000]  And I think every pastor has to work out
[01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:20.000]  in their own particular setting
[01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000]  how they're going to help people
[01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:26.000]  do this kind of self-formational work.
[01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000]  But it really has to begin
[01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000]  by the same things we've just talked about,
[01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:31.000]  laying down power,
[01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000]  laying down certainty,
[01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000]  laying down self-righteousness,
[01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000]  not righteousness, but self-righteousness,
[01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:42.000]  laying down a presumption of a theological exam
[01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:43.000]  at the very beginning,
[01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:44.000]  or a moral exam
[01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000]  at the beginning of every relationship,
[01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000]  which is not the way that any of us,
[01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000]  in fact, actually live,
[01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:53.000]  nor would we want to live that way.
[01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000]  So we want to know one another.
[01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000]  We want to love one another.
[01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:58.000]  And there may be differences.
[01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000]  Of course, there are differences
[01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000]  in how we see the world
[01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000]  and relate to one another.
[01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000]  But I want to start with,
[01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000]  as Dr. Chan said,
[01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:11.000]  I want to start with an attitude of humility
[01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:12.000]  and of deference.
[01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000]  I want to listen very, very carefully.
[01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:17.000]  I want to hear their story.
[01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:20.000]  I want to understand and empathize
[01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:24.000]  with the way that their story has unfolded.
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000]  Now, I believe that all of our stories
[01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:29.000]  are held by a larger story that's God's story.
[01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:32.000]  So eventually, in some way,
[01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000]  verbal and nonverbal both,
[01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:39.000]  I want to help people who are LGBTQ2,
[01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:42.000]  if they don't already,
[01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000]  understand how to hold their story
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:47.000]  in light of the greater story of God.
[01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000]  That's a longer and more theological question.
[01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000]  But on the pastoral level,
[01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000]  I think it has to do with inviting people
[01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000]  into honesty,
[01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000]  into their own vulnerability,
[01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:00.000]  into their places of pain and shame
[01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000]  and say, can you imagine
[01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:05.000]  what it's like to live in a community
[01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000]  in which those realities
[01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000]  are reinforced by the church.
[01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000]  People feel worse about themselves.
[01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:14.000]  People feel more marginalized about themselves
[01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:18.000]  by the way the church has related to LGBT people.
[01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000]  And frequently, the church has been
[01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000]  a failure in loving people
[01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:25.000]  who don't live up to what we believe
[01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:28.000]  are biblical standards, perhaps.
[01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:31.000]  I'm deeply struck by your comment
[01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000]  that it is a matter about
[01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000]  loving and respecting your neighbors
[01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:38.000]  as creating the image of God.
[01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:41.000]  It's not about warring or battling
[01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:45.000]  for theological or ideological correctness.
[01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000]  So this is a very important thing
[01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000]  to remember, actually.
[01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:52.000]  And maybe another question,
[01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:53.000]  or perhaps that will be
[01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000]  the one last question.
[01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000]  Dr.Levitin, you talked about
[01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000]  the influence from the media
[01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000]  in the 1990s.
[01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000]  So could you comment on the impacts
[01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:07.000]  on the social media in white evangelicals?
[01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:10.000]  Yes. Well, it's of course a problem,
[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:11.000]  as I would say it,
[01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000]  at least all around the world,
[01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:14.000]  or at least in places
[01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:17.000]  where social media dominance
[01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:18.000]  controls things,
[01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000]  as social media does dominate things
[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000]  in the United States.
[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000]  So you have public media
[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:25.000]  of various kinds,
[01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000]  but then you have just the social media
[01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:28.000]  and all the networks
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000]  and communication of messages
[01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:33.000]  which can be used as battering rams.
[01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:34.000]  And this is why
[01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000]  it has been such a big deal
[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000]  in the last few days
[01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:41.000]  since Twitter no longer allowed
[01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:44.000]  President Trump to be able to
[01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:47.000]  post his declarations of various kinds,
[01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:50.000]  as you've probably
[01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000]  or pleasantly experienced
[01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000]  or seen or heard about.
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:57.000]  And he has a following on Twitter
[01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:00.000]  of something like 84 million people.
[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:06.000]  So he would typically tweet
[01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:09.000]  usually several dozen messages
[01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:10.000]  over the course of a day
[01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:13.000]  to 84 million people.
[01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:14.000]  So let's just imagine
[01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000]  he was the only person
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000]  that was engaging in social media.
[01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000]  And he would be the only person
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:21.000]  who would be able to
[01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000]  be able to communicate with people.
[01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000]  And he would be the only person
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:26.000]  who would be able to
[01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000]  be able to communicate with people.
[01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:29.000]  And he would be the only person
[01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:30.000]  who would be able to
[01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000]  be able to communicate with people.
[01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:33.000]  And he would be the only person
[01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:34.000]  who would be able to
[01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000]  be able to communicate with people.
[01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:37.000]  And he would be the only person
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:38.000]  who would be able to
[01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000]  be able to communicate with people.
[01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:41.000]  And he would be the only person
[01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:42.000]  who would be able to
[01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000]  be able to communicate with people.
[01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:45.000]  And he would be the only person
[01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:46.000]  who would be able to
[01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:47.000]  be able to communicate with people.
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:48.000]  And he would be the only person
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:49.000]  who would be able to
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:50.000]  be able to communicate with people.
[01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:51.000]  And he would be the only person
[01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:52.000]  who would be able to
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:53.000]  be able to communicate with people.
[01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:54.000]  And he would be the only person
[01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:55.000]  who would be able to
[01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:56.000]  be able to communicate with people.
[01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:57.000]  And he would be the only person
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:58.000]  who would be able to
[01:55:58.000 --> 01:55:59.000]  be able to communicate with people.
[01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:00.000]  And he would be the only person
[01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:01.000]  who would be able to
[01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:02.000]  be able to communicate with people.
[01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:03.000]  And he would be the only person
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:04.000]  who would be able to
[01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:05.000]  be able to communicate with people.
[01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:06.000]  And he would be the only person
