[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920]   (soft piano music)
[00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:21.080]   - Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.600]   Christian brothers and sisters,
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.040]   warmest greetings in our Lord Jesus Christ to you,
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.120]   no matter where you are now geographically located.
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.080]   Welcome to join us
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.240]   at our China Graduate School of Theology,
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.400]   Josephine So Culture and Ethics Lecture Week.
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.480]   My name is Simon Cheung, your host this morning.
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.240]   Let me first say a few words about this lecture series.
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.080]   Instituted in 1985,
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.160]   this biannual lecture series
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.120]   is for commemorating Josephine So,
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.000]   the pioneering Christian thinker and leader here in Hong Kong
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.640]   after her untimely death in 1982.
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.300]   In the past, this lecture series has covered
[00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.520]   a broad swath of topics,
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.600]   ranging from a contemporary reading
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.860]   of Augustine's "The City of God"
[00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.900]   to pressing cultural and ethical issues
[00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.920]   concerning creation care, marketplace theology,
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.400]   or contextualizing Christian faith
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.820]   in the current Chinese context.
[00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.960]   This year, our lecture series is set to take a look,
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.640]   and I may add, a scrutinizing and critical look
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.780]   into the American white evangelicalism
[00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.280]   and the crisis it faces today.
[00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.460]   And our distinguished speaker is Reverend Dr. Mark Levitin,
[00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.960]   the president of Fuller Theological Seminary in the US.
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.680]   Dr. Levitin, it's great to have you here virtually with us.
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.840]   Would you like to say hi to our audience here?
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.400]   - Thank you so much for this invitation.
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.660]   - Thank you, Dr. Levitin.
[00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.880]   And before we hear your first lecture today,
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.240]   may I first say a few words to introduce you
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.880]   to our general audience?
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.700]   Dr. Levitin is a prolific writer,
[00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.360]   and his work appears in various kinds of platforms,
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.080]   with the Lord Jesus Christ as a center of passion,
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.080]   as Dr. Levitin once expressed in an interview.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.600]   His work is aimed to wake people up
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.400]   as to what kind of life and practice
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.680]   they are called into by their Savior and by the Lord.
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.640]   Just by reading the evocative titles of his books
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.080]   like "The Dangerous Act of Worship"
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.740]   and "The Dangerous Act of Loving Your Neighbor,"
[00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.880]   his readers will immediately get the feel
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.320]   that the complacent and insipid understanding
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.320]   of our faith falls far short of the true calling
[00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.480]   to be the followers of Jesus.
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.300]   Out of a deep conviction in the practice of genuine dialogue,
[00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:30.100]   Dr. Levitin has been hosting as the president of FOLA,
[00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.020]   a forum called Conversing,
[00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.180]   in which he will speak with a wide spectrum of leaders,
[00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.340]   I quote, "on issues at the intersection
[00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.500]   of theology and culture," end quote.
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.840]   This dialogue is meant, I quote again,
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.680]   "to evoke both the power of conversation
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.900]   and the turbulence of our times," end quote.
[00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.640]   So one of his latest additions features his interview
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.640]   with a Christian writer and activist
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.000]   who champions racial justice
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.040]   and seeks to expose the Christian,
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.560]   especially white Christians' complicity
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.180]   in racism in the US.
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.120]   Today, Dr. Levitin will begin his reflection
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.540]   of the issue at hand with the title,
[00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.540]   "The Start, the Complicity, the Tsunami, and Today,
[00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.980]   the Birth, Original Scene, Development, Growth,
[00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.300]   Consumption, and Betrayal
[00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.700]   of American White Evangelicalism."
[00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.100]   Without further ado, let's welcome Dr. Levitin.
[00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.180]   - Thank you very, very much.
[00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.240]   It's a great joy and privilege to be here.
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:58.300]   Presently distinguished faculty, students, and guests,
[00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.540]   it's a great honor for me to be participating
[00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.780]   in these lectures in 2021.
[00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.440]   We had, of course, all hoped that the lectures
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.980]   would be delivered in person,
[00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.540]   but 2020 and the COVID pandemic
[00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.580]   regrettably made that impossible.
[00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:21.260]   I hope that the Canadian philosopher, Marshall McLuhan,
[00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.780]   is wrong, that this medium will not be the message,
[00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.460]   and that you will remember far more
[00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:29.900]   about what I'm trying to say
[00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.580]   than the medium by which I will be saying it.
[00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.560]   I bring all of you very warm greetings
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.700]   from Fuller Theological Seminary,
[00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.700]   especially from our board of trustees and faculty,
[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.860]   and pray for you, for the church,
[00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.440]   and for the world of which we are a part
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.100]   and for which we serve as we do.
[00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:59.620]   Before formally starting, let's let first things be first.
[00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:05.340]   In Romans 8, the Apostle Paul traces
[00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:10.340]   the pervasive, unfinished, and agonizing groans of God,
[00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.820]   the church, and creation itself.
[00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:17.020]   In these lectures, there will be cause for joy,
[00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:21.240]   but there will also be evidences of groaning,
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.380]   reasons for arguing, causes for crying,
[00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.180]   repenting, and lamenting.
[00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:32.500]   Yet in the face of all that is wrong and incomplete,
[00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:36.160]   let us first hear the Apostle Paul's words
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.420]   toward the end of that well-known chapter.
[00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:45.180]   He writes, "What then are we to say to these things?
[00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:49.220]   "If God is for us, who can be against us?
[00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.020]   "He who did not spare his own son,
[00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.180]   "but gave him up for us all,
[00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.560]   "how will he not also with him
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.980]   "graciously give us all things?
[00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:03.280]   "In all these things, we are more than conquerors
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.800]   "through him who loved us.
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.980]   "For I am sure that neither death, nor life,
[00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:12.780]   "nor angels, nor rulers,
[00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.560]   "nor things present, nor things to come,
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:20.080]   "nor power, nor height, nor depth,
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.040]   "nor anything else in all creation
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.400]   "will be able to separate us
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.380]   "from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord."
[00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.260]   I offer these lectures as those with hope,
[00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.500]   a hope that is gratefully far beyond ourselves
[00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.220]   for these days.
[00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.740]   In the name of the Father, and the Son,
[00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:40.860]   and the Holy Spirit, amen.
[00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:43.420]   Shall we pray together?
[00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:48.300]   Oh God, how thankful we are for the privilege and gift
[00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:49.980]   of gathering in this way.
[00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:55.380]   We are in places throughout parts of Asia,
[00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:57.860]   and perhaps around the world,
[00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:00.420]   aware of your presence and faithfulness,
[00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:04.540]   which is our only hope, the only hope of the church,
[00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:06.980]   and the only and final hope of the world.
[00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:10.500]   May our days together this week
[00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:14.060]   be ones that you will bless,
[00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:16.940]   that our conversation and my reflections
[00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:19.900]   will combine in useful ways,
[00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.500]   that our understanding of your will
[00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.260]   and the future of our nation
[00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.500]   and the future to which you call us
[00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:30.200]   will be clearer and that our faithfulness will grow.
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:36.340]   We ask it to your glory in the name of Jesus, amen.
[00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:44.060]   To speak about the crisis of American white evangelicalism
[00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:48.100]   is to speak about a crisis within just part
[00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:51.300]   of the body of Christ and its mission in the world.
[00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:56.020]   As I hope and know you will see,
[00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:58.940]   I have no difficulty trying to honestly describe
[00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:02.100]   my understanding of the situation,
[00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:05.500]   but in doing so, I want to remind myself and you
[00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:08.180]   that I am after all talking about part
[00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:10.660]   of our Lord's beloved bride.
[00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:16.500]   The journey of God with God's people from Abraham to today
[00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:20.300]   has been endlessly fraught with crises,
[00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:24.060]   and still our ever loving and persisting good shepherd
[00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:25.820]   does not let us go.
[00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:29.780]   I believe in the legitimacy and in fact,
[00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:33.220]   the necessity of self critique,
[00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:36.980]   while conscious that that can easily and glibly fall prey
[00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.180]   to its own arrogance and presumption.
[00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:44.420]   So I want genuinely to repent even in advance
[00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:47.100]   and commit to you that I will try to be both candid
[00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:50.340]   and loving, honest and fair.
[00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:55.020]   The topic is large enough and complex enough
[00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:58.620]   to necessarily state that I'm not addressing
[00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:01.460]   all dimensions of evangelicalism of course,
[00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:03.460]   and certainly not addressing the related
[00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:06.580]   but very different realities of global evangelicalism.
[00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:10.340]   Nor would I pretend to adequately trace therefore
[00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:14.540]   the impact and importance of American white evangelicalism
[00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:17.460]   on the China Graduate School of Theology
[00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:19.860]   or the Chinese church.
[00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:23.140]   Instead, I will offer you my thoughts
[00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:25.100]   about American white evangelicalism
[00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:28.860]   and ask during our question and answer sessions
[00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:32.180]   for your partnership as brothers and sisters in Christ,
[00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.580]   with whom the scriptures call us to both rejoice
[00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:37.740]   with those who rejoice and weep with those who weep.
[00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:43.700]   Your reflections, critiques and perhaps even weeping
[00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:45.420]   are truly valuable to me.
[00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.260]   And I look forward to hearing your voices
[00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.020]   and perspectives as well.
[00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:52.660]   We are in one communion in Christ.
[00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:56.940]   Presently encouraged me to deliver lectures
[00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.780]   in a way that would include my own personal experience
[00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:02.980]   and not only to offer them through the lens
[00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:07.420]   of a merely academic set of categories or ideas.
[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:11.340]   I was grateful for this and pleased
[00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:13.020]   since it allows me to do in public
[00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:15.740]   what we all know to be true in private,
[00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:18.580]   namely that almost all scholarship
[00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:21.940]   is also narrative or narratival.
[00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:23.820]   That is our commitments and interests
[00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:26.100]   are inevitably oriented by
[00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:28.380]   and reflective of our own stories.
[00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.620]   A few examples.
[00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:34.380]   I point to Dr. Francis Collins,
[00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:36.620]   the director in the United States
[00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:40.540]   of the National Institutes of Health in Washington, DC
[00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:43.220]   and the leader of the Human Genome Project,
[00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:48.220]   which worked out the first complete sequencing of human DNA
[00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:52.740]   forever changing the way human biological science
[00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:57.100]   would proceed and affecting the lives of people everywhere.
[00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:02.060]   It was he who said that the underlying conviction
[00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:05.580]   of God's creative and recreative love
[00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:09.060]   and salvation in Jesus Christ is the daily rock
[00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:11.540]   on which he seeks to do the very best science
[00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:14.260]   and public health that he can provide.
[00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:19.020]   Dr. Collins can distinguish science from faith,
[00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:22.380]   but his commitment to science and to the evangel
[00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:27.260]   are together part and parcel of one life and one project.
[00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:30.220]   Dr. Martin Luther King,
[00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:32.660]   the great American civil rights leader
[00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:35.500]   was not incidentally black.
[00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:38.700]   It was his blackness that informed his experience
[00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:42.140]   and his theology and also motivated his rhetoric
[00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:44.340]   and his analysis of the past and present.
[00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:49.300]   His personal story made him more capable, not less,
[00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:51.020]   of perceiving reality clearly
[00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:53.300]   in his study of American racial history.
[00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:56.780]   His embeddedness in his story
[00:12:56.780 --> 00:13:00.220]   and in the larger black narrative in the United States,
[00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:01.780]   including his demonstrations
[00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:05.260]   in some of the great marches and movements of the '60s
[00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.580]   gave him clearer vision, not less,
[00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:09.900]   that in a multiracial nation,
[00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:13.420]   race is never a neutral factor.
[00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:16.060]   Any claim of neutrality about race in America
[00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:20.020]   is a warning sign that misunderstanding is already at hand.
[00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:27.660]   Jesus was not incidentally a first century Jewish man.
[00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:29.700]   The very character of his divine revelation
[00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:33.420]   and of the love and healing, teaching and sacrifice,
[00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:37.060]   death and resurrection are simultaneously objective
[00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:42.060]   and subjective realities for him and for us.
[00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:45.660]   This is what we affirm about the incarnation,
[00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:48.420]   the universal particularity of God.
[00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:52.300]   Postmodernism has succeeded in driving us
[00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:56.100]   to face the inescapable particularity of life.
[00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:59.020]   In the case of Christian faith,
[00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:03.700]   the particular, however, is the lens by which we can see,
[00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:07.900]   know and encounter the God of the universe.
[00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:09.660]   This is what we hold together.
[00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:16.420]   Just a moment.
[00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:32.300]   Excuse me.
[00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:35.420]   (pages rustling)
[00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:42.300]   All of this is to say that when President Lee
[00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:44.180]   invited me to speak personally
[00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:48.140]   on the subject of American white evangelicalism,
[00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:51.820]   he was allowing me to express in public
[00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:56.820]   what otherwise is privately and inescapably present.
[00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:00.700]   I'm being allowed through his invitation
[00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:05.540]   to pixelate the story with an acknowledgement
[00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:08.980]   of the ways my own experience has ordered the arrangement
[00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:11.940]   and colors and shades of my telling
[00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:13.900]   of the American evangelical story.
[00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:18.340]   On a personal level, I come to you to this topic
[00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:21.100]   first and foremost, simply as a brother in Christ,
[00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:25.620]   seeking as you do to hear and respond
[00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:28.540]   to what the Holy Spirit may want to say to us
[00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:30.020]   in these sessions together.
[00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:33.660]   The primary context out of which I speak
[00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:38.340]   is what we hold in common, our life in Christ.
[00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:41.700]   This defining context of God's loving redemption
[00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:46.700]   holds any and all details about me, my gifts and weaknesses,
[00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:51.740]   my sins and sorrows, my hopes and longings,
[00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:56.700]   my social location, my birth and my new social location
[00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:58.940]   as part of God's one new humanity.
[00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:02.660]   The same of course is true for you.
[00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:06.060]   We find our life's principal location together
[00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:11.060]   in this one new communion, made possible and active
[00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:14.340]   as we are held in the love of the Father, Son and Spirit.
[00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:18.940]   In this common life, we also bring
[00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:21.540]   our distinct similarities and differences.
[00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:25.420]   I am a tall, white, educated American
[00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:28.820]   born and raised on the West Coast of the United States.
[00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:30.740]   And I am 67 years old.
[00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:34.420]   I've been married for nearly 37 years.
[00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:37.940]   And my wife and I have two adult sons.
[00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:41.980]   My family of origin had a low or moderate income
[00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:44.780]   and lived in an agricultural community
[00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:48.540]   adjacent to a nearby Native American community
[00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:52.540]   and in a place known as the Yakama Nation,
[00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:55.700]   a designation of a Native American tribe,
[00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:57.220]   namely the Yakama Nation.
[00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:01.140]   And in a community served by itinerant farm workers
[00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:04.140]   who traveled each season to labor
[00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:06.220]   in the agricultural harvest around us.
[00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:12.140]   My life as a white American was not their life.
[00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:15.420]   We lived in proximate, parallel,
[00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:17.220]   but utterly different worlds.
[00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:20.540]   I grew up in a tight knit family
[00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:24.180]   in which my father saw religion and religious devotion
[00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:26.460]   as one of the most dangerous influences
[00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:29.300]   in the world, one that he wanted his two sons
[00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:31.740]   to avoid if at all possible.
[00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:36.740]   So my Christian journey began as I started college
[00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:40.060]   where I became a Christian through reading the gospels.
[00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:43.980]   I simply had an intellectual and social curiosity
[00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:47.140]   about the Bible and felt that since I was on the road
[00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:50.380]   to becoming, I hoped, an educated person,
[00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:52.180]   I should read the Bible.
[00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:54.220]   And I began with the Gospel of Matthew.
[00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:58.100]   My father had committed to do all he could
[00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:00.780]   to keep his two sons from religion
[00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:02.900]   and especially from religious devotion.
[00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:06.020]   His argument from history and experience
[00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:07.900]   was that religious people,
[00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:10.980]   particularly Christian people in his assessment,
[00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:12.860]   by the influence of their faith,
[00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:16.300]   take great things, the universe,
[00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:18.660]   the mystery of being human,
[00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:21.380]   and turn them into something that's actually very small.
[00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:24.020]   My father is a Christian.
[00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:27.780]   My father illustrated this through the history of science
[00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:30.660]   and Christianity, but also through social
[00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:32.140]   and political history,
[00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:34.340]   as well as moral philosophy and practice.
[00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:38.620]   To my great shock, what I discovered
[00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:40.220]   in the New Testament was first
[00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:44.540]   that Jesus shared this same concern as my father.
[00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:48.540]   Many of his expressions address that very concern.
[00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:52.380]   And yet Jesus' antidote to small-making
[00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:55.620]   is what he announced and displayed
[00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:57.700]   to be the kingdom of God,
[00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:03.620]   the reality that cracks the whole universe wide open.
[00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:07.700]   This was the gift that I was being offered
[00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:09.580]   through the New Testament,
[00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:11.180]   the gift that shocked me
[00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:14.380]   and ultimately has come to change my whole life.
[00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:17.980]   My life as a disciple to this day
[00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:21.260]   has been constantly shaped by the dialogue
[00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:24.780]   between my father's anxiety about Christian faith,
[00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:27.580]   which I believe was accurate and fair,
[00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:32.660]   and how it has been constructively shaped now
[00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:34.820]   by the dialogue between that anxiety
[00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:37.660]   and the comprehensive and personal character
[00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:42.660]   of God's loving reign in Jesus Christ by the Holy Spirit
[00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:48.180]   through one new humanity that we call the church
[00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:50.700]   for the sake of the whole created order.
[00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:55.060]   The first Christians I came to know were and are
[00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:58.660]   some of the most positive spiritual influences in my life.
[00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:02.700]   They referred to themselves as evangelical
[00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:07.740]   and the rest is, well, history.
[00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:11.100]   I stepped into a biblical story I had not known
[00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:15.420]   and into a community that became home to me.
[00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:19.660]   My spiritual life and journey has been full of God
[00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:23.220]   and full of a ministry of resisting smallness.
[00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:28.620]   Let's go back to the beginning
[00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:30.820]   and all of these sections of this lecture
[00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:33.540]   will be very, very introductory.
[00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:36.260]   And I apologize if they seem repetitive
[00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:37.780]   to what you may already know.
[00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:42.020]   By the 17th and 18th centuries,
[00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:45.020]   the so-called birth of America was already by that time
[00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:46.980]   long since underway.
[00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:50.380]   Only in the last quarter of the 18th century
[00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:54.180]   would it become a formally united project.
[00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:56.740]   But for two centuries before that,
[00:20:56.740 --> 00:21:01.020]   Europeans and European colonies had established
[00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:02.940]   what became the United States.
[00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:07.260]   Evangelicalism was a spiritual
[00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:10.140]   and theological renewal movement.
[00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:11.940]   Some would say one that emerged
[00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:15.340]   from the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century.
[00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:19.380]   Evangelicalism was both a spiritual movement
[00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:22.060]   and a way of conceiving of the Christian life.
[00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:26.340]   It was by no means then a party,
[00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:29.420]   let alone an organization or an institution.
[00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:33.380]   It was instead a fresh experience or movement
[00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:37.940]   of the Holy Spirit that cut across denominational lines,
[00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:41.340]   that spoke out into town squares,
[00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:43.420]   that brought influence,
[00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:48.380]   and uncontrolled by formal Christian structures or histories
[00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:50.820]   while declaring and nurturing people
[00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:54.220]   in what they saw as the first order matters of faith.
[00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:59.500]   By the last quarter of the 17th century,
[00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:05.460]   the 18th century,
[00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:07.260]   when the Declaration of Independence
[00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:09.940]   and the War of Independence occurred,
[00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:14.140]   the colonies were clearly hungry for change,
[00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:17.100]   expansion, freedom, and hope.
[00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:20.140]   This, along with various Christian awakenings in Europe
[00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:24.740]   and in America in the 1730s and the 1740s
[00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:28.340]   by groups such as Anglicans and Methodists,
[00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:30.540]   Reformed and Puritan,
[00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:33.820]   meant that institutional religious teaching and authority
[00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:36.980]   were being modified and challenged in various ways.
[00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:38.660]   Together, it created a readiness
[00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:41.020]   for a kind of spiritual awakening
[00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:42.620]   that was motivated by a readiness
[00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:45.140]   to receive the spiritual identity and life
[00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:48.540]   that could freshly ground them in this new context,
[00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:50.020]   in this new land.
[00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:52.780]   The great awakenings in Europe came to
[00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:55.300]   and triumphed in American soil.
[00:22:55.300 --> 00:23:00.260]   In retrospect, a British historian, David Bebbington,
[00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:02.580]   in his defining work in 1989,
[00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:05.620]   entitled "Evangelicalism in Modern Britain,
[00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:09.980]   "A History of the 1730s to the 1980s,"
[00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:12.020]   set forth that evangelicalism
[00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:15.300]   was centered on a quadrilateral set of traits,
[00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:18.220]   that it was Bible-centered,
[00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:20.980]   that it was cross-centered,
[00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:23.820]   that it was conversion-expecting,
[00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:26.940]   and that it was activist-oriented.
[00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:33.260]   This movement unfolded with undulations
[00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:35.220]   that responded to external changes,
[00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:38.620]   to the presence and practice of slavery, for example,
[00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:41.780]   to the critical study of the scriptures,
[00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:46.780]   to the anxieties spawned during the Enlightenment by science,
[00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:50.260]   to the realities of world wars,
[00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:52.940]   to the impact of pandemics,
[00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:56.620]   to the growing impact of higher education.
[00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:59.180]   It claimed a spiritual, theological,
[00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:02.340]   and experiential legitimacy
[00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:04.900]   more than an intellectual, denominational,
[00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:06.500]   or formal identity.
[00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:08.060]   It was a movement
[00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:11.220]   more than it was an institution or an organization.
[00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:15.500]   And therefore, it was adaptable to the East Coast,
[00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:17.940]   but it was highly flexible enough
[00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:21.140]   as the westward expansion in the United States occurred.
[00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:24.260]   In the 1920s,
[00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:26.900]   the fundamentalist modernist controversy
[00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:29.260]   drew and debated lines
[00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:31.540]   that were the fruit of this long history
[00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:34.540]   that had already been developed over that period of time.
[00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:37.140]   By the middle of the 20th century,
[00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:38.940]   when Fuller Theological Seminary
[00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:41.700]   and many other evangelical organizations
[00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:44.060]   and institutions were founded,
[00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:46.380]   evangelicalism had become a word
[00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:50.780]   that could serve as a pathway between two extremes.
[00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:53.140]   In the case of Fuller Theological Seminary,
[00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:56.140]   it was a way between fundamentalism
[00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:58.820]   and a wooden understanding of the Bible
[00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:01.140]   and its interpretation.
[00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:02.340]   And modernism,
[00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:07.620]   namely, potentially at least an adaptation,
[00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:10.980]   if not an abandonment of orthodoxy at times
[00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:13.380]   for the sake of being quote, "modern."
[00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:18.020]   Evangelicalism, as Fuller saw it,
[00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:21.020]   was an embrace of Christian orthodoxy
[00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:26.020]   that was open to more critical study of the scriptures
[00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:31.260]   and more open to engagement with realities around us
[00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:34.220]   in context and in culture
[00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:36.620]   than was typically true of fundamentalists
[00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:40.780]   or wholeheartedly true of modernists.
[00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:44.540]   So evangelicalism quietly and broadly
[00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:48.420]   remained in this position until the late 1970s,
[00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:51.860]   to which we will comment to the 2000s,
[00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:53.980]   including the last four years
[00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:56.900]   in the national and political life of the United States.
[00:25:56.900 --> 00:26:00.500]   Please note, again, several things.
[00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:04.340]   The lack of institutional or organizational center,
[00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:08.780]   the lack of a defining or controlling role
[00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:13.780]   or set of voices for what was in fact
[00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:18.820]   a diffuse and multiply defined and growing movement.
[00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:23.540]   The claim to knowledge that can and must define
[00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:28.540]   what is true and good was clarified by evangelicalism,
[00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:33.380]   but not with the emphatic certainty of fundamentalism.
[00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:36.380]   It had an orientation towards who is in
[00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:39.220]   and who is out in fundamentalism,
[00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:42.100]   whereas in growing evangelicalism,
[00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:45.420]   it was a sense that it was the center that was primary
[00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:47.060]   and not the boundaries.
[00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:49.940]   We'll return to this as well.
[00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:54.700]   We turn next to the complicity.
[00:26:54.700 --> 00:27:00.180]   Here is complicity in a number of social realities,
[00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:03.380]   which create a major problem for evangelicalism in America.
[00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:08.620]   From the earliest days in North America,
[00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:11.300]   Native American tribes were being displaced
[00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:13.420]   by formal and informal versions
[00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:15.900]   of the so-called doctrine of discovery,
[00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:19.500]   in which lands and peoples could be claimed
[00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:22.260]   under the authority of various European countries.
[00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:26.780]   The majority of this was theologically justified
[00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:29.180]   as part of a sense of the mission of God
[00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:31.620]   that reigned over all.
[00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:35.340]   The presumption was that this was legitimate legally,
[00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:37.460]   that it was morally right,
[00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:39.780]   that it was socially beneficial,
[00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:43.380]   and that it was most importantly, spiritually redemptive
[00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:46.780]   for those whose lives were now held inside
[00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:50.580]   and under Christian and European authority.
[00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:55.020]   The Christian church was manifest in a European defined
[00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:56.860]   and embodied set of terms.
[00:27:56.860 --> 00:28:00.060]   This meant that there were Roman Catholics
[00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:02.180]   and various Protestant churches as well,
[00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:04.060]   Anglican and Puritan in particular,
[00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:07.620]   that were involved in these matters.
[00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:11.780]   The church in America imitated the church in Europe,
[00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:13.700]   while it also opened the way for many
[00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:16.460]   who were defining religious persecution in Europe
[00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:19.820]   to be a motivation for immigrants to the colonies.
[00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:21.900]   Regional plots along the East Coast
[00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:24.180]   tagged with different primary European
[00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:25.660]   and Christian identities.
[00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:28.300]   From this intertwined connection
[00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:32.380]   between the doctrine of discovery and Native Americans,
[00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:36.620]   that is the readiness to dominate Native peoples,
[00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:39.500]   there developed an abominable extension.
[00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:42.500]   An intertwined connection between white Christians
[00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:46.460]   and African slavery was early and well-established
[00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:48.300]   in the United States.
[00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:53.300]   The doctrine of discovery established by the Pope in 1493
[00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:56.700]   created the legal, political and religious claim
[00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:59.940]   of land and people that were not Christian.
[00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:02.820]   This plain and historic doctrine
[00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:06.620]   became the driving theological and missiological force
[00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:10.580]   underpinning colonialism and its mutating motives
[00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:12.700]   and expressions to this very day.
[00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:15.540]   What was fundamentally a political
[00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:19.060]   and economic vision initially was justified
[00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:24.060]   and defended even more passionately as a theological one,
[00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:29.300]   trumping and masking the political and economic benefits.
[00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:33.820]   The doctrine of discovery provided the theological cover
[00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:38.060]   and the unlimited possibilities for economic expansion
[00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:40.260]   that were simply too much to resist.
[00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:44.820]   Colonialist condescension and rationalization
[00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:47.700]   looked away from and denied the horror
[00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:49.980]   of the transatlantic slave trade
[00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:53.420]   and the practice that denigrated and dehumanized
[00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:57.300]   African men, women and children by the millions,
[00:29:57.300 --> 00:30:00.620]   all to satisfy the greed of colonial
[00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:05.260]   and post-colonial families in the name of the gospel.
[00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:08.740]   The unpaid labor of black Africans
[00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:13.100]   was the workforce that built America.
[00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:16.460]   Christians saw the expansion of agricultural
[00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:20.380]   and manufacturing capacity as it was neutrally called
[00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:22.140]   as the blessing of God.
[00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:27.060]   There are reports, as you probably know, in West Africa
[00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:30.060]   where kidnapped Africans were imprisoned
[00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:33.060]   after being taken in horrific conditions,
[00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:35.900]   before rather being taken in horrific conditions
[00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:39.020]   across the Atlantic Ocean, the Middle Passage,
[00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:42.860]   for sale in the Caribbean and in the colonies.
[00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:46.740]   In those ports, Christian worship happened
[00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:48.820]   to ask for God's blessing
[00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:50.620]   in the so-called Middle Passageway.
[00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:54.900]   One such chapel in Ghana, for example,
[00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:57.740]   was built across the bridge,
[00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:02.060]   upon which manacled slaves would later walk
[00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:05.340]   to the place where they would be tied and bound
[00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:07.820]   for the cross-Atlantic trip.
[00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:10.980]   In the chapel, above this gangplank,
[00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:13.620]   taking slaves on board the ship,
[00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:17.100]   would be the captors, the slave masters,
[00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:19.780]   the ship's captains and crew,
[00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:23.380]   singing hymns still familiar today.
[00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:26.900]   They would read the scriptures.
[00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:30.020]   They would pray for safety for all the crew
[00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:31.900]   and for the trip to be successful
[00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:35.700]   in the eventual sale of fellow human beings.
[00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:39.220]   For the servitude that would define them
[00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:41.140]   for the rest of their lives
[00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:44.300]   and the lives of generations and generations
[00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:47.420]   of slaves and slave families to come.
[00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:51.820]   All this being done in the name of Jesus Christ,
[00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:56.100]   as they would say, the Lord and Savior of the world.
[00:31:56.100 --> 00:32:00.740]   Among the perpetrators on both sides of the Atlantic
[00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:04.260]   were American white evangelicals.
[00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:07.700]   The convergence of the psychological
[00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:10.220]   and spiritual readiness of colonials
[00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:11.700]   in relation to this narrative
[00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:16.620]   of America's original sin is hard to trace.
[00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:19.340]   The ability to claim to love God
[00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:22.020]   while so obviously hating their neighbors
[00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:27.420]   was of course not invented in the Atlantic slave trade,
[00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:31.460]   but it was destructively and politically practiced
[00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:33.620]   for over 250 years.
[00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:37.500]   This practice involved the death of 2 million lives
[00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:39.580]   in the Atlantic crossing,
[00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:43.820]   the deaths of millions en route to their plantations
[00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:47.260]   and the sale of 12 to 14 million human lives.
[00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:51.100]   These are the ones who carried out the nation building
[00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:53.900]   that was the growing, emerging, uniting
[00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:57.380]   and Christian reality that became the United States.
[00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:01.220]   In the constitution of the United States,
[00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:06.220]   the phrase, we the people meant white land owning men.
[00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:12.540]   We the people are the people that are referred to
[00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:16.180]   in our constitution, not the slaves.
[00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:20.740]   African slaves were in fact classed by our constitution
[00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:22.500]   as three fifths human.
[00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:26.940]   All this brought the United States to war
[00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:29.100]   in the mid 19th century
[00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:32.540]   and the death of more than 650,000 lives
[00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:34.780]   during that civil war period.
[00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:38.740]   The war divided families and friends
[00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:41.980]   and congregations and denominations
[00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:45.860]   and continues to this very week to define
[00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:48.140]   and explain the American church
[00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:50.820]   and political rallies realities.
[00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:54.100]   The interwovenness for many evangelicals of faith
[00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:56.940]   and slavery now seems like an unbelievable aberration
[00:33:57.820 --> 00:34:01.060]   and yet it reveals the ways that culture
[00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:05.860]   and economics speak more loudly than our theology and faith
[00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:08.700]   and that we are more capable than we might imagine
[00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:13.700]   of wrapping desire with faith and calling it God's gift.
[00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:16.900]   The economic labor engine that built the United States
[00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:21.900]   was unpaid labor, unpaid labor for 250 years of slavery.
[00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:28.340]   It was claimed to be God's blessing for the owner
[00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:32.300]   and God's blessing for the uncivilized slave and family
[00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:34.300]   who because of having been taken captive
[00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:38.900]   and now "employed" as a slave,
[00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:41.060]   giving them the opportunity and privilege
[00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:44.420]   to live in a "Christian nation."
[00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:48.180]   The cruelty and sin that was right in front of them
[00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:49.860]   was apparently invisible.
[00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:56.100]   In other words, many, by no means all, white evangelicals
[00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:59.620]   were seamlessly in the church community
[00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:03.580]   and fully complicit in 250 years of slavery
[00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:07.220]   followed by 100 more years of extended slavery
[00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:09.700]   and depression into the assumptions of culture,
[00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:12.820]   economics, and evangelical faith.
[00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:14.140]   Debates continue to this day
[00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:19.140]   about the cause of the American Civil War from 1861 to '65.
[00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:22.020]   As a central matter, the main point of concern
[00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:23.300]   was however slavery.
[00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:27.980]   In Romans 1, Paul talks about our human capacity
[00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:32.580]   to hold down or to suppress the truth in unrighteousness.
[00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:34.980]   We do this in our own lives
[00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:37.620]   and the culture of Christian churches and congregations
[00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:42.380]   and institutions reflects this in various ways.
[00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:45.300]   But for a very large and focal part
[00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:47.420]   of white evangelical church in America,
[00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:52.420]   this habit became deep, multi-generationally ingrained
[00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:56.380]   and the white evangelical movement has at times challenged
[00:35:56.380 --> 00:36:00.100]   and at some times completely conceded
[00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:03.940]   to this kind of vision.
[00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:07.020]   There were of course in the 18th and 19th century
[00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:09.380]   white evangelical public leaders
[00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:14.380]   who spoke and acted loudly and sustainably against slavery.
[00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:18.020]   But the lowest baseline associated with
[00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:23.020]   and defended in Christian terms was the defense of slavery.
[00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:26.300]   Evangelical complicity with slavery,
[00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:29.180]   with reconstruction following the Civil War,
[00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:33.660]   with imprisoned and indentured labor, with Jim Crow,
[00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:36.700]   with bank control of real estate and money
[00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:39.460]   erupted in periodic riots and protests.
[00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:43.620]   As an example, 100 years ago this very year
[00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:48.620]   in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in the heart of Southern America
[00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:53.180]   and South, Southern American white evangelicalism,
[00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:57.460]   the most thriving black community in the whole country
[00:36:57.460 --> 00:37:01.540]   was decimated and 300 black lives were slaughtered
[00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:05.100]   because a black man was alleged to try
[00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:07.980]   and kiss a white Christian woman.
[00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:10.740]   The most economically thriving black community
[00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:13.380]   was burned to the ground.
[00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:15.580]   Wiping out an entire community
[00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:17.980]   who confessed that Jesus Christ is Lord.
[00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:22.580]   Only this year will this be fully faced,
[00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:25.420]   lamented and recognized.
[00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:28.580]   In different but parallel ways,
[00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:31.860]   this black narrative is not only the Native American story,
[00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:35.780]   but also in the United States, the Latin American story
[00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:39.240]   and the Asian story as well.
[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:42.980]   In all these instances and many others besides,
[00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:47.660]   many in the evangelical church confessing Christ
[00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:51.060]   were also participating supportive or passive
[00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:53.820]   about these abuses, cruelties and injustices.
[00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:58.780]   Being perpetrated by those our Bible calls
[00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:01.180]   are made in the image of God,
[00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:03.380]   knit together in their mother's wounds,
[00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:07.340]   fearfully and wonderfully made.
[00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:11.740]   Complicity is too mild a word.
[00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:14.420]   It showed that many evangelical Christians
[00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:18.380]   had enslaved themselves to the injustice and abuse
[00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:21.580]   of fellow human beings for centuries.
[00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:25.980]   People ask, where was the church in Nazi Germany?
[00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:27.900]   The answer is the same place
[00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:30.620]   that many white evangelical Christians in North America
[00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:35.220]   have been during the past 400 years, right here,
[00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:38.340]   right in the midst of mainstream culture.
[00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:43.700]   This needs to be kept in mind, I might add as a footnote
[00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:45.980]   in understanding the events of the United States
[00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:47.020]   in the last week.
[00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:50.140]   We move next to the tsunami.
[00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:52.500]   The civil rights movement in America
[00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:56.020]   was primarily led by the black church in America.
[00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:59.500]   It has evangelical theology and doctrine,
[00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:01.300]   but did not choose for the most part
[00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:05.020]   to identify as evangelical because they were not white.
[00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:07.300]   And because the white evangelical narrative
[00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:10.660]   excluded black and brown people.
[00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:13.220]   The narrative the black church knew
[00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:16.260]   was the God who knew how to set his people free.
[00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:20.460]   And that narrative led by exceptional black Christian leaders
[00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:22.340]   and pastors was the narrative
[00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:25.260]   to which their civil rights movement was committed.
[00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:27.580]   Enormous and positive changes occurred.
[00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:31.660]   But in symbol and in reality,
[00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:34.820]   the murder of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
[00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:36.860]   slowed and diverted the narrative,
[00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:40.900]   along with the sacrifice of many others as well.
[00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:44.900]   For evangelicals, King was too liberal.
[00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:49.140]   And only very gradually as the black Christian critique
[00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:51.980]   of the white story of America became domesticated enough
[00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:55.020]   to accept Dr. King into some white Christian
[00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:57.940]   evangelical narratives,
[00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:02.380]   but only some and only relatively recently.
[00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:06.660]   By the late 1960s, the election of Jimmy Carter
[00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:08.900]   as a quote, born again, Christian,
[00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:12.500]   evangelicalism began to quickly step into the public light
[00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:14.900]   in a different way than before.
[00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:18.100]   By the 1980s, we have the birth of a movement
[00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:19.220]   called the moral majority
[00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:21.860]   and the rise of various media ministries
[00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:24.660]   that can propagate arguments of faith
[00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:26.900]   in continuous feeds of ideas.
[00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:30.820]   Simultaneously cable television news channels
[00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:34.100]   are developing and growing in passive popularity.
[00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:35.860]   And this development mixes together
[00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:39.460]   in a thick media presence of culture and religion.
[00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:41.060]   It's all presented as real,
[00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:44.140]   but what emerges is closer to reality TV.
[00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:47.420]   That is not so much an expression of Christian faith,
[00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:50.860]   as much as a combination of entertainment and production.
[00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:54.740]   Audience ratings are the most important measure of success.
[00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:59.300]   This becomes a globally spreading reality and infection.
[00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:03.260]   The experience of popular cable religious programs,
[00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:05.900]   most of them fundamentalist and Pentecostal,
[00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:08.500]   hosted by many different TV evangelists,
[00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:11.140]   turned to the political sphere in the '80s
[00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:15.500]   and unleashed a tsunami that flooded the religious airwaves.
[00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:18.820]   This went on for some time during the '80s and early '90s
[00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:21.260]   and increasingly addressed politics,
[00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:24.980]   especially related to abortion and sexuality debates
[00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:29.060]   and claimed an enormous, both American and global audience.
[00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:33.580]   In 1996, Fox News was established by Robert Murdoch,
[00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:37.500]   Rupert Murdoch, and further amplified the voices
[00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:41.220]   of popular fundamentalist, conservative pastors,
[00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:43.940]   TV evangelists, organizations, churches,
[00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:45.700]   and political groups.
[00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:47.660]   Along the way, these became known
[00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:50.260]   as the evangelicals by the media.
[00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:53.780]   It was a title claimed by those that the media amplified
[00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:56.460]   and made more culturally acceptable
[00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:59.940]   than the tag that had been used as fundamentalist
[00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:03.780]   or Pentecostals, who were seen more to be
[00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:05.500]   at the margins of culture,
[00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:09.180]   whereas evangelicals became a more acceptable
[00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:11.220]   mainstream term.
[00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:14.460]   This was the tsunami that took over the term evangelical
[00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:17.140]   in the United States, and it remained so
[00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:20.100]   through the late '90s and certainly
[00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:23.420]   during the first two decades of the 2000s.
[00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:26.020]   This all happened as the growth of megachurches
[00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:29.820]   in the United States also expanded from a few hundred
[00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:32.540]   to thousands of such congregations.
[00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:35.620]   The pervasive lack or minimalization
[00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:39.020]   of theological education in most of these movements
[00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:40.900]   was quite appalling.
[00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:44.500]   It created a large collection of communicators
[00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:49.340]   who were not marked by careful thought or by accountability.
[00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:51.900]   It became a tribe of its own with its own regard
[00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:53.500]   and disregard for boundaries.
[00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:58.620]   Effect, popularity, emotion all dominated
[00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:02.020]   with a popular unselfcritical frame and attitude.
[00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:05.700]   Typically a single personality and voice
[00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:08.460]   dominated the message.
[00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:12.900]   But all this is too simplistic.
[00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:15.220]   Two parallel narratives or realities
[00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:16.540]   also need to be acknowledged.
[00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:20.100]   First, the media prominence of white evangelicalism
[00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:23.900]   was similar, but always distinct from the rise
[00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:26.700]   and growth and development of the black church.
[00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:29.420]   Some, if not all of the same theological markers
[00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:31.500]   describe the rise of the black church,
[00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:33.700]   but the social associations do not,
[00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:35.700]   quite the opposite in fact.
[00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:38.540]   The white evangelical church and the black church
[00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:40.300]   were distinct, separate,
[00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:42.900]   and had very different characteristics.
[00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:45.820]   The most important one might be assumed
[00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:49.060]   to be integration of faith and context of the love of God
[00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:52.100]   and the justice of God in Jesus Christ.
[00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:55.860]   And the suffering of blacks, including black Christians,
[00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:58.020]   who suffered from the brutal racism
[00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:00.500]   and the white supremacy and normativity
[00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:02.860]   that pervaded the American landscape.
[00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:04.660]   More on this in our next lecture.
[00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:07.260]   The second layer that needs to be acknowledged
[00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:10.860]   is a smaller reactive movement of neo-evangelicals
[00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:13.380]   who specifically and stridently rejected
[00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:15.860]   the sociology, policy, and politics
[00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:19.820]   of conservative Republican white American evangelicals.
[00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:22.020]   This cross current is essential
[00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:24.900]   to understand the state of affairs today
[00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:26.980]   in the US evangelical landscape.
[00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:31.380]   The rabid condemning response of conservative evangelicals
[00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:34.540]   to the HIV/AIDS crisis in the 80s and 90s
[00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:36.980]   added another layer of judgmentalism
[00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:39.660]   and cultural division and separation,
[00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:43.020]   all justified by quote, "The good news of the gospel."
[00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:44.180]   Unquote.
[00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:48.060]   The crisis of today has a long development that precedes it.
[00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:50.500]   So finally, today.
[00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:53.420]   Today, American white evangelicalism
[00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:57.980]   is publicly and privately in a shambles and in confusion.
[00:44:57.980 --> 00:45:01.180]   Publicly and broadly,
[00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:04.340]   the identification of evangelicalism with Trumpism
[00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:06.900]   and the loss of the 2020 election
[00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:09.100]   was a resounding repudiation
[00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:10.940]   of American white evangelicalism
[00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:13.140]   by the broad American public.
[00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:18.020]   Not least by African-Americans, but also by many whites.
[00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:20.940]   Many up to this point,
[00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:24.980]   evangelicals were silent or deflective of the racial issues
[00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:27.900]   and associated with the appointment under Trump
[00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:30.100]   of conservative judges at all levels
[00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:33.260]   and the dismantling of various social safeguards.
[00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:37.020]   The aggressive politics and policies of America first.
[00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:40.140]   The anti-immigration and anti-LGBT,
[00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:42.820]   anti-abortion, anti-racial justice,
[00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:44.740]   and anti-science stances
[00:45:44.740 --> 00:45:47.940]   that have all been part of the Trump administration.
[00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:52.820]   And then the post-election unwillingness since November
[00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:57.100]   to acknowledge Biden's defeat of Trump.
[00:45:57.100 --> 00:46:00.100]   Over 73 million Americans who voted for Trump
[00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:01.900]   in this last election
[00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:06.900]   included still 80% white evangelical voters.
[00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:12.500]   The summer of 2020, before the election,
[00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:14.420]   will go down as one of the most prominent
[00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:17.660]   and provocative seasons of racial demonstrations
[00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:19.820]   in the United States to date.
[00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:22.260]   Triggered most directly by the murder
[00:46:22.260 --> 00:46:26.620]   and a string of murders of unarmed African-Americans,
[00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:30.060]   and especially the killing of George Floyd
[00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:31.820]   by white policemen.
[00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:35.300]   Somewhere between 15 and 25 million people
[00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:38.500]   were active in demonstrations over this past summer
[00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:41.100]   in cities and towns across the country.
[00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:44.660]   People of all races and ages and political affiliations.
[00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:47.060]   Virtually nothing was said or done
[00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:49.340]   by many that the press turned to
[00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:51.980]   and called evangelical leaders.
[00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:54.460]   The height of offense to evangelicals
[00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:55.420]   should have been taken
[00:46:55.420 --> 00:46:58.460]   when Trump aggressively dismissed protesters
[00:46:58.460 --> 00:47:00.620]   for a photo opportunity in front of a church
[00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:02.220]   in Washington, DC,
[00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:06.340]   in order to hold up there an upside down Bible.
[00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:09.060]   But instead, Trump's actions were heralded
[00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:11.900]   by prominent white evangelical voices.
[00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:15.140]   The political and public rejection of science
[00:47:15.140 --> 00:47:17.860]   in response to the coronavirus pandemic
[00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:21.260]   added a third layer to the problems of this moment.
[00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:23.580]   More fuel yet to the fire
[00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:25.420]   that put the voices of political
[00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:28.220]   and evangelical forces on the side of being,
[00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:30.060]   frankly, reality denying.
[00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:33.740]   Denial of racism and white supremacy,
[00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:37.500]   denial of the coronavirus and trust in science,
[00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:40.340]   denial of the election and its outcome,
[00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:44.780]   all has many evangelical supporters in common.
[00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:47.380]   Typically, when these denials are offered
[00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:49.620]   as an expression of Christian faith,
[00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:52.100]   then it appears to the wider American culture
[00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:55.980]   and to many Christians and non-Christians
[00:47:55.980 --> 00:47:58.100]   inside the United States,
[00:47:58.100 --> 00:47:59.820]   that it appears that evangelicalism
[00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:03.540]   has less and less to do with ordinary reality,
[00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:06.460]   the reality that everyone else lives full time.
[00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:09.620]   The tradition that has elevated the possibilities
[00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:13.620]   of spiritual and theological knowing in Jesus Christ
[00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:17.860]   appears to have abandoned the possibility of knowledge.
[00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:21.820]   This historic theological and cultural stew
[00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:24.540]   is the crisis of American white evangelicalism.
[00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:27.740]   For me personally, it is a crushing,
[00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:30.460]   maddening and tragic story,
[00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:34.180]   but far more importantly, and I hope that I am wrong,
[00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:36.300]   this highly public narrative
[00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:40.780]   holds every sign of driving a multi-generational,
[00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:44.300]   decimating disaffection with many people,
[00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:47.500]   not least many young adults in the United States.
[00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:50.420]   For if this, this that has been demonstrated
[00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:53.340]   in the last four years and in the last months
[00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:54.820]   and in the last weeks,
[00:48:54.820 --> 00:48:58.940]   if this is the fruit of white American evangelicalism,
[00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:00.940]   how could it ever be claimed
[00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:04.180]   that its gospel could be received as good news?
[00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:08.460]   So in light of all of that, what is the hope?
[00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:13.300]   Jesus said, "I am the way, the truth and the light."
[00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:17.900]   This is the word that defines and holds all other words.
[00:49:17.900 --> 00:49:20.460]   This is the plum line, the true vine,
[00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:21.980]   the rock that is our origin,
[00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:23.820]   our redeemer and our sustainer.
[00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:27.660]   "Behold, all things are being made new,"
[00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:31.340]   the apostle says, even white evangelicalism
[00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:33.700]   that promotes that hope for others,
[00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:35.940]   that hope for others when it is a time
[00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:38.980]   when we who are white evangelicals in America
[00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:41.020]   need it more than ever.
[00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:42.580]   On many levels,
[00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:45.580]   the white American evangelical population
[00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:49.220]   does not want to live out its theological identity
[00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:51.860]   as much as it wants to justify its social
[00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:53.740]   and racial identity.
[00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:55.740]   And more on this in the next lecture.
[00:49:55.740 --> 00:50:00.220]   There's no joy in sharing what I have said in this lecture.
[00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:02.500]   Story could be told in the positive light
[00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:05.100]   of God's true and faithful bounty.
[00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:07.500]   In truth, it is a both and story.
[00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:11.380]   God is faithful to white American evangelical church.
[00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:13.700]   The white American evangelical church
[00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:17.140]   is a deep and painful crisis.
[00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:20.020]   In this lecture, I've tried to show the scope of the problem.
[00:50:20.020 --> 00:50:23.660]   Tomorrow, I will turn to some of the more underlying reasons.
[00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:30.580]   Let me stop there and see if there's comment or questions
[00:50:30.580 --> 00:50:32.500]   as we engage together.
[00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:35.100]   - Thank you, Dr. Labbaton
[00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:40.740]   for walking us through the past three centuries,
[00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:44.860]   giving us a quick but succinct historical survey
[00:50:44.860 --> 00:50:48.820]   of how the present evangelical crisis came to be.
[00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:53.980]   So in what follows, two members of our faculty
[00:50:53.980 --> 00:50:58.220]   will give their response to Dr. Labbaton's speech.
[00:50:58.220 --> 00:51:00.180]   Before introducing them,
[00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:02.180]   I'd like to remind the audience
[00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:04.900]   that a question and answer session
[00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:09.220]   will immediately follow the responses.
[00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:13.180]   All the questions can be posted on our website
[00:51:13.180 --> 00:51:15.580]   in the live streaming page.
[00:51:15.580 --> 00:51:17.700]   And you may scroll down the webpage.
[00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:20.180]   After the live streaming in Mandarin,
[00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:22.540]   there is a Q&A session,
[00:51:22.540 --> 00:51:27.340]   and you're most welcome and strongly encouraged
[00:51:27.340 --> 00:51:31.220]   to input your questions there after inputting your name.
[00:51:32.540 --> 00:51:35.660]   Your questions or comments can be either
[00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:37.700]   in Chinese or English.
[00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:43.980]   Now, our two responses, our two response speakers today,
[00:51:43.980 --> 00:51:47.700]   they are Dr. Chen Wing-Yen,
[00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:51.580]   our visiting professor in practical studies,
[00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:55.220]   and Reverend Dr. Song Jun,
[00:51:55.220 --> 00:51:58.180]   our Philip Teng Associate Professor
[00:51:58.180 --> 00:52:00.860]   in theological studies.
[00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:02.940]   Their responses will be given
[00:52:02.940 --> 00:52:06.700]   in English and Putonghua, respectively.
[00:52:06.700 --> 00:52:09.580]   Let's welcome them with our applause.
[00:52:09.580 --> 00:52:22.940]   - Thank you, Dr. Labbaton,
[00:52:22.940 --> 00:52:24.500]   for your wonderful lecture,
[00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:27.660]   and I feel so honored to give my personal response here.
[00:52:28.900 --> 00:52:31.460]   I was drawn to the Fuller School of Theology
[00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:34.660]   long before I entered the CGST.
[00:52:34.660 --> 00:52:39.460]   I think most of the Hong Kong churches know Fuller
[00:52:39.460 --> 00:52:41.860]   not only as a seminary and a training ground
[00:52:41.860 --> 00:52:44.860]   for counselors and theologians,
[00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:49.140]   but also as the school for training intercultural workers
[00:52:49.140 --> 00:52:50.980]   and teachers in mission.
[00:52:50.980 --> 00:52:56.460]   The two CGST mission faculty members prior to me
[00:52:56.460 --> 00:52:59.700]   both got their DEMITS degrees
[00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:02.940]   from Fuller's School of World Mission,
[00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:04.620]   which has now changed her name
[00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:08.460]   to the Fuller School of Intercultural Studies.
[00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:13.180]   To me, Fuller's intercultural studies
[00:53:13.180 --> 00:53:16.100]   excel on issues like gospel and culture,
[00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:18.300]   intercultural communication,
[00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:22.020]   cultural anthropology, and so on and so forth.
[00:53:22.020 --> 00:53:24.100]   And we have all benefited
[00:53:24.100 --> 00:53:26.500]   from the easy-to-grasp concepts
[00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:29.180]   like 10/40 window,
[00:53:29.180 --> 00:53:31.740]   unreached people groups,
[00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:34.860]   people movement in church growth, et cetera,
[00:53:34.860 --> 00:53:37.300]   developed by the Fuller faculty.
[00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:40.420]   We are also on the receiving end
[00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:42.860]   from a lot of American missionaries
[00:53:42.860 --> 00:53:44.860]   coming to this part of the world.
[00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:48.460]   Personally, I had great friends
[00:53:48.460 --> 00:53:51.860]   among the American Southern Baptist missionaries
[00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:54.940]   when my family was in Sri Lanka three decades ago.
[00:53:54.940 --> 00:53:59.540]   I had very mixed feeling experience with them
[00:53:59.540 --> 00:54:02.500]   who worked closely with me in that country.
[00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:05.180]   We were great friends,
[00:54:05.180 --> 00:54:10.180]   so much so that we had asked an elderly couple
[00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:13.820]   to be the godparents of our infant son.
[00:54:13.820 --> 00:54:19.780]   But at the same time, we avoided too close a connection
[00:54:19.780 --> 00:54:23.420]   because of the way they carry themselves.
[00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:27.460]   Coming in with obvious financial power and human resources,
[00:54:27.460 --> 00:54:31.980]   locals commented that they lived like kings.
[00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:37.220]   Another difficulty between us was our differences
[00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:39.900]   in seeing the meaning of the gospel
[00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:42.260]   in a world war-torn land.
[00:54:42.260 --> 00:54:46.100]   To our American colleagues,
[00:54:46.100 --> 00:54:49.420]   their job was to get the message of the gospel across
[00:54:49.420 --> 00:54:52.780]   without ever touching on the problems
[00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:57.780]   of inequity and injustice that were rampant in the country.
[00:54:57.780 --> 00:55:03.060]   A lot of their mission theories and conceptual framework
[00:55:03.060 --> 00:55:06.380]   were generated from social sciences,
[00:55:06.380 --> 00:55:07.820]   which were excellent tools
[00:55:07.820 --> 00:55:10.660]   for reaching people outside the church.
[00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:15.380]   But unfortunately, such techniques did not touch
[00:55:15.380 --> 00:55:19.340]   on the socioeconomic political aspects of the gospel.
[00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:24.100]   And the good news of God's mercy and justice
[00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:26.780]   to a broken world has been missed out.
[00:55:26.780 --> 00:55:32.820]   What is the gospel to a world plagued by systemic oppression
[00:55:32.820 --> 00:55:36.860]   against the minority and the disadvantaged,
[00:55:36.860 --> 00:55:41.260]   especially when privileged middle-class Christians
[00:55:41.260 --> 00:55:45.660]   were being implicated as part of the unjust process?
[00:55:47.940 --> 00:55:52.100]   After reading Dr. Levitin's lecture script,
[00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:55.820]   I could suddenly solve the puzzle I have
[00:55:55.820 --> 00:55:59.140]   regarding the focal areas of American missiology.
[00:55:59.140 --> 00:56:04.980]   Now I understand why the packaged Kairos Mission Course
[00:56:04.980 --> 00:56:06.700]   did not mention the special needs
[00:56:06.700 --> 00:56:09.340]   of the poor and the marginalized,
[00:56:09.340 --> 00:56:13.780]   and why in another classic package called Perspectives,
[00:56:13.780 --> 00:56:18.780]   out of 169 articles, only six, that is 3.5%,
[00:56:18.780 --> 00:56:25.100]   directly talk about the issues of poverty and social ills.
[00:56:25.100 --> 00:56:29.900]   Now I understand why there's no mentioning of liberation,
[00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:34.660]   of ethnic equality, and of suffering and persecution,
[00:56:34.660 --> 00:56:36.980]   because the majority of authors belong
[00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:39.740]   to a majority of white evangelicals
[00:56:39.740 --> 00:56:42.780]   that have actually turned a blind eye on these issues
[00:56:42.780 --> 00:56:44.180]   on their own doorsteps.
[00:56:44.180 --> 00:56:48.500]   Then the problem is getting serious
[00:56:48.500 --> 00:56:52.660]   because we have imported the whole paradigm
[00:56:52.660 --> 00:56:56.620]   and repeated the same patterns of missionary engagement
[00:56:56.620 --> 00:56:59.780]   in our Hong Kong and Mainland churches.
[00:56:59.780 --> 00:57:06.340]   These days, we talk a lot about the Silk Road initiatives
[00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:08.300]   that have enabled Chinese missionaries
[00:57:08.300 --> 00:57:12.220]   to venture far beyond the country border,
[00:57:12.220 --> 00:57:14.060]   going to countries that badly need
[00:57:14.060 --> 00:57:16.580]   Chinese input in their businesses.
[00:57:16.580 --> 00:57:22.580]   But in all these Asian and African countries,
[00:57:22.580 --> 00:57:26.580]   do we have to ask if our political supremacy
[00:57:26.580 --> 00:57:29.780]   and economic advantage reflect a God
[00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:33.300]   that care for sins generated from power imbalance?
[00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:37.580]   How much are we implicated
[00:57:37.580 --> 00:57:41.220]   in some of the irregular Chinese trading methods
[00:57:41.220 --> 00:57:44.820]   and exploitation of people and the land?
[00:57:44.820 --> 00:57:48.500]   The way we carry our presence speaks volumes
[00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:51.380]   about the gospel we preach.
[00:57:51.380 --> 00:57:53.980]   The contemporary Chinese mission movements
[00:57:53.980 --> 00:57:58.820]   like Back to Jerusalem, the Homecoming Chinese Gathering,
[00:57:58.820 --> 00:58:01.980]   or Mission China 2030,
[00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:05.260]   have gathered momentum in recent years
[00:58:05.260 --> 00:58:09.180]   to mobilize Chinese Christians to serve the global church,
[00:58:09.180 --> 00:58:10.940]   which is very good indeed.
[00:58:11.340 --> 00:58:15.340]   However, despite all their good intentions,
[00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:19.660]   they all carry certain air of conquest and entitlement,
[00:58:19.660 --> 00:58:23.620]   painting the Chinese church as the country
[00:58:23.620 --> 00:58:26.540]   used by God at the end to finish the task
[00:58:26.540 --> 00:58:29.260]   to preach the gospel to the ends of the earth.
[00:58:29.260 --> 00:58:33.820]   Such stance does energize and motivate people
[00:58:33.820 --> 00:58:35.460]   in positive ways,
[00:58:35.460 --> 00:58:39.420]   but are we going out as conquerors and saviors
[00:58:39.420 --> 00:58:42.900]   or as fellow sinners needing redemption?
[00:58:42.900 --> 00:58:48.540]   Do we dare to mention that we are also being sinned against
[00:58:48.540 --> 00:58:49.700]   by the social system?
[00:58:49.700 --> 00:58:55.780]   The same holds true within the Chinese soil
[00:58:55.780 --> 00:58:59.020]   when a sizable group of Chinese Han Christians
[00:58:59.020 --> 00:59:02.740]   enter minority groups without any attempt
[00:59:02.740 --> 00:59:05.060]   to embrace a world of weakness,
[00:59:05.060 --> 00:59:07.660]   vulnerability, and marginality.
[00:59:08.740 --> 00:59:11.220]   Han Christians often fail to identify
[00:59:11.220 --> 00:59:13.380]   with the struggles of being minorities,
[00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:17.580]   refuse to learn minority languages and cultures,
[00:59:17.580 --> 00:59:20.580]   and expect ethnic Christians to merge
[00:59:20.580 --> 00:59:24.100]   into the majority Han churches.
[00:59:24.100 --> 00:59:28.260]   Thus, they have inadvertently adopted a mindset
[00:59:28.260 --> 00:59:31.140]   and lifestyle that support inequality.
[00:59:31.140 --> 00:59:35.660]   Critical self-reflection is truly needed
[00:59:35.660 --> 00:59:38.660]   for missionaries and their sending bodies.
[00:59:39.660 --> 00:59:44.660]   Another problem coming out from this superiority mentality
[00:59:44.660 --> 00:59:48.020]   is the lack of partnership with the weak
[00:59:48.020 --> 00:59:49.900]   in the advancement of the gospel.
[00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:55.020]   We pride ourselves when we play the savior mode,
[00:59:55.020 --> 00:59:57.380]   sending out workers to places where the church
[00:59:57.380 --> 00:59:59.140]   is poor and depleted,
[00:59:59.140 --> 01:00:02.020]   and sometimes even persecuted.
[01:00:02.020 --> 01:00:07.020]   But we are not ready to encounter truth in those contexts
[01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:11.340]   which may change and challenge our current position
[01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:12.460]   in our theology.
[01:00:12.460 --> 01:00:15.620]   Are we ready to engage with cultures
[01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:18.060]   that may be superior to ours,
[01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:22.580]   not in the modern-day economic technical sense,
[01:00:22.580 --> 01:00:26.340]   but in the sense of classic moral standards
[01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:29.540]   that sometimes have even worked on the archaic,
[01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:33.460]   like caring for the elderly, communal sharing,
[01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:37.260]   the demand to uphold family name and honor,
[01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:39.860]   the emphasis on resilience in suffering
[01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:42.740]   instead of success, et cetera, et cetera?
[01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:44.820]   Are we repeating the failures
[01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:47.220]   of American white evangelicalism?
[01:00:47.220 --> 01:00:52.380]   Coming back to lecture today,
[01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:57.340]   we might not be able to feel the kind of pain and anguish
[01:00:57.340 --> 01:01:02.340]   Dr. Leberton has on American white Christians
[01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:05.860]   because the whole scenario seems so distant.
[01:01:05.860 --> 01:01:09.220]   But we know we are all bundled together
[01:01:09.220 --> 01:01:11.060]   in this global village,
[01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:14.780]   and it's time for us to confront the whole array
[01:01:14.780 --> 01:01:17.460]   of misrepresentation of the gospel
[01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:19.740]   and the darker side of human nature
[01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:23.140]   being dressed under the cloak of evangelicalism.
[01:01:23.140 --> 01:01:27.260]   I pray that together we might be able
[01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:29.180]   to find a way out of this mire.
[01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:30.900]   Thank you.
[01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:33.220]   (footsteps)
[01:01:33.220 --> 01:01:43.740]   (speaking in foreign language)
[01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:45.060]   - Dr. Leberton,
[01:01:45.060 --> 01:01:47.420]   President Lee, distinguished guests,
[01:01:47.420 --> 01:01:48.700]   colleagues, and students,
[01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:51.940]   I'm most honored to be given the opportunity
[01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:54.700]   to respond to Professor Leberton's great speech today.
[01:01:54.700 --> 01:01:57.140]   I'd like to talk about the stories
[01:01:57.140 --> 01:01:59.580]   of American mission workers in modern China
[01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:03.900]   but it would be a totally impossible task
[01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:06.300]   to do justice to this rich legacy
[01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:07.620]   within seven minutes' time.
[01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:11.180]   However, I'm much encouraged by the example
[01:02:11.180 --> 01:02:13.620]   of the late Reverend Dr. Cheng Chengyi,
[01:02:13.620 --> 01:02:15.780]   one of the representatives of Chinese churches
[01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:19.660]   at the World Missionary Conference in Edinburgh in 1920.
[01:02:19.660 --> 01:02:22.060]   Reverend Cheng was able to clearly articulate
[01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:24.020]   the voices of the Chinese church
[01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:26.540]   within a short span of just seven minutes.
[01:02:26.740 --> 01:02:30.660]   (speaking in foreign language)
[01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:34.900]   Tracing the footprints of the many American mission workers
[01:02:34.900 --> 01:02:38.460]   in China, from Elijah Coleman Bridgman,
[01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:41.740]   the first one to arrive in China in 1830,
[01:02:41.740 --> 01:02:43.820]   through to Loyal Holding Bartow,
[01:02:43.820 --> 01:02:46.500]   who finally died in prison in China,
[01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:50.780]   we can clearly see the dedication and contribution
[01:02:50.780 --> 01:02:53.260]   of the American church in China
[01:02:53.260 --> 01:02:55.500]   in those one and a half centuries.
[01:02:56.140 --> 01:02:58.340]   (speaking in foreign language)
[01:02:58.340 --> 01:03:01.940]   The impact made was enormous and imperishable,
[01:03:01.940 --> 01:03:06.060]   so much so that even after over 70 years,
[01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:10.540]   the new China could not totally remove
[01:03:10.540 --> 01:03:12.900]   all the marks and traces they left.
[01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:21.220]   If we push the clock back another 30 years from 1949,
[01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:29.620]   we will find that the Chinese Communist Party
[01:03:29.620 --> 01:03:33.940]   had been a competition to Christianity
[01:03:33.940 --> 01:03:37.020]   since the party's inception in 1921.
[01:03:37.020 --> 01:03:43.500]   The competition was vigorous on many, many fronts.
[01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:46.740]   Both sides had wins and losses at different times.
[01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:53.220]   In respect of a number of resources and operations
[01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:58.220]   and other things, in the first 30 years of the 20th century,
[01:03:58.220 --> 01:04:03.420]   Christianity seemed to gain the upper hand,
[01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:06.860]   except that it didn't have a military presence.
[01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:13.860]   But by the end of the second 30 years,
[01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:19.620]   Christianity had lost almost everything.
[01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:25.540]   And during the third 30-year period,
[01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:27.500]   the competition ended in a draw
[01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:29.580]   if we look at numbers alone.
[01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:35.620]   There is so much that I want to tell about this period.
[01:04:35.620 --> 01:04:41.700]   So in the remaining five minutes,
[01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:43.940]   I should be very, very focused.
[01:04:51.020 --> 01:04:52.620]   In mid-20th century,
[01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:57.900]   the China Committee of the Division of Foreign Missions
[01:04:57.900 --> 01:05:02.300]   of the National Council of Churches of Christ in the USA,
[01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:07.180]   they conducted a study on the 150-odd American
[01:05:07.180 --> 01:05:11.580]   mission workers from 22 sending organizations
[01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:13.980]   who withdrew from mainland China.
[01:05:13.980 --> 01:05:20.820]   The report entitled "Lessons to be Learned
[01:05:20.820 --> 01:05:25.700]   from the Experiences of Christian Missions in China"
[01:05:25.700 --> 01:05:29.740]   was published in 1951.
[01:05:29.740 --> 01:05:35.180]   It represented the common reflections
[01:05:35.180 --> 01:05:38.340]   of that group of American missionaries in China.
[01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:42.740]   Now, one of the issues raised in the report
[01:05:42.740 --> 01:05:44.420]   caught my special attention.
[01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:51.980]   Whilst almost all missionary respondents agreed
[01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:56.140]   that services in the urban and rural areas,
[01:05:56.140 --> 01:05:57.660]   common education,
[01:05:57.660 --> 01:06:01.940]   improvements in agriculture, and so on,
[01:06:01.940 --> 01:06:06.100]   were all needed to meet the needs of the people of China.
[01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:12.300]   But 86% of the respondents pointed out
[01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:16.180]   that the Church had done very little
[01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:18.540]   in helping workers and farmers.
[01:06:18.540 --> 01:06:26.180]   And 31% agreed that
[01:06:26.180 --> 01:06:36.380]   the Church's action would build up a community
[01:06:36.380 --> 01:06:39.700]   that is totally detached from the poor people.
[01:06:39.700 --> 01:06:44.700]   And 31% agreed that missionaries tended to associate
[01:06:45.060 --> 01:06:47.860]   much more closely with government officials,
[01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:49.660]   intellectuals, and rich people.
[01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:55.500]   Since the mid-19th century,
[01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:59.100]   the most urgent priority for China
[01:06:59.100 --> 01:07:01.260]   and the most desperate dream of her people
[01:07:01.260 --> 01:07:05.300]   had been survival and rebuilding the country.
[01:07:05.300 --> 01:07:11.020]   For this, different organizations and individuals
[01:07:11.020 --> 01:07:14.180]   had put forward various proposals and solutions.
[01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:18.660]   At the same time, they were fighting for their share
[01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:21.340]   of influence and power,
[01:07:21.340 --> 01:07:23.300]   which was needed to change the country.
[01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:30.820]   That the Communist Party finally won this power struggle
[01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:33.740]   might be attributable to many reasons,
[01:07:33.740 --> 01:07:37.300]   one of which was the ability to hone in precisely
[01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:41.660]   to the crux, which was the farmers and the land.
[01:07:41.660 --> 01:07:45.580]   (speaking in foreign language)
[01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:50.580]   So the communists penetrated into farming communities,
[01:07:50.580 --> 01:07:54.500]   enticing them with fair distribution of land,
[01:07:54.500 --> 01:07:59.260]   and tireless fought on their behalf,
[01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:02.820]   thus winning over their support.
[01:08:02.820 --> 01:08:06.820]   Let me clarify here
[01:08:10.740 --> 01:08:13.620]   that I'm only pointing out the aims of endeavors
[01:08:13.620 --> 01:08:17.500]   of Communist Party without commenting on the legitimacy
[01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:19.180]   of their tactics and actions.
[01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:26.060]   By contrast, many American mission workers
[01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:28.380]   tried to showcase the Chinese version
[01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:33.380]   of America's success story in becoming a strong nation,
[01:08:33.380 --> 01:08:37.180]   extending the American westward expansion
[01:08:37.180 --> 01:08:39.060]   all the way to China.
[01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:41.660]   (speaking in foreign language)
[01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:46.100]   With a promise that this gospel from across the Atlantic
[01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:51.660]   would bring about democratic political system
[01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:56.860]   in the American style, free market economy,
[01:08:56.860 --> 01:09:01.140]   and the Christian ethos embedded
[01:09:01.140 --> 01:09:03.100]   in the founding of the United States.
[01:09:03.100 --> 01:09:08.780]   I must admit that this is still the dreams
[01:09:08.780 --> 01:09:11.020]   of many Chinese Christians today.
[01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:17.780]   But as an agricultural country like China,
[01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:20.580]   what about the most pressing social issue,
[01:09:20.580 --> 01:09:23.100]   namely the farming people and the land?
[01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:30.900]   Indeed, during the 1920s to '30s,
[01:09:30.900 --> 01:09:33.300]   some American mission organizations
[01:09:33.300 --> 01:09:37.260]   did send some agricultural mission workers to China,
[01:09:38.260 --> 01:09:41.860]   and in some Christian universities in China,
[01:09:41.860 --> 01:09:43.740]   agricultural departments were set up.
[01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:47.580]   And some Chinese Christian leaders
[01:09:47.580 --> 01:09:51.540]   had championed some rural development movements
[01:09:51.540 --> 01:09:56.820]   and managed to get some financial and policy support
[01:09:56.820 --> 01:09:59.540]   from the then Kuomintang government.
[01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:05.660]   But their contribution was limited
[01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:07.540]   to symptomatic measures.
[01:10:07.540 --> 01:10:14.300]   These are like starting education in the rural areas,
[01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:18.100]   improving hygiene and farming technologies,
[01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:21.740]   but without tackling the roots of the problem,
[01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:23.260]   which was the land issue.
[01:10:23.260 --> 01:10:31.300]   But these efforts were not embraced
[01:10:31.300 --> 01:10:34.260]   by mainline Chinese churches.
[01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:40.260]   And indeed, just like a glasshouse flower,
[01:10:40.260 --> 01:10:44.820]   which bloomed only for a short while
[01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:47.700]   and soon to be destroyed by the Sino-Japanese War.
[01:10:47.700 --> 01:10:56.340]   Just as advocates for rural development
[01:10:56.340 --> 01:11:00.580]   were trying hard to persuade the mainline Chinese churches
[01:11:00.580 --> 01:11:02.260]   to change their focus,
[01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:05.220]   some mission workers in the tertiary education sector
[01:11:05.220 --> 01:11:07.100]   cried out in alarm
[01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:10.580]   that the communists had stolen from Christian thoughts.
[01:11:10.580 --> 01:11:14.340]   The communists had already put into practice
[01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:17.220]   the very concept of fighting for social justice
[01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:18.540]   for grassroots people.
[01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:23.980]   Pastors at that time also found that
[01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:26.860]   they were losing the young people
[01:11:26.860 --> 01:11:28.620]   to the communist movements.
[01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:32.100]   In the summer of 1933,
[01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:34.980]   special meetings were held among mission workers
[01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:39.980]   to discuss how Christianity could be as influential
[01:11:39.980 --> 01:11:43.140]   among young people as communism.
[01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:51.620]   The issue that I wish to bring up today
[01:11:51.620 --> 01:11:56.220]   is not whether Christianity could win the war,
[01:11:56.220 --> 01:12:00.460]   is not whether Christianity could win in this competition,
[01:12:00.460 --> 01:12:04.940]   but rather whether the church
[01:12:04.940 --> 01:12:09.940]   is following the path of life after Christ and His cross.
[01:12:09.940 --> 01:12:15.020]   Then Jesus said to His disciples,
[01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:19.500]   "Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves
[01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:21.780]   and take up their cross and follow me."
[01:12:26.140 --> 01:12:29.740]   The young official in the Gospels had great wealth.
[01:12:29.740 --> 01:12:33.900]   So the meaning of the cross
[01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:36.740]   points directly at his wealth,
[01:12:36.740 --> 01:12:39.260]   his status,
[01:12:39.260 --> 01:12:43.140]   and challenging the social order on which he was established.
[01:12:43.140 --> 01:12:49.780]   Jesus answered,
[01:12:49.780 --> 01:12:52.860]   "If you want to be perfect,
[01:12:52.860 --> 01:12:55.740]   go sell your possessions
[01:12:55.740 --> 01:12:58.020]   and give to the poor,
[01:12:58.020 --> 01:13:00.500]   and you will have treasure in heaven.
[01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:04.820]   Then come, follow me."
[01:13:04.820 --> 01:13:11.100]   Christ has called His followers
[01:13:11.100 --> 01:13:13.660]   to tread on a downward path.
[01:13:13.660 --> 01:13:19.100]   The issue is not whether the church is in the middle class,
[01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:25.020]   but rather whether she is living out a different life.
[01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:27.580]   Separate from the world trends,
[01:13:27.580 --> 01:13:32.380]   and in accordance with Christ's commands.
[01:13:32.380 --> 01:13:38.020]   We can list four or more characteristics of evangelicalism,
[01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:40.700]   but each one may have the peril
[01:13:40.700 --> 01:13:43.300]   of becoming just a deceiving packaging.
[01:13:43.300 --> 01:13:48.220]   The crux is whether we are determined
[01:13:48.220 --> 01:13:51.260]   to internalize it as our inner value,
[01:13:52.100 --> 01:13:56.140]   and to be recognized as such through our earnest practice.
[01:13:56.140 --> 01:13:57.140]   Thank you.
[01:13:57.140 --> 01:14:21.980]   Thank you, Dr. Chen and Dr. Song, for your responses.
[01:14:21.980 --> 01:14:23.980]   And now, in the rest of the,
[01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:29.100]   we'll have about 45 minutes of questions and answers.
[01:14:29.100 --> 01:14:33.300]   And in fact, there have been several questions
[01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:34.860]   being sent in.
[01:14:34.860 --> 01:14:37.820]   And Dr. Levitin,
[01:14:37.820 --> 01:14:41.100]   can we start with a question,
[01:14:41.100 --> 01:14:45.660]   perhaps most directly related to your presentation?
[01:14:45.660 --> 01:14:51.780]   So, I think the first question is,
[01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:56.780]   what factors made evangelical Christians so blind
[01:14:56.780 --> 01:15:00.340]   to be unable to live out the truth of gospel?
[01:15:00.340 --> 01:15:02.220]   What can be done to change?
[01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:03.500]   What suggestions do you have
[01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:07.460]   for Chinese churches in America,
[01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:11.460]   which tends to so blindly follow the white churches
[01:15:11.460 --> 01:15:13.260]   in many or in all ways?
[01:15:13.260 --> 01:15:18.300]   Thank you very much for that good question.
[01:15:19.860 --> 01:15:23.300]   Let me start simply by also saying thank you
[01:15:23.300 --> 01:15:25.620]   to the two respondents.
[01:15:25.620 --> 01:15:27.740]   I appreciated very much their comments,
[01:15:27.740 --> 01:15:30.860]   and I hope I'll have a chance to interact
[01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:32.180]   with them at some stage.
[01:15:32.180 --> 01:15:35.060]   The question is penetrating,
[01:15:35.060 --> 01:15:38.220]   and I think maybe one way of summarizing it
[01:15:38.220 --> 01:15:43.220]   is that we are all aware that the gospel
[01:15:43.220 --> 01:15:47.060]   is far more radical than the church
[01:15:47.060 --> 01:15:51.780]   that names that gospel as usually ever wanting to be.
[01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:55.780]   What Jesus did and what he said and how he taught
[01:15:55.780 --> 01:16:02.220]   and what he called us to is just much more difficult
[01:16:02.220 --> 01:16:07.460]   and uncomfortable than we are usually willing
[01:16:07.460 --> 01:16:11.420]   to actually accept or even acknowledge.
[01:16:11.420 --> 01:16:14.100]   I think Christian history has shown
[01:16:15.020 --> 01:16:17.500]   that there is a great tendency,
[01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:22.500]   a common tendency to accommodate the gospel
[01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:26.540]   to something that we find more acceptable
[01:16:26.540 --> 01:16:29.860]   than to live in the radical way
[01:16:29.860 --> 01:16:32.180]   that Jesus exemplified and taught.
[01:16:32.180 --> 01:16:38.340]   So in talking about American white evangelicalism,
[01:16:38.340 --> 01:16:41.540]   I'm talking about one way that the church
[01:16:41.540 --> 01:16:44.900]   throughout history has simply accommodated
[01:16:44.900 --> 01:16:48.420]   the good news to the life that we wanna go ahead
[01:16:48.420 --> 01:16:50.940]   and live apart from the gospel.
[01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:55.460]   And we want to use the gospel as a framework
[01:16:55.460 --> 01:17:01.020]   for various purposes, for eternal life,
[01:17:01.020 --> 01:17:06.020]   for moral clarity, for social relationships,
[01:17:06.020 --> 01:17:14.140]   for hope, for love, for peace.
[01:17:14.780 --> 01:17:15.980]   For forgiveness.
[01:17:15.980 --> 01:17:19.380]   But the radical call to take up our cross
[01:17:19.380 --> 01:17:23.740]   and follow Christ has never been a popular part
[01:17:23.740 --> 01:17:25.260]   of the life of the church.
[01:17:25.260 --> 01:17:30.180]   And throughout church history,
[01:17:30.180 --> 01:17:32.940]   the number of people, as Jesus said,
[01:17:32.940 --> 01:17:35.620]   that are willing to do that are few.
[01:17:35.620 --> 01:17:41.900]   So let me begin first with saying that.
[01:17:41.900 --> 01:17:45.060]   So we're talking about the broadness of the church
[01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:49.300]   in its unwillingness to actually be radical followers
[01:17:49.300 --> 01:17:50.980]   of Jesus.
[01:17:50.980 --> 01:17:54.820]   And in many ways, the white evangelical church in America
[01:17:54.820 --> 01:17:59.580]   becomes a case study in what for different reasons
[01:17:59.580 --> 01:18:02.500]   could be said perhaps as the two respondents
[01:18:02.500 --> 01:18:05.620]   have indicated in some ways of the Chinese church,
[01:18:05.620 --> 01:18:08.340]   but it certainly could be true of countries
[01:18:08.340 --> 01:18:10.620]   all around the world,
[01:18:10.620 --> 01:18:14.180]   each in their own particular context and culture.
[01:18:14.180 --> 01:18:17.180]   But in the American setting,
[01:18:17.180 --> 01:18:20.660]   I would commend a book that I'm going to refer to again
[01:18:20.660 --> 01:18:25.660]   tomorrow called "The Democratization of Christianity
[01:18:25.660 --> 01:18:27.660]   in America."
[01:18:27.660 --> 01:18:31.900]   "The Democratization of Christianity in America."
[01:18:31.900 --> 01:18:36.140]   It's an exceptionally good book,
[01:18:36.140 --> 01:18:40.980]   which is an expression of the way
[01:18:40.980 --> 01:18:44.580]   that American Christianity changed as it moved
[01:18:44.580 --> 01:18:47.900]   from the East Coast to the West Coast of the United States
[01:18:47.900 --> 01:18:52.180]   and further and further into the South as well.
[01:18:52.180 --> 01:18:53.940]   And a great deal of the theme of the book
[01:18:53.940 --> 01:18:57.540]   has to do with the way that Christianity became
[01:18:57.540 --> 01:19:00.980]   something which people made up for themselves.
[01:19:00.980 --> 01:19:02.740]   So they had the Bible,
[01:19:02.740 --> 01:19:05.140]   but they often didn't have any educated leaders.
[01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:08.300]   They didn't have any kind of Christian community
[01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:09.580]   around them necessarily.
[01:19:09.580 --> 01:19:13.180]   They didn't have any educational institutions
[01:19:13.180 --> 01:19:16.980]   that were helping to guide and form their leadership.
[01:19:16.980 --> 01:19:20.300]   They just instead took the gospel
[01:19:20.300 --> 01:19:23.660]   or whatever it is that they thought they knew of the gospel
[01:19:23.660 --> 01:19:27.180]   and put it to work for their own designs,
[01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:29.740]   I'm sure humbly and earnestly,
[01:19:29.740 --> 01:19:34.140]   but often very, very specifically and personally
[01:19:34.140 --> 01:19:37.980]   rather than as a response to the Lordship of Christ
[01:19:37.980 --> 01:19:39.460]   over all things.
[01:19:39.460 --> 01:19:43.300]   And out of that came what now we would recognize,
[01:19:43.300 --> 01:19:47.780]   for example, as consumer Christianity.
[01:19:47.780 --> 01:19:51.620]   That is, I'm going to take from the gospel what I want
[01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:56.620]   and I'm going to keep the parts that I like that serve me
[01:19:56.620 --> 01:19:59.700]   and I'm going to more or less ignore
[01:19:59.700 --> 01:20:04.460]   or reject the parts that I don't like.
[01:20:04.460 --> 01:20:08.860]   And that pattern, which is one that emerges early
[01:20:08.860 --> 01:20:13.540]   in American history, is one that continues to this day.
[01:20:13.540 --> 01:20:15.660]   So the antidote to that,
[01:20:15.660 --> 01:20:20.060]   coming to the question asker's point,
[01:20:20.060 --> 01:20:21.940]   what is the antidote to that?
[01:20:21.940 --> 01:20:24.220]   I think the antidote to that has to do
[01:20:24.220 --> 01:20:27.900]   with how we form genuine disciples,
[01:20:28.900 --> 01:20:33.020]   not people who are part of denomination and a movement
[01:20:33.020 --> 01:20:36.020]   or an organization or a structure,
[01:20:36.020 --> 01:20:39.580]   but people who are truly devoted
[01:20:39.580 --> 01:20:42.460]   to being followers of Jesus.
[01:20:42.460 --> 01:20:44.420]   And then do it in community,
[01:20:44.420 --> 01:20:46.940]   because of course we're not meant to live this kind of life.
[01:20:46.940 --> 01:20:50.620]   We can't live this kind of life individualistically
[01:20:50.620 --> 01:20:52.540]   as Americans also try to do.
[01:20:52.540 --> 01:20:54.820]   We'll come to that more tomorrow.
[01:20:54.820 --> 01:20:56.900]   We have to do it in community.
[01:20:56.900 --> 01:20:58.820]   And in doing it in community,
[01:20:58.820 --> 01:21:02.860]   then we have the check and balance of other people around us.
[01:21:02.860 --> 01:21:07.140]   And the difficulty is that so often what we gather around us
[01:21:07.140 --> 01:21:09.620]   is a community that looks like us.
[01:21:09.620 --> 01:21:13.340]   So then the church starts looking like the social setting
[01:21:13.340 --> 01:21:15.260]   into which we were born,
[01:21:15.260 --> 01:21:19.700]   rather than a community like the apostle Paul,
[01:21:19.700 --> 01:21:21.140]   I would want to argue,
[01:21:21.140 --> 01:21:25.100]   suggests is meant to be an entirely new humanity.
[01:21:27.340 --> 01:21:31.220]   One humanity, a new humanity that reflects
[01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:33.260]   the death and resurrection of Jesus
[01:21:33.260 --> 01:21:36.140]   by the death and resurrection of ourselves
[01:21:36.140 --> 01:21:39.180]   in community of unlike people.
[01:21:39.180 --> 01:21:43.420]   That's the place that the church has often broken down.
[01:21:43.420 --> 01:21:46.780]   And that's exactly what happened in American church culture
[01:21:46.780 --> 01:21:51.780]   in historical terms, but it is largely still the case.
[01:21:51.780 --> 01:21:56.900]   So when a poll was done by the Pew Foundation
[01:21:56.900 --> 01:22:00.780]   two years ago about how many white Americans
[01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:05.700]   have close relationships with a person of another race,
[01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:11.020]   nearly 85% of white Americans said
[01:22:11.020 --> 01:22:14.220]   they did not have any close relationships
[01:22:14.220 --> 01:22:16.620]   with people that were not of their race.
[01:22:16.620 --> 01:22:20.060]   Now that's true of society in general,
[01:22:20.060 --> 01:22:22.020]   but if that's true of society in general,
[01:22:22.020 --> 01:22:26.380]   then it is tragically certainly true of churches
[01:22:26.380 --> 01:22:29.460]   who have a white normativity
[01:22:29.460 --> 01:22:32.700]   that often excludes people of color
[01:22:32.700 --> 01:22:35.580]   and does so in cultural and church terms.
[01:22:35.580 --> 01:22:39.620]   And then we just become a mirror, a hall of mirrors
[01:22:39.620 --> 01:22:43.060]   that we all look alike and act alike and talk alike.
[01:22:43.060 --> 01:22:45.420]   And therefore we think that's the gospel
[01:22:45.420 --> 01:22:48.540]   instead of letting the gospel radically redefine us.
[01:22:48.540 --> 01:22:53.180]   - Thank you, Dr. Levitan.
[01:22:53.180 --> 01:22:55.900]   I think you have raised several themes
[01:22:55.900 --> 01:22:59.380]   like taming the radical nature of the gospel,
[01:22:59.380 --> 01:23:02.740]   the consumerism, and also bringing together
[01:23:02.740 --> 01:23:06.860]   unlike people in the new created community in Christ.
[01:23:06.860 --> 01:23:09.860]   So these themes sound also familiar
[01:23:09.860 --> 01:23:13.340]   here in actually in the Chinese churches
[01:23:13.340 --> 01:23:16.380]   and the churches around here in Hong Kong as well.
[01:23:16.380 --> 01:23:21.020]   So I think this lead very naturally to a second question.
[01:23:21.020 --> 01:23:25.260]   Actually, it's a small agenda in nature.
[01:23:25.260 --> 01:23:27.500]   It says maybe our two response speakers
[01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:29.740]   have to fill in some of the gaps as well.
[01:23:29.740 --> 01:23:35.820]   It asks, "In what way does American white evangelicalism
[01:23:35.820 --> 01:23:40.020]   "affect churches in Hong Kong now?"
[01:23:40.020 --> 01:23:43.100]   So yes, I think we need wisdoms
[01:23:43.100 --> 01:23:46.420]   from across the Atlantic, Pacific.
[01:23:46.420 --> 01:23:48.340]   - The respondent should speak first.
[01:23:48.340 --> 01:23:49.580]   - Okay.
[01:23:49.580 --> 01:23:53.660]   So perhaps I translate the question
[01:23:53.660 --> 01:23:55.780]   for Dr. Sung-Jun first, okay.
[01:23:55.780 --> 01:24:01.140]   (speaking in foreign language)
[01:24:01.140 --> 01:24:08.540]   Maybe we may start with a born Chinese,
[01:24:08.540 --> 01:24:09.580]   Hong Kong, sorry.
[01:24:09.580 --> 01:24:15.020]   - Well, I noticed that there are quite a few
[01:24:15.020 --> 01:24:17.060]   faculty members now on the floor.
[01:24:17.060 --> 01:24:20.700]   So I'm expecting some of your response as well, okay.
[01:24:20.700 --> 01:24:21.980]   We need your input.
[01:24:21.980 --> 01:24:27.460]   And yeah, because of my location,
[01:24:27.460 --> 01:24:30.380]   I mean, I feel more and more distant
[01:24:30.380 --> 01:24:33.860]   from the Hong Kong current scene to be sure, yeah.
[01:24:33.860 --> 01:24:36.260]   But I'm just thinking that
[01:24:36.260 --> 01:24:41.500]   just following up on Dr. Leberton's remark,
[01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:45.380]   I think we need to be aware of our inclination
[01:24:45.380 --> 01:24:48.180]   or this kind of
[01:24:48.180 --> 01:24:53.740]   tendency to group together with people
[01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:56.860]   who are alike with us, okay.
[01:24:56.860 --> 01:24:59.780]   So I mean, this is something very natural
[01:24:59.780 --> 01:25:01.900]   because you feel so comfortable.
[01:25:01.900 --> 01:25:04.220]   We will stay in our comfort zone.
[01:25:04.220 --> 01:25:08.060]   But right now, because of the divisions,
[01:25:08.060 --> 01:25:11.660]   the divisiveness among the churches in Hong Kong,
[01:25:11.660 --> 01:25:15.420]   I think we need to sort of alter our mentality.
[01:25:15.420 --> 01:25:19.980]   We need to keep reminding us that we have to keep
[01:25:19.980 --> 01:25:21.740]   reading from the other side
[01:25:21.740 --> 01:25:26.700]   and then to listen from opposing angles and views.
[01:25:26.700 --> 01:25:28.660]   So I think this is kind of a discipline.
[01:25:28.660 --> 01:25:31.420]   I call this even spiritual discipline for us
[01:25:31.420 --> 01:25:35.820]   that we need to constantly keep
[01:25:38.660 --> 01:25:43.660]   learning, learning and trying to see
[01:25:43.660 --> 01:25:49.020]   what we have missed in our own framework, okay.
[01:25:49.020 --> 01:25:52.660]   So this is something that I think should be done.
[01:25:52.660 --> 01:25:56.820]   But if talking about this whole concept of,
[01:25:56.820 --> 01:26:00.340]   whole tendency of white evangelicalism
[01:26:00.340 --> 01:26:03.140]   and their influence on the Hong Kong church,
[01:26:03.140 --> 01:26:07.980]   I'm feeling that whatever American is doing now,
[01:26:07.980 --> 01:26:11.700]   would have global effects, like it or not, okay.
[01:26:11.700 --> 01:26:13.540]   So we have to acknowledge that
[01:26:13.540 --> 01:26:16.860]   because of all this online information
[01:26:16.860 --> 01:26:19.260]   and all because of all the,
[01:26:19.260 --> 01:26:23.580]   the most of the theological material we study,
[01:26:23.580 --> 01:26:28.220]   imported from the West and because of the majority
[01:26:28.220 --> 01:26:32.220]   of written material from the States,
[01:26:32.220 --> 01:26:37.220]   I mean, we are really affected by the whole concept
[01:26:37.700 --> 01:26:40.500]   of, the whole concept of
[01:26:40.500 --> 01:26:48.620]   theology that would underplay the,
[01:26:48.620 --> 01:26:55.140]   the emphasis or the look on the weak and the marginalized.
[01:26:55.140 --> 01:27:00.460]   This is what I'm talking in my response
[01:27:00.460 --> 01:27:02.900]   because of this whole idea of success
[01:27:02.900 --> 01:27:07.060]   that you can do it, freedom and all this idea
[01:27:07.060 --> 01:27:11.100]   that is very positive thinking and it's really good for us.
[01:27:11.100 --> 01:27:14.260]   But on the other hand, I think we really lack
[01:27:14.260 --> 01:27:17.220]   this whole concept of suffering and persecution
[01:27:17.220 --> 01:27:19.700]   in American theology.
[01:27:19.700 --> 01:27:26.540]   And we import them and then we tend to talk about,
[01:27:26.540 --> 01:27:29.380]   say when we talk about suffering,
[01:27:29.380 --> 01:27:32.540]   we talk about personal suffering as such
[01:27:32.540 --> 01:27:34.260]   instead of social suffering.
[01:27:35.180 --> 01:27:39.260]   We talk about this whole concept of suffering
[01:27:39.260 --> 01:27:42.540]   because of illness, of age, but we know that
[01:27:42.540 --> 01:27:49.140]   in the end, actually, most of the suffering
[01:27:49.140 --> 01:27:52.580]   actually comes from a social setting.
[01:27:52.580 --> 01:27:57.940]   But because Hong Kong churches are in general
[01:27:57.940 --> 01:27:59.780]   also very middle class.
[01:27:59.780 --> 01:28:05.060]   And so we can hide in our small niche
[01:28:05.060 --> 01:28:07.460]   and then we can feel comfortable.
[01:28:07.460 --> 01:28:12.100]   And again, we can sort of explain our whole being
[01:28:12.100 --> 01:28:15.260]   with a very limited kind of framework.
[01:28:15.260 --> 01:28:19.780]   And so I'm feeling that if we look broader
[01:28:19.780 --> 01:28:23.820]   into the whole global world and read more about
[01:28:23.820 --> 01:28:26.540]   the kind of experiences and narratives
[01:28:26.540 --> 01:28:28.780]   from more of the third world countries,
[01:28:28.780 --> 01:28:31.060]   from Africa, from Latin America,
[01:28:31.060 --> 01:28:34.020]   and from say South Asia, et cetera,
[01:28:34.020 --> 01:28:37.620]   I think we'll really try to wean ourselves
[01:28:37.620 --> 01:28:39.500]   from American evangelicalism.
[01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:45.380]   >> Thank you very much.
[01:28:45.380 --> 01:28:52.420]   >> Thank you for the question and the response from Wenyan.
[01:28:52.420 --> 01:28:56.140]   I just want to respond to one point.
[01:29:00.140 --> 01:29:05.140]   From what Dr. Levitin talked about American evangelicalism
[01:29:05.140 --> 01:29:11.380]   true to the critical and put into action.
[01:29:11.380 --> 01:29:19.860]   I think the churches in Hong Kong do have the DNA
[01:29:19.860 --> 01:29:21.220]   of evangelicalism.
[01:29:21.220 --> 01:29:29.100]   But there are three things which are also pointed out
[01:29:29.860 --> 01:29:30.700]   in the question.
[01:29:30.700 --> 01:29:35.380]   And as someone coming from mainland China,
[01:29:35.380 --> 01:29:36.860]   I have such observation.
[01:29:36.860 --> 01:29:41.860]   The first one, from 1980s onwards,
[01:29:41.860 --> 01:29:44.220]   churches in Hong Kong,
[01:29:44.220 --> 01:29:51.220]   more and more members of them are becoming more concerned
[01:29:51.220 --> 01:29:55.940]   about social issues, especially among young Christians.
[01:29:55.940 --> 01:29:59.540]   And this is a very clear sign.
[01:29:59.540 --> 01:30:00.820]   The second point is,
[01:30:00.820 --> 01:30:14.220]   in Hong Kong there are also many ethnic problems.
[01:30:14.220 --> 01:30:18.540]   But among Christians in Hong Kong,
[01:30:18.540 --> 01:30:21.020]   very few of them would voice out their response.
[01:30:21.020 --> 01:30:27.100]   Most of them do not admit that there is an ethnic problem.
[01:30:28.020 --> 01:30:31.660]   But as a very international and open community here,
[01:30:31.660 --> 01:30:35.660]   with many, many people from many different
[01:30:35.660 --> 01:30:37.740]   ethnic backgrounds living here,
[01:30:37.740 --> 01:30:43.900]   their conditions and their problems, their livelihood,
[01:30:43.900 --> 01:30:50.380]   is not something that is a concern of Church of Hong Kong.
[01:30:50.380 --> 01:30:52.780]   The third point is,
[01:30:55.660 --> 01:30:59.060]   many churches in Hong Kong are middle class,
[01:30:59.060 --> 01:31:03.980]   neglecting concern about the grassroot people.
[01:31:03.980 --> 01:31:08.180]   But admittedly, there are many organizations,
[01:31:08.180 --> 01:31:13.180]   Christian NGOs, who are helping the underprivileged.
[01:31:13.180 --> 01:31:19.540]   But they also have characteristics
[01:31:19.540 --> 01:31:21.420]   of the middle class church.
[01:31:21.420 --> 01:31:22.260]   Thank you.
[01:31:23.260 --> 01:31:26.980]   - Dr. Levitton, any further comments after hearing the two?
[01:31:26.980 --> 01:31:34.860]   - Augustine was convinced that sin is disordered love.
[01:31:34.860 --> 01:31:42.060]   And every culture has an order of loves that it prioritizes.
[01:31:42.060 --> 01:31:48.620]   And in American culture, loves that tend to get prioritized
[01:31:49.860 --> 01:31:54.860]   are loves like the love of personal happiness,
[01:31:54.860 --> 01:32:01.700]   the love of pleasure, the love of success,
[01:32:01.700 --> 01:32:05.500]   which can be monetary, but it can be other things as well.
[01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:11.620]   The love of power, the love of beauty.
[01:32:11.620 --> 01:32:17.100]   These are all things that are part of our loves.
[01:32:17.100 --> 01:32:20.380]   And we live in a world of disordered loves,
[01:32:20.380 --> 01:32:23.540]   where we're meant to live and sustain ourselves,
[01:32:23.540 --> 01:32:26.660]   first and foremost, out of the love of God,
[01:32:26.660 --> 01:32:31.660]   and in response, showing our love to God as our first love.
[01:32:31.660 --> 01:32:35.460]   But of course, the nature of the human story
[01:32:35.460 --> 01:32:38.540]   and the nature of the American white evangelical story
[01:32:38.540 --> 01:32:43.260]   is the story of us attaching our lives to other loves,
[01:32:43.260 --> 01:32:46.420]   and then trying to make peace
[01:32:46.420 --> 01:32:50.020]   with the way that they do and don't fit
[01:32:50.020 --> 01:32:52.340]   the call of a disciple.
[01:32:52.340 --> 01:32:57.340]   And part of what we're called to is to reorder our loves.
[01:32:57.340 --> 01:33:01.060]   And I think this is where Christian worship
[01:33:01.060 --> 01:33:05.340]   reveals both our sin and the places that American culture
[01:33:05.340 --> 01:33:08.340]   has influenced many places around the world,
[01:33:08.340 --> 01:33:13.340]   and the ways that we are meant to be redeemed.
[01:33:13.580 --> 01:33:17.580]   So ideally, we could say public worship
[01:33:17.580 --> 01:33:22.580]   is meant to be an experience of reordering love,
[01:33:22.580 --> 01:33:29.260]   to be regrounded again in our love for God
[01:33:29.260 --> 01:33:34.260]   and our love for our neighbors and our love for ourselves.
[01:33:34.260 --> 01:33:38.220]   And within the ordering of loving our neighbors,
[01:33:38.220 --> 01:33:40.620]   it doesn't mean the neighbors that are like us
[01:33:40.620 --> 01:33:45.100]   or who like us, but as Jesus says in the Sermon on the Mount
[01:33:45.100 --> 01:33:48.100]   it even can include those who are our enemies.
[01:33:48.100 --> 01:33:52.820]   So to live into that kind of reordered love
[01:33:52.820 --> 01:33:57.820]   means that our public worship has to feed those appetites,
[01:33:57.820 --> 01:34:02.020]   nurture that desire that we would be those kinds of people.
[01:34:02.020 --> 01:34:06.180]   But instead, the American worship that we've exported
[01:34:06.180 --> 01:34:10.580]   is often a worship of entertainment.
[01:34:10.580 --> 01:34:14.900]   It's about celebrity, it's about money,
[01:34:14.900 --> 01:34:19.140]   it's about beauty, it's about fame, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:34:19.140 --> 01:34:22.860]   And not as Dr. Chan said so beautifully,
[01:34:22.860 --> 01:34:26.020]   it's not about the first love of God,
[01:34:26.020 --> 01:34:30.460]   particularly for the poor and for the neediest.
[01:34:30.460 --> 01:34:35.460]   So we are not cultivated to love what God most loves.
[01:34:36.260 --> 01:34:39.420]   And instead we're recultivated in the church
[01:34:39.420 --> 01:34:41.620]   to love what we already love.
[01:34:41.620 --> 01:34:44.740]   And then to just go on loving it even more
[01:34:44.740 --> 01:34:47.740]   rather than actually reflecting the love of God
[01:34:47.740 --> 01:34:49.260]   for the world.
[01:34:49.260 --> 01:34:51.700]   So I fear that we've exported that
[01:34:51.700 --> 01:34:54.860]   and it is its own musical
[01:34:54.860 --> 01:35:00.340]   and worship entertainment industry
[01:35:00.340 --> 01:35:02.500]   that has often been exported.
[01:35:02.500 --> 01:35:07.260]   And tragically that forms people to love the wrong things.
[01:35:07.260 --> 01:35:11.540]   - Thank you for your comment.
[01:35:11.540 --> 01:35:14.020]   So your comment has encouraged me
[01:35:14.020 --> 01:35:18.140]   to study more closely your two books,
[01:35:18.140 --> 01:35:19.700]   The Dangerous Acts of Worship
[01:35:19.700 --> 01:35:22.300]   and The Dangerous Acts of Loving Your Neighbor.
[01:35:22.300 --> 01:35:26.620]   I think I will take out more answers from your two works.
[01:35:26.620 --> 01:35:28.780]   Well, actually bring that to,
[01:35:28.780 --> 01:35:31.980]   I think your mentioning of loving your neighbor,
[01:35:31.980 --> 01:35:35.740]   actually it has quite some impact
[01:35:35.740 --> 01:35:40.740]   on our present Hong Kong churches as well.
[01:35:40.740 --> 01:35:44.860]   So there are two questions a bit related,
[01:35:44.860 --> 01:35:46.900]   but actually there are some details there.
[01:35:46.900 --> 01:35:50.220]   So maybe it can help Dr. Levitin
[01:35:50.220 --> 01:35:55.220]   to help giving your wisdom about what we may do,
[01:35:55.220 --> 01:36:00.260]   how we may react in the certain situation.
[01:36:00.260 --> 01:36:03.780]   One question is from a pastor and he says,
[01:36:03.780 --> 01:36:05.900]   Dr. Levitin, your views on complicity
[01:36:05.900 --> 01:36:08.900]   is something we can relate to greatly in Hong Kong.
[01:36:08.900 --> 01:36:12.980]   Given the recent circumstances as experienced by Hong Kong,
[01:36:12.980 --> 01:36:15.620]   most churches are very divided.
[01:36:15.620 --> 01:36:18.580]   It is those who feel we should speak out
[01:36:18.580 --> 01:36:21.540]   against present happenings, against authority,
[01:36:21.540 --> 01:36:24.100]   and those who do not wish to at all.
[01:36:24.100 --> 01:36:26.980]   As a pastor, I can say that we struggle greatly
[01:36:26.980 --> 01:36:30.020]   with the balancing act of wishing to speak,
[01:36:30.020 --> 01:36:33.060]   wishing to speak against that which we feel is evil,
[01:36:33.060 --> 01:36:36.260]   and of not wishing to offend those members of the church
[01:36:36.260 --> 01:36:39.020]   who are strong supporters of authority.
[01:36:39.020 --> 01:36:41.700]   But you seem to present the view that we are either
[01:36:41.700 --> 01:36:46.340]   complicit and condone evil acts like slavery,
[01:36:46.340 --> 01:36:49.740]   or we speak out against it, which at least to war,
[01:36:49.740 --> 01:36:52.500]   and there's highly frowned upon in the Chinese community,
[01:36:52.500 --> 01:36:54.860]   which is all about harmony.
[01:36:54.860 --> 01:36:57.380]   So how should we juggle this balancing act,
[01:36:57.380 --> 01:37:00.460]   speaking or not speaking, and not to be complicit?
[01:37:00.460 --> 01:37:03.860]   So that is the very particular question.
[01:37:03.860 --> 01:37:08.620]   And in the more general nature is about how to communicate
[01:37:08.620 --> 01:37:12.020]   effectively and in a loving way to those
[01:37:12.020 --> 01:37:14.980]   who hold opposite opinions from you.
[01:37:14.980 --> 01:37:18.620]   So these are, I think, two very related questions.
[01:37:18.620 --> 01:37:20.660]   And can we hear your wisdom on that?
[01:37:20.660 --> 01:37:23.620]   - Yes, I'll offer what I have.
[01:37:23.620 --> 01:37:26.740]   Whether you consider it wisdom, I'll leave you to decide.
[01:37:27.700 --> 01:37:30.540]   Let me say first that what you've just described
[01:37:30.540 --> 01:37:34.020]   by that example is precisely what has been going on
[01:37:34.020 --> 01:37:35.980]   in the American white evangelical church,
[01:37:35.980 --> 01:37:39.620]   where you end up having some members of a church
[01:37:39.620 --> 01:37:43.740]   believe that, for example, that America and its government
[01:37:43.740 --> 01:37:48.060]   is not in any way an expression of God's will or desire.
[01:37:48.060 --> 01:37:51.460]   And in the same congregation, you have people who look
[01:37:51.460 --> 01:37:54.260]   at what's going on and say this at last is the best
[01:37:54.260 --> 01:37:57.420]   and most supportive government for Christians
[01:37:57.420 --> 01:37:59.940]   that the United States has ever had.
[01:37:59.940 --> 01:38:03.540]   So how do they share in the same congregational life?
[01:38:03.540 --> 01:38:07.940]   So this problem that we're all describing manifests
[01:38:07.940 --> 01:38:09.380]   under different issues perhaps,
[01:38:09.380 --> 01:38:11.940]   but the dynamic is really the same.
[01:38:11.940 --> 01:38:13.780]   So when I think about, first of all,
[01:38:13.780 --> 01:38:16.860]   how Jesus responds to this dilemma,
[01:38:16.860 --> 01:38:21.260]   he moves toward the stranger, toward the other,
[01:38:21.260 --> 01:38:24.660]   and also actually toward the so-called enemy.
[01:38:24.660 --> 01:38:28.820]   These are such dramatic examples,
[01:38:28.820 --> 01:38:31.460]   but one of them, for example, would be at the end
[01:38:31.460 --> 01:38:33.820]   of the Sermon on the Mount, when Jesus says
[01:38:33.820 --> 01:38:36.820]   that we build our house on rock or on sand,
[01:38:36.820 --> 01:38:39.220]   he's clearly saying that we build our house on rock
[01:38:39.220 --> 01:38:43.140]   by actually doing the truth, not by just affirming it
[01:38:43.140 --> 01:38:44.500]   or confessing the truth.
[01:38:44.500 --> 01:38:45.900]   We live the truth.
[01:38:45.900 --> 01:38:48.140]   That's how we build our house on rock.
[01:38:48.140 --> 01:38:50.100]   And what's interesting is that right after that,
[01:38:50.100 --> 01:38:54.420]   he encounters a person with epilepsy.
[01:38:54.420 --> 01:38:58.660]   Sorry, not with, yes, with epilepsy.
[01:38:58.660 --> 01:39:02.980]   No, sorry, excuse me, with leprosy, excuse me.
[01:39:02.980 --> 01:39:09.940]   And in that moment, he's invited to heal the person,
[01:39:09.940 --> 01:39:12.620]   and Jesus moves toward this person
[01:39:12.620 --> 01:39:16.260]   that was considered unclean, touches them, and heals them.
[01:39:16.260 --> 01:39:19.740]   And then if that's not enough of a shock,
[01:39:19.740 --> 01:39:24.420]   then the very next part of this is that a Roman centurion
[01:39:24.420 --> 01:39:29.420]   comes toward Jesus and says that a servant of his
[01:39:29.420 --> 01:39:31.940]   is in great need, could Jesus come and heal him?
[01:39:31.940 --> 01:39:34.540]   And Jesus says he's happily willing to do so,
[01:39:34.540 --> 01:39:37.620]   and the man says, "No, no, you don't need to come and do so
[01:39:37.620 --> 01:39:41.140]   "because you just say the word and it will be done."
[01:39:41.140 --> 01:39:45.180]   And then he pauses everyone around and said,
[01:39:45.180 --> 01:39:47.940]   "Did you just hear what this man said?
[01:39:47.940 --> 01:39:50.380]   "I have not heard," these are the critical words,
[01:39:50.380 --> 01:39:55.380]   "I've not heard faithfulness like this in all of Israel.
[01:39:55.380 --> 01:39:58.540]   "There are some people outside the kingdom of God
[01:39:58.540 --> 01:40:02.620]   "who will be in, and some who you presume to be in
[01:40:02.620 --> 01:40:04.700]   "who will be on the outside."
[01:40:04.700 --> 01:40:06.940]   Now, I share those stories because for me,
[01:40:06.940 --> 01:40:09.860]   they are examples of at least some of the things
[01:40:09.860 --> 01:40:12.460]   to consider in answering the question.
[01:40:12.460 --> 01:40:14.900]   I want to first of all move toward people
[01:40:14.900 --> 01:40:18.540]   that I might consider to be uncomfortable.
[01:40:18.540 --> 01:40:21.220]   They might not be, quote, "unclean,"
[01:40:21.220 --> 01:40:24.500]   but they're not like me or they are not easy
[01:40:24.500 --> 01:40:28.160]   for me to be with, or they are a problem,
[01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:30.200]   in quotes, in some way or another.
[01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:32.460]   And Jesus gives an example in this case
[01:40:32.460 --> 01:40:34.940]   and in so many other cases as we know
[01:40:34.940 --> 01:40:36.780]   about what it means to move toward people
[01:40:36.780 --> 01:40:41.780]   who are difficult, marginalized, awkward, needy,
[01:40:43.340 --> 01:40:44.860]   potentially unclean.
[01:40:44.860 --> 01:40:47.660]   I think there's a lot of tendency
[01:40:47.660 --> 01:40:49.940]   in contemporary culture around the world
[01:40:49.940 --> 01:40:52.100]   to label people clean and unclean,
[01:40:52.100 --> 01:40:56.780]   to be mindful that some are should be included
[01:40:56.780 --> 01:40:59.940]   and others don't deserve to be included.
[01:40:59.940 --> 01:41:02.040]   What's amazing about these texts
[01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:06.120]   in the early part of chapter eight of Matthew's gospel
[01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:11.120]   is that Jesus moves toward the man with leprosy,
[01:41:11.620 --> 01:41:16.620]   touches him, calls him a name of attachment,
[01:41:16.620 --> 01:41:24.140]   heals him, and does this completely counter
[01:41:24.140 --> 01:41:28.180]   to the pressure of the moment, the social pressure.
[01:41:28.180 --> 01:41:31.940]   But then more radically, when the centurion appears,
[01:41:31.940 --> 01:41:35.000]   the representative of dominating Roman authority,
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:39.560]   he receives the man's witness, hears it for what it is,
[01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:43.060]   acknowledges it and lifts it up,
[01:41:43.060 --> 01:41:47.620]   and then goes forward to actually heal the man's servant.
[01:41:47.620 --> 01:41:50.940]   Now, in both cases, I think we learn lessons
[01:41:50.940 --> 01:41:53.120]   about what it means to try to live together
[01:41:53.120 --> 01:41:53.960]   in a different way.
[01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:57.500]   In the first case, how do I learn to lean toward people
[01:41:57.500 --> 01:42:02.380]   that I might marginalize because of different opinions
[01:42:02.380 --> 01:42:06.020]   in churches over these very issues that you've just raised?
[01:42:06.020 --> 01:42:09.220]   That has to take practice to develop that ability.
[01:42:09.220 --> 01:42:14.080]   And I think often churches have small groups that meet
[01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:15.760]   or prayer groups that meet.
[01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:17.460]   Our ability to pray for one another,
[01:42:17.460 --> 01:42:19.660]   to grow in our capacity to love people
[01:42:19.660 --> 01:42:24.320]   inside the body of Christ is one of the kinds of prayers
[01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:26.420]   and the sort of work that we need
[01:42:26.420 --> 01:42:28.720]   to hold one another accountable to doing,
[01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:32.680]   not just becoming our own little small tribe within a tribe,
[01:42:32.680 --> 01:42:35.400]   but to actually learn to love one another,
[01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:38.200]   to see each other, to value each other,
[01:42:38.200 --> 01:42:40.840]   to honor in whatever way we can.
[01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:45.480]   And then the gold standard of Jesus
[01:42:45.480 --> 01:42:48.960]   is not whether we love those who love us,
[01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:51.280]   but whether we love those who don't love us
[01:42:51.280 --> 01:42:55.120]   or don't like us and who may even be our enemies.
[01:42:55.120 --> 01:42:58.880]   How do we also learn to practice loving people like that?
[01:42:58.880 --> 01:43:03.680]   And I think that happens in that case in Matthew 8,
[01:43:03.680 --> 01:43:05.360]   it happens first of all by Jesus
[01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:09.480]   just very carefully listening to what the man said.
[01:43:09.480 --> 01:43:12.040]   The most amazing part of that text
[01:43:12.040 --> 01:43:16.360]   is the way that Jesus hears his actual declaration of faith
[01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:19.360]   and then focuses on that,
[01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:23.320]   letting it fully be absorbed into his own heart and mind,
[01:43:23.320 --> 01:43:28.320]   and then responds back to that affirmingly.
[01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:30.960]   That is deep and profound faith,
[01:43:30.960 --> 01:43:33.840]   unlike anything I've heard in all of Israel.
[01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:36.720]   Well, that was scandalous, of course, to Jews.
[01:43:36.720 --> 01:43:39.480]   It was crazy to think that Jesus would do that.
[01:43:39.480 --> 01:43:42.680]   And yet Jesus listened very carefully
[01:43:42.680 --> 01:43:44.400]   and affirmed what he could affirm.
[01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:49.280]   Now, I think often in divided churches,
[01:43:49.280 --> 01:43:52.200]   like the ones that we're talking about tonight,
[01:43:52.200 --> 01:43:55.280]   we have to learn to really listen much more carefully.
[01:43:55.280 --> 01:43:59.340]   And often, not always, but often within the differences
[01:43:59.340 --> 01:44:02.320]   is a failure of really hearing the other person,
[01:44:02.320 --> 01:44:04.600]   really understanding why they're motivated,
[01:44:04.600 --> 01:44:07.880]   what it is that drives them, what their fears are,
[01:44:07.880 --> 01:44:10.400]   what controls their anxiety.
[01:44:10.400 --> 01:44:13.120]   Why are some people so insistent on holding on
[01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:15.000]   to certain forms of authority?
[01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:19.440]   And why do other people find it necessary,
[01:44:19.440 --> 01:44:21.480]   almost required for them
[01:44:21.480 --> 01:44:23.680]   to reject certain kinds of authority?
[01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:27.080]   Those are conversations that ultimately
[01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:29.000]   the body of Christ has to have,
[01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:32.640]   but we have to first be able to simply carry it out
[01:44:32.640 --> 01:44:34.880]   in a very respectful, mutual way.
[01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:37.640]   And that's gonna require that our hearts be remade.
[01:44:37.640 --> 01:44:40.000]   It's going to require, in Paul's language,
[01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.540]   that we be transformed by the renewing of our minds,
[01:44:42.540 --> 01:44:44.920]   that we have the heart of Christ
[01:44:44.920 --> 01:44:47.960]   and that we do not regard equality with God,
[01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:52.080]   that is taking our own prerogative and views as first order,
[01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:56.360]   but actually lay them down for the sake of loving
[01:44:56.360 --> 01:44:59.400]   and in some bizarre way,
[01:44:59.400 --> 01:45:02.840]   identifying with the person that we most disagree with.
[01:45:02.840 --> 01:45:06.460]   Those are just some small initial thoughts,
[01:45:06.460 --> 01:45:09.020]   but I think it's in that kind of direction
[01:45:09.020 --> 01:45:11.520]   that some of this work can be sustained.
[01:45:11.520 --> 01:45:13.080]   But as a pastor, we have to decide,
[01:45:13.080 --> 01:45:15.760]   and I was a pastor for 35 years
[01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:19.400]   before I became involved in formal theological education
[01:45:19.400 --> 01:45:20.580]   as I am now.
[01:45:20.580 --> 01:45:25.440]   And I was very, very aware every day as a pastor
[01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:28.840]   that it was about restoring community and communion.
[01:45:28.840 --> 01:45:30.880]   The word communion for me
[01:45:30.880 --> 01:45:33.840]   is one of the most valuable Christian words
[01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:35.680]   in the whole Christian vocabulary.
[01:45:35.680 --> 01:45:38.340]   And it's through that lens,
[01:45:38.340 --> 01:45:40.280]   communion with God, communion with one another,
[01:45:40.280 --> 01:45:44.800]   communion across the economic, social, political divides,
[01:45:44.800 --> 01:45:49.120]   that communion in Christ is meant to give us
[01:45:49.120 --> 01:45:54.120]   our ground on which to stand and build our lives.
[01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:58.160]   >> I think I do have something to add along this line
[01:45:58.160 --> 01:46:03.160]   from my experience with the mainline churches,
[01:46:03.160 --> 01:46:07.640]   because it's divided into the institutional
[01:46:07.640 --> 01:46:10.360]   and non-institutional churches.
[01:46:10.360 --> 01:46:11.200]   >> Yes.
[01:46:11.200 --> 01:46:15.240]   >> And I'm finding that this one major attitude
[01:46:15.240 --> 01:46:18.080]   that we need to have is to be humble
[01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:21.320]   and to know that in spite of all my conviction
[01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:25.560]   and understanding of truth, I don't have all the truth,
[01:46:25.560 --> 01:46:28.520]   that God is bigger and higher.
[01:46:28.520 --> 01:46:29.840]   >> Yes, yes.
[01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:34.840]   >> And I mean, if I know I have certain conviction
[01:46:34.840 --> 01:46:40.360]   that I'm following the right way in my choice,
[01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:44.560]   either it's institutional or non-institutional,
[01:46:44.560 --> 01:46:48.200]   but it's okay because I see the other party,
[01:46:48.200 --> 01:46:51.440]   the other churches as brothers and sisters
[01:46:51.440 --> 01:46:53.600]   and not as satanic work.
[01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:54.440]   >> Right, yes.
[01:46:54.440 --> 01:46:56.840]   >> So this is important.
[01:46:56.840 --> 01:47:01.840]   And another way, another solution is for me
[01:47:01.840 --> 01:47:05.640]   to be engaged together in some joint projects.
[01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:09.280]   Usually I find that some social projects is good,
[01:47:09.280 --> 01:47:13.880]   like some community work projects like that,
[01:47:14.160 --> 01:47:18.720]   together with people from different groups
[01:47:18.720 --> 01:47:22.080]   and denominations, they don't have denominations,
[01:47:22.080 --> 01:47:26.280]   but institutions, outside institutions.
[01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:29.400]   And if we work together, through living together,
[01:47:29.400 --> 01:47:31.560]   we come to appreciate what they have
[01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:33.800]   and what I don't have, okay?
[01:47:33.800 --> 01:47:34.640]   >> Right.
[01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:37.160]   >> And then by communing together,
[01:47:37.160 --> 01:47:41.160]   I think this is a way for us to soften our divide.
[01:47:41.160 --> 01:47:42.000]   >> Yes.
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.080]   >> And then I have to acknowledge that
[01:47:44.080 --> 01:47:45.560]   the divide is always there.
[01:47:45.560 --> 01:47:48.240]   I mean, I have no way to sort of--
[01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:49.720]   >> Right.
[01:47:49.720 --> 01:47:50.560]   You can't pretend.
[01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:55.520]   >> Yeah, I can't, I can't dissolve that, okay?
[01:47:55.520 --> 01:47:59.040]   But I can, to a certain extent,
[01:47:59.040 --> 01:48:04.040]   hold one another's arms and then we say
[01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:05.480]   that we can work together.
[01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:10.480]   And I always tell my friends that our enemies are outside,
[01:48:10.760 --> 01:48:12.160]   not inside this circle.
[01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:14.000]   >> Yes, right, thank you.
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.920]   >> So even though you mentioned,
[01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:20.400]   it's only your small initial thoughts,
[01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:23.400]   it takes a heart which is big
[01:48:23.400 --> 01:48:27.360]   and that can generate a large amount of courage
[01:48:27.360 --> 01:48:30.880]   and also so as to overcome a barrier
[01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:33.160]   which is as high as a mountain, actually.
[01:48:33.160 --> 01:48:35.040]   >> Right, right, that's the stuff.
[01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:38.520]   >> But we really appreciate that.
[01:48:39.600 --> 01:48:43.160]   And well, actually, this related,
[01:48:43.160 --> 01:48:46.800]   but not that political or maybe political,
[01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:50.000]   sexuality has become a political issue as well.
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.960]   So one of our faculty members raised this question.
[01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:57.160]   Suppose, so you are talking to
[01:48:57.160 --> 01:48:59.280]   the conservative white Christians
[01:48:59.280 --> 01:49:03.240]   who feel threatened by the LGBTQ movement,
[01:49:03.240 --> 01:49:04.440]   who feel that they are losing
[01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:06.680]   their once dominant social influence.
[01:49:06.680 --> 01:49:09.600]   So how would you encourage them to change?
[01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:14.480]   >> Well, I think it's along the very same lines
[01:49:14.480 --> 01:49:15.680]   that we were just discussing.
[01:49:15.680 --> 01:49:18.200]   I think it has to do with beginning first,
[01:49:18.200 --> 01:49:20.560]   not with theological assessments,
[01:49:20.560 --> 01:49:25.560]   but with interpersonal relationship building,
[01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:30.200]   letting people actually tell you their story.
[01:49:30.200 --> 01:49:33.000]   Often I find in settings like that,
[01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000]   this is less and less true by the way,
[01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:36.720]   but it has been true,
[01:49:36.720 --> 01:49:38.960]   that people didn't believe that they knew anyone
[01:49:38.960 --> 01:49:41.760]   who was LGBTQIA.
[01:49:41.760 --> 01:49:46.880]   They didn't have any idea where those people were,
[01:49:46.880 --> 01:49:48.160]   but they were not in their life.
[01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:50.760]   Well, it turns out, as more and more people
[01:49:50.760 --> 01:49:54.200]   have been willing to explain and declare who they are
[01:49:54.200 --> 01:49:57.600]   and how they approach the world,
[01:49:57.600 --> 01:50:00.240]   they are discovering that their children,
[01:50:00.240 --> 01:50:02.800]   their grandchildren, their neighbors,
[01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:07.800]   their friends, their colleagues may either be LGBTQ
[01:50:07.800 --> 01:50:12.640]   or they may be related to people who are.
[01:50:12.640 --> 01:50:14.960]   And when that occurs,
[01:50:14.960 --> 01:50:18.440]   it's a privilege to actually welcome the knowledge
[01:50:18.440 --> 01:50:22.080]   of who someone actually understands themselves to be.
[01:50:22.080 --> 01:50:26.600]   So even though I maintain myself a traditional view
[01:50:26.600 --> 01:50:30.720]   of the theological and moral understandings
[01:50:30.720 --> 01:50:35.120]   of human sexuality that have been classic in Christianity,
[01:50:35.120 --> 01:50:39.920]   I don't do so as a wall against LGBT people
[01:50:39.920 --> 01:50:43.440]   or as a battering ram to defeat them.
[01:50:43.440 --> 01:50:44.920]   I want to hear them.
[01:50:44.920 --> 01:50:46.120]   I want to know them.
[01:50:46.120 --> 01:50:47.440]   I want to love them.
[01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:51.080]   I want to invite them into communion with me
[01:50:51.080 --> 01:50:52.280]   and with other people.
[01:50:52.280 --> 01:50:54.520]   I want them to not be isolated.
[01:50:54.520 --> 01:50:57.480]   I want them to not be self-loathing.
[01:50:57.480 --> 01:51:00.680]   I want them to feel as much welcome
[01:51:00.680 --> 01:51:03.760]   as I can extend to them.
[01:51:03.760 --> 01:51:08.760]   And so I would encourage such a community, for example,
[01:51:08.760 --> 01:51:11.920]   to think carefully about who they really know
[01:51:11.920 --> 01:51:14.680]   and how they are going to love people.
[01:51:14.680 --> 01:51:17.520]   And I think every pastor has to work out
[01:51:17.520 --> 01:51:19.080]   in their own particular setting
[01:51:19.080 --> 01:51:22.880]   how they're going to help people
[01:51:22.880 --> 01:51:27.160]   do this kind of self-formational work.
[01:51:27.160 --> 01:51:28.560]   But it really has to begin
[01:51:28.560 --> 01:51:30.600]   by the same things we've just talked about,
[01:51:30.600 --> 01:51:33.600]   laying down power, laying down certainty,
[01:51:33.600 --> 01:51:35.280]   laying down self-righteousness,
[01:51:35.280 --> 01:51:38.040]   not righteousness, but self-righteousness,
[01:51:38.040 --> 01:51:42.720]   laying down a presumption of a theological exam
[01:51:42.720 --> 01:51:44.920]   at the very beginning or a moral exam
[01:51:44.920 --> 01:51:46.960]   at the beginning of every relationship,
[01:51:46.960 --> 01:51:49.320]   which is not the way that any of us, in fact,
[01:51:49.320 --> 01:51:53.720]   actually live, nor would we want to live that way.
[01:51:53.720 --> 01:51:55.160]   So we want to know one another.
[01:51:55.160 --> 01:51:57.360]   We want to love one another.
[01:51:57.360 --> 01:51:59.200]   And there may be differences, of course.
[01:51:59.200 --> 01:52:02.040]   There are differences in how we see the world
[01:52:02.040 --> 01:52:04.200]   and relate to one another.
[01:52:04.200 --> 01:52:08.360]   But I want to start with, as Dr. Chan said,
[01:52:08.360 --> 01:52:11.000]   I want to start with an attitude of humility
[01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:12.640]   and of deference.
[01:52:12.640 --> 01:52:14.800]   I want to listen very, very carefully.
[01:52:14.800 --> 01:52:17.080]   I want to hear their story.
[01:52:17.080 --> 01:52:20.200]   I want to understand and empathize
[01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:23.960]   with the way that their story has unfolded.
[01:52:23.960 --> 01:52:26.160]   Now, I believe that all of our stories
[01:52:26.160 --> 01:52:29.400]   are held by a larger story that's God's story.
[01:52:29.400 --> 01:52:34.240]   So eventually, in some way, verbal and nonverbal both,
[01:52:34.240 --> 01:52:39.480]   I want to help people who are LGBTQ2,
[01:52:39.480 --> 01:52:42.560]   if they don't already,
[01:52:42.560 --> 01:52:44.200]   understand how to hold their story
[01:52:44.200 --> 01:52:47.440]   in light of the greater story of God.
[01:52:47.440 --> 01:52:49.480]   That's a longer and more theological question,
[01:52:49.480 --> 01:52:51.320]   but on the pastoral level,
[01:52:51.320 --> 01:52:53.520]   I think it has to do with inviting people
[01:52:53.520 --> 01:52:57.160]   into honesty, into their own vulnerability,
[01:52:57.160 --> 01:53:00.200]   into their places of pain and shame,
[01:53:00.200 --> 01:53:02.960]   and say, "Can you imagine what it's like
[01:53:02.960 --> 01:53:07.000]   to live in a community in which those realities
[01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000]   are reinforced by the church?"
[01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.360]   People feel worse about themselves.
[01:53:11.360 --> 01:53:14.520]   People feel more marginalized about themselves
[01:53:14.520 --> 01:53:18.160]   by the way the church has related to LGBT people.
[01:53:18.160 --> 01:53:21.400]   And frequently, the church has been a failure
[01:53:21.400 --> 01:53:24.160]   in loving people who don't live up
[01:53:24.160 --> 01:53:29.400]   to what we believe are biblical standards, perhaps.
[01:53:29.400 --> 01:53:31.240]   -I'm deeply struck by your comment
[01:53:31.240 --> 01:53:35.720]   that it is a matter about loving and respecting your neighbors
[01:53:35.720 --> 01:53:38.880]   as creating an image of God.
[01:53:38.880 --> 01:53:41.720]   It's not about warring or battling
[01:53:41.720 --> 01:53:45.280]   for theological or ideological correctness.
[01:53:45.280 --> 01:53:49.320]   So this is a very important thing to remember, actually.
[01:53:49.320 --> 01:53:52.360]   And maybe another question,
[01:53:52.360 --> 01:53:56.080]   or perhaps that will be the one last question.
[01:53:56.080 --> 01:53:58.240]   Dr. Levitin, you talked about the influence
[01:53:58.240 --> 01:54:01.040]   from the media in the 1990s.
[01:54:01.040 --> 01:54:04.560]   So could you comment on the impacts on the social media
[01:54:04.560 --> 01:54:07.720]   in white evangelicals?
[01:54:07.720 --> 01:54:10.920]   -Yes. Well, it's, of course, a problem,
[01:54:10.920 --> 01:54:13.680]   as I would say it, at least all around the world,
[01:54:13.680 --> 01:54:17.600]   or at least in places where social media dominance
[01:54:17.600 --> 01:54:20.840]   controls things, as social media does dominate things
[01:54:20.840 --> 01:54:22.440]   in the United States.
[01:54:22.440 --> 01:54:25.120]   So you have public media of various kinds,
[01:54:25.120 --> 01:54:26.920]   but then you have just the social media
[01:54:26.920 --> 01:54:30.640]   and all the networks and communication of messages,
[01:54:30.640 --> 01:54:33.480]   which can be used as battering rams.
[01:54:33.480 --> 01:54:36.320]   And this is why it has been such a big deal
[01:54:36.320 --> 01:54:38.920]   in the last few days,
[01:54:38.920 --> 01:54:42.880]   since Twitter no longer allowed President Trump
[01:54:42.880 --> 01:54:48.040]   to be able to post his declarations of various kinds,
[01:54:48.040 --> 01:54:51.760]   as you've probably pleasantly experienced
[01:54:51.760 --> 01:54:53.360]   or seen or heard about.
[01:54:53.360 --> 01:54:57.000]   And he has a following on Twitter
[01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.480]   of something like 84 million people.
[01:54:59.480 --> 01:55:06.280]   So he would typically tweet,
[01:55:06.280 --> 01:55:08.560]   you know, usually several dozen messages
[01:55:08.560 --> 01:55:12.880]   over the course of a day, to 84 million people.
[01:55:12.880 --> 01:55:15.520]   So let's just imagine he was the only person
[01:55:15.520 --> 01:55:18.320]   that was engaging in social media.
[01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:19.640]   It would be a dominant voice.
[01:55:19.640 --> 01:55:21.800]   But because of how it's picked up and distributed
[01:55:21.800 --> 01:55:25.080]   and spread throughout network upon network
[01:55:25.080 --> 01:55:28.880]   upon network upon network, it just pervades our lives.
[01:55:28.880 --> 01:55:32.880]   And it is one of the major, I would say,
[01:55:32.880 --> 01:55:37.080]   toxicities that now influences the life of the church,
[01:55:37.080 --> 01:55:44.320]   which can't possibly compete with the overwhelming amount
[01:55:44.320 --> 01:55:46.560]   of social media presence and power
[01:55:46.560 --> 01:55:48.400]   that's influencing people's lives.
[01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:50.520]   We used to say it was television.
[01:55:50.520 --> 01:55:52.560]   It's less television, of course, now.
[01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:54.680]   And it's really the Internet
[01:55:54.680 --> 01:55:57.120]   and it's really social media in particular.
[01:55:57.120 --> 01:56:00.600]   And that makes Christian discipleship that much harder.
[01:56:00.600 --> 01:56:05.160]   So, yeah, I think it's an example of the fact
[01:56:05.160 --> 01:56:08.160]   that the American church has come to be dominated
[01:56:08.160 --> 01:56:10.360]   more by social media voices
[01:56:10.360 --> 01:56:15.680]   than by the faithful word of God preached on Sunday,
[01:56:15.680 --> 01:56:17.240]   encouraged in home,
[01:56:17.240 --> 01:56:19.560]   nurtured by individual discipleship,
[01:56:19.560 --> 01:56:21.440]   shared in small groups, right?
[01:56:21.440 --> 01:56:23.560]   These are things that can't compete
[01:56:23.560 --> 01:56:27.240]   against the ocean of social media.
[01:56:27.240 --> 01:56:28.960]   So I think it's a huge challenge
[01:56:28.960 --> 01:56:32.920]   and an example of the white evangelical church's willingness
[01:56:32.920 --> 01:56:36.400]   to just give that ground and to believe that all of that
[01:56:36.400 --> 01:56:39.680]   is one thing and then the church
[01:56:39.680 --> 01:56:43.800]   and its pleasant message is on another.
[01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:45.480]   And the two don't meet,
[01:56:45.480 --> 01:56:48.840]   and the radical Jesus of transformation
[01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:51.040]   and redemption is lost.
[01:56:51.040 --> 01:56:56.680]   - I hope today we are redeeming the social media
[01:56:56.680 --> 01:57:00.600]   by broadcasting something of positive value.
[01:57:00.600 --> 01:57:05.360]   And also, yeah, we hope that all those
[01:57:05.360 --> 01:57:09.000]   who are listening to Dr. Leperton's
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:13.560]   and our two response speakers' speeches will be enlightened.
[01:57:13.560 --> 01:57:16.720]   And we wholeheartedly look forward
[01:57:16.720 --> 01:57:18.520]   to the coming three lectures,
[01:57:18.520 --> 01:57:22.240]   which Dr. Leperton will be giving in the coming three days.
[01:57:22.240 --> 01:57:25.560]   And once again, a big round of applause
[01:57:25.560 --> 01:57:27.160]   for our three speakers today.
[01:57:27.160 --> 01:57:29.560]   - Thank you.
[01:57:30.320 --> 01:57:32.560]   (audience applauding)
[01:57:32.560 --> 01:57:34.040]   - And today- - Can I say one thing?
[01:57:34.040 --> 01:57:35.320]   - Yes, yeah, sure.
[01:57:35.320 --> 01:57:39.000]   - The difficulty of speaking on this subject
[01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:42.840]   is that I arrive in your presence with this terrible news.
[01:57:42.840 --> 01:57:47.840]   It feels like I've arrived with a very dark cloud.
[01:57:47.840 --> 01:57:51.280]   And I just wanna assure you,
[01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:53.560]   A, that that's not all that I think about,
[01:57:53.560 --> 01:57:56.160]   but B, there's all kinds of reasons
[01:57:56.160 --> 01:57:57.720]   for celebration and gladness
[01:57:57.720 --> 01:57:59.520]   in both the life of the church,
[01:57:59.520 --> 01:58:02.400]   including even the white evangelical church.
[01:58:02.400 --> 01:58:05.080]   But there are, this is a critical moment.
[01:58:05.080 --> 01:58:07.160]   I can't overstate that.
[01:58:07.160 --> 01:58:08.760]   And I am grateful for the chance
[01:58:08.760 --> 01:58:10.480]   to be able to talk with you.
[01:58:10.480 --> 01:58:12.360]   But I also want to encourage you,
[01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:14.280]   as I wanna encourage myself,
[01:58:14.280 --> 01:58:16.640]   to always remember the greater story
[01:58:16.640 --> 01:58:20.520]   of God's grace and love and mercy for us,
[01:58:20.520 --> 01:58:22.320]   the white evangelical church in America,
[01:58:22.320 --> 01:58:24.440]   for the church in Hong Kong and in China,
[01:58:24.440 --> 01:58:27.240]   and around the world.
[01:58:27.240 --> 01:58:30.600]   And so I feel like I'm giving you
[01:58:30.600 --> 01:58:35.120]   a very strange impression by speaking so critically.
[01:58:35.120 --> 01:58:37.680]   But because it's such an unusual moment,
[01:58:37.680 --> 01:58:41.720]   I am also grateful to be able to speak this honestly,
[01:58:41.720 --> 01:58:45.760]   and I hope it can be heard in that way.
[01:58:45.760 --> 01:58:47.360]   So thank you again.
[01:58:47.360 --> 01:58:49.560]   - Don't worry, Dr. Labusin.
[01:58:49.560 --> 01:58:51.200]   You have brought us a dark cloud,
[01:58:51.200 --> 01:58:54.960]   but actually we are under a massive thunderstorm,
[01:58:54.960 --> 01:58:57.080]   actually, here in Hong Kong as well.
[01:58:57.080 --> 01:59:01.080]   So, but I think taking an honest look
[01:59:01.080 --> 01:59:03.840]   at what the church and also the faith,
[01:59:03.840 --> 01:59:05.720]   our faith responses,
[01:59:05.720 --> 01:59:07.480]   actually you have given us hope
[01:59:07.480 --> 01:59:11.920]   that the gleam of light, of hope is coming,
[01:59:11.920 --> 01:59:14.080]   is on the way, is still always there.
[01:59:14.080 --> 01:59:15.480]   Thank you very much again.
[01:59:15.480 --> 01:59:17.480]   And thank you for joining us today.
[01:59:17.480 --> 01:59:21.720]   Okay, and I will see you, many of you, tomorrow again.
[01:59:21.720 --> 01:59:22.560]   Bye-bye.
[01:59:22.560 --> 01:59:23.400]   - Thank you.
[01:59:23.400 --> 01:59:26.480]   (gentle piano music)
[01:59:26.480 --> 01:59:29.560]   (gentle piano music)
[01:59:29.560 --> 01:59:32.640]   (gentle piano music)
[01:59:32.640 --> 01:59:35.720]   (gentle piano music)
[01:59:35.720 --> 01:59:38.800]   (gentle piano music)
[01:59:38.800 --> 01:59:41.880]   (gentle piano music)
[01:59:41.880 --> 01:59:44.460]   (gentle music)
