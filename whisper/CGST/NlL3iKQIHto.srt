(音樂)

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Good morning or good evening everyone

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Depending on where you are

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Welcome to the final day of

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
CGST Josephine's Soul Culture and Ethics lecture week

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I am Esther Xue

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Assistant Professor of Biblical Studies

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We are so honored to have

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
our keynote speaker Dr. Labberton

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
with us at the start of 2021

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
via this virtual platform

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Besides he is known as president of

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Fuller Theological Seminary

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Dr. Labberton also serves in several

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
significant world ministry institutions

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Particularly he is known as

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
leadership with scholar leaders

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
international and John Stott ministry

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
NATI's Lindheim partners

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Actually I can survive through my PhD

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
partly because I have been supported

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
spiritually and financially

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
by these two institutions

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Thanks Dr. Labberton

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I believe we were so inspired

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
by your fruitful lectures

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
in the past three days

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You have clearly shown the cultural locations

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
and the key factors of the crisis

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
of American white evangelicalism

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And your reflections on them

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
shed light on the situation of Hong Kong

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
or Chinese evangelical churches

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Well, after the crisis

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
finally we move forward

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
to today's topic on hope

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Please join with me to welcome Dr. Labberton

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
to present on evangelicalism

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
still or not yet

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
to explore how the crisis of

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
American white evangelicalism requires

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
the restoration its soul

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
by discovering its source and hope

44
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Thank you very much

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I appreciate again being here

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I have been very warmly welcomed

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
by all of you and I'm grateful for that

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I want to say again my special thanks

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
to your president Dr. Stephen Lee

50
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
for the invitation to come

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
and be part of these lectures

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
And I look forward I hope to one day

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
being able to visit CGST in person again

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's a community that I have had

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
connection with for over 30 years

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And I'm extremely grateful for your ministry

57
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
and for your life together

58
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm aware of the significant challenges

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
that many churches throughout Asia

60
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
and particularly in Hong Kong

61
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
are facing these days

62
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And therefore my own particular gratitude

63
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
for your willingness to allow me

64
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
to be part of your conversation

65
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And I hope and pray as I have from the beginning

66
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
that these days together

67
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
will be useful to you

68
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So the title of this final lecture

69
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
as we've heard is Evangelicalism

70
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Still or Not Yet

71
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You'll notice in the English spelling of this

72
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
that there's a hyphenation

73
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
between evangel and icalism

74
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And one of the arguments that I want to make

75
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
is represented by that simple construct

76
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
that is that it's the evangel

77
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Jesus and the kingdom of God

78
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
which is central

79
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Icalism names a movement

80
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
a body of people

81
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
a set of cultural practices

82
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
and theological and spiritual

83
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
and ethical stances

84
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
that have been taken in light of the gospel

85
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
But I want to argue tonight

86
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
that our hope is found in thinking again

87
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
about the evangel

88
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
and letting that be what defines

89
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
who we are and how we live in the world

90
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So let me begin then by saying this

91
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
If there's going to be hope

92
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
which I definitely believe there is

93
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Our American evangelical

94
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
is going to find it by claiming

95
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
that we are "still evangelical"

96
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
or asking the question

97
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Are we yet evangelical?

98
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
In the first construct

99
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Are we still evangelical?

100
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The claim can often be

101
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
that it's like a destination

102
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
at which some have already arrived

103
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
or a trajectory, by contrast

104
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
a direction, but by no means yet reached

105
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
If we're claiming that we're still evangelical

106
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
it seems to me that we're in danger

107
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
of claiming that we have arrived

108
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
and that we need to hold on

109
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
to the terrain that was defended

110
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
and claimed before

111
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
But if we ask the question

112
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Are we yet evangelical?

113
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
We're asking

114
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Is our life and our ministry

115
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
individually, personally and institutionally

116
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
is it a reflection of the evangel itself?

117
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
That puts us on a very, very different trajectory

118
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
In other words, is evangelical an identity

119
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
that we claim like a badge

120
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
that we could put on our chest?

121
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Or is evangelicalism an invitation?

122
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Is evangelical mission

123
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
an exercise in dominion

124
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
with territory claimed

125
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
and a flag firmly planted?

126
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Or is evangelical mission

127
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
a witness to the invitation

128
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
to find life in the kingdom of God

129
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
and to become part of a new community

130
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
that seeks to be an embodied reflection

131
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
of Jesus Christ?

132
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
To pose these binary alternatives

133
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
reflects the ways that I find

134
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
aspects of American evangelicalism

135
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
to be tragic and offensive

136
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
to the gospel itself

137
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Encroaching on the unique supremacy

138
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
and authority of Jesus

139
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
is sadly a deceptive duplicity

140
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
that subverts the primary

141
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
and the primacy and character of Jesus

142
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
and supplants it with American culture

143
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
dressed in gospel garb, gospel clothing

144
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It can make the sounds of the gospel

145
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
while it lives a different and divergent story

146
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Of course it must be said

147
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
that no expression of the gospel

148
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
is free from compromise

149
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
and human distortion

150
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And in Romans, or rather in Matthew 28

151
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
it is an astonishing thing

152
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
that Jesus gives the great commission

153
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
that we call the mission

154
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
that defines the mission of God's people in the world

155
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
to 11 disciples, the text points out

156
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
not the perfect number 12, but just to 11

157
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And the text says that some believed and some doubted

158
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And in Greek it's that some believed and doubted

159
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It's that the same people both believed and doubted

160
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
The church is always fewer numbers than we would hope

161
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And it's always far from being the true and

162
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
doubtless people that we might imagine

163
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
To Jesus, this band of 11 believer doubters

164
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
11 believer doubters

165
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
This band was the right group

166
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
to be God's witnesses to nothing less

167
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
than the hope of the world

168
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
This is all part of the shocking evangel

169
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
God's redeeming love and justice in Jesus Christ

170
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
should ground and define a new communion

171
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
or community of disciples

172
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
on a journey of transformation

173
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
If the question is not still evangelical

174
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
but rather yet evangelical

175
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
then American white evangelicalism

176
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
could begin the kind of reset

177
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
that only the evangel itself offers

178
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Some of the primary elements of

179
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Bebbington's quadrilateral depiction of evangelicalism

180
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
which we discussed earlier

181
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
could contribute to the reclamation and recreation

182
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
of American white evangelicalism

183
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
So let me begin by making several points

184
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
The first is this

185
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
The hope for American white evangelicalism

186
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
lies in the evangel

187
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It does not lie in evangelicalism

188
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
The hope of evangelicalism in America

189
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
is born by the evangel

190
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
not by evangelicalism itself

191
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
The hope is not that the icalism of evangelicalism

192
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
past or present, that is not our hope

193
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Agendas, personalities, structures, assumptions

194
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
prerogatives cloud and encrust the evangel

195
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
and attach to it like barnacles

196
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:54,000
to some kind of port

197
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
The icalisms encase God's living word

198
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
inside a particular set of language games

199
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,000
regarding abortion, human sexuality, race, gender

200
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
mannerliness, control and doctrine

201
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So around the evangel, in other words

202
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
are these barnacles or these attachments

203
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
that are claiming that they are

204
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
virtually equal to the evangel itself

205
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
A similar set of religious codes

206
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
conscripted first century Israel

207
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It was into that context

208
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
that Jesus announced the arrival of the kingdom of heaven

209
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
or the kingdom of God

210
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
and called unlikely disciples

211
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
and generously taught and healed

212
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Jew and Gentile, righteous and unrighteous alike

213
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Jesus embodied a scandal

214
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
that refused the boundaries of acceptability

215
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
that confronted the abusive control of Sabbath keeping

216
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
that honored the good Samaritan

217
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
and that saw in the faith of a Roman centurion

218
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
a faith that exceeded that which he had seen

219
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
in all of Israel

220
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
In other words, Jesus subverts the practices

221
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
and claims of dominion and nationalism

222
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
and individualism and agency and fear

223
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
not least those things done in the name of God

224
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
All of this meant paring away

225
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
what was assumed to be primary

226
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
in order to actually hear what was primary

227
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
the good news that was and is truly good

228
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
because of Jesus Christ

229
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
American white evangelicals need the evangelism

230
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
the evangel to save us from ourselves

231
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
We need to be delivered, rescued from evangelicalism

232
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Upsetting the money changers in the temple

233
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
seems like the right picture

234
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
We stand inside the faith

235
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
but we in one sense or another

236
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
need the faith that has been practiced

237
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
to be overthrown

238
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Procuring and providing implements of worship

239
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
but distorting and distracting people from true worship

240
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
was the problem in the temple

241
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
When Jesus flips the tables

242
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
and calls them thieves and a den of robbers

243
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
He exposes what had been unassailable

244
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
and it changes everything

245
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,000
about identity, power, money, control and more

246
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It was a religious, social and economic system

247
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
that was being dismantled at that moment

248
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
as well as confronted

249
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Is it too much to believe

250
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
that American white evangelicalism

251
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
is in need of the same confrontation

252
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
The purpose is not deserved judgment

253
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
but instead the discovery of the good news

254
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,000
again and as it were for the first time

255
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
The evangelicals need to be converted

256
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
back to the evangel

257
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
The presumptions of evangelicals

258
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
undermines the ability

259
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
to allow the good news

260
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
to do its fundamental confrontation

261
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:38,000
conviction, repentance, lament and reconstruction

262
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Zacchaeus got this to the core

263
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
and it changed his inner life

264
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
and his public life

265
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It meant tangible actions of reparation

266
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
in place of acts

267
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
that up to that point

268
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
had been all about self-preservation

269
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
He got the word Jesus was making

270
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
that Jesus was making all things new

271
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
and that meant all of him

272
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
for the sake of all who were around him

273
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
As evangelicals we are known

274
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
for talking conversion

275
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
but we do not necessarily

276
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
practice it ourselves

277
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
The ongoing work of letting

278
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
the actual evangel be our life

279
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
is not the same as living

280
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
inside evangelical culture

281
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Allowing Jesus Christ to confront

282
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
and to break American evangelicalism

283
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
of its distractions and its idols

284
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
would be essential for its revival

285
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Do we need a road to Damascus confrontation?

286
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Saul was after all so assured

287
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
that his spiritual, theological

288
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
and political pedigree were in place

289
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Dominion, nationalism, identity, agency

290
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
and fear were in full flight

291
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And then on the road to Damascus

292
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
the risen Christ confronts him

293
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
when he is right in the middle

294
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
of his own self-righteous crusade

295
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
with a life-redefining question

296
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,000
"Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?"

297
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Cast down and blinded for three days

298
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
but also fed and kept by God's provision

299
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
And then he was unexpectedly welcomed

300
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
by the touch of Ananias' words

301
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
"Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus

302
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
who appeared to you on the road

303
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
by which you came has sent me

304
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
so that you may regain your sight

305
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:59,000
and be filled with the Holy Spirit."

306
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
What confronts and redeems Saul

307
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
is the evangel, it's not evangelicalism

308
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Through his blindness, through later

309
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
13 years of study and reflection

310
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Paul lives as a mature

311
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
and perfect reflection

312
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
of an unexpected evangel

313
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
that was still in the process

314
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,000
of making him, Paul, new

315
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
American white evangelicalism

316
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
needs to hear and receive

317
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Jesus' confronting question

318
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
"Why do you make my good news

319
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
look and sound so bad?"

320
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
We need the evangel to rescue us

321
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
The next point is this

322
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
that American white evangelical

323
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
needs the evangel

324
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,000
to help evangelicalism die

325
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
The apostle's birthright, his personal pride

326
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
his persecuting dominion

327
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
over Jesus' followers

328
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
his religious stature

329
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
as a Pharisee of Pharisees

330
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
his political identity

331
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
as a Roman citizen

332
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
had to become, as he says in Philippians

333
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
"dumb"

334
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It was this dismantling of Saul

335
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
that allowed him to become Paul

336
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
The mark of his conversion

337
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
was not in holding on to the prerogatives

338
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
and privileges of which he had

339
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
so understandably been proud

340
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
while learning to profess Jesus

341
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Rather, his proud religious life

342
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
his public life

343
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
had to die

344
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
so the new life in Christ

345
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
could be born

346
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Laying down his trophies

347
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
to identify, as he says

348
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
with the fellowship of Christ's sufferings

349
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
led Paul to speak and embody

350
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
an entirely different life

351
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
completely unlike the life

352
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
that he had led before

353
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
his conversion on the Damascus Road

354
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
and the events that followed

355
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
The success of American white evangelicalism

356
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
has exposed, ironically, its failure

357
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
By choosing to pursue the road of victory

358
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
that has not led to human, ecclesial

359
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
or social thriving

360
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
for American white evangelicalism

361
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
But too often, as we've explored

362
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
to a barren and shameful display

363
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
of self-serving appetites

364
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
and self-protective interests

365
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
This is hardly a mirror of the Lord

366
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
that we claim to trust and follow

367
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
American white evangelicalism

368
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
is a part of the body of Christ

369
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
that cannot be remade without dying

370
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
to significant elements of our common life

371
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
The death that is needed

372
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
must confront its idolatrous assumptions

373
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
as we've thought about communion

374
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
about dominion, nationalism and individualism

375
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
about whiteness and agency and fear

376
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
These are the primary posts

377
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
that define the broken and scandalous architecture

378
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
within which American white evangelicalism

379
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
has been built

380
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Life in Christ cannot thrive

381
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
in this prison of privilege

382
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
These things are a betrayal

383
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
of an evangelistic life

384
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
and they substitute human categories

385
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
and privileges

386
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
that are bent against the humble purposes

387
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
of God's redemptive reign

388
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Failure to put these things to death

389
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
exposes their power

390
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
and our false allegiance

391
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
No wonder American churches

392
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
are being vacated by young adults

393
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
and teenagers

394
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
who fail to see a basic integrity

395
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
of life that matches faith

396
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Why should these young people not leave?

397
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
When we make them the problem

398
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
that is the young adults and teenagers

399
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
and fail to see that we

400
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
that is the holders of the treasures

401
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
of white evangelicalism in America

402
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
that we are the problem

403
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
the scale of the crisis only grows darker

404
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
We fail to see what we have to first admit

405
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
so that we can be changed

406
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
If for example

407
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
American white evangelicalism

408
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
had truly repented

409
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
of its deep complicity in racism

410
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
and its participation in centuries

411
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
of torturous and abusive slavery

412
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
that would utterly change

413
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
what has become the nearly impossible

414
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
conversation today

415
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
about reparations

416
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
that is paying back in some way

417
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
the people who are descendants of slaves

418
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
This willingness

419
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
of course our secular nation

420
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
is not interested in that

421
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
But the people of God

422
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
would it not be the natural outcome

423
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
of a true dying to the offense

424
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
and scandal of slavery

425
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
and the contemporary entanglements

426
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
with racism and white supremacy

427
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
for at least the people of God

428
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
in the 21st century

429
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
to work on behalf of appropriate reparations

430
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
for slaves' descendants

431
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Perhaps reparations from the nation

432
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
may not come

433
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
But for the role of American white evangelicals

434
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
to raise reparations for their role

435
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
in the defense and benefit from slavery

436
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
The promises of Zakiya echo

437
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Look Lord, here and now

438
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I give half of my positions to the poor

439
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
And if I cheated anybody out of anything

440
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I will pay back four times the amount

441
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Jesus said to him

442
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Today salvation has come to this house

443
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Because this man too

444
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Is a son of Abraham

445
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
For the Son of Man came to seek

446
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
And to save the lost

447
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
What is the point of American white evangelicals

448
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Defending and arguing against

449
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
The witness of black and brown Christians

450
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
And others in the United States

451
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Who testify to suffering

452
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Because of whiteness in general

453
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
And Christian whiteness in particular

454
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Would not a spiritual humility

455
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Empower God's people

456
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
To seek the truth

457
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
To name reality

458
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
To take responsibility

459
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
To confess wrong

460
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
To repent

461
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
And to truly start again

462
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
It is hard to find this

463
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
As a deep track in the history of the world

464
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Of the American white evangelical church

465
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,000
It has not profoundly and pervasively happened

466
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
And the proof lies in the ongoing legitimacy

467
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Of the Christian movement

468
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
That can so appropriately be labeled

469
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
American white evangelicalism

470
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
That total phrase would never be needed

471
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
If the American church

472
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
White evangelical church had responded

473
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
The unnamed but ever-present reality of whiteness

474
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Shows the willingness of millions of Christian people

475
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
To die to their cultural and racial privilege

476
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
White evangelicals profess that dying leads to living

477
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
But that is true

478
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Only if we live are dying

479
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
The next point is this

480
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
That the death of American white evangelicalism

481
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Could actually be its birth

482
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Revivals are typically defined

483
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
By church historians as a combination of two

484
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Simultaneous factors

485
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Evidence both of personal transformation

486
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
And of social transformation

487
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
The need for each contributes to the necessity of the other

488
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
The admission that personal change is required

489
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
In order to produce social change

490
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
And social change without personal change

491
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,000
May be too superficial to make enduring change last

492
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Let's hypothetically imagine

493
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
That the portrait of American white evangelicalism

494
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
That I've given you

495
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Is sufficiently accurate to bring many to their knees

496
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
And by God's grace to usher in a revival

497
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Of a deep and transformative kind

498
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Please join me in an imaginary exercise

499
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Of how a story of revival in America

500
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Not of secular and multi-religious society that America is

501
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
But of the American white evangelicals themselves

502
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
The story might read like this

503
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Dateline January 2020 or even better now January 2021

504
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
American white evangelicals in several cities and towns

505
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Are showing themselves in an entirely new way

506
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,000
In place of their typically proud and adamant rhetoric of confidence

507
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,000
We are hearing now new voices with an entirely different tone

508
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Rather than them pointing blame at others

509
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
These evangelicals are realizing the responsibilities

510
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
That they have failed to practice

511
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Quietly at first

512
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
But now building in congregations and other gatherings

513
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,000
This community that we have heard from with such stridency

514
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Is now making confession

515
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
People who described themselves previously

516
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
As unwilling to hear and accept the experience of others

517
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Especially others who do not share their racial social background

518
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Are normally listening to their brothers and sisters of color

519
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,000
It's like they are actually hearing these stories for the first time

520
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
The report could go on perhaps like this

521
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Immigrants seeking justice

522
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Having had their child taken from them and caged before

523
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Are telling their stories

524
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
And in place of defending borders

525
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
And denying compassion and care for vulnerable people

526
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
American white evangelicals are at the borders weeping

527
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
And acknowledging the fears that have kept them so angry

528
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:57,000
And defensive that they would want to keep other people out

529
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Gatherings of white evangelicals the report might go on

530
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Are now happening at the southern US border

531
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
And people who fought for the wall to be built

532
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Are now lamenting at the suffering that they have helped cause

533
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
They are gathering with Latino leaders in different parts of the country

534
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
They are trying to start over in hearing the stories

535
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
And grasping the injustice perpetrated against Latinos

536
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Too often previously unsupported by white evangelicals

537
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
But now supported and cared for

538
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
The report could go on

539
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Tours of the sites of lynchings against black men and women in America in the past

540
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Are now being swamped by gatherings of white evangelicals

541
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
As are some of the primary sites of the Underground Railroad

542
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
And of the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s

543
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Reading groups seem to be springing up everywhere

544
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,000
In towns and cities and in evangelical white churches

545
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Who are listening to the profound words of Frederick Douglass

546
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
And W.E.B. Du Bois and of Martin Luther King

547
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
And of Ruby Bridges and of Fannie Lou Hamer

548
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:24,000
And of James Baldwin and of Malcolm X and of Ta-Nehisi Coates

549
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
These are all African Americans in America

550
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Publishers are reporting significant increases the report would go on

551
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
In the sales of such writers

552
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
And the prominence of these voices is finally continuing to grow

553
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:45,000
It is like something that was never really seen or understood or trusted

554
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Is now front and center in American evangelical circles

555
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
What's more than this

556
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Is that there are scenes of home and community gatherings

557
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Just for confession

558
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
People are admitting the ways that they've defended themselves

559
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
And rejected the voices of others who are not like them

560
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
A related but different movement seems to be developing in churches

561
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
That have treated women as second-class people

562
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
And likewise need to be repented of

563
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
They are being invited by their male pastors to tell their stories with trust

564
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,000
So these women's voices can now be heard and believed

565
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
And where actions are needed, including legal action

566
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:35,000
They will take such steps and where appropriate, admit their complicity

567
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
The theme of those that we have met

568
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Is that what is happening is personal, the report would go on

569
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
But also institutional

570
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
People realize that it is not just about a change of hearts and minds

571
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
But about changes in the structures and habits of our public lives

572
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
That need to be changed as well

573
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
This feels revolutionary

574
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
A black pastor and a Latino leader

575
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Said this was deeper and broader than they have ever seen it before

576
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
It is not measured at this point, they said, by demonstrations

577
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:15,000
But by gatherings or services of confession and lament and healing

578
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Led by black, Latino and Asian leaders of their churches

579
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Stay tuned for more

580
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Now this little imaginary exercise of mine is not a pure dream

581
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Such things are happening among some American white evangelicals

582
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
But by too small a percentage

583
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Only a deep work of the Spirit of God

584
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Would make it possible for such events to develop

585
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:56,000
As an organic reset of American white evangelicalism

586
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I share this dream with gospel hope

587
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
But also with deep sorrow

588
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I think Jesus is the one who weeps over Washington, D.C. in recent weeks

589
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Or New York or Boston

590
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Chicago or Los Angeles

591
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
And wants to see revival

592
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
God's fulfillment will come

593
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
But we are in the already and not yet in between

594
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Following the one in Jesus Christ who is with us on a long journey

595
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Which is never complete in this life

596
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Where faith will finally become sight

597
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
And where we see fully and no longer

598
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Through a glass darkly

599
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
We are given confidence but not certainty

600
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
We are straining on at this point

601
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
But not yet arrived

602
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
We live in trust

603
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
For what we have not yet fully seen

604
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Let's do something more modest if nonetheless profound

605
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
After more than two decades of ministry

606
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Surrounded by the University of California, Berkeley

607
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I can say that it is an icon of secularism in America

608
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I was there serving as a pastor in Berkeley

609
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Surrounded by the campus

610
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
And I very seldom found people unwilling to engage

611
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
With issues and debates of religious meaning

612
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
As long as there was room for mystery and humility

613
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,000
For an acknowledgment of unfinishedness

614
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
And uncertainty

615
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Christian faculty at the University of California, Berkeley

616
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:47,000
They may not have had an easy time communicating with colleagues and students

617
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
About how to understand the world through the lens of the Bible

618
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,000
But even so, it was imaginable if two things were present

619
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,000
If the professor gave true evidence of genuine humility

620
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
And second, if they gave evidence of an honest life

621
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Consistent with a complicated world

622
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
In the midst of their profession of faith

623
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:21,000
If either humility or true action of honesty and candor were absent

624
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
The result from students would be derision

625
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
In the presence of both of these things

626
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
There could be debate

627
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
But there could also be respectful silence

628
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I remember one time when there were huge campus demonstrations

629
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
On the campus of the University of California, Berkeley

630
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
That were largely led by Jewish students

631
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Against what they saw as Islamic fascism

632
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
And on the central plaza of the campus

633
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
There had been daily gatherings during this one week

634
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Of thousands of students

635
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
From Monday to Friday

636
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
On the Friday of that week

637
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
During the last day of demonstrations

638
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
A remarkable undergraduate

639
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Who was a white evangelical woman that I know

640
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
A student who had been present

641
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
To support and encourage the dialogue between Jews and Muslims

642
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Took the microphone in the closing moments

643
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
As the sun was beginning to go down over the plaza

644
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
She was known by people there

645
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
And she was known as a Christian

646
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
But she had credibility

647
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
To be able to say to the audience of Jews

648
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
How grateful, and Muslims, how grateful she had been

649
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
For the week of dialogue

650
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
As passionate as it had been

651
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
And then she surprised everyone

652
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
By unexpectedly asking a group of Jews and Muslims

653
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
A very straightforward question

654
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
She simply said

655
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Please raise your hand

656
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,000
If you believe that Jesus was the Son of God

657
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Not one person in this crowd of thousands did so

658
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
She would have known that

659
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
And in the stillness of this moment

660
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
And with a very humble and earnest heart

661
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
She slowly said to them all

662
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
I love you

663
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
The typically cynical editor of the student newspaper

664
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Later muted something like this

665
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I saw, I saved the last word of this editorial

666
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
To honor Tinley Ireland, the young woman who had spoken

667
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
And for what she did on that final afternoon

668
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,000
I don't know or believe in her God

669
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
But whatever that is

670
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
And whatever love that is

671
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I need

672
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
This is an authentic witness

673
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
A credible evidence of the presence

674
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Love, justice and respect

675
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
That the gospel, the evangel itself

676
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Is meant to produce

677
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
If American white evangelicals

678
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Could begin a process of rebirth

679
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Then American white evangelicals

680
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Must recover a genuinely Christian identity

681
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
The crisis of American white evangelicalism

682
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Can be summed up in the inadequacy

683
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
If not the absence of these two qualities

684
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
In place of humility

685
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Often an overreaching confidence

686
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
That they and they alone know and define the truth

687
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
In a place of honesty

688
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
An admission of weakness and limitation

689
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
They proclaim and over-assert

690
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
What they don't know fully

691
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
But claim to know and enact consistently

692
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
This is what exposes

693
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,000
The unacceptable hypocrisy to so many

694
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
What aspects of Christian identity

695
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Of white evangelicals seem to have lost

696
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
We might start here

697
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
That as it says in the Heidelberg Catechism

698
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
The answer to question one

699
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
What is your only hope in life and in death

700
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
To which the answer is

701
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
We belong not to ourselves

702
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
But that in body and soul

703
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
In life and in death

704
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
We belong to our faithful Savior Jesus Christ

705
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,000
If you read this in light of the gospel narratives

706
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,000
We do not then embrace a mere theological frame

707
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
But a new way of being in the world

708
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
That challenges and reprioritizes

709
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:02,000
All other assumptions of our social, economic, racial, ethnic, and educational identity

710
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Our life is a life now "hidden in Christ"

711
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
And in relationship to which

712
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,000
We come by the power of the Spirit to live into this new reality

713
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
That God says is new

714
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Christ died to make this

715
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Which is necessary, namely our redemption and reparation

716
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Possible since we cannot redeem ourselves

717
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
This is the identity into which we are meant to grow

718
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:34,000
As maturing disciples

719
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
When we are baptized

720
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
And we acknowledge entering into Christ's death and resurrection

721
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
And our own dying and rising

722
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
It is not a mere religious ceremony

723
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,000
But a sacred and public sign of the beginning of a new life

724
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
This is a communal reality

725
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Not just an individual one

726
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
And it happens before the church

727
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
And in some sense before the world

728
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,000
It is our identity, not my identity alone

729
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
And it is with and for God's glory

730
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Including but not defined by my desires

731
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
And it's for the building up of the body of Christ

732
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Including but not defined by my gifts

733
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
And the evidence of God's life-transforming reign

734
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
In whatever context we consider

735
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Including but not bound by my own social location

736
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
As Paul says, for to me to live is Christ

737
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
And to die is gain

738
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,000
If American white evangelicals were to live this identity

739
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,000
And find new life, find hope

740
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
It means letting some things die

741
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Letting die our sense of self-definition

742
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Our sense of individualism

743
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Our sense that we hold primary agency

744
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Our sense that our Christian identity is primarily private and inward

745
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Our sense that we are followers of Jesus

746
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Marked with his death and resurrection

747
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
And filled with his spirit and joined to others who share that new life

748
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
And that look like us

749
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Our sense, in other words, that we are first white or American or male

750
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Rather than realizing we are first Christ's people

751
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
American white evangelicals would also

752
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Not only need to recover a Christian identity

753
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,000
But recover a Christian sense of location

754
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
According to the Apostle Paul

755
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Our first and foremost location as Christian disciples

756
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Is that we live "in Christ"

757
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
This picture of our lives is both mystical and theological

758
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
But it is also more incarnational

759
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Than those categories alone might suggest

760
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:07,000
To be "in Christ" is to grow up in the capacity to see and think and feel

761
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
And engage in communion with others

762
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,000
To re-socialize one another in Christ

763
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:22,000
To be "in Christ" is to dwell in our divine communion of Father, Son and Spirit

764
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,000
This is deeply inward but not private and not only personal

765
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,000
The need to realize our Christian social location

766
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
If American white evangelicals were to live "in Christ"

767
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
It means letting some things die

768
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
That this place is ours

769
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:47,000
That our social location is first and foremost where we choose to live

770
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,000
That we, that is white evangelicals, are in the top location

771
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
That our social location is neutral when it's clearly not

772
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,000
That we know the truth and the wisdom and the decisions to make

773
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
And that our only life in Christ

774
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Knows how to learn to read our home, our town and our nation

775
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,000
American white evangelicals

776
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
In addition to identity and location

777
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Need to recover Christian communion

778
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,000
God's people, we together here

779
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Right at this moment

780
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,000
In Hong Kong, around the Chinese world

781
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Wherever that you might be listening

782
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
And around the United States and throughout the whole globe

783
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,000
We are to be the living evidence that Christ died and rose

784
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
According to Philippians 2

785
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:50,000
We do so by showing that we have died and risen

786
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
To be part of a new humanity, a new communion

787
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Of unlike people

788
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,000
This is how and why the church is to be

789
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,000
If American white evangelicals were to live out this

790
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
What would need to die?

791
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:10,000
We would need to crucify the pride and presumption of our social location

792
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
We would need to repent and lament and reconcile and restore our past

793
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
And be willing to understand what we need to release

794
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
About the expectation of finding a church

795
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,000
That is basically finding comfort instead of finding transformation

796
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Finally, the future and hope of American white evangelicalism

797
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
God's repertoire of recreating anything

798
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Whether it's the Chinese church or CGST or Fuller Theological Seminary

799
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Or American white evangelicalism is without limit

800
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:52,000
God has every capacity and desire and will and purpose to recreate us

801
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:58,000
God can and God will do what God can and will do

802
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Depending on the theological tradition that we are in

803
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,000
We have presuppositions about what God might do

804
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,000
I'm here not as the prophet to declare what God will do

805
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
But to suggest what seems needed

806
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
All of these comments that I've tried to share with you

807
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Are conditioned by God's choosing to be and do what he does in Jesus Christ

808
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Perhaps the least likely possible strategy for the redemption of the world

809
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
That could have been imagined

810
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
That a Jewish first century male

811
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Who incarnates nothing less than the whole of God's character in life

812
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Is the one by whom the whole world

813
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,000
In all of its difference and diversity

814
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
In all of its crisis and urgency

815
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Can be saved by Jesus Christ

816
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,000
This is not a strategy any of us would have devised

817
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
But it is at the very core

818
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:02,000
It is the heart and the heartbeat of the evangelist self

819
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Therefore God's true heart and truth and imagination

820
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Continue to hold our goodness

821
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
And our brokenness

822
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
And any hope for our redemption

823
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Including hope for the white American evangelism we've been discussing

824
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,000
I do not presume God will do what seems to my perspective to be so needed

825
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
What I trust is that God is good

826
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
That God is near

827
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,000
And that God will complete what he has begun

828
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
So for the sake of scattering

829
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
The understandable despair

830
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Or resignation that I find

831
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,000
In some of the crisis of God's church in the 21st century

832
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Let's remember that the enterprise that we are a part of

833
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Is that we know as reality

834
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
To be God's wondrous project

835
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
This mess that I've described

836
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
As white American evangelicalism

837
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Is also part of the body of Christ himself

838
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
We do not come to the table

839
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
That is about human enterprise and effort

840
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
But to the table of God's unending love

841
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
And mercy and justice

842
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000
The purposes for which the world has been made

843
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
The goodness with which God has created

844
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,000
The severe brokenness that God is redeeming

845
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
In the sacrifice of Jesus Christ

846
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:36,000
And the new creation that is initiated in the resurrection

847
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
The end to which God is moving all things

848
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
By the presence and power of the Holy Spirit

849
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
In the people of God and in the world

850
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,000
These are the solid grounds of our collective hope

851
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:55,000
And to that we give thanks and praise every day

852
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,000
In Jesus' name, amen
