[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.880]   [Music]
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.400]   Good evening, friends, brothers and sisters.
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.400]   Michael Chu here.
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.600]   It's a great joy to see all of you.
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.680]   Even we have a bit of rain outside,
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.800]   but still you come all the way to join us.
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:33.360]   This particular evening is an important one
[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.080]   because we have a keynote speaker,
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.320]   a prominent speaker here with us.
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.720]   So I particularly would like to welcome many of you.
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.680]   Some of you are graduates, some are students,
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.320]   some are good friends of CGST.
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.560]   So your coming is a great support to this college
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.760]   and also it's especially love to see you all here.
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.880]   So now from time to time,
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.400]   CGST organize lectures or seminars
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.600]   and I'm sure many of you join us
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.320]   and you have a great memories here
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.320]   and I hope that tonight is also another one
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.200]   so we can learn a lot from our speakers.
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.200]   This evening we are so privileged to have
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.720]   Dr. Mark Leperton to be with us.
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:35.280]   Dr. Leperton served as president in FULA for a number of years
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.080]   from 2013 to 2022.
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.960]   And Mark is now the Clifford Arrow Panel
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.520]   Presidential Chair Emeritus
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.960]   and the Professor Emeritus of Preaching at FULA.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:59.200]   Mark is a highly respected and a great voice in America,
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.160]   in the Christian world,
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.200]   and also in the English speaking world.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.120]   So tonight I'm sure Mark will give us a lot of insight
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.800]   or even provoke us into a lot of thoughts.
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.720]   And tonight Mark Leperton will speak to us on the topic
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.840]   "Rethinking Relevance, Reimagining the American Church for Today's Society."
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.840]   I'm sure many of us today, we are so concerned the relevance,
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.600]   the relevance of the gospel,
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.040]   the relevance of the church to the society,
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.720]   how we could make a great connection
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.240]   and preach our gospel effectively to our non-Christian world.
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.360]   And this evening after Mark's lecture, we have two respondents.
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.880]   The first one is Reverend Jackie Chok.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.600]   He's the Senior Pastor of our Kowloon Lingling Church.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.160]   In fact, Reverend Chok or Dr. Chok.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:05.760]   He's actually graduated from FULA, D-Min in 2016.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.440]   So tonight we have a FULA graduate respond to a FULA president.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.040]   So it's wonderful.
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:23.760]   And also we have another respondent is our Professor Dr. Keane Lui.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:30.160]   He's the Heavenly Blessing Professor, Theological Study of CGST.
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.000]   And he's also Director of the Center for Faith and Prophetic Value.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.040]   Why we have Dr. Keane here?
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.720]   Because he had been in New York,
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.200]   the East Coast of America for so many years.
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.880]   So he's also a very right person to give response.
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:53.200]   So I'm sure tonight through the lecture of Mark and also Jackie and Keane,
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.680]   we have a colorful of discussion and dialogue.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.800]   And also I'm sure they're sharing their response or dialogue
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.200]   with sort of edifying all of us tonight.
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.280]   So may I now ask all of us to welcome Mark Lepperton.
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.920]   Come over here.
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:21.200]   [ Applause ]
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.080]   >> Thank you very much.
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.240]   It is a great joy to be here.
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.880]   CGST has been a place that I've known about for probably 40 years.
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.480]   I first learned of it when I was working in London
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.520]   and actually had the opportunity and privilege of meeting Dr. Carver there.
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:43.680]   And had the opportunity since then to know many people who have been connected to CGST.
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.480]   And there's a very warm connection between Fuller Theological Seminary and CGST.
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.360]   So all of that is another cause for celebration.
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.440]   I certainly want to thank Dr. Bernard Wong for his very kind invitation to be here
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.040]   this week teaching as well as that is this past week.
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.120]   And to say I see a number of faces from people that were in the class.
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.960]   So I'm grateful that you were able to come back this evening as well.
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.920]   I also want to just express that I'm grateful for the opportunity
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.120]   to be here at such an important time in Hong Kong's history.
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:22.160]   I am humbled by the timing and I'm humbled by what all of you are facing.
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.880]   And how well and how deeply I think God is meeting you and sustaining you
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.160]   and giving you hope and strength in all kinds of different ways.
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.640]   And none of us knows the future.
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.960]   None of us knows the timing of the future even more.
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:41.840]   So we acknowledge in humility before God that we are all people that are simply trying
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:48.080]   in the wisest way that we can to honor God by being together and thinking together tonight.
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.840]   I do want to bring particularly warm greetings from Dr. David Emanuel Goatley
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.400]   who is the president of Fuller Seminary where I get to serve as president emeritus.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:03.360]   But he's now the one carrying the mantle of that leadership and I'm extremely grateful.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.360]   He wanted me to particularly send his greetings along with the board of trustees of Fuller.
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:16.080]   The reflections that I'm going to share tonight are reflections that I hope are offered with
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.880]   sufficient humility before the Lord because I really do think that when we're talking about
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.600]   the church, whether it's in America or in Hong Kong or any other part of the world,
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.680]   we're talking about the bride of Christ.
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:34.880]   And I want to underscore that for me that does give me a certain intentional sobriety.
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:39.760]   That is a sense that this is something that God is deeply vested in.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:44.160]   And while I will offer words of critique as well as appreciation,
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:51.200]   both are meant as simply as offerings and observations before the God who alone is really
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:56.800]   the one who has ever been the source of hope for the church and is still the hope of the church.
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:03.120]   So like you, it is simply an astounding surprise to me that I even belong to the family of God's
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:03.440]   people.
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.160]   I was not born and raised in the life of the church.
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.800]   This happened for me when I was in my early 20s in college.
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:18.240]   And it still is a source of marvel to me that somehow God found me and called me and has been
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.200]   with me in all of the highs and lows and in between.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:26.000]   So I really come tonight simply as a sibling of faith with you.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   We are all trying to figure out what we're doing, and we're all trying to offer what we have to God
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.680]   for whatever purpose God may want.
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.600]   So let me offer a word of prayer.
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:47.680]   Oh God, how grateful we are that in your wonderful mercy and kindness that you are with us and that
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:56.800]   we have a chance tonight to be able to think together, to be able to feel after you and your
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:02.880]   purposes, yes, in part for the church in the United States, but certainly the church in Hong Kong,
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:06.080]   in China, and throughout the whole world.
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:13.760]   We bow in the deepest humility that you who hold all things and hold all things together
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.800]   should actually invite us in some way.
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:22.720]   To be a participant with you in the things that are so enormously important.
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:26.160]   We're grateful for your faithfulness.
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:32.000]   Take my words and insofar as they are a blessing, help people to think further about them.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.840]   And insofar as they're distracting or unhelpful, may they fall away.
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:39.600]   Give you thanks tonight for the gift of being together.
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.020]   Amen.
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:50.320]   It's inevitable that in talking about relevance that we have to talk about context.
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.760]   Context is what creates relevance, right?
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:58.640]   It's relevance to a time, place, people, circumstance, whatever that may be.
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:04.720]   So I'd like to begin with two different images of churches trying to grapple with context.
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:11.040]   The first, I'll say, comes a number of years ago when I had the opportunity and privilege
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:16.640]   of preaching at Nanjing Seminary for the first commencement service that they had in their new
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:23.840]   chapel. It had been a very large unfinished form on the campus for years and years and
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:26.720]   the money simply hadn't been there to be able to finish the chapel.
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:32.560]   So on my first visit to the campus years before that, it had been this large,
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:35.680]   empty hulk that had not yet been finished.
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:40.640]   But when I went back again, two, three years later, it had been finished.
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:45.200]   And it turned out that it was the first time that the chapel was going to be used as a site
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.720]   for their commencement.
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:51.920]   And they, with a great honor, asked if I would preach at the commencement service.
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:59.120]   When I came in, the building does not occupy a large space, but it is enormous.
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:02.000]   It's enormous inside.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.480]   And in taking all of that in, I was aware that there were these really large lights
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:14.800]   on the sides of the buildings that made the room exceptionally, brilliantly lit.
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:22.080]   But what I also noticed was in the ceiling, there were these little, small lanterns that
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:27.280]   were about this big, that were hanging inside this enormous space.
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:35.200]   And I kept thinking, I wonder why the architect would design a light that would be so small
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.480]   compared to the space.
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:42.960]   And as I was just taking it in, looking at the vastness of the space, and I saw these
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:47.680]   little lanterns, and I thought, I think this is an act of theology.
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:55.920]   I think what's happening is that the architect has designed these small lights to suggest
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:01.920]   that really probably the church in China is a bit like these small lights in a very vast
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:02.400]   space.
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:08.480]   So I said to the graduates of that commencement, you are these lanterns.
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:14.400]   And if the big lights go out, there is still this small light that you are going to be
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:18.160]   shining wherever it is in China that God may call you to be.
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:22.560]   And you're going to be doing that in the name of Christ, who is a light that can never be
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:23.360]   extinguished.
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:27.360]   It will be a light that will be with you in any and every place.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:35.040]   All of that was a telling of a story architecturally of what the gospel in context means.
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:39.280]   Let me now change and tell you a different story.
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:46.480]   The church I serve for almost 25 years altogether in Berkeley, California, is surrounded by
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:51.520]   the University of California, Berkeley, which, if you don't know, is kind of a crazy place.
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:58.080]   It's a very, very highly regarded university, but it has a wild political history.
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:06.000]   And at the time that the church that I'm going to be describing this, the church in the 1960s,
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.320]   long before I was ever associated with it, the church had gone through a time when there
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:14.320]   were riots in Berkeley every two or three months for four years.
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:20.720]   And right at that moment, the church's building was condemned by the fire marshal.
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:27.840]   For having a large stone belfry, which the fire marshal thought would be dangerous in
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.200]   earthquake territory.
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:33.680]   So he condemned the building and said, "This whole building has to be torn down."
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:40.480]   So you can imagine if a church that's surrounded by rioting, and I mean really surrounded by
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:46.400]   rioting, for four years, has suddenly the announcement that its building is condemned,
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.040]   then it was a time to evaluate.
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:51.280]   Are we going to stay on this property?
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.040]   Are we going to move further away?
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:58.560]   Amazingly, the church courageously decided to stay right on that corner.
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:04.080]   And then it did something even more amazing to me, which was that they tore down this
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:10.000]   old stone sanctuary, which was very beautiful, but it was made of these stones, and they
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.160]   built a clear glass-walled church.
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:18.640]   So anything that's happening in the streets of Berkeley, you see when you're in the middle
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:19.200]   of worship.
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:24.240]   And whatever's happening in worship is seen by everyone who's passing by.
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:30.560]   And they built the church with only one cross, which was not inside the building.
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.280]   It was just outside the front steps.
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:37.200]   And it was to say, "It's one cross for the world."
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:40.960]   And it's true for life inside the church.
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.520]   It's true for life outside the church.
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:46.640]   It makes a claim on everything and everyone.
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:52.720]   And it was a statement of the daringness of saying, staying, that we're going to stay
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:58.560]   on this corner and continue to try to be a witness to a light and a life that still matters
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:03.760]   in Berkeley, even if you're having a riot every few months for four years.
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:12.480]   Now, these are two stories of how to live with context, how to somehow, in those two
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.800]   cases, just architecturally reflect this.
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:19.760]   Of course, the reality of the gospel is much deeper than our architecture.
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.480]   But our architecture does tell a story.
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:29.680]   And in this case, what I want to suggest tonight and what I hope will be an aspirational vision
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:39.040]   and a hopeful vision, but a difficult perspective, is this, that I hope for the American church,
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:42.960]   which Bernard suggested would be a good thing for me to talk about.
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:46.640]   It was his decision, not mine.
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:48.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:53.440]   I didn't come needing to talk about the American church, but since I've been invited to talk
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:54.960]   about the American church, I will.
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:57.440]   This is my hope.
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:02.960]   I intend that tonight I want to argue that the church in the United States needs to be
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:11.440]   an embodied, credible, and beautiful witness to the relevance of God's love in Jesus Christ,
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:18.800]   and especially so in contexts of spiritual confusion and places of suffering, physical
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:21.840]   suffering, poverty, and injustice.
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:28.720]   It needs to be a gospel with credibility that is it's believable, not perfect, not a church
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.600]   that's perfect and pristine and pure.
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:37.920]   That is the eternal church, just a church that is credible, that when it speaks and
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:40.240]   acts, each reinforces the other.
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:45.200]   These are themes in the Gospel of Matthew, and last week we were thinking as a class
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:47.600]   about those connections deeply.
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:52.000]   That is the call of any church in any context at any time.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:58.480]   But how do we do this in an embodied way, that is not in just a language-formed way,
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:05.200]   but in a physical body, in a physical manifestation, in a community or a communion of other
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:12.960]   people who are sharing the reality of this beautiful witness to the relevance of God's
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:22.080]   love in Jesus Christ in every sphere, both spiritually and also physically, politically?
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:28.640]   So as we go from here for this evening, because we're going to start at the largest level
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:34.880]   and work into the more granular level, I'd like to invite us to take a moment of silence
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:38.160]   to all stand, if you would, please, just for a moment, if you would stand.
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:45.760]   I'm going to ask us to be silent for a moment, and then I would like to ask us to say the
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:52.320]   Apostles' Creed together as a way of affirming in the biggest possible theological framework
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:57.440]   who it is that we're here to honor and whose church it is that we're talking about.
[00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.120]   So let's pause for a moment.
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:04.240]   Please, when you come to say the Apostles' Creed, speak in whatever language you would
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:04.960]   most prefer.
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:18.080]   But first, let's be silent.
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:38.000]   And we say together, I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth,
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:45.200]   and in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:52.160]   of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried.
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.320]   He descended into hell.
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:57.680]   On the third day, he rose again from the dead.
[00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:04.560]   He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of God, the Father Almighty.
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:08.800]   From there, he will come to judge the living and the dead.
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:16.800]   I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:21.840]   of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting.
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:23.040]   Amen.
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:30.480]   Please be seated.
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:40.640]   When the Apostles' Creed was written, it was written at a time and place in Christian
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:46.320]   history in which it was meant to try to give an articulate expression of a theological
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:50.960]   frame for the most essential Christian doctrines.
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:58.000]   It is, like any creed, never sufficient to the whole, but adequate for the moment and
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.400]   very much a reflection of the debates that were going on at the time that the Apostles'
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:06.560]   Creed was written, as were every other creed that has ever been written.
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:14.880]   And I use it tonight simply as a framework to say, if it expresses the largest theological
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:19.520]   framework for what God has actually done and what the Church is meant to confess and to
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:25.200]   believe and to live in light of, then how does it help us understand the relevance of
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:25.840]   the gospel?
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:29.040]   Let's first think in this way.
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:36.400]   Let's think about the relevance that comes from above and then in a moment about the
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:39.440]   relevance that comes from below.
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:44.240]   The relevance that comes from below, I suggest, has several assumptions.
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:51.040]   The first relevance is this, that God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, through the
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:56.720]   power and presence of the Holy Spirit, is of unending relevance to us and to the world.
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:02.960]   It is just an established ontological fact that if it is true that there is such a God,
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:08.320]   that that God has spoken in Jesus Christ, that God in Jesus Christ has come for the
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:14.400]   salvation of the world, to both teach and lead and exemplify to us what a full humanity
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:20.960]   looks like and to call us into the new humanity of living as God's people in the world, then
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:27.600]   he, this is the relevance that God needs and the only relevance God needs, but it is every
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:28.240]   relevance.
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:35.840]   It is every relevance in the sense that it is relevance for everyone and for everything.
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:39.680]   There is no place beyond which this relevance extends.
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:42.640]   Now, we don't just say this as an abstraction.
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:48.000]   I want to suggest that it's not at maybe the broadest frame.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.680]   I want to suggest that it's at the deepest frame instead and call it the ground, the
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:21:00.960]   soil from which Christian faith and human life and creation itself exists because God
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.240]   is this kind of God.
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:08.800]   And therefore, this kind of God is the God who in Christ, as Colossians 1 suggests, is
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:14.080]   the God who holds all things together, the one who was the firstborn of creation and
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:15.600]   the firstborn from the dead.
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:22.240]   This is a picture that if we're ever wanting what is relevant at any given moment, God
[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.000]   is by definition relevant.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.320]   And in the language of the Bible, this is not distant relevance.
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:31.200]   This is actually proximal relevance.
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:33.680]   It's God at close hand.
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:40.400]   So the confession, as you know, goes through the first framing, only four lines that are
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.360]   specifically related to God the Father and the Creator.
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:49.120]   And the rest of the creed is really centered in Jesus Christ and then the Spirit and then
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:50.400]   the gift of the church.
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:53.920]   This is a remarkable amount of relevance.
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:59.600]   Now, this is relevance that's of such first order that if no one believed it, it is still
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:00.480]   relevant.
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:06.480]   If it was never seen, confessed, understood, it would still be the thing on which everything
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:09.600]   else ultimately takes its cue and finds its life.
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:16.160]   This is the kind of relevance that's so profound that we--it's like saying that the sky begins
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:17.520]   in our lungs, right?
[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:21.040]   It's not the sky out there, it's the sky here.
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:26.880]   The relevance of God begins actually in the foundation of our very being, that we are
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:32.560]   certainly made in the image of God, but that God is the one who really holds all of my
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:38.880]   and your particularity, all of our contextual details, all of our social and political challenges,
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:42.160]   all of that is known and loved by God.
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:48.240]   Let's think about some of the texts in the scriptures that just remind us of this.
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:52.480]   I'm going to start with the New Testament primarily, only the New Testament for the
[00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:58.560]   sake of time, but to acknowledge also that this full reality is in Jesus Christ.
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:06.080]   The Gospel of John puts it this way, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:08.320]   God, and the Word was God.
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:11.840]   He was in the beginning with God.
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:16.640]   All things were made through him, and without him was not anything made that was made.
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:20.320]   In him was life, and the life was the light of men.
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:25.040]   The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:29.840]   The true light, which gives light to everyone, was coming into the world.
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:37.440]   He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world did not know him.
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:41.520]   He came to his own, and his people did not receive him.
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:46.880]   But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:52.480]   of God, who were born not of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:24:00.160]   And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:04.160]   the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth."
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:11.600]   I hope you noticed in that longer opening paragraph that the relevance of God and God's
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:15.760]   love in Christ was not just for those who were able to hear and receive it.
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:17.600]   Did you hear that?
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:18.960]   It's really quite amazing.
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:24.960]   He, that is Jesus, was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:26.000]   did not know him.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:33.760]   In other words, he was utterly relevant to their sheer existence and was not recognized
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:34.560]   for who he was.
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:39.600]   And then, as though that's not enough, he comes to his own, that is to Israel, and his
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:42.000]   own people did not receive him.
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:49.360]   So even though he was that proximate, nevertheless, Israel, as you know, did not receive him.
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:54.160]   But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:54.640]   of God.
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:58.080]   Relevance, then, is found at every level.
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:03.920]   It's found in existence, it's found in Israel, it's found in the people who rejected
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:06.720]   him, but it's also found in the people who accept him.
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:14.000]   This is one way of simply referring back to the ontological existential relevance of God,
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.760]   and specifically to human beings, that God is not primarily dependent on the church,
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:23.520]   but on the God who promises and is faithful in Jesus Christ.
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:29.440]   In other words, we don't come to the question of relevance by trying to figure out how do
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:30.960]   we make the church relevant.
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:38.400]   We come to the question of relevance through the lens of God, who is relevant by the nature
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:40.000]   of God's own being.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:48.080]   And we share, as people made in God's image, the burden of a vocation that is actually
[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:58.000]   meant to make Christ now visible, audible, palpable, physically manifest, embodied, to
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.960]   a world that thinks there is no God, or that absolutely rejects that there is any God,
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:10.720]   whether it's Yahweh, Jesus, or anyone or anything else, or to people with various religious
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:15.360]   and competing views, all of which, in the language of the New Testament and language
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:21.040]   of the Bible, would be supplanted by this vision of the God who holds all things.
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:27.280]   It means, then, that without any protest, without any insistence, without any sense
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:32.720]   that the church is making God relevant, as though God has no relevance, we, the church,
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:35.760]   are going to be the bridge to make God relevant.
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:42.160]   Instead, we begin with this deep conviction, a grounding conviction, a soil out of which
[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:46.800]   our life and work and ministry is formed, because this is who God is.
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:52.480]   I want to underscore this, not because we're not going to go on and talk about how the
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:58.480]   church does play a role, but to simply acknowledge to ourselves that the church has a secondary
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:04.400]   role, and if the church ever gets confused about that, that it thinks it is the primary
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:12.640]   agent of relevance, and that we have to make ourselves relevant in a way that is more important
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:18.720]   than who God actually is, himself is, or what God has already done, then the church is already
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:20.800]   in a very troubled place.
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:28.160]   There are ways in the history of the church where the church has threateningly replaced
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:35.200]   God, and essentially said to its members, "Come and follow us, we who are of this era,
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:41.200]   of this denomination, of this inclination, of this way of liturgical practice, of this
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:43.760]   hierarchy of ecclesiastical leadership."
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:48.320]   The church has actually been a rival to God in the name of God.
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:55.840]   That is obviously an offense to God, but it's a very important warning, and when it's not
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:28:01.200]   being a warning, it's a very important gift to realize that before I wake up in the morning,
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:07.760]   before I or you or the graduates of CGST or the faculty of CGST or the church in Hong
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:15.120]   Kong or China or the United States even moves an inch, does anything, the gospel that we
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:18.880]   put our trust in is relevant to everyone and everything.
[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:24.880]   To me, this picture is extremely important, especially if we're going to then go on and
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:30.320]   talk about other practical ways in which we are meant to be relevant, but it's not in
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:35.120]   this primary sense that God alone makes the gospel relevant.
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:42.160]   God is the one who creates and loves and promises and sacrifices everything that all things
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:44.960]   might be made new in Jesus Christ.
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:48.560]   It's really a magnificent biblical vision.
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:56.240]   Let's then move from relevance from above, you might say, or from the ground to relevance
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:57.840]   from below and beside.
[00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:03.440]   Here, the question is the relevance of the church to the gospel itself, or not yet the
[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:05.280]   relevance of the church to society.
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:09.440]   Is the church relevant to the gospel?
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:18.800]   Again, in ontological theological terms, yes, the church is God's design, but does the church
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:21.440]   live like it is relevant to the gospel?
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:26.160]   Does the church show that it understands that it lives in this reality that we've just
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:29.360]   sketched, this large framework of what God is doing?
[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:35.280]   Or has the church decided to just come up with its own little enterprises, its own little
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:43.760]   tasks, its busy work, its organizational structures, its religious fussiness?
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:46.880]   Or is it actually relevant to God?
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:50.400]   In other words, does it reflect the gospel?
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:56.400]   The relevance of the church to the gospel has to precede the question of then how does
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:02.560]   that church that could be living in a relevant way to the gospel then is also relevant to
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:03.120]   the world?
[00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:09.200]   So how is the church relevant to the gospel in any given time and place?
[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:11.920]   This is actually a much more difficult question.
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:14.000]   It's much more complicated.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.800]   It intersects with history in a way in which God is not the only actor.
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:23.760]   He's still the primary actor, but now the church is filled with actors.
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:29.040]   We, who are part of the church, the church across the centuries, the church around the
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:33.280]   world, the church across every denomination and manifestation.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:42.480]   God's mysterious economy has always chosen finite and fallen human beings to be the agents
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:45.040]   of his truth and goodness and mercy.
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:49.760]   I don't know about you, I find this one of the great mysteries of the universe.
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:57.120]   Why would the God who holds all things deploy a group of people, which I say with affection,
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:03.600]   like us, to be the people who carry forth the reality of God's love and mercy and justice
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:04.560]   for the world?
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:05.200]   Seriously?
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:06.960]   This is God's plan?
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:13.600]   In Matthew, we discussed last week that at the end, just before the Great Commission,
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:19.680]   when God and Jesus is sending them out, there's a very interesting note that I think is often
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:24.960]   not observed in Matthew 28, where Matthew, who has said so much about the 12, the 12,
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:30.800]   the 12, the 12, the 12, the 12, and so much about the fact that this is really a portrait
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:34.720]   of Jesus as the new Moses who's launching a new era for God's people.
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:40.480]   It says in Matthew 28, "And then Jesus gathered with the 11."
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:45.760]   If you've been listening to the voice of Matthew, by the time you get to that moment,
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:48.480]   it's like, "Oh, it's not the perfect number.
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:55.360]   Things happened along the way that didn't go the way that anyone but God may have understood
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:55.920]   them to go.
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:57.520]   It's just 11."
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:02.240]   And then the text goes on to say, "And some believed and doubted."
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:06.560]   And in Greek, it's a little complicated right there because it feels as though it could
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:08.720]   also be saying, "Some believed and doubted."
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:10.800]   That is, some were both believers and doubters.
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:19.040]   So it was to 11 believer doubters that God gave the gospel to the church, not his authority,
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:23.200]   which, interestingly, Roman Catholics believe that authority was transferred to the church.
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:25.920]   Protestants don't believe that was transferred to the church.
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:31.840]   We don't carry God's authority, except insofar as the Holy Spirit authorizes what we're doing,
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:36.560]   but not in the sense that God has given the church the authority to be Jesus Christ in
[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:37.440]   the world.
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:42.320]   It's the Holy Spirit's authority who, through us, demonstrates the power of God.
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:49.760]   But my point in all this is that God has chosen finite, limited, fallen human beings to be
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:55.200]   the agents of telling the good news of God's love and mercy to the world.
[00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:57.360]   This is a shock.
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:02.800]   From the promises to Abraham and Sarah, to Moses, to Israel, all the way through the
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:08.240]   major and minor prophets, the highs and lows and ins and outs of Israel's life, all the
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:14.240]   way to the 12, to Paul, to the growth of the church in the first and second centuries,
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:17.920]   and beyond, all the way to this very day.
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:20.960]   This is God's relentless purpose.
[00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:24.480]   I want to choose people who, in freedom, will choose me.
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:31.600]   And in the course of that process, I want to deploy them, fill them with the Spirit,
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:37.600]   baptize them in my name, fill them with the Spirit, and commission them to grow up in
[00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:44.000]   Christ as they grow up and mature in Christ, to be people who become agents of my love,
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.040]   God is saying.
[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:50.560]   The biblical narrative is of such significant ups and downs as God's people have been, and
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:52.960]   more, far less relevant often to God.
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:56.480]   This is the pain of reading through the 66 books of the Bible.
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:03.920]   How often in the Hebrew Scriptures is God crying out to Israel for its unfaithfulness
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:08.000]   in actually being the kind of distinctive people that God's called them to be?
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:14.640]   And while that tone is less evident in the New Testament, it still is evident in the
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:21.760]   New Testament that God sends apostles to teach, but to also correct the church in its failure
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:22.960]   to be relevant to God.
[00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:29.440]   So you've taken what I've given you, you've taken it into yourself, you've remade it for
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:34.640]   your own purposes and for your own ends, and now you're going to call it mine, but it's
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:38.400]   really yours, and now you're going to try to be that in the world.
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:45.520]   Clearly, whether we're talking Israel or the church, that methodology is not the way
[00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:46.480]   that we're supposed to live.
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:50.320]   Often it becomes less relevant to God.
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:56.400]   This is why, for example, in Isaiah 58, so much is said by the prophet that God hates
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:35:01.440]   Israel's worship, and he hates it primarily because, in that text, he hates it because
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:06.800]   you worship me as if you practiced righteousness.
[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:10.640]   Those two words could not be more condemning of Israel.
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:13.840]   In other words, it's like an imitation.
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:17.040]   It's like you're trying to play act worship.
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:23.520]   You're a character in a play trying to pretend to God that you're actually worshiping God,
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:27.520]   when in fact, he would go on to say, in fact, you're really just worshiping yourselves.
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:29.200]   You're seeking your own ends.
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:33.680]   The worship that you're claiming in my name then scandalizes God, and you're doing it
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:36.880]   in my name so other people think that's who I am.
[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:38.560]   That's not who I am, God says.
[00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:39.680]   That's who you are.
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:47.840]   And that's why he then, in the prophet, through the prophet, God says that these are not the
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:48.160]   things.
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:51.520]   Sackcloth and ashes are not the things.
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:53.760]   Burdening your servants are not the things.
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:55.200]   None of that represents me.
[00:35:55.200 --> 00:36:01.920]   What represents me is if you actually do the weightier matters in the language of Jesus,
[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:06.720]   the matters that really care for the poor, that care for the marginalized, that see those
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:11.440]   who are in great need and respond with compassion and mercy and justice.
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:17.040]   These are the things that are meant to actually mark the relevance of the church to the God
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:17.760]   of the gospel.
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:23.120]   Whether Israel or the church, the people of God are meant to be a reflection of the character
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:25.440]   and actions of God that we worship.
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:31.120]   In Christ, we understand that this is meant to be, as in Philippians 2, 1 through 11,
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:33.120]   the story of self-emptying power.
[00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:42.000]   It's the story of how God is not dominating but sacrificing, the God who is self-giving.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:48.400]   The church's temptation has always been to imitate empire and not to imitate the sacrificial
[00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:51.120]   love and self-giving of Jesus Christ.
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:56.960]   The crisis of the church in the United States in this first quarter of the 21st century
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:37:03.120]   is broadly the story of the church in the United States often being irrelevant to the
[00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:09.520]   gospel but doing all kinds of things in the name of the gospel in a way that then is confusing,
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:14.800]   does not stand the test of time, is not blessed and honored by God in the way that it can
[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:15.440]   or should be.
[00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:21.680]   I, of course, want to say that there have been, by God's faithfulness, so many stories
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:25.600]   through the American church of the evidence and presence of the power of the Spirit at
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:31.520]   work over all of the hundreds of years, not in China's case, the thousands of years, in
[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:32.480]   the hundreds of years.
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:40.320]   Native Americans have been there for thousands of years but we who look more like me have
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:42.400]   only been there for a few hundred years.
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:45.600]   And in that period of time, God has been faithful.
[00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:47.440]   There is evidence of God's blessing.
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:47.920]   There is.
[00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:54.640]   But tragically, again, it's been tended to be a church that over and over again looks
[00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:59.680]   more like Israel that God battered against in the words of the prophets than a church
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:03.520]   that actually mirrors God's character and love in the world.
[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:09.840]   The crisis of the church in this period of time then is that it is less and less relevant
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:15.760]   to God in its struggle to be more and more relevant to the culture and to the power structures
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:18.160]   of the culture than it's probably ever been.
[00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:26.160]   It's possible that it's parallel to the kind of judgment that God offers to Israel and
[00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:27.520]   it comes back again and again.
[00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:34.560]   The key question for the American church and perhaps everywhere is this, will the church
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:38.160]   be God's church?
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:44.080]   Will it actually be the people who live a Christian identity?
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:50.560]   Or are we just going to say we claim a Christian identity but live in a way that is functionally
[00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:56.240]   really nothing more than a reflection of culture, nothing more than a reflection of human desire,
[00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:58.640]   however that might be structured or expressed?
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:01.200]   Will the church be relevant to God?
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:04.480]   Will it in that sense be reflective of God?
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:14.000]   Will it be a church that when it's encountered, people say, "Oh, this is a taste of God."
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:19.920]   To be in this community of faith, to be with these people, to be in their presence, to
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:23.920]   share life together, will we live our Christian identity?
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:30.640]   Right now the church in America is facing all kinds of temptations to be absorbed even
[00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:35.280]   more in cultural formation rather than in gospel formation.
[00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:40.320]   And so much of what I'm sure you read about and find offensive about what's going on in
[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:44.880]   the American church is offensive, it's rightly understood to be offensive.
[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:50.560]   There's so many different ways in which this is evident, and it's tragic, and it's painful,
[00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:58.720]   and it feels like a multi-generational tragedy that's been unfolding, especially really in
[00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:05.600]   the last, I'll say, eight years or so, but has been really a part of the American church
[00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:06.560]   since it began.
[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:11.920]   That's a much longer story than we have time to get into, but really from the beginning,
[00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:18.960]   the struggle of the American founding being a departure from empire, to come to a place
[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:24.720]   of freedom and yet to immediately exercise empire over all the Native people that were
[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:31.840]   there, and to operate in a way that said, "Okay, we can now reject all those authorities,"
[00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:36.880]   only to put themselves in the same kind of authoritative positions and to manifest a
[00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:43.680]   gospel which then conquered the land in a way that it understood as the promised land,
[00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:50.480]   but which brutalized thousands of people and destroyed many, many, many ways of life with
[00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:53.920]   no sensitivity to the character of God in the relationship to this.
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:59.840]   It's no wonder then that along from the beginning, slavery is already a significant part of
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:07.280]   American history, American church and Christian history, and it goes all the way up to the
[00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:15.520]   middle of the 19th century that it's in full legal formation, and then it extends even
[00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:19.760]   further in something that you may have read about called the Jim Crow era, which is a
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:25.840]   period where basically slavery is no longer legal, but it's functionally still practiced
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:31.440]   in a whole variety of socially horrific ways.
[00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:38.880]   Just that one theme is enough to say the American church is hardly a reflection of the God of
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:44.240]   all mercy and justice and love who sets people free.
[00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:50.240]   The relevance of Jesus to contemporary life has to connect with all the questions, all
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:56.480]   the issues, all the circumstances, the injustices, the hopes, the social needs, the transformation,
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:42:02.880]   the politics, the stewardship of the earth, the spiritual void, and much, much more.
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:08.560]   The church's relevance to the times needs to demonstrate not that it is relevant, but
[00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:13.600]   that the God that we worship in Christ is relevant to all of the structures and powers
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:19.520]   and forces of darkness that exist around us, that we are meant to be agents of beauty and
[00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:24.720]   goodness and love and mercy and justice, and we're meant to show up as that kind of church
[00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:30.800]   because that would be a reflection of the compassion and love of how God has acted in
[00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:32.280]   Jesus Christ.
[00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:37.600]   To distill it in the way Jesus does, again, in Matthew, as had been said in the Hebrew
[00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:42.640]   Scriptures, that the first and second commandments, loving God with all our heart, mind, soul,
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:48.280]   and strength, and loving our neighbor as ourselves, is still the very core of how the church shows
[00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:50.280]   that it is like God.
[00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:57.680]   It's not just to figure out some way of entertaining the culture, some way of imagining how to
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:00.760]   find pleasure amidst the culture.
[00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:07.600]   It's how to actually love people in those contexts and to do it in a way that mirrors
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:12.880]   God, not just a way that mirrors sometimes very superficial culture, as though it's about
[00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:24.760]   bringing in more balloons, more screens, more technological magic, more big stage speakers,
[00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:29.160]   more awesome bands.
[00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:34.840]   All of that can happen, but if it doesn't actually manifest itself at the core as really
[00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:42.800]   being about the love of God, first and foremost, and the love for one another in God's name,
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:48.040]   then it is not a church that has the relevance to God or to the world that it's actually
[00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:49.840]   meant to have.
[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:55.440]   These commandments name what is most important to God and most needed in the world.
[00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:59.080]   And if we do love God with all our heart, mind, soul, and strength, and our neighbors
[00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:02.720]   as ourselves, it will lead to reordering power.
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:04.600]   It will change the way that we love.
[00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:07.000]   It will change the way that we see our neighbor.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:13.960]   It will change our capacity to move beyond self-interest into actually being more interested
[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:20.600]   in the other, the neighbor, the stranger, and even the enemy.
[00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:23.680]   This is the only relevance that actually matters.
[00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:30.440]   If the church doesn't do this, then we could have spectacular buildings, small lights,
[00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:34.320]   big lights, stone buildings, glass buildings.
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:41.520]   If in the end, we're not a people, an organic people that embody the relevance of the gospel,
[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:44.400]   then we have lost the relevance that actually matters.
[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:47.360]   And it's the relevance that is always the most at risk.
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:50.520]   This is all part of the mystery of God's strategy.
[00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:57.920]   The number one risk is to give an eternal mission to a finite and flawed people.
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:03.760]   And as that plays out, God seems to have tolerance, patience, love.
[00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:07.720]   He's going to mature us in that process of this growing up.
[00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:12.800]   And it is a remarkable picture of how important it is that we pay attention to these things.
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:15.680]   I'll move a little quicker because I know we've been going for some time.
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:18.280]   When do I need to be done with my part of it?
[00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:22.720]   Am I already supposed to be done?
[00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:25.240]   Oh my gosh.
[00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:29.120]   Well, oh my gosh.
[00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:32.240]   I really thought I had a bit longer.
[00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:34.960]   Okay, so we will jump then quickly.
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:35.960]   Okay.
[00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:38.200]   No, no, no.
[00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:42.080]   We want to hear from you.
[00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:46.240]   So let me just see how to do this.
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:51.120]   Okay, I'll just say three things and then I'll be done and then we'll leave it to you.
[00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:55.000]   So what constitutes the relevance of the church?
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:02.040]   I would say first and foremost, a church that is relevant is relevant to a
[00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:09.240]   in the sense of being a credible reflection of the life and the character of God.
[00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:14.800]   If those things are not true, if the church, if in some ways the experience of the church
[00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:20.720]   doesn't have the aroma of Christ about it, if it primarily has the aroma of wealth or
[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:28.600]   power or entertainment and not the aroma, the core aroma that Christ is in this place,
[00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:33.360]   then we already have to ask ourselves, are we really a church that's anything more than
[00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:36.360]   simply a reflection of our sociology?
[00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:39.440]   Are we just the people that we would be without Christ?
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:44.760]   We just happen to be with Christ, we say, but then we just go on living and being the
[00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:47.000]   same kind of people we would be otherwise.
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:54.800]   Secondly, if the church takes God with full seriousness, with radical, it means that if
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:59.360]   the church takes God with full seriousness, it's relevant and if it does that, it will
[00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:04.280]   involve radical love and reordered power.
[00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:07.720]   Love is often defined as we know, primarily sociologically.
[00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:12.400]   We grow up in families and cultures and backgrounds that say this is what love looks like.
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:15.660]   If we're thoughtful, reflective, maturing Christians, we have to ask ourselves, how
[00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:21.220]   does the gospel critique the criteria by which we understand the nature of love?
[00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:25.320]   And if it doesn't lead us beyond our safety zone, if it doesn't lead us to engage with
[00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:31.040]   people that are unlike us and not just like us, if it doesn't lead us to see and care
[00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:35.720]   and extend ourselves in mercy toward people whose circumstances may be dramatically different
[00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:41.240]   than our own, then we really have to ask, is our religion, is our faith just a protection
[00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:46.320]   of myself and my own identity as though it is simply about my own self-interest?
[00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:49.820]   That is one of the major problems in the American church.
[00:47:49.820 --> 00:47:55.600]   And thirdly, if the church is going to have relevance, it has to be a church that takes
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:58.900]   the world with full seriousness.
[00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:04.480]   There are theological ideas that have gone on for many years which have really suggested
[00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:08.680]   that this is just, the earth is just a place we're passing through.
[00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:10.920]   There is nothing here that really matters.
[00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:14.880]   You don't need to worry about this injustice or that injustice or this circumstances or
[00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:15.880]   that kind of suffering.
[00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:20.960]   None of that really matters because in fact it's all just going to get burned up and God
[00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:23.800]   will give us a new kingdom.
[00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:32.520]   Now imagine that view which is a common view in many, many people's underlying theology
[00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:37.740]   and means that they don't take the world seriously.
[00:48:37.740 --> 00:48:46.460]   You face Gaza, you face Myanmar, you face Sudan, just to name a few and perhaps many
[00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:50.700]   others closer at hand.
[00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:53.340]   And then you just say, it really doesn't matter.
[00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:57.860]   All of that is irrelevant unless it brings people to Christ.
[00:48:57.860 --> 00:49:00.780]   And then in the end it's all going to get burned up.
[00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:07.780]   Imagine God stepping into that scene and says, in fact, all of this matters.
[00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:14.620]   All of this suffering, all of this injustice, and the world is not going to be burned up.
[00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:21.500]   In fact, I'm here to fulfill the law, Jesus says in Matthew, but I'm also here to fulfill
[00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:22.820]   creation.
[00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:27.260]   I will actually bring it to its ultimate manifestation.
[00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:32.060]   And the writing and thinking of so many theologians over the centuries, but I think in our own
[00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:38.900]   day, particularly of the work of Tom Wright, in reconstituting this sort of framework,
[00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:44.620]   reclaiming the earth, reclaiming the soil, reclaiming bodies, reclaiming the significance
[00:49:44.620 --> 00:49:50.300]   of suffering as a Christian vocation to step into that gives us relevance.
[00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:56.940]   There is much more that I had prepared and my apologies for taking anyone's time and
[00:49:56.940 --> 00:50:01.340]   I'm now very interested in hearing from both of our respondents and then we will have some
[00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:02.340]   conversation.
[00:50:02.340 --> 00:50:03.580]   So please, thank you.
[00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:08.700]   [applause]
[00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:19.500]   [music]
