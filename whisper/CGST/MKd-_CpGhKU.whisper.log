[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500]  Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.500]  My name is Daniel Lee.
[00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.900]  I teach systematic theology at CGST here.
[00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.900]  It's my great privilege to introduce our honored speaker,
[00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.500]  Professor Nguyen Van Mugman tonight.
[00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.100]  Actually, Professor Nguyen Van Mugman
[00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.100]  does not need an introduction.
[00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.100]  He has long been distinguished
[00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.400]  as one of the most acclaimed theologians of our time
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.600]  since the publication of his celebrated
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.800]  Theology of Hope in 1964.
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.300]  He is the architect of post-Auschwitz theology
[00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.300]  as well as a pioneering voice in political theology,
[00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.300]  ecological theology,
[00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.100]  feminist and Jewish-Christian dialogue.
[00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.300]  He demonstrates a life that has dedicated itself
[00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.100]  to seeking a Christian response
[00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.600]  to the turmoil and opportunities of our time.
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.100]  His publication list is breathtaking in length
[00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.700]  and many of his books are immensely influential.
[00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.500]  So just name a few.The Crucified God in 1974.
[00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.100]  The Church in the Power of the Holy Spirit,1977.
[00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.900]  The Trinity and the Kingdom of God in 1981.
[00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.100]  God in Creation in 1985.
[00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.300]  The Way of Jesus Christ in 1990.
[00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.700]  The Spirit of Life in 1992.
[00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.900]  The Coming of God in 1996.
[00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.100]  Experiences in Theology in 1999.
[00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.900]  Ethics of Hope,2010.
[00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.500]  Professor Mugman truly has great delight
[00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.500]  and vitality in writing.
[00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.500]  We've been told that he's going to publish
[00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.500]  a new book on Christian patients this year.
[00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.700]  So in his profound theological works,
[00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.300]  there has been a great passion for life.
[00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.500]  This reminds me of a beautiful prayer
[00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.500]  I have read in Professor Mugman's autobiography.
[00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.100]  It serves a quotation here.
[00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.700]  Quote, "When I love God,
[00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.100]  I love the beauty of bodies,
[00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.700]  the rhythm of movements,
[00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.700]  the shining of eyes,
[00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.500]  the embraces,
[00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.700]  the feelings,
[00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.100]  the sense,
[00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.900]  the sense of all these protein creation.
[00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.100]  When I love you, my God,
[00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.700]  I want to embrace it all,
[00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.500]  for I love you with all my senses
[00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.500]  in the creations of your love.
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.100]  In all the things that encounter me,
[00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.700]  you are waiting for me."
[00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.900]  The experience of God
[00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.300]  deepens the experiences of life.
[00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.100]  It does not reduce them,
[00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.300]  for they are ways
[00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.500]  the unconditional yes to life.
[00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.300]  The more I love God,
[00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.100]  the more gladly I exist.
[00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.700]  The more immediately and wholly I exist,
[00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.700]  the more I sense the living God,
[00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.500]  the inexhaustible source of life
[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.900]  and eternal livingness."
[00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.900]  End quote.
[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.700]  Such a great passion for life
[00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.700]  is why we are so thankful
[00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.300]  to have him in our midst tonight
[00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.500]  and to listen to his insights
[00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.700]  on the topic,
[00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.300]  a culture of life
[00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.500]  in the dangers of our time.
[00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.900]  So please join me
[00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.700]  and offer our warm welcome
[00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.100]  to Professor Yungel Mokhmar.
[00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.300]  Thank you, Professor Daniel Lee,
[00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.900]  for your kind words of introduction
[00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.900]  and of welcome.
[00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.900]  In this lecture,
[00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.900]  ladies and gentlemen,
[00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.900]  I would like to introduce
[00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.900]  the famous professor,
[00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.900]  Professor Daniel Lee.
[00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.900]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.900]  I grapple with what have been
[00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.900]  my most urgent concerns
[00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.900]  for some time,
[00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.900]  a culture of life
[00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.900]  stronger than the terror of death,
[00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.900]  a love for life
[00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.900]  that overcomes
[00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.900]  the destructive forces
[00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.900]  in our world today
[00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.900]  and a confidence
[00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.900]  in the future
[00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.900]  that overcomes anxiety
[00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.900]  and fatalism.
[00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.900]  These issues are for me
[00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.900]  most urgent
[00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.900]  because with a poet,
[00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.900]  Friedrich Hölderlin,
[00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.900]  I believe strongly
[00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.900]  that where there is danger,
[00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.900]  salvation also grows.
[00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.900]  We should inquire
[00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.900]  whether it,
[00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.900]  to what extent,
[00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.900]  this hope will wait
[00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.900]  as we explore the possibilities
[00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.900]  of a culture of life
[00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.900]  and of a future.
[00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:00.900]  In the face of the real annihilation
[00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:05.900]  with which our world is threatened,
[00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.900]  I will begin by addressing
[00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.900]  some of the dangers of our time
[00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.900]  in part one.
[00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.900]  And in part two,
[00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.900]  I will offer some answers
[00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.900]  by considering dimensions
[00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.900]  of the world
[00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.900]  capable of supporting life
[00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.900]  and in a quite literal sense,
[00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:41.900]  a world that is worth of our love.
[00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.900]  And in the end,
[00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.900]  I'll return to the first verse
[00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:52.900]  of the poem by Hölderlin.
[00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:54.900]  Life is God,
[00:06:54.900 --> 00:07:00.900]  but difficult to grasp.
[00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.900]  Part one.
[00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:08.900]  The terror of universal death.
[00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.900]  Number one.
[00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:16.900]  Life is today in danger.
[00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:18.900]  It is not in danger
[00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:21.900]  because it is mortal.
[00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:27.900]  Human life has always been mortal.
[00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:29.900]  It is in danger
[00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:34.900]  because it is no longer loved,
[00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:40.900]  in respected and affirmed and accepted.
[00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:44.900]  The French author Albert Camus
[00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.900]  wrote after World War II,
[00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:52.900]  This is the mystery of Europe.
[00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:57.900]  Life is no longer loved.
[00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:00.900]  The 20th century
[00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:06.900]  was a century of mass exterminations
[00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:10.900]  and mass executions.
[00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:15.900]  State terror from above.
[00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:19.900]  The beginning of the 20th,
[00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.900]  21st century
[00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:28.900]  saw private terror from below
[00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:31.900]  of senseless killings
[00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:36.900]  with suicide assassins.
[00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:43.900]  In the terror rest of the 21st century,
[00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:49.900]  a new religion of death is confronting us.
[00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:55.900]  I do not mean the religion of Islam,
[00:08:55.900 --> 00:09:01.900]  but rather the ideology of terror.
[00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:04.900]  Your young people love life,
[00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:13.900]  said the late Mullah Omar of the Taliban in Afghanistan.
[00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:18.900]  Our young people love death.
[00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:26.900]  After the mass murder in Madrid on March 11, 2004,
[00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:32.900]  there were acknowledgments by the terrorists
[00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:35.900]  with the same message.
[00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:42.900]  You love life, we love death.
[00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:48.900]  A German who joined the Taliban in Afghanistan
[00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:53.900]  declared, "We don't want to win.
[00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:58.900]  We want to kill and be killed."
[00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:07.900]  Why? I think because they view killing as power
[00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:16.900]  and they experience themselves as gods over their enemies
[00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:27.900]  and they love publicity and this they get.
[00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:33.900]  This seems to be the modern terrorist ideology
[00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:38.900]  of suicide assassins.
[00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:44.900]  I remember we had this love of death in Europe
[00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:52.900]  some 70 or 80 years ago.
[00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:59.900]  "Viva la muerte" cried an old fascist general
[00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:03.900]  in the Spanish Civil War.
[00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:06.900]  Long live death.
[00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:13.900]  And the German SS troops in the Second World War
[00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:20.900]  had the saying, "Death gives and death takes away."
[00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:27.900]  And wore the symbol of the skull and the bones.
[00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:35.900]  It is not possible to deter suicide assassins
[00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:40.900]  for they have broken the fear of death.
[00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:44.900]  They don't love life anymore.
[00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:50.900]  They want to die with their victims.
[00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:58.900]  Second, behind this terrorist ideological surface
[00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:04.900]  a greater danger is hidden.
[00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:12.900]  Peace, disarmament, and non-proliferation
[00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:17.900]  treaties between the nations
[00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:21.900]  share an obvious assumption
[00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:29.900]  namely that on both sides there is a will to survive
[00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:33.900]  and a will to live.
[00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:39.900]  Yet what happens if one partner
[00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:43.900]  does not want to survive
[00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:49.900]  but is willing to die is through death.
[00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:55.900]  That partner can destroy this whole wicked
[00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.900]  or godless world.
[00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:04.900]  Until now we have had to deal only
[00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:14.900]  with an international network of suicide assassins
[00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:18.900]  overcome by a death wish.
[00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:26.900]  What happens when a nation possessing nuclear weapons
[00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:32.900]  becomes obsessed with this religion of death
[00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:39.900]  and turns into a collective suicide assassin
[00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:44.900]  against the rest of the human world
[00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:49.900]  because it is driven into a corner
[00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:52.900]  and gives up all hope.
[00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:57.900]  Deterrence works only so long
[00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:02.900]  as all partners have the will to live
[00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:06.900]  and want to survive.
[00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:15.900]  When it is of no matter whether one lives or dies
[00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:24.900]  one has lost the fear that is necessary for deterrence.
[00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:33.900]  Whoever is convinced for ideological or religious reasons
[00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:39.900]  that he or she must become a sacrifice
[00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:43.900]  in order to save the world
[00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:48.900]  can no longer be threatened with death.
[00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:57.900]  The one who clamors for the great war or the end war
[00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:03.900]  even if it means one's own destruction
[00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:08.900]  is beyond deterrence.
[00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:13.900]  The attraction of destroying a world
[00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:22.900]  that is considered rotten or disordered or godless
[00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:30.900]  can obviously grow into a universal death wish
[00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:37.900]  to which one sacrifices one's own life.
[00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:43.900]  Death then becomes this fascinating divinity
[00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:49.900]  inflaming a desire for destruction.
[00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:54.900]  This apocalyptic religion of death
[00:15:54.900 --> 00:16:00.900]  is a real enemy of the will to live
[00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:09.900]  the love of life and the affirmation of being.
[00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:17.900]  Number three, the suicide program.
[00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:22.900]  Behind this present political danger
[00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:28.900]  endangering the common life of the nations
[00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:35.900]  there is still an older threat lurking
[00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:39.900]  the nuclear threat.
[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:45.900]  The first atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima
[00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:49.900]  in August 1945
[00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:55.900]  brought the world war to an end.
[00:16:55.900 --> 00:17:00.900]  At the same time is marked the beginning
[00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:07.900]  of the end time for the whole of humankind.
[00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:11.900]  The end time is in the age
[00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:20.900]  in which the end of humankind is possible at any moment.
[00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:27.900]  No human being could survive the nuclear winter
[00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:35.900]  that would follow a great atomic war.
[00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:41.900]  Remember humankind was at the cusp
[00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:45.900]  of such a great atomic war
[00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:48.900]  for more than 40 years
[00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:52.900]  during the cold war time.
[00:17:52.900 --> 00:18:01.900]  It is true that since the end of the cold war in 1990
[00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:08.900]  the great atomic war is not as likely.
[00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:16.900]  We live in relative peace.
[00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:24.900]  Yet there are so many atomic and hydrogen bombs
[00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:30.900]  stored up in the arsenals of the great nations
[00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:34.900]  and some smaller ones as well
[00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:40.900]  that the self annihilation of humankind
[00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:46.900]  remains a distinct possibility.
[00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:52.900]  The Russian atomic scientist Sakharov
[00:18:52.900 --> 00:19:00.900]  called it collective suicide of humankind.
[00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:07.900]  Whoever fires first dies second.
[00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:10.900]  For those 40 years
[00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:21.900]  we depended on mutual destruction for security.
[00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:27.900]  Most people had forgotten this atomic threat
[00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:38.900]  until President Barack Obama in 2009 speech
[00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:42.900]  lived in Prague
[00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:51.900]  revived the old dream of the world free of atomic bombs
[00:19:51.900 --> 00:20:01.900]  and started new disarmament negotiations with Russia.
[00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:14.900]  But in 2017 Donald Trump threatened North Korea
[00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:24.900]  with fury and fire with atomic bombs.
[00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:32.900]  Then many of us became aware again of this destiny
[00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:38.900]  hanging like a dark cloud over the nations.
[00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:47.900]  Strangely enough we feel the presence of the nuclear threat
[00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:58.900]  publicly in what American psychologists call nuclear numbing.
[00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:02.900]  We repress our anxiety
[00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:06.900]  try to forget this threat
[00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:13.900]  and live if this danger were not there.
[00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:22.900]  Yet it is gnawing at our subconsciousness
[00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:29.900]  in impairing our love of life.
[00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:36.900]  Number four, the social conditions of misery.
[00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:43.900]  A general impairment of life also exists
[00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:48.900]  in the miserable social conditions.
[00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:54.900]  For more than 40 years we have heard repeatedly
[00:21:54.900 --> 00:22:04.900]  and everywhere the charge that despite of all political efforts
[00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:12.900]  the social gap between the rich and the poor is widening.
[00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:20.900]  It is not just in the poorer countries of the third world
[00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:27.900]  that a small rich sector of the population
[00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:33.900]  rules over the masses of the poor.
[00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:38.900]  In the democracies of the developed world
[00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:51.900]  the financial asset gap between financiers on the one hand
[00:22:51.900 --> 00:23:01.900]  and low income workers, welfare recipients, the unemployed
[00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:12.900]  and those not able to work on the other hand takes on obscene proportions.
[00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:20.900]  Yet democracy is grounded not only in the freedom of the citizens
[00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:30.900]  but also in the equality without social justice in life opportunities.
[00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:39.900]  In the comparability of life circumstances
[00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:50.900]  the common will dies and with it what holds a society together falls apart.
[00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:54.900]  Trust is lost.
[00:23:54.900 --> 00:24:07.900]  Since the democratic revolutions in England, the United States and France
[00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:14.900]  the political task in the European states
[00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:25.900]  has been the balancing of individual freedom and social equity.
[00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:34.900]  The deregulation of the economy and fiscal institutions
[00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:45.900]  wrought by American politics with all its destructive consequences
[00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:53.900]  has led to an imbalance between freedom and equality
[00:24:53.900 --> 00:25:00.900]  that has become life threatening for many people.
[00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:08.900]  It has led to the disempowerment and poverty.
[00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:16.900]  A capitalism that is no longer politically controllable
[00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:25.900]  through the common wealth becomes an enemy of democracy
[00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:33.900]  because it destroys the common meaning of a society.
[00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:41.900]  Climbing on the social ladder brings anxiety.
[00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:48.900]  In the modern competitive society
[00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:56.900]  the loser creates the force of the winner.
[00:25:56.900 --> 00:26:01.900]  The winner creates the anxiety of life.
[00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:06.900]  The anxiety of life creates nothing
[00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:15.900]  but the anxiety of existence for modern human beings.
[00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:25.900]  Yet is anxiety a good incentive for life, for work and for happiness?
[00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:27.900]  I doubt.
[00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:39.900]  At the end, the ecological conditions of world destruction
[00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:52.900]  unlike the nuclear threat, climate change is not only a threat
[00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:59.900]  but already an emerging reality everywhere.
[00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:05.900]  It is not only a latent problem
[00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:13.900]  but also very much a matter of public consciousness.
[00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:24.900]  People know it because they can see it, feel it and sometimes smell it.
[00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:34.900]  The biosphere of the planet Earth is the only space we have for life.
[00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:46.900]  The globalization of the human civilization has reached its limits
[00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:55.900]  and is beginning to alter the conditions of life on Earth.
[00:27:55.900 --> 00:28:01.900]  The destruction of the environment
[00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:10.900]  that we are causing through our present global economic system
[00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:21.900]  will undoubtedly, seriously jeopardize the survival of humanity
[00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:25.900]  in the 21st century.
[00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:37.900]  Modern industrial society is thrown out of the balance,
[00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:44.900]  the equilibrium of the Earth organism
[00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:52.900]  and is on the way to the universal ecological death.
[00:28:52.900 --> 00:29:00.900]  Unless we can change the way things are developing.
[00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:10.900]  Year after year, vulnerable species of animals and plants die out.
[00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:26.900]  Scientists have shown that certain chemical emissions are destroying the ozone layer
[00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:37.900]  while the use of chemical fertilizers and a multitude of pesticides
[00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:47.900]  is polluting our drinking water and making the soil infertile.
[00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:54.900]  They have shown that the global climate is already changing
[00:29:54.900 --> 00:30:04.900]  so that we are now experiencing an increasing number of
[00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:09.900]  so-called natural catastrophes
[00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:21.900]  such as droughts and floods, expanding deserts and incessant storms.
[00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:34.900]  These are not simply natural but also caused by human activities.
[00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:40.900]  All in all, life on Earth is under threat.
[00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:45.900]  Why is this so?
[00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:56.900]  This is some irony, I say, some do not know what they are doing
[00:30:56.900 --> 00:31:04.900]  while others do not know what they are knowing.
[00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:13.900]  This ecological crisis is fundamentally a crisis
[00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:22.900]  wrought by the Western scientific and technological civilization.
[00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:32.900]  Yet it is a mistake to think that our environmental problems
[00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:41.900]  are problems for the industrialized countries of the region.
[00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:51.900]  On the contrary, ecological catastrophes are increasing even more
[00:31:51.900 --> 00:32:03.900]  in the midst of a rising global economic and social crisis in their development.
[00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:16.900]  Indira Gandhi was right when she said poverty is the worst pollution.
[00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:25.900]  Despite the well-known document of limits of growth,
[00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:33.900]  the ideology of permanent growth continues.
[00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:39.900]  We know all this, but we are paralyzed
[00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:47.900]  and do not change our economy or our lifestyle.
[00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:55.900]  This paralysis will be called ecological numbing.
[00:32:55.900 --> 00:33:01.900]  Nothing accelerates an imminent catastrophe
[00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:08.900]  so much as the paralysis of doing nothing.
[00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:20.900]  We do not know whether humanity will survive this self-made destiny.
[00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:25.900]  This is actually a good thing.
[00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:35.900]  If we knew with certainty that we would not survive,
[00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:38.900]  we would do nothing.
[00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:44.900]  If we knew with certainty that we will survive,
[00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:48.900]  we would also do nothing.
[00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:55.900]  Only if the future is open for both possibilities
[00:33:55.900 --> 00:34:05.900]  are we forced to do today what is necessary to survive tomorrow.
[00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:13.900]  We cannot know whether humankind will survive,
[00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:22.900]  so we must act today as if the future of life depends on us
[00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:33.900]  and trust at the same time that our children will survive.
[00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:41.900]  But must a human race exist and survive
[00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:49.900]  or are we just an accident of nature?
[00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:53.900]  We can ask cynically,
[00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:59.900]  didn't the dinosaurs come and go?
[00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:07.900]  So it ends with the question of existence,
[00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:13.900]  whether humanity should be or not be.
[00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:19.900]  That is a humbled question of our days.
[00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:27.900]  More than 8 billion human beings already live on earth today.
[00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:34.900]  This number will likely grow rapidly.
[00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:40.900]  An alternative for the future
[00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:47.900]  is that the earth could be uninhabited.
[00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:52.900]  The earth existed without human beings
[00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:58.900]  for more than millions of years
[00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:04.900]  and may survive perhaps for millions of years
[00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:10.900]  after the human race disappears.
[00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:16.900]  This raises the even deeper question,
[00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:22.900]  are we human beings on earth only by chance
[00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:33.900]  or are we human beings a necessary result of the evolution?
[00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:41.900]  If nature would show a strong anthropic principle,
[00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:49.900]  we could feel at home in the universe with Stuart Kaufman.
[00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:59.900]  If such a stark anthropological principle cannot be proved,
[00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:09.900]  the universe gives no answer to this existential question of humankind.
[00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:24.900]  Looking to the universe for an answer to the question of a reason for being,
[00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:32.900]  we encounter the sad conjecture of Steven Weinberg.
[00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:38.900]  The more the universe seems comprehensible,
[00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:45.900]  the more it also seems pointless.
[00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:50.900]  The silence of the world's expanses
[00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:59.900]  and the coldness of the universe can lead to our despondence.
[00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:06.900]  In any case,neither the stars nor our genes
[00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:15.900]  say whether human beings should be there or not.
[00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:25.900]  How can we love life and affirm our being as humans
[00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:31.900]  if humanity is only an accident of nature,
[00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:39.900]  so perfidious and without relevance for the universe,
[00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:46.900]  but is only a mistake of the evolution?
[00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:54.900]  Is there a duty to be as Hans Jonas claimed?
[00:38:54.900 --> 00:39:04.900]  Is there any reason to love life and affirm human beings
[00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:13.900]  if we find no answer to this existential question
[00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:21.900]  every culture of life is uncertain in its fundamentals
[00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:26.900]  and built on shaky grounds?
[00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:31.900]  With this I start part two.
[00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:39.900]  A culture of life must be a culture of common life
[00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:45.900]  in the human and the natural world.
[00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:54.900]  First point,can we live with a bomb?
[00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:58.900]  Are the dangers growing faster
[00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:04.900]  than what can save us?
[00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:11.900]  I think we can grow in wisdom,but how?
[00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:19.900]  President Obama's dream of a world without atomic weapons
[00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:25.900]  is an honorable one,but only a dream.
[00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:32.900]  Human beings will never again become incapable
[00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:36.900]  of what they can do now.
[00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:44.900]  Whoever has learned the formula of atomic fission
[00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:47.900]  will never forget.
[00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:52.900]  Since Hiroshima in 1945,
[00:40:52.900 --> 00:41:01.900]  human kind has lost its atomic innocence.
[00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:06.900]  Yet the atomic end time
[00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:13.900]  is also the first common age of the nations.
[00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:21.900]  All the nations are sitting in the same boat.
[00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:26.900]  We all share the same threat.
[00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:33.900]  Everyone can become the victim.
[00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:37.900]  In this new situation,
[00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:42.900]  human kind must organize itself
[00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:47.900]  as the subject of common survival.
[00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:55.900]  The foundation of the United Nations in 1945
[00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:58.900]  was a first step.
[00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:03.900]  International security partnership
[00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:10.900]  can serve peace and give us time to live.
[00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:13.900]  And someday,
[00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:21.900]  perhaps a transnational unification of humankind
[00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:29.900]  will keep the means of nuclear destruction under control.
[00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:34.900]  By science and technology,
[00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:40.900]  we learned to gain power over nature.
[00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:43.900]  But by wisdom,
[00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:50.900]  we learned to gain moral control of our powers.
[00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:58.900]  The development of public and political wisdom
[00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:07.900]  is as important as the scientific progress.
[00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:12.900]  The first lesson we learned is this.
[00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:20.900]  Deterrence does not secure peace anymore.
[00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:29.900]  Only justice serves peace between the nations.
[00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:34.900]  There is no way to peace in our world
[00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:38.900]  except through just action
[00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:44.900]  and harmonious balance of interests.
[00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:49.900]  Peace is not the absence of violence,
[00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:56.900]  but the presence of justice.
[00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:59.900]  Peace is a process,
[00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:04.900]  not a property of one nation.
[00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:11.900]  Peace is a common way of reducing violence
[00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:16.900]  and constructing justice
[00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:26.900]  in the social and global relationships of humankind.
[00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:29.900]  Point two.
[00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:36.900]  Social justice creates social peace.
[00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:43.900]  The gap between the poor and the rich widens.
[00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:52.900]  But the alternative to poverty is not poverty.
[00:44:52.900 --> 00:45:01.900]  The alternative to poverty and poverty is community.
[00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:05.900]  One can live in poverty
[00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:11.900]  when it is born in common with others
[00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:14.900]  as was the case in Europe
[00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:22.900]  in the years of hunger after the World War II.
[00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:31.900]  It is injustice that makes poverty insufferable.
[00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:37.900]  The spirit of communal solidarity
[00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:42.900]  and mutual help was demolished
[00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:46.900]  by the flight from Texas
[00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:53.900]  which in turn aroused the anger of the people.
[00:45:53.900 --> 00:46:01.900]  If everyone is in the same situation
[00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:06.900]  then all give mutual help.
[00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:16.900]  Remove equality because one wins and the other loses
[00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:22.900]  then mutual help also vanishes.
[00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:27.900]  By community I here mean
[00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:34.900]  the visible community of solidarity
[00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:41.900]  as well as the inner togetherness of society
[00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:47.900]  in social balance and social freedom.
[00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:53.900]  It is not in the end the football games
[00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:57.900]  that unite a society.
[00:46:57.900 --> 00:47:01.900]  It is social justice
[00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:08.900]  that creates lasting social peace.
[00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:12.900]  The individualism that says
[00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:22.900]  everyone is his or her own neighbor
[00:47:22.900 --> 00:47:30.900]  looking out for himself and herself
[00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:35.900]  makes the human beings powerless.
[00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:39.900]  The fragmenting of work
[00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:44.900]  by making it temporarily insecure
[00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:47.900]  and without benefits
[00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:53.900]  harms the life planning of those
[00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:58.900]  at the mercy of the system
[00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:02.900]  and destroys their future.
[00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:07.900]  In communities of solidarity
[00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:12.900]  human beings are strong and wealthy
[00:48:12.900 --> 00:48:17.900]  that is wealthy in relationships
[00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:20.900]  with neighbors and friends
[00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:24.900]  companions and colleagues
[00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:28.900]  of which one can depend.
[00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:34.900]  They are thus made strong
[00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:37.900]  by being recognized
[00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:41.900]  and by being esteemed as worthy.
[00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:45.900]  Many helpful actions
[00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:50.900]  emerge in such communities
[00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:55.900]  as child care, care of the sick
[00:48:55.900 --> 00:49:00.900]  and care of the aged, associations
[00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:07.900]  of the handicapped and the health peace movement.
[00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:11.900]  Market position and competition
[00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:17.900]  are certainly strong incentives for work
[00:49:17.900 --> 00:49:23.900]  but they remain humane
[00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:28.900]  only in the framework of a common life
[00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:33.900]  and that means only in the bounds
[00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:39.900]  of social and ecological justice.
[00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:43.900]  There are dimensions of life
[00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:47.900]  that may not be determined
[00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:51.900]  by the market logic
[00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:56.900]  because they follow other laws.
[00:49:56.900 --> 00:50:04.900]  Patients are not customers of doctors and nurses
[00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:10.900]  and students are not consumers of science
[00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:16.900]  and research in our universities.
[00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:26.900]  Security must not be a private property
[00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:30.900]  and the reverence for life
[00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:34.900]  because human society
[00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:40.900]  is a natural environment
[00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:45.900]  for a total life system
[00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:51.900]  where there is a crisis of dying in nature
[00:50:51.900 --> 00:50:57.900]  a crisis of the whole life system
[00:50:57.900 --> 00:51:01.900]  emerges as well.
[00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:08.900]  We call today the ecological crisis
[00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:14.900]  is not only a crisis in our environment
[00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:20.900]  but also a total crisis of our life system
[00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:28.900]  and cannot be solved by technological means alone.
[00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:35.900]  It also demands a change in our lifestyle
[00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:40.900]  and a change in the basic values
[00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:45.900]  and convictions of our society.
[00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:50.900]  Modern industrial societies
[00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:53.900]  are no longer in harmony
[00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:59.900]  with the cycles and rhythms of the earth
[00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:07.900]  as was the case in pre-modern agrarian societies.
[00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:16.900]  Modern societies are predicated on progress
[00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:22.900]  and expansion of the projects of humanity.
[00:52:22.900 --> 00:52:29.900]  We reduce the nature of the earth
[00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:33.900]  to our environment
[00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:40.900]  and destroy the life space of other forms of life.
[00:52:40.900 --> 00:52:46.900]  Nothing works so much destruction
[00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:56.900]  as with using nature to more than an environment for humans.
[00:52:56.900 --> 00:53:06.900]  We need a change from modern domination of nature
[00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:10.900]  to the reverence for life
[00:53:10.900 --> 00:53:14.900]  as Albert Schweitzer teaches us.
[00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:23.900]  Reverence for life is respect for every single form of life
[00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:31.900]  and for our common life in the human and the natural world
[00:53:31.900 --> 00:53:37.900]  and for the great community of all the living.
[00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:43.900]  The post-modern life centrism
[00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:49.900]  will have to replace the western and modern
[00:53:49.900 --> 00:53:54.900]  anthropocentrism of culture.
[00:53:54.900 --> 00:54:03.900]  Of course we cannot return to the cosmos orientation
[00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:10.900]  of the ancient and pre-modern agrarian world
[00:54:10.900 --> 00:54:17.900]  but we can begin the necessary
[00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:25.900]  ecological transformation of our industrial world.
[00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:32.900]  For this we must change our concept of time.
[00:54:32.900 --> 00:54:37.900]  The linear concept of progress
[00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:43.900]  in production, consumption and waste
[00:54:43.900 --> 00:54:50.900]  has the future, the present and the past
[00:54:50.900 --> 00:54:58.900]  must give way to the concept of the cyclical time
[00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:03.900]  of renewable energy
[00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:08.900]  and the recycling economy.
[00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:13.900]  Only this cycles of life
[00:55:13.900 --> 00:55:20.900]  can give stability to our world of progress.
[00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:25.900]  Yet as long as the children of Ghana
[00:55:25.900 --> 00:55:29.900]  bear the burden of recycling
[00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:33.900]  or electronic scrap
[00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:39.900]  we must say that the recycling economy
[00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:46.900]  is still the economy of the poor people.
[00:55:46.900 --> 00:55:59.900]  The 2000s charter points in the right direction.
[00:55:59.900 --> 00:56:03.900]  Humanity is part of nature
[00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:08.900]  or other life forms of nature
[00:56:08.900 --> 00:56:13.900]  have their worth independent of their worth
[00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:16.900]  for human beings.
[00:56:16.900 --> 00:56:19.900]  We are part of nature
[00:56:19.900 --> 00:56:23.900]  and can only survive
[00:56:23.900 --> 00:56:32.900]  by preserving nature's integrity.
[00:56:32.900 --> 00:56:40.900]  The last part, the love of life in times of danger.
[00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:46.900]  Human being is not only a gift of life
[00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:52.900]  but also a task of being human.
[00:56:52.900 --> 00:57:00.900]  To accept this task of humanity in times of terror
[00:57:00.900 --> 00:57:07.900]  requires the strength of life
[00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:11.900]  and the courage to be.
[00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:17.900]  Life must be a front against terror
[00:57:17.900 --> 00:57:20.900]  to say simply
[00:57:20.900 --> 00:57:25.900]  life must be lived
[00:57:25.900 --> 00:57:29.900]  and then the beloved life
[00:57:29.900 --> 00:57:32.900]  will be stronger
[00:57:32.900 --> 00:57:39.900]  than the threat of universal annihilation.
[00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:46.900]  I see three major factors
[00:57:46.900 --> 00:57:50.900]  for this courage to be
[00:57:50.900 --> 00:57:54.900]  and this courage to live.
[00:57:54.900 --> 00:57:59.900]  First, human life must be affirmed
[00:57:59.900 --> 00:58:06.900]  because it can also be denied.
[00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:13.900]  As we know, a child can only grow
[00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:20.900]  and live in an atmosphere of affirmation
[00:58:20.900 --> 00:58:25.900]  and an atmosphere of rejection
[00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:32.900]  that child will fade away in soul and body.
[00:58:32.900 --> 00:58:37.900]  If experiencing affirmation
[00:58:37.900 --> 00:58:41.900]  is the occasion for a child
[00:58:41.900 --> 00:58:47.900]  to affirm himself or herself.
[00:58:47.900 --> 00:58:50.900]  What is true for a child
[00:58:50.900 --> 00:58:53.900]  is true for human beings
[00:58:53.900 --> 00:58:56.900]  throughout their lives.
[00:58:56.900 --> 00:59:03.900]  We are accepted, appreciated and affirmed.
[00:59:03.900 --> 00:59:07.900]  We are motivated to live
[00:59:07.900 --> 00:59:13.900]  where we feel a hostile world of contempt
[00:59:13.900 --> 00:59:17.900]  and rejection and mistrust.
[00:59:17.900 --> 00:59:25.900]  We retire into ourselves and become defensive.
[00:59:25.900 --> 00:59:31.900]  We need a strong affirmation of life
[00:59:31.900 --> 00:59:37.900]  that can deal with such negations of life.
[00:59:37.900 --> 00:59:42.900]  Each year to life is stronger
[00:59:42.900 --> 00:59:47.900]  than every negation of life
[00:59:47.900 --> 00:59:52.900]  because it can create something new
[00:59:52.900 --> 00:59:56.900]  against the negations.
[00:59:56.900 --> 01:00:02.900]  Second, human life is participation.
[01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:05.900]  We become alive
[01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:10.900]  where we feel the sympathy of others
[01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:13.900]  and we stay alive
[01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:18.900]  where we share our life with others.
[01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:24.900]  As long as we are interested, we are alive.
[01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:30.900]  The counterproof can be easy to make.
[01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:35.900]  Indifference leads to apathy
[01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:41.900]  and apathy is a sickness unto death.
[01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:46.900]  Complete lack of participation
[01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:51.900]  is completely unlived life.
[01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:56.900]  Third, human life is a life
[01:00:56.900 --> 01:01:01.900]  in the pursuit of fulfillment.
[01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:06.900]  Human life gains its dynamic
[01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:11.900]  from this inborn striving.
[01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:15.900]  The pursuit of happiness
[01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:20.900]  is since the writing of the Declaration
[01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:24.900]  of Independence of America
[01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:29.900]  one essential human right
[01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:33.900]  to pursue one's happiness
[01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:38.900]  is not only a private human right
[01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:43.900]  but also a public human right.
[01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:47.900]  We speak of a good life
[01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:50.900]  and we mean a life
[01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:55.900]  that lives out its best potential
[01:01:55.900 --> 01:02:01.900]  in the public life of a good society.
[01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:08.900]  When we take this pursuit of happiness seriously
[01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:13.900]  we encounter the misfortune
[01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:18.900]  of the masses of poor and sick people
[01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:24.900]  and to begin to suffer with the unfortunate.
[01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:29.900]  The compassion by which we are drawn
[01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:33.900]  into their passion of life
[01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:41.900]  is the reverse side of the pursuit of happiness.
[01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:49.900]  The more we become capable of the happiness of life
[01:02:49.900 --> 01:03:00.900]  the more we become also capable of sorrow and compassion.
[01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:07.900]  This is the great dialectic of human life.
[01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:14.900]  But where there is danger, salvation also grows.
[01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:19.900]  How is salvation growing?
[01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:28.900]  I've tried to show how being can take in non-being
[01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:35.900]  and how life can overcome death through love
[01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:43.900]  and how deadly contradictions can change into a life.
[01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:49.900]  And how death can change into a protective differences
[01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:57.900]  and higher forms of living and community.
[01:03:57.900 --> 01:04:04.900]  Near is God and difficult to grasp.
[01:04:04.900 --> 01:04:11.900]  Here at the end I will allow the theologian
[01:04:11.900 --> 01:04:17.900]  with declarations of Christian faith.
[01:04:17.900 --> 01:04:25.900]  Should humanity be or I be superfluous?
[01:04:25.900 --> 01:04:33.900]  Is there a duty to survive or our life and death
[01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:38.900]  simply take or leave it matter?
[01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:43.900]  In the evolution of life,
[01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:52.900]  are we an accident or a mistake of life?
[01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:58.900]  The existential questions of humankind
[01:04:58.900 --> 01:05:05.900]  are not only answered by rational arguments.
[01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:12.900]  But first of all by pre-rational assurance
[01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:21.900]  or a lack of assurance that leads the interest of our reason.
[01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:26.900]  Difficult to grasp is God.
[01:05:26.900 --> 01:05:38.900]  Not because God is distant from us human beings
[01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:47.900]  but rather near and therefore difficult to grasp.
[01:05:47.900 --> 01:05:55.900]  What is near indeed nearer to us than we ourselves
[01:05:55.900 --> 01:06:00.900]  is not to be grasped by us.
[01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:07.900]  We would need distance for that.
[01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:14.900]  If we were however grasped by the nearness of God
[01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:23.900]  we would know the answer to our existential questions.
[01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:29.900]  In the eternal yes of the living God
[01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:36.900]  we affirm our fragile and vulnerable humanity
[01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:43.900]  in spite of death and say yes to life.
[01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:47.900]  In the eternal love of God
[01:06:47.900 --> 01:06:55.900]  we love life and resist its devastations.
[01:06:55.900 --> 01:07:02.900]  In the ungraspable nearness of God
[01:07:02.900 --> 01:07:12.900]  we trust in what is saving even if dangers are growing.
[01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:15.900]  Here ends the lecture.
[01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:24.900]  (掌声)
