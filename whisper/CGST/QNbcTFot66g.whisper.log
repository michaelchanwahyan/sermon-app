[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.680]   Brothers and sisters in Christ, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to tonight's public lecture
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.440]   jointly organized by the China Graduate School of Theology and the Langham Foundation Hong
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:29.400]   Kong, featuring our distinguished guest speaker tonight, Reverend Dr. Munta Isaac.
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.960]   My name is Simon Cheung, a member of the Old Testament Faculty of Teaching at this school.
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.000]   It's my honor tonight to introduce our speaker to you.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:48.040]   Dr. Isaac is currently the academic dean at Bethlehem Bible College, an evangelical seminary
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.280]   founded by Palestinian Christians in 1979.
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.800]   As the seminary, he is also the director of the seminary choir, and over the dinner, he
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:06.380]   told us that he used to compose music for the choir to sing, so he is richly talented
[00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.440]   in music as well.
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:14.600]   He's also the current director of the conference called Christ at the Checkpoint.
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:21.240]   May I quote from Paul Alexander, who edited a volume of the essays presented at this conference
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.440]   in 2010, to see how he described this event.
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:32.800]   He begins to quote, "The Palestinian Christians who organized the conference are motivated
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:40.480]   by their love for God, their love for Israelis, and their love for fellow Palestinians."
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:48.640]   The conference is described as a labor of love of those who prayerfully seek justice
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:56.440]   and reconciliation done among the Palestinian and Israeli communities in the land of constant
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.320]   conflicts.
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:05.560]   The ministry of Musalaha, so it is called, and Dr. Isaac is actively involved in this
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.560]   work.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:14.040]   Dr. Isaac did his first theological training at Westminster Theological Seminary, and later
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:20.220]   on continued with his doctorate studies at Oxford Center of Mission Studies.
[00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:27.200]   He wrote his thesis under two supervisors, one from Oxford and one from Cambridge, and
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:35.640]   completed his studies in 2014, and with remarkable and admirable efficiency, published it in
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:43.720]   2015 under the title, "From Land to Lands, from Eden to the Renewed Earth, a Price Center
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.920]   for Biblical Theology and the Promised Land."
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.040]   A sample of it I'm holding in my hand, and there are only a few copies left downstairs
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.960]   at the bookstore, so be quick to grab one after the lecture.
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:05.000]   May I quote again from another of Dr. Isaac's essay, which begins with this observation.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.520]   He says, "Palestinian Christians have struggled for many years with the Old Testament in general,
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.400]   and with the theology of the land in particular."
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.880]   Clearly enough, Dr. Isaac's work tackles right at the heart of the most difficult problem
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.400]   of Christian faith faced by his Palestinian people.
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:35.240]   Tonight, he'll share with us his insights gleaned from his studies and his ministry
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:41.520]   under the topic, "Towards a Shared Land Theology, a Palestinian Christian Reading of the Land
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.520]   Promises."
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:49.400]   His talk will be followed by a Q&A section immediately afterward.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:04:01.120]   Without further ado, shall we welcome Reverend Dr. Muntir Isaac with our warmest applause?
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.640]   [applause]
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.760]   Thank you very much for this introduction.
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.160]   For a while, I didn't recognize myself.
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:20.920]   I really appreciate that kind introduction, and thank you for coming this evening to listen
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.240]   to my presentation on the theology of the land.
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:30.960]   I've been in Hong Kong for a week, and really we've been overwhelmed with your kindness,
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.200]   your generosity, and hospitality.
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:39.240]   And I want to thank you again from the bottom of my heart for all the support you've shown
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.880]   me personally and my family, and also the church in Palestine as well.
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:54.240]   Yes, the title of my talk is "Towards a Shared Land Theology," and clearly the theology of
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:02.080]   the land is something we have struggled with as Palestinian Christians for many, many years.
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:09.000]   The creation of the State of Israel created a dilemma for Palestinian Christians.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:19.040]   Today we live in a reality that is pretty much characterized by division, by separation,
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.640]   and by a dispute over land.
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:29.680]   More than often that dispute was violent and resulted in clashes, attacks.
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.920]   And in my very young life, I've witnessed so many uprisings and demonstrations and fights
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.880]   over that land.
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.280]   Today if you come to Palestine and Israel, you will be struck by the separation wall
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:50.080]   that divides the two people, a physical wall that reflects a more deeper reality of spiritual
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.960]   and psychological separation between two peoples.
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:02.160]   And just to give you an idea why this topic, the theology of the land, was or has been
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:08.720]   a challenging one for Palestinian Christians, as you quoted, I always like to begin my talk
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:14.960]   with referencing to the story of a friend of mine, a church member, who owns land that
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:21.400]   inherited, he inherited and his family from their grandparents, a Palestinian Christian.
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:27.480]   This land is under threat of being confiscated by Jewish settlers, supported by the Israeli
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.120]   military.
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:34.280]   And in their effort to keep their land, they fight in court and they maintain papers that
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:39.640]   all prove their possession of the land for centuries, papers that date back all the way
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:43.040]   to the days of the Ottoman Empire.
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:48.880]   And one day when the Jewish settlers arrived to their land, trying to uproot some trees
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:54.440]   and bulldoze their way, my friend stopped them and said, "Wait a minute, this is our
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.800]   land, we have papers."
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.920]   Jewish settlers responded, one of them by holding a Bible from his pocket and saying,
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:06.720]   "This is our land, we have papers as well."
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:12.760]   And this tells you how the Bible is used today in Palestine and Israel, but try at the same
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:17.880]   time to imagine what does that make to my Palestinian Christian friend and to the Palestinian
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:18.880]   Christian community.
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:23.640]   This is the Bible we worship from, this is the Bible we meet God in, this is the source
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.360]   of our faith.
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.660]   And all of a sudden that Bible became a threat to us.
[00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:33.800]   And that's why many Palestinian Christians today struggle with the Old Testament, with
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.940]   the promises, with the story of Israel.
[00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:43.720]   And that's why someone like me decided to spend my PhD time working on that theme, the
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.880]   theology of the land.
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:54.160]   The theme continues to be disputed today, even many Muslims claim that the land belongs
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.760]   to them by divine claim.
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:05.360]   Not all, and of course not all Jews do what these Jewish settlers do, so don't understand
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:11.040]   from what I'm saying that all Jews are like this or all Muslims like this, but this reflects
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:17.400]   ideologies that exist today and many times these are the loudest voices that we hear
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:23.720]   and most certainly the most violent voices that we hear.
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:31.640]   Yet what interests us most today is the fact that many Christians hold strong beliefs of
[00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:33.520]   the land.
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:38.960]   And as I often say, with very little knowledge of what is happening on the ground and very
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:42.800]   little knowledge of the consequences of those beliefs.
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:48.840]   A very general theme is applied on these Christians, Christian Zionism, and basically Christian
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:57.120]   Zionism is the belief that any strand among Christianity that supports Israel for theological
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.040]   reasons.
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:05.280]   Christian Zionism is the default position of many Christians today and of most evangelical
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.280]   Christians.
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:12.680]   And to give you an idea of some of the presuppositions of Christian Zionism, many believe that if
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:19.560]   you bless Israel, God will bless you, and that if you stand against Israel, God will
[00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.080]   curse you.
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:29.120]   This is based on one interpretation to Genesis 12, 1 to 3, and of course I will present in
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:33.440]   my talk an alternative interpretation to that verse, which actually speaks about Abraham,
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:37.960]   the people of Israel, or their seed, but that's a different issue.
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:43.600]   They also assume that God gave the land to the Jewish people as an eternal possession.
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:49.360]   And as such, the Jews have a divine right to the land today.
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:54.440]   And notice with me the language of divine right, the language of eternal possession,
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.240]   which is very common used.
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:03.720]   And again, try to understand or try to put yourself in the place of a Palestinian or
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:08.880]   a Palestinian Christian when we hear claims like that.
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:13.720]   When we hear that someone else have a divine right to our land, what does that make us?
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:20.640]   It immediately puts us in this strange position of standing in opposition to God.
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:26.760]   And so today we continue to see debates among Christians such as that, do Jews have a divine
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:29.400]   right to Israel's land?
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:34.160]   And commonly the answer is yes, because they are the descendants of biblical Israel, and
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:40.960]   many people just draw a straight line from biblical Israel to the modern state of Israel
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:46.880]   with sometimes very tragic consequences on the Palestinian community.
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:53.760]   And again, this puts us in a crisis as Palestinian Christians.
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:11:00.240]   Christian Zionism is more than just a theological belief, because it's also a political movement,
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:05.040]   a political movement that lobbies on behalf of the state of Israel and funds the state
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:08.800]   of Israel with hundreds of millions of dollars every year.
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:15.640]   Some of it goes to the building of settlements that are illegal to international law, and
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:22.480]   many of them even are not willing to support mission among the Jewish people, but are willing
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:28.640]   to invest millions of dollars to the state of Israel.
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:33.320]   Of course, as I said, that theology, theology of Christian Zionism is a theology that is
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:38.400]   very problematic to Palestinian Christians, because it is a theology that marginalized
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.800]   us, often ignored us.
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:46.040]   You know, when you speak that Jews have a divine right to Israel's land, I always ask,
[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:48.360]   so what about the Palestinian?
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.080]   What about the Palestinian population?
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:55.880]   And that question is never or seldom addressed by Christian Zionists.
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:59.960]   They always pretend as if we don't exist.
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:05.480]   A very old slogan that was promoted by the Zionist movement and by Christian Zionists
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:10.280]   is a land without a people for a people without a land.
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:13.160]   Talking about our land as a land without a people.
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:19.960]   And in that sense, we are pretty much invisible to them or nonexistent.
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:28.680]   And in that I always say we have been dehumanized as Palestinians simply by that tradition.
[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:33.880]   And so what I would like to present with you today is a summary of my book.
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.360]   It's 400 pages.
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:41.840]   It's very ambitious to try to do so in the next 40 minutes or so.
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:47.120]   In what I called a shared land, a place in which we read the Bible and ask the question,
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:50.860]   is there a place for both people on the land?
[00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:56.400]   What is the place of land in the biblical story of salvation?
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:03.280]   I decided to study that theme and look carefully to scripture, and not simply ignore the Bible
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:07.240]   and say justice matters or human rights is more important.
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:13.920]   But to see really, is it true that our God, the God of the good news of salvation, the
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:18.720]   God who sent Jesus to die on the cross, is it true that he has promised our land to someone
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:22.520]   else and that we have no right in it today?
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:27.320]   And so I wanted to be faithful to our Christian heritage and study the Old Testament and the
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:31.720]   New Testament and look at the question on the land.
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:39.800]   And with that, I want to begin by looking at the Old Testament and asking some questions
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:44.560]   in dialogue with Christian Zionism.
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:50.040]   But really, these questions should guide us, as you will see, to understand the whole picture
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:57.160]   of salvation, the biblical story of redemption as we encounter it in scripture.
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:02.320]   These questions are whose land is it to begin with?
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:06.000]   What were the boundaries of the promised land?
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.760]   What is Israel or who is Israel in the Old Testament?
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:16.720]   Were the promises of the land unconditional or was it different?
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:21.760]   And the question that I feel very few people ask, and I try to address this in my book,
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.780]   why a land to begin with?
[00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:27.280]   Why did God promise Abraham a land?
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:30.640]   What's the purpose behind that promise?
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:35.320]   So now we go in with a journey trying to answer these questions from scripture.
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:36.320]   The first one is easy.
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:40.640]   I always tell my student, you don't need a PhD to answer the first question.
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:42.440]   The land belongs to God.
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:46.680]   It's God's land, okay?
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:49.120]   God created the earth and he owns it.
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.920]   It's his, okay?
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:55.240]   The earth is the Lord's, as the psalmist declared.
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.760]   To him belongs the heaven and heaven and heavens.
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:00.900]   The earth with all that is in it.
[00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.300]   We all belong to God.
[00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:03.840]   Our lands belong to God.
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:05.160]   The whole earth belongs to God.
[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:09.480]   And in particular, what really matters here is the promised land in particular in the
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:11.360]   story of Israel.
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:17.840]   God declared in Leviticus 25 that the land shall not be sold in perpetuity, for the land
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:18.840]   is mine.
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:22.880]   In other words, Israel, when I give you the land, it is not yours to do with it whatever
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:23.880]   you want.
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:25.200]   It remains my land.
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:31.040]   It's a very crucial basic point that we should start with.
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:35.400]   The land that God gives never becomes our possession.
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:41.680]   And if you know Leviticus 25, you know that this verse, "the land is mine," came in the
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.400]   context of the Jubilee.
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:49.320]   And the Jubilee is basically a reminder to Israel that the land is given to you for the
[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:52.440]   benefit of the community.
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:55.920]   You should distribute it equally among you.
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:16:00.760]   Every seven years, you let the land to rest, and that's a biblical mandate.
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:06.800]   Not only that, in the year, in the 50th year, after 50 years, if some of you became rich,
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:10.640]   some of you became poor, some of you had more land than the others, some of you became slave
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:16.320]   to others, you press the restart button and start from zero again.
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:21.040]   Redistribute the land equally so that we make sure no one is poor, no one is rich, so that
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:26.800]   we make sure no one owns the whole land and very few people own little land.
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:33.120]   And God reminds Israel here that even if you become rich and own land, it's not yours.
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:37.760]   The land belongs ultimately to God.
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:42.600]   This is a reminder to Israel that she does not own the land, for the land, as I said,
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:44.680]   belongs ultimately to God.
[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:50.560]   Israel is not free to do with the land whatever she wants or to claim eternal possession of
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:52.300]   it.
[00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:57.640]   These land Sabbath laws remind Israel that the land is not from Israel but is a gift
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:04.760]   to Israel and that the land is not fully given over for Israel's self-indulgence.
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:09.320]   This is a crucial point to begin with.
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:16.240]   My second point, what are the boundaries of the promised land and why?
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:22.800]   Interestingly, in scripture we find different descriptions of the borders of the land.
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:25.880]   It's never fixed.
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:30.640]   And the first promise to Abraham is actually much more than what is known today as Palestine
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:33.340]   and Israel.
[00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:35.120]   That is very often ignored.
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:39.880]   We assume that the promised land is modern day Palestine and Israel, whereas it's much
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:41.800]   more than that.
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:46.840]   The promised land, as you see from the picture to Abraham, is from the river, from the Nile
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:50.000]   to the Euphrates.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.520]   And so sometimes jokingly I tell Christian Zionists, if you want to use scripture, at
[00:17:54.520 --> 00:18:00.200]   least be consistent and argue that Israel today should wage war with Jordan, Lebanon,
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:05.600]   Syria, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt to claim the promised land.
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.480]   Otherwise don't use scripture.
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:14.000]   But not only that, even in history, in the Old Testament when Israel actually entered
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.120]   the land during the days of Joshua, two and a half tribes stayed in the east of Jordan,
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:23.680]   what is today Jordan and even parts of Lebanon.
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:28.560]   And during Solomon's reign the land extended way up in the north.
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:35.520]   We've always had these fluid boundaries and we need to ask why.
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:43.680]   And it is here that I rely most on actually Jewish scholars who argued from ancient Near
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:50.920]   East traditions and texts that in the old days when people wanted to describe boundaries
[00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:56.120]   and describe boundaries from water boundaries to other water boundaries, they were actually
[00:18:56.120 --> 00:19:01.000]   describing the whole universe, the whole world as they knew it.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:08.720]   A Jewish scholar by the name of Neelie Vazana says that the promised reflected spatial merisms
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:13.160]   and is not to be understood literally, nor should it be translated and transformed into
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:21.520]   borderlines or maps, but the promised land to Abraham is a promise of world dominion.
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:25.440]   They are referring to universal rule.
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:30.720]   And actually it makes sense because if you think of it, that is the world as Abraham
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.400]   knew it.
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:38.560]   In fact, second temple Jewish traditions also believe that the promise to Abraham was a
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:41.160]   promise of the universe.
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:45.880]   I would show you later that even Paul believed that the promise to Abraham wasn't a promise
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:53.600]   of one particular land, but a promise that he would inherit the cosmos, the universe.
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:20:01.520]   And actually we should see it because when God called Abraham in Genesis 12, 1 to 3,
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:06.440]   the climax of that calling to Abraham was the statement that through him, through Abraham,
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:11.880]   if you know the Bible, Genesis 12, 3, through you, Abraham, all the families of the earth
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:15.000]   shall find blessing.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.520]   And so the promise that Abraham will become a great nation implies both numerous seed
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:27.680]   and land expansion, and it must be understood as being subservient to God's principle desire
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:31.640]   to bless all the families of the earth.
[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:36.480]   Palestinian theologian Yohanna Ketanashu puts it this way, "It seems that the land of Abraham
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:39.660]   is not going to have fixed borders.
[00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:47.360]   It will continue to expand, thus increasing in size both territorially and demographically.
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:53.840]   The land of Abraham will continue to extend until it is equal to the whole earth."
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:21:02.040]   And so if we see it this way, Canaan or modern day Palestine of Israel becomes only the first
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:04.440]   phase, the beginning.
[00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:08.600]   Jerusalem is only the beginning of that expansion.
[00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:14.440]   For the God we believe in is the God of the whole earth, not only the God of one particular
[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.560]   land.
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:21.360]   This is not something that is exclusive to the Abrahamic tradition.
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:27.680]   When we consider the messianic prophecies, the land of the Messiah, for example in Psalm
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:33.080]   2, 8, one of the most important verses in the theology of the land, a strategic verse
[00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:41.760]   in my study, there God says to the king of Israel, "I will give you the nations as your
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:48.360]   inheritance and the ends of the earth as your possession."
[00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:51.600]   That's the land of the Messiah, not just one piece of land.
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.320]   We see this in other Psalms.
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:58.020]   We see it in many other prophecies like in Daniel and Micah where the Messiah shall rule
[00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:03.200]   until his rule will extend to the ends of the earth.
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:08.240]   See it's never limited to one piece of land.
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:13.920]   That's why my book, I argue that our right understanding of the theology of the land
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:19.520]   should be not about the promised land, but the promised earth.
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:23.280]   And I hope that by the end of my lecture you begin to see even Hong Kong as a promised
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:32.000]   earth, as part of the promised land, if we abide by God's covenant, as I will argue.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.800]   The theology of the land has a universal thrust.
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:42.800]   Through God's servant, Israel, Adam, later the Messiah, the land should expand until
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:44.880]   it reaches the ends of the earth.
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:50.320]   And actually what's interesting is that in the Hebrew language, the word for land and
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:53.320]   earth is the same, haaretz.
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:54.720]   Okay?
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:59.800]   And I wonder if that is intentional.
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:06.160]   So the theology of the land is ultimately the theology of the earth.
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:07.480]   Are you with me so far?
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:08.860]   Very good.
[00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:13.000]   So we asked whose land and we asked what are the boundaries of the land.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.520]   We're still in the Old Testament.
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:20.160]   My next point is about the covenanted land.
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:26.400]   Were the promises really unconditional as some argue?
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:30.600]   Were the land given as a possession, meaning it is yours once and for all and this can
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:33.400]   never change?
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:40.480]   The word forever, eternal, does it apply here on the theology of the land?
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:46.440]   Chris Wright reminds us, the head of Langham, that it is insufficient simply to say that
[00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:54.040]   the Lord gave the land to Israel without taking into consideration the context of the gift,
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:24:00.560]   which was the covenant relationship and its reciprocal commitments.
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:06.680]   The land was an integral part not only of the Lord's faithfulness to Israel, but also
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:12.520]   of Israel's covenantal obligation to the Lord.
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:18.960]   We cannot understand the land without understanding the covenant.
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:26.480]   And when you read the story of Israel, many, many times, and I can actually spend the next
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:32.600]   30 minutes reading to you verses from the Old Testament that sets conditions to maintaining
[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:33.600]   the land.
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:36.720]   I will just choose a few.
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:42.440]   Leviticus 18 is a very clear one and has a special meaning, actually.
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:46.400]   The whole chapter is thinking about the sins of the people who were living in the land
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:51.440]   before of Israel and then God tells Israel, remember now Israel is getting ready to enter
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:57.160]   the land, "Do not make yourselves unclean by any of these things.
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:02.880]   For by all these, the nations I am driving out before you have become unclean.
[00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:09.600]   And the land became unclean so that I punish its iniquity and the land vomited out its
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:11.600]   inhabitants.
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:16.480]   But you shall keep my status and my rules and do none of these abominations, either
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:21.560]   the native or the stranger who sojourns among you."
[00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:23.160]   Very important statement.
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:26.960]   For the people of the land who were before you did all of these abominations so that
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:33.960]   the land became unclean, lest the land vomit you out when you make it unclean, as it vomited
[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:38.440]   out the nation that was before you.
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:46.080]   Strong warnings, not just to Israel, but to anybody who lives in the land.
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:49.840]   The land does not tolerate unholiness.
[00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:52.600]   The land does not tolerate sin.
[00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:58.560]   And notice how here this text equals Israel with the nations that were before her in the
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:25:59.560]   land.
[00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:00.960]   Did you notice that?
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:08.160]   And not only that, gives the same commandments to the Israelites and to the strangers who
[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:09.160]   live in the land.
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:13.600]   In other words, the land does not discriminate.
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:18.280]   The land treats all of its inhabitants equally.
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:22.080]   And you need to pay attention to these verses because later I will argue that what applied
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:25.600]   to the promised land actually should apply to any land.
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:29.280]   The land does not tolerate ungodliness.
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:32.920]   And this is a very key point for the theology of the land.
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:41.400]   In Deuteronomy 16, 20, the condition that is set before the Israelites for keeping the
[00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:45.480]   land is nothing but justice.
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:51.920]   Justice and only justice you shall follow that you may live and inherit the land that
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:55.160]   the Lord your God is giving you.
[00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:57.960]   Cannot be said more explicit or more clear.
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:03.360]   A clear condition to inheriting the land is justice.
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:09.680]   If there is no justice, you have no right to live in the land.
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:12.600]   That's what the covenant is about.
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:14.800]   There are no free gifts here.
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:19.040]   There are no gifts with no conditions or no strings attached.
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:20.040]   God holds us accountable.
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:25.640]   And I wish I have time to go through the whole doctrine of election because oftentimes we
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:32.200]   confuse election with privilege, whereas election is in fact about responsibility and duty.
[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:37.640]   If you are elected, that means you are a servant to the others.
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:40.680]   That's the real meaning of election.
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:46.960]   And we have turned it over and over as the people of God into some sort of a privilege,
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:51.280]   whereas it's about serving.
[00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:57.480]   Think of Jesus, the servant, the chosen servant.
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:03.120]   Now of course if you know the history of Israel in the Bible, they lost the land in exile
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:10.440]   because of disobedience, because they broke the covenant often and often.
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:15.640]   And after the exile, we have a very interesting verse in Ezekiel 33 which reminds Israel that
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:21.760]   they are still obligated to obey God if they wish to have any chance of returning to the
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:23.160]   land.
[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:30.240]   And in that incident, the people of Israel actually try to depend on ethnicity.
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:31.760]   They say, "Abraham is our father.
[00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:32.760]   He was one.
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:33.760]   He inherited the land.
[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:34.760]   We are many.
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:36.960]   We too shall inherit the land."
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:39.120]   They think it's this simple.
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:40.840]   And it's amazing what God says.
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:45.480]   "Therefore say to them, 'Thus says the Lord God, 'You eat flesh with the blood and lift
[00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:49.040]   up your eyes to your idols and shed blood.
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:52.200]   Shall you then possess the land?
[00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:54.280]   You rely on the sword.
[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:59.400]   You commit abominations, and each of you defiles his neighbor's wife.
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:03.040]   Shall you then possess the land?'"
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:06.600]   Strong, clear warnings.
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:11.040]   And it's here where I want to emphasize that no other sin in the Old Testament was tied
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:19.720]   more directly with being expelled from the land than the sin of socioeconomic injustice.
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:24.640]   Chris Wright puts it this way, "The prophets simply would not allow Israel to get away
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:30.720]   with claiming the blessing and protection of the covenant relationship for their society
[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:37.160]   while trampling on the socioeconomic demands of that relationship."
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:43.240]   The most emphasized sin in terms of quantity of verses, if you want to put it this way,
[00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:48.200]   we find in the warnings what leads to losing the land, nothing more in Scripture, believe
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:55.160]   me, I studied all these verses, than the sin of socioeconomic injustice.
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:30:01.520]   And that leads me, and I spend a lot of time in the book talking about this, to discuss
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:08.280]   some technical terms that we used and continue to use in our theological traditions, sometimes
[00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:10.040]   without reflecting on their meanings.
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:15.840]   One of them is the word in Hebrew, "la'olam," in English translated "forever," because
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:22.680]   oftentimes we think it's forever and ending, whereas if you study the word in the Old Testament,
[00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:26.760]   many many times things are declared that they will last forever, whereas they actually don't
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:29.240]   last forever.
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:35.480]   The Aaron was supposed to be a priest forever and his descendants, the temple was supposed
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:40.720]   to stand forever, David as a king forever, and so on.
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:47.040]   And one of the most striking examples about that word forever, though not related to the
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:52.680]   theology of the land directly but actually gives us a very clear indication of that term,
[00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:58.720]   is in 1 Samuel 2 30, talking about Eli, the priest back then.
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:04.600]   "Therefore the Lord, the God of Israel, declares to Eli, 'I promise that your house and the
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:10.040]   house of your father should go in and out before me forever.'"
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:15.960]   Clear, no dispute.
[00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:23.600]   Yet the next sentence, "But now the Lord declares, 'Far be it from me, for those who honor me
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:30.080]   I will honor, and those who despise me shall be lightly esteemed.'"
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:36.000]   And it seems that even the word forever is here conditioned to obedience to God and honoring
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.480]   God.
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:44.640]   Another word that we're discussing is the word "nachalai" in Hebrew, which is often translated
[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:50.640]   "inheritance," because many times people confuse it with possession.
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:56.560]   Whereas I would argue that the right interpretation of that verse is that it is a mandate, never
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:57.560]   a possession.
[00:31:57.560 --> 00:32:04.640]   Brueggemann puts it this way, the renowned Old Testament scholar, "Land with God brings
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:06.200]   responsibility.
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:12.800]   The same land that is gift freely given is tasked sharply put.
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:15.160]   Landed Israel is under mandate."
[00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:21.280]   Chris Wright puts it, "Like all tenants, therefore, Israelites were accountable to
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:29.800]   their divine landlord for proper treatment of what was ultimately his property."
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:31.400]   That is the right meaning of land.
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:35.120]   It's never our possession, as I argued in my first point.
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:40.640]   It's always a mandate, and that's why how we treat the land, what we do in the land,
[00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:44.400]   how we treat our neighbors in the land matters to God.
[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:51.440]   And because it's his land, he is free to take it from us whenever he wants.
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:56.640]   The Old Testament introduces us to this conflict, to this concept of a land that comes with
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:58.560]   conditions.
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:04.080]   On the one hand, it wants to underscore the sovereignty of God and his gracious nature,
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:06.480]   evident by his giving of the land.
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:11.280]   And on the other, it wants at the same time to underscore the ethical and moral nature
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:22.440]   of God and to show how this demands nothing but total allegiance from the people of God.
[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:26.160]   My next point, I hope you're with me.
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:27.960]   This is interesting.
[00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:28.960]   Very good.
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:31.200]   Who is Israel?
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:37.280]   Sometimes, you know, again, we take these things for granted, but we fail to ask, "Was
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:40.960]   Abraham an Israelite?"
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:42.760]   Was Ruth an Israelite?
[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:43.760]   Think of that.
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:44.760]   She was a Moabite.
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:50.400]   Ruth is actually a very interesting figure because throughout the book of Ruth, every
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:53.920]   time she is mentioned, she is Ruth the Moabite.
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:54.920]   Every time.
[00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:57.800]   It wants to remind us she's a stranger.
[00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:01.840]   And at the beginning of the book, she declares to her mother-in-law, "Your people are my
[00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:06.480]   people and your God is my God."
[00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:09.520]   And she becomes part of the people of God.
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:11.960]   Interesting.
[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:14.280]   Was Solomon an Israelite?
[00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:20.240]   Remember, the mother of Solomon wasn't a Jew, wasn't part of the people of God.
[00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:24.080]   David married Beth Sheba.
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:28.720]   And when we study scripture, we realize that it's full of intermarriages.
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:30.480]   Judah married a Canaanite.
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:32.480]   Joseph an Egyptian.
[00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:33.480]   Moses a Midianite.
[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:38.160]   And Solomon, well, we know.
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:39.880]   The Bible is full of intermarriages.
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:40.880]   That's my point.
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:46.520]   Judges 3 says that the people of Israel lived among these nations, and it names them, and
[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:51.360]   their daughters they took to themselves for wives, and their own daughters they gave to
[00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:55.800]   their sons, and they served their gods.
[00:34:55.800 --> 00:35:02.440]   And think sometimes we assume this clear ethnicity thing that runs through scripture.
[00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:09.840]   But only that, in the book of Esther, it declares at the end of the book, after God rescues
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:16.840]   the people of Israel, "And many from the peoples of the country declared themselves Jews, for
[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:21.300]   fear of Jews had fallen on them."
[00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:26.240]   In scripture, people could become Jews.
[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:29.320]   In other words, it's a matter of faith.
[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:36.760]   Becoming part of Israel in the Old Testament wasn't exclusively dependent on ethnicity.
[00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:38.400]   And please try to understand what I'm saying.
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:44.760]   I am not denying that Jews existed over the centuries as a distinct people or religion.
[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:50.840]   Nor am I negating Jews' right to define themselves as a people as they understand their tradition.
[00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:59.780]   I am simply looking at the Old Testament and asking, is it by ethnicity alone?
[00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:01.940]   Is it by DNA alone?
[00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:07.680]   And can anybody really claim a clear DNA from Abraham to today, given all the intermarriages
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:13.160]   that I explained, and then claim possession of the land?
[00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:17.320]   And if it's really about faith, as I am arguing here, and as I will argue strongly in the
[00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:25.400]   New Testament, don't we all believe in the God of Israel when we believe in Jesus, the
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:26.400]   Jewish Messiah?
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:33.640]   Hold that point in mind, because we will definitely come back to it.
[00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:38.520]   My final question in the Old Testament section, before moving to the New Testament, is why
[00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:39.520]   a land?
[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:44.000]   And it's here I want to refer again to my book, where I began my study of the land not
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.440]   in Genesis 12 with the promise of the land to Abraham, but rather with Genesis 1, 2,
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:53.920]   and 3, the creation narrative and the giving of the Garden of Eden.
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:37:00.080]   And there I believe we have a picture of the first promised land, the Garden of Eden.
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:03.080]   It was the first land.
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:10.320]   And the sin resulted in death, and that death actually was expulsion from the Garden of
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:11.760]   Eden.
[00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:12.760]   That's the first exile.
[00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:20.440]   If we learn anything from Eden, we learn that we are accountable before God for our actions,
[00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:25.280]   and that the beautiful gift of Eden could be taken from us.
[00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:33.800]   Yet not only that, Eden was supposed to be a blessing to the rest of the creation, because
[00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:40.640]   in Genesis 1, God tells Adam and Eve, "Be fruitful," I think I have it, "and multiply
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:43.200]   and fill the earth and subdue it."
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:46.200]   It's the notion of the kingdom.
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:50.840]   And have dominion over the fish and the birds and the heavens and everything on earth.
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:57.000]   And if that is supposed to happen, that's what Adam and Eve are supposed to do, and
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:05.360]   they were located in Eden, then this gives us an idea about Eden as a center of the universe
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:10.960]   that is supposed to bless the rest of creation.
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:14.920]   That is the paradigm we have in scripture.
[00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:19.660]   And as such, we see Eden as the first promised land.
[00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:28.280]   We also see Adam as the first Israel, or Israel as the second Adam.
[00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:33.000]   All part of a process to restore what was lost in Eden.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:40.160]   And so I argue in my book that the whole idea of Abraham being chosen and given a land is
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:48.080]   to restore what was lost in Eden, the first land, with the goal of redeeming all of creation,
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:55.040]   with the goal of redeeming the creation of God, redeeming all of the earth.
[00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:57.480]   And that's really the goal from the verse to Abraham.
[00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:03.720]   In the midst of Genesis 12, 1 to 3, God tells Abraham, "You be a blessing."
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:04.720]   It's a commandment.
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:07.400]   Actually, some translation has it, "You shall be a blessing."
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:11.400]   I don't know what it is in Chinese, but really it is a commandment.
[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:14.680]   Be a blessing.
[00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:21.680]   God wanted to use Abraham to fix, to restore what was lost in Eden.
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:24.600]   The goal was not Abraham and his family.
[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:26.600]   The goal was not Canaan.
[00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:29.680]   But really, God placed Abraham in one land.
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:33.880]   God chose one man and his family and placed them in one particular land with that goal
[00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:39.260]   in mind, so that in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed.
[00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:44.240]   And that's why Abraham's name was chosen from the father of one nation to the father of
[00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:47.820]   many nations.
[00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:53.800]   From the beginning, there is this universal dimension in the calling of Abraham.
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:56.600]   We see it also in the calling of Israel.
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:59.160]   Exodus 12, 19, 5 to 6.
[00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:04.840]   When God chose Israel, he reminded her that, "You are my treasured possession among all
[00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:09.040]   peoples for all the earth is mine."
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:10.560]   Not just one piece of land.
[00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:16.680]   "All the earth is mine and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and holy nation."
[00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:22.200]   The whole idea of priests is mediators, so we always ask, "Priests among whom?"
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:27.760]   So Israel was clearly the mediator between God and the rest of humanity and between humanity
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:29.120]   and God.
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:33.920]   Again, from the beginning, there is this universal scope.
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:38.600]   And so the story of Israel is supposed to be a paradigm for all the nations on the earth.
[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:44.680]   And Israel was supposed to be the means towards the restoration and redemption of the rest
[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:47.640]   of God's creation.
[00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:55.320]   I believe that through Israel, God wanted to create an ideal society and model to other
[00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:59.480]   nations ideal kingdom values.
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:05.640]   And that's why God gave Israel the law, the Ten Commandments, the laws about the Jubilee
[00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:06.640]   I mentioned.
[00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:12.920]   Israel was supposed to be this ideal society and Israel was supposed to be the means by
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:18.400]   which the whole universe is redeemed.
[00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:24.960]   And again, that points us to the universal elements of the promised land, promised earth.
[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:32.160]   And really, when we read the prophecies in particular, we see this universal and inclusive
[00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:37.840]   nature of restoration.
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:44.960]   One of the very clear elements in biblical prophecy is how inclusive it is and how universal
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:46.320]   it is.
[00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:55.760]   For example, Psalm 87 envisions a Zion which is multi-ethnic, where people from all nations
[00:41:55.760 --> 00:42:01.720]   are born in it and are registers in it and are citizens of Zion.
[00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:06.680]   It is the city of God and not simply a city of one nation.
[00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:12.600]   Ezekiel 47 has one of the most striking statements in the theology of the land and again, one
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:15.200]   of the most ignored statements about the theology of the land.
[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:20.760]   When God tells Israel in the restoration, "You shall allot it as an inheritance for
[00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:27.640]   yourself about the land and for the sojourners who reside among you.
[00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:33.320]   They shall be to you as native-born children of Israel."
[00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:38.720]   This is the equality here between Israelites and non-Israelites.
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:42.320]   Everyone inherits in the new creation.
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:45.440]   Everyone inherits in the restoration.
[00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:53.880]   The same in Isaiah 56, when it speaks about the temple, that my house shall be called
[00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:58.080]   a house of prayer for all peoples.
[00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:06.760]   A scripture that Jesus quoted when he entered the temple, when he saw the separation between
[00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:12.600]   Jews and Gentiles in the temple, that angered him and argued, "My house shall be called
[00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:15.880]   a house of prayer for all peoples."
[00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:21.560]   Isaiah 49 is another example about the Messiah who is a light, not just for Israel, but a
[00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:28.280]   light for the nations, that the salvation of the servant of God might reach to the end
[00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:29.280]   of the earth.
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:32.660]   A very important element.
[00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:36.680]   And so in conclusion to the Old Testament part, the giving of a land as part of the
[00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:42.920]   project of redemption highlights that God is committed to his created order and to the
[00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:47.640]   redemption of human society.
[00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:54.320]   Redemption in the Old Testament is not merely about individuals, personal piety, or spiritual
[00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:57.420]   existential experiences.
[00:43:57.420 --> 00:44:03.960]   It is about redeeming whole societies on earth, and ultimately the whole of humanity.
[00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:07.040]   It is an earthly phenomenon.
[00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:14.360]   That's a very important thing that the theology of the land in the Old Testament teaches us.
[00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:15.960]   So you survived the first part.
[00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:17.880]   I hope you're still awake.
[00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:21.120]   I'm glad you're still awake.
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:27.640]   And I will devote the next few minutes to talking about the land in the New Testament.
[00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:33.720]   And I spent half of my book talking about the land in the New Testament.
[00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:38.800]   Very few people actually find the theme of the land in the New Testament, and I beg to
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:44.600]   differ and I hope I was able to show that actually Jesus and Paul spoke a lot about
[00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:45.920]   the land.
[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:51.680]   The problem is that we miss it because we have preconceived ideas about the land as
[00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:56.160]   exclusively to one people and not as the earth to all peoples.
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:45:00.760]   And you see, once we see those themes that I establish in the Old Testament clearly,
[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:09.280]   understand them, we see it, we see them come over and over in the New Testament.
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:13.960]   Yet I begin with the question and observation.
[00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:20.320]   Is the New Testament reading of the Old Testament matter?
[00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:27.160]   And I ask this because so many times I encounter Christians who read the prophecies of the
[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:31.720]   land, read the prophecies to Israel in the Old Testament as if the New Testament was
[00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:37.160]   not written, as if the coming of Jesus did not alter things.
[00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:42.960]   I just, what I call the Jesus event, his life, death, and resurrection didn't change the
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:44.960]   course of history.
[00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:45.960]   We cannot do that.
[00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:51.600]   And I want to quote from a famous New Testament scholar, James Dunn, who says that unless
[00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:59.600]   a New Testament theology both recognizes and brings out the degree to which the New Testament
[00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:07.640]   writers saw themselves as in continuity with the revelation of the Old Testament and as
[00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:15.800]   at least in some measure continuing or completing that revelation, it can hardly provide a faithful
[00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:20.200]   presentation of what they understood themselves to be about.
[00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:26.400]   New Testament authors, when they wrote, they understood themselves as completing the revelation
[00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:28.400]   of the Old Testament.
[00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:33.360]   This is a very, very important observation, and I always challenge my students.
[00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:36.920]   How does the New Testament begin and why?
[00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:41.960]   Is it by coincidence or just, you know, telling us address of someone or who is he that tells
[00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:47.580]   us the, you know, the gospel of Jesus, son of David, son of Abraham?
[00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:51.240]   This is a theologically loaded statement.
[00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:57.340]   Matthew is telling us this Jesus is the seed of Abraham and the seed of David.
[00:46:57.340 --> 00:47:02.280]   He is the continuation of the story of Israel.
[00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:07.360]   Where Israel begins, Abraham, he has two children, Isaac, Ishmael.
[00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:11.080]   Isaac is the chosen seed, the holy seed, I call it.
[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:14.120]   Isaac had two children, Jacob, Esau.
[00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:17.200]   Jacob is the holy seed, and so on in the Old Testament.
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:20.280]   Now Matthew comes with this clear statement.
[00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:23.480]   That line now reach a pivotal point.
[00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:30.120]   Jesus, the Jew, the son of Abraham, the son of David.
[00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:34.360]   We should not miss that when we read the Old Testament.
[00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:40.440]   Jesus himself spoke about the land at least twice, more than that, in my book.
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:46.400]   But the most two explicit ones are in Matthew 5, 5 when he says, "The meek shall inherit
[00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:52.360]   the earth or the land," again, depending on our translation of the Greek word "ge" which
[00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:55.760]   could mean land and earth.
[00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:59.040]   And he quotes Psalm 37.
[00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:05.000]   Psalm 37 is a psalm about the land and about the qualities of those who have the right
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:11.380]   to inherit the land, reminding us again that you cannot take the land promises for granted.
[00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:13.520]   But you have to obey God in the covenant.
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:19.640]   Among these qualifications, justice, care of the poor, and here Jesus quotes the meekness
[00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:20.640]   verse.
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:27.480]   Let us not forget the context in which Jesus said these statements, a context that was
[00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:33.800]   politically charged, a context in which people were disputing how to redeem the land from
[00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:36.000]   the hands of the Romans.
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   And Jesus comes with this radical idea about the kingdom of God and about the meek who
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:45.320]   inherit that kingdom.
[00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:49.920]   Yet probably one of the most important verses in the New Testament about the promises of
[00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:53.160]   the land is in Matthew 28, 18.
[00:48:53.160 --> 00:49:06.560]   After Jesus is risen and after he was vindicated as the Son of God through his resurrection,
[00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:13.800]   before he ascends to heaven, he says, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been
[00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:15.800]   given to me."
[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:23.920]   And I see this as a statement by Jesus, the new Israelite, the faithful Israelite saying,
[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:30.640]   "I have received the land as my inheritance again on behalf of Israel.
[00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:37.020]   The land was restored to me as a result of my obedience on the cross and as a result
[00:49:37.020 --> 00:49:39.820]   of my resurrection."
[00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:44.440]   And it's interesting, it doesn't simply say, "Jesus, I am going to heaven to sit on the
[00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:54.160]   right hand of my Father," but he declares, "I am king today in heaven and on earth."
[00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:59.040]   The kingdom of God was established not just in heaven but also on earth.
[00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:05.320]   That is why we pray, "Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven."
[00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:09.960]   Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:16.200]   Jesus here receives the land as his inheritance.
[00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:22.680]   Jesus talked a lot about the issue of who is the child of Abraham.
[00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:25.720]   Remember that question that I asked.
[00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:29.200]   And it seems that Jesus here enters that discussion.
[00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:34.920]   One time during his discussion with the Jewish leaders, the Pharisees, the discussion got
[00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:40.720]   heated and they answered him by saying, "Abraham is our father."
[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:47.560]   Jesus said to them, "If you were Abraham's children, you would be doing the works Abraham
[00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:49.520]   did."
[00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:55.000]   Jesus here opens it to who could be a child of Abraham.
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:00.660]   If you have the faith of Abraham, you too could be a child of Abraham.
[00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:06.360]   And again we ask, being a child of Abraham, is it by ethnicity?
[00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:08.920]   Not to Jesus, it seems.
[00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:12.480]   Being a child of Abraham, is it about entitlement?
[00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:13.480]   Again not to Jesus.
[00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:17.480]   It's more about our accountability.
[00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:23.320]   And so the New Testament presents Jesus with this new Israelite.
[00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:30.200]   In short, the history of Israel narrows down and focuses on one person, an Israelite and
[00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:33.680]   a descendant of Abraham by the name of Jesus.
[00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:40.520]   This new Israelite reenacts the story of Israel and in his personality, in his person, he
[00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:44.760]   encapsulates what it means to be Israel.
[00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:51.040]   In addition, Jesus is also portrayed as the obedient and thus ideal Israelite, the one
[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:55.080]   with whom God is well pleased.
[00:51:55.080 --> 00:52:00.200]   Israel's story now narrows down and becomes Jesus' story.
[00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:05.000]   And remember, he is an Israelite.
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:11.040]   He earned it by his obedience and he is at the same time a child of Abraham.
[00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:13.560]   And it couldn't have been any other way.
[00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:17.440]   And I'm sorry to tell you, Jesus couldn't have been a Chinese.
[00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:19.880]   He couldn't have been born in Hong Kong.
[00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:25.120]   He had to be born as a Jew in Bethlehem to continue that story of Israel.
[00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:31.040]   That shows God's commitment to salvation through the line of Abraham.
[00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:37.000]   We should be thankful to that because through that commitment, the good news of God's reign
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:43.700]   on earth through his Messiah reached today to the ends of the earth.
[00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:53.680]   We move to Paul, who enters a discussion about Abraham, the land, the covenant, the inheritance.
[00:52:53.680 --> 00:53:00.080]   And in Galatians 3.16, we have one of the most important verses about the theology of
[00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:04.240]   the land in Pauline writings.
[00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:05.720]   We all know John 3.16.
[00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:10.400]   I always say that for me personally and for many Palestinian Christians, we have Galatians
[00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:12.480]   3.16.
[00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:14.440]   You might wonder what is Galatians 3.16.
[00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:21.960]   Galatians 3.16 is the verse we have which speaks about who is the offspring of Abraham.
[00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:26.920]   And if we take that verse seriously, many answers, many questions will be answered.
[00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:34.380]   Paul declares, "Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring."
[00:53:34.380 --> 00:53:40.360]   It does not say, "and to offsprings," with a plural, of course, referring to many, but
[00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:48.460]   referring to one and to your offspring, who is Christ.
[00:53:48.460 --> 00:53:51.680]   This is a massive statement.
[00:53:51.680 --> 00:54:01.140]   Paul here effectively affirms that Jesus is the only legitimate recipient of the Abrahamic
[00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:04.120]   promises.
[00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:10.560]   And he denies, in essence, any other claims by any people, any person or people group
[00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:14.280]   to the benefits of this covenant.
[00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:17.480]   Paul doesn't say Jesus was one of the people of God.
[00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:21.320]   Paul doesn't say Jesus was one of the offsprings in many.
[00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:24.560]   Paul actually says there are no other offsprings to Abraham.
[00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:29.800]   There is only one, and that is Jesus.
[00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:30.800]   That is Jesus.
[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:36.880]   And as I said, the story of Abraham narrows down in Paul's thinking until it is summed
[00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:39.920]   up in one person, Jesus.
[00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:47.560]   Remember, can anybody today, based on the New Testament, okay, we're talking here in
[00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:51.280]   a Christian discussion, come and say, "I am a child of Abraham.
[00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:54.800]   I receive the promises."
[00:54:54.800 --> 00:55:00.200]   Within a Christian discussion, according to Paul, the answer is no.
[00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:03.760]   Only Jesus has that right.
[00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:10.280]   Jesus inherits the land because he is the legitimate recipient of the Abrahamic promises
[00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:12.280]   as the son of Abraham.
[00:55:12.280 --> 00:55:15.440]   And the land that Jesus inherits is, of course, the whole earth.
[00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:17.400]   This was our argument.
[00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:23.160]   For Matthew claims, as we read, that Jesus has been given all authority on heaven and
[00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:24.160]   on earth.
[00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:30.600]   Jesus here receives all the lands of the earth as his inheritance, and this clearly echoes
[00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:34.960]   Psalm 2, 8, when we said, "Ask of me, the Messiah, and I will give you the ends of the
[00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:38.520]   earth as your possession."
[00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:46.320]   And so any theological claims that replace Christ's ownership to the land with Israel's
[00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:53.040]   must deal with the difficulties of defining Israel and with the New Testament claims that
[00:55:53.040 --> 00:56:00.760]   Christ receives the Abrahamic inheritance of the land.
[00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:06.520]   Not only that, so if we argue that the story of Israel narrowed down until it reached Jesus,
[00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:16.040]   at the end of Galatians 3, those promises or that story expands again.
[00:56:16.040 --> 00:56:25.600]   But this time, clearly not based on ethnicity or biological claims, but on faith and unity
[00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:27.360]   in Christ.
[00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:29.040]   Unity in Christ.
[00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:36.560]   Galatians 3, 27, 29, "For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.
[00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:39.360]   There is neither Jew nor Greek.
[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:41.800]   There is neither slave nor free.
[00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:44.360]   There is no male and female.
[00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:52.840]   For you are all one in Christ Jesus, and if you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's offspring,
[00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:56.760]   heirs according to the promise."
[00:56:56.760 --> 00:57:03.920]   Through our unity in Jesus, we become part of the Abrahamic line.
[00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:10.440]   We too are Abraham's children, you too are Abraham's children, and we are heirs according
[00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:11.440]   to the promise.
[00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:16.600]   And of course I ask here, heirs to what?
[00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:19.920]   What do we inherit?
[00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:25.000]   For of course, here we see that the people of God have been redefined.
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:31.520]   Membership in the people of God today is through faith in Jesus, according to Paul.
[00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:35.600]   And when we ask, when we say heirs according to the promise, heirs to what?
[00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:41.560]   Here we say that the Abraham imagery, apart from the land promise, is really an empty
[00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:42.680]   form.
[00:57:42.680 --> 00:57:45.840]   And remember what we talked about the meaning of inheritance.
[00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:51.200]   When I say heirs according to the promise, again, this is not about privilege.
[00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:53.840]   This is about responsibility.
[00:57:53.840 --> 00:58:00.080]   The Abrahamic promises, that responsibility of being a blessing to the nations, a blessing
[00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:06.720]   to those who are around us, has been transferred now to those of us who believe in Jesus and
[00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:12.640]   who are united into Jesus.
[00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:19.320]   And notice how here we can clearly say, you know, Paul says there is no Greek or Gentile,
[00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:21.220]   male or female.
[00:58:21.220 --> 00:58:27.520]   And whenever I have been discussion with Messianic Jews, Christians from a Jewish believer, sometimes
[00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:33.920]   we do dialogue or debates, and I usually open to Galatians 3 and I say, according to Galatians
[00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:37.200]   3, what you inherit, I inherit.
[00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:39.520]   There is no distinction in our inheritance.
[00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:43.840]   We inherit the same thing because we both believe in the same Jesus.
[00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:51.320]   There is no separate plan for some people and a spiritual plan for some people.
[00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:54.600]   This is not the only place in which Paul emphasizes this.
[00:58:54.600 --> 00:58:58.780]   In Ephesians 2, 19, he speaks to Gentile believers.
[00:58:58.780 --> 00:59:07.640]   Now you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints
[00:59:07.640 --> 00:59:11.760]   and members of the households of God.
[00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:17.880]   And when we are members of the household of God, all that was belonging to the original
[00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:24.200]   people of that household belongs now to us as well.
[00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:31.480]   Ephesians 3, 16, Paul says this mystery is that the Gentiles are fellow heirs.
[00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:35.640]   Fellow heirs meaning we inherit together.
[00:59:35.640 --> 00:59:39.440]   It's not like now Gentiles, you know, we come and kick out the Jews and now we take their
[00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:40.440]   place.
[00:59:40.440 --> 00:59:41.440]   It's not that.
[00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:43.840]   It's that now we became with them fellow heirs.
[00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:48.640]   In fact, I always say for Paul it could not have been any other way.
[00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:51.400]   The people of God had to be Jews and Gentiles together.
[00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:57.360]   That is the mystery for Paul and that is the reconciliation work of Christ.
[00:59:57.360 --> 01:00:03.640]   So we are fellow heirs, members of the same body and partakers of the promise in Christ
[01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:07.480]   Jesus through the gospel.
[01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:13.920]   Clear statement that now in Christ we become part of the story of Abraham, part of the
[01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:16.880]   story of Abraham of Israel.
[01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:23.160]   This is what 1 Peter 2, 9 clearly says and echoes when it says to the believers in Christ,
[01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:28.840]   you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood.
[01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:34.440]   Here Peter applies what was said about the people of God Israel in Exodus 19 to those
[01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:37.440]   who believe in Christ today.
[01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:46.720]   Not that we replaced biblical Israel, but it's that we are now part of biblical Israel.
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:49.920]   This is what Paul actually says in Romans 11.
[01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:58.460]   And I want to emphasize, you know, the olive tree example that Paul brings.
[01:00:58.460 --> 01:01:03.500]   Notice how Paul doesn't say the tree was uprooted, nor does he say all the original branches
[01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:07.560]   were uprooted, but some of the branches were broken off.
[01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:08.560]   We need to remember that.
[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:14.360]   And when it says some, that reminds us that the first believers in Christ were actually
[01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:17.000]   Jewish believers.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:22.280]   Yes Israel in general rejected the Messiah, but not every Israelite.
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:28.760]   So some of the branches were broken off and you, although a wild olive shoot, were grafted
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:35.560]   in among the others and now together at the same tree, at the same time, share in the
[01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:37.760]   nourishing fruit of the olive tree.
[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:43.000]   There are no two olive trees, no plant for one branch and one plant for the other branch.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:48.040]   We are together in the same tree at the same time and Jesus is the center.
[01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:53.160]   I have the privilege of seeing this actually happen in history.
[01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:58.560]   You know, my mother loves farming and I've seen her bring branches from another tree
[01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:00.040]   and graft them into one tree.
[01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:02.000]   It's a beautiful thing.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.840]   And after a while, after a few months, when you look at that branch, you would not be
[01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:10.040]   able to tell which one is original and which one is not.
[01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:13.240]   And that's the beauty of this paradigm.
[01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:19.080]   But I've actually seen it take place in reality through worship meetings between Palestinian
[01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:23.360]   Christians and Messianic Jews where people from two different backgrounds are at the
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:29.120]   same olive tree at the same time worshiping the same God.
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:34.120]   And as such I emphasize what Paul wanted to emphasize in Romans 11.
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:42.040]   We should not be arrogant towards the Jews because just as some of them have fallen because
[01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:47.900]   of unbelief, we too could fall because of our unbelief and our pride.
[01:02:47.900 --> 01:02:54.200]   And he reminds us that we did not replace Israel, we are not the origin, but rather
[01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:56.080]   we joined Israel.
[01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:57.240]   And I want to emphasize that.
[01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:59.280]   We did not replace the Jewish people.
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:03.680]   Rather, we joined biblical Israel.
[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:09.960]   Or put it more, we were incorporated into biblical Israel.
[01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:15.960]   I want to quote James Dunn who says, "God has not uprooted the olive tree of Israel
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:18.680]   and replaced it with another.
[01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:26.040]   On the contrary, uncultivated branches of wild olives, Gentiles, have been grafted into
[01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:30.400]   the olive tree of Israel, the same original planting."
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:35.680]   It's not replacement, it's incorporation.
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:39.220]   We did not replace, we joined.
[01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:42.600]   And this is not a new thing only in the time of Christ.
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:46.900]   Paul says, "You should have seen this coming."
[01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:53.280]   He goes to Abraham and he reminds us that God has always been not only the God of Jews,
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:55.080]   he is the God of Gentiles also.
[01:03:55.080 --> 01:04:00.600]   Yes, of Gentiles also in Romans 3, 29.
[01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:02.120]   So is this a paradigm shift in Paul?
[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:06.040]   No, he is being faithful to his Jewish heritage.
[01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:14.520]   He went back to base his theology on Old Testament texts, especially on the person of Abraham.
[01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:19.240]   That's why for Paul, when he wanted to argue for the inclusion of Gentiles into the people
[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:22.240]   of God, he had to go to Abraham.
[01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:27.960]   He didn't just invent this out of nothing.
[01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:33.320]   And so here we want to ask, because this is something I am always asked, so I will anticipate
[01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:38.080]   this question and try to respond.
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:41.200]   Does this mean that the Jews were rejected?
[01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:46.280]   Paul clearly says, emphatically says, "By no means."
[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:50.760]   God has not rejected his people, yet we need to continue the verse.
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:53.440]   What does it mean that God has not rejected his people?
[01:04:53.440 --> 01:05:01.560]   Paul says, "For I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of all of
[01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:03.140]   the tribe of Benjamin.
[01:05:03.140 --> 01:05:06.880]   God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew."
[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:12.920]   You see, for Paul, when he says God has not rejected his people, he says, "Look at me.
[01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:16.360]   I am a clear example that God has not rejected his people.
[01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:22.900]   I am a Jew, a son of Abraham, an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, and a tribe of Benjamin.
[01:05:22.900 --> 01:05:28.480]   When I came to faith in Christ, he did not reject me, but he accepted me."
[01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:33.280]   And so when Paul says God has not rejected his people, he doesn't mean for 2,000 years
[01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:35.560]   later he will bring them back to the land.
[01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:37.940]   That's not his point.
[01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:45.120]   His point is they are and can still be part of the people of God if they believe in Christ.
[01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:46.960]   And that's his whole point in Romans.
[01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:53.080]   It was actually a missiological point, trying to warn Gentile believers in Rome, "Don't
[01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:55.000]   be arrogant to the Jews.
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.720]   Be humble and witness to them.
[01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:59.320]   They have not rejected.
[01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:07.480]   If they believe in Christ, it's very natural to them to return to the original olive tree."
[01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:14.480]   The salvation of Israel for Paul, whether in Roman 11 or anywhere in his writing, is
[01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:16.640]   their faith in Jesus.
[01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:17.840]   It is not a political reality.
[01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:23.680]   It has nothing to do with restoration to the land.
[01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:29.640]   His statement, Paul's statement that all Israel will one day be saved, of course has drawn
[01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:35.360]   a lot of controversy and questions and debates and interpretations, and I can spend the next
[01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:40.880]   hour just summarizing to you all the different point views about what it means that all Israel
[01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:41.880]   shall be saved.
[01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:43.600]   I will not do that.
[01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:45.160]   Don't worry.
[01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:48.400]   But I want to emphasize this.
[01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:51.920]   What does it mean for Paul that the people of Israel shall be saved?
[01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:55.280]   What does the word "saved" mean for Paul?
[01:06:55.280 --> 01:07:01.680]   And again, here I remind you, saved for Paul could only mean faith in Christ, not a political
[01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:02.680]   state.
[01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:08.000]   So I always say, if Paul is saying in Romans 11 that one day every single Jew will become
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000]   a Christian, amen.
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.760]   All right?
[01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:15.000]   There are, of course, different interpretations.
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.320]   Some say only the elect among the Jewish people.
[01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:19.200]   Some say it's actually an ongoing process.
[01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:21.120]   It's not about the future.
[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:24.480]   Some say all Israel is Jews and Gentiles.
[01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:29.280]   Regardless of how you interpret that, what is all Israel, or when they shall be saved,
[01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:34.320]   one thing we cannot dispute is that saved for Paul could only mean faith in Christ,
[01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:37.440]   not a political state 2,000 years later.
[01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:43.320]   And that's why I always say you cannot use Romans 11 to justify or say that the state
[01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:48.120]   of Israel is a fulfillment of prophecy.
[01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:54.040]   And so to conclude the New Testament part, what the New Testament actually claims is
[01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:56.640]   nothing but the fulfillment of the Old Testament story.
[01:07:56.640 --> 01:08:00.840]   Jesus continues the story of Israel and brings it to realization.
[01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:03.680]   Eden is redeemed and restored.
[01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:08.440]   The earth is redeemed and restored right now through the ministry of Jesus, and as I will
[01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:12.520]   argue now, through the ministry of the church.
[01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:14.760]   Jesus didn't start something new.
[01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:17.600]   Remember, he was a Jew.
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:19.200]   And that the first believers were Jews.
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:23.880]   And so the church is both Jews and Gentiles together.
[01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:26.880]   And here I come back and back again to the same point.
[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:31.040]   Has it been by DNA anyway to begin with?
[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:35.120]   The inclusivity of Gentiles into the people of God has been anticipated.
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:41.080]   In fact, Paul argues this has been the goal when the calling of Abraham said, "You shall
[01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:44.440]   be a blessing to all the people."
[01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:49.320]   And now the blessing has been made to all the universe.
[01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:55.040]   And that's why the land now is the whole universe.
[01:08:55.040 --> 01:09:00.960]   I'm going to skip some slides and move because we're almost out of time.
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:04.680]   That's why the land has been, as I said, universalized.
[01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:05.680]   How much time we have?
[01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:06.680]   Okay, that's good.
[01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:10.040]   I'm almost done, don't worry.
[01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:14.400]   How much, what happened to the land now?
[01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:18.880]   Remember I argued that Jesus said, "All authority has been given to me on earth and in heaven
[01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:20.360]   that the land has been universal."
[01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:22.520]   All the lands of the earth has been given.
[01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:25.160]   And I mentioned in the Old Testament part the promises to Abraham.
[01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:27.560]   This is the verse I talked about.
[01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:32.720]   Paul in Romans 4.13 says, "For the promise to Abraham and his offspring that he would
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:38.400]   be heir of the world did not come through the law, but through the righteousness of
[01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:39.800]   faith."
[01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:45.120]   And notice how he doesn't say that he would be heir of the land or heir of Canaan.
[01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:47.880]   Rather, that he would be heir of the world.
[01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:50.920]   As I said, the Greek word is the cosmos.
[01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:59.800]   Elsewhere, in Ephesians 16, Paul applies the commandment to honor your parents so that
[01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:03.680]   you shall live long and the land that the Lord is giving you in the original context
[01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:09.280]   in Exodus becomes now so that you should live long, full stop.
[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:14.720]   Which means it applies today in Ephesus and it applies in Hong Kong.
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:21.800]   What applied to the promised land in Israel's time applies today to us, people of God who
[01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:27.560]   are in covenant with God through Jesus, the Israelites.
[01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:34.640]   And so we read in Scripture that when redemption took place, after Jesus and only after Jesus
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:35.640]   was resurrected.
[01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:38.840]   You see, it doesn't work before restoration.
[01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:44.320]   The resurrection of Jesus is the point in which in salvation history restoration and
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:46.720]   redemption began.
[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:50.760]   After that, Jesus tells the disciple, "You will receive power when the Holy Spirit has
[01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:59.680]   come upon you and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, in all Judea, Samaria, and the
[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:01.160]   end of the earth."
[01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:03.040]   Psalm 2 is repeated again.
[01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:06.880]   In fact, that is the table of context of the book of Acts.
[01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:11.920]   It begins in Jerusalem, then moves into the ministry of the church in Judea, then Samaria,
[01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:17.660]   and concludes with Paul in Rome declaring the kingdom of God.
[01:11:17.660 --> 01:11:24.400]   Now the kingdom of God is a universal reality, no longer confined to one particular land
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:27.320]   or to one particular people.
[01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:30.320]   Sisters and brothers, this is the good news of the gospel.
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:32.720]   This is the gospel that was accomplished by Jesus.
[01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:38.560]   This is the salvation that was accomplished by Jesus in Jerusalem and expanded to the
[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:40.040]   ends of the earth.
[01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:48.240]   Jesus is king on earth today and now through the embodiment, through his people, the church.
[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:49.640]   We declare his kingship.
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:50.640]   We declare his rulership.
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:53.640]   Actually, how is the land universalized?
[01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:58.000]   We saw it in Acts 1a, through the ministry of the church, through evangelism.
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:02.640]   Not through might, not through power, but through the good news of the gospel, through
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:09.240]   the preaching of the word, and through actions of service and love and ministry to people.
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:15.560]   That is how we go to new lands and declare them as belonging to King Jesus.
[01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:16.900]   This is the gospel.
[01:12:16.900 --> 01:12:19.100]   This is the theology of the land.
[01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:22.760]   This is what we should continue to preach.
[01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:27.760]   The land, I argue, has been universalized.
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:32.320]   I am not spiritualizing the promises, nor heavenizing them, saying we're going to heaven.
[01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:38.440]   On the contrary, I am saying that the promised land expanded from Jerusalem to the ends of
[01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:39.840]   the earth.
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:45.320]   And it's here that I want to bring the theology of the land as a challenge to you.
[01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:53.200]   That the land has been, we should reproduce new Israelites community in new locations.
[01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:59.680]   And so you today should become in your community of God that embody justice, embody holiness,
[01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:03.720]   embody the presence of God in your midst, in your lands.
[01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:09.240]   And this is how even Hong Kong today, the place where you worship, where you embody
[01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:15.160]   God through the presence of Jesus in your midst, could become a holy land.
[01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:21.480]   And if you live in covenant with God, obey God, that land could function as a holy land,
[01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:27.160]   as a promised land, where people encounter God in you, where people learn about justice
[01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:30.520]   through your actions and through your ministry.
[01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:34.200]   This is what I call a missional theology of the land.
[01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:37.240]   Scripture reminds us that land matters.
[01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:40.720]   Israel and her land can function as a paradigm.
[01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:49.920]   And so a missional theology of the land replicates a Christian version of Israel in you lands.
[01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:55.680]   That's why if you were wondering what is the strange title of your book, From Land to Lands,
[01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:59.880]   From Eden to the Renewed Earth, this is exactly what I mean.
[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:05.640]   Let's take the community model of salvation, the embodiment of the presence of God model
[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:10.680]   of salvation and replicate it in you locations.
[01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:16.080]   Community society matter, territory matter, ecological issues matter.
[01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:22.880]   For the Bible in both testaments has a vision of an inclusive and redeemed land.
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:27.560]   Remember where I began my presentation with the scenes in the Middle East?
[01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:33.160]   And here I want to say the Middle East has enough of exclusive ideologies.
[01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:41.800]   The last thing we need is for Christians to come with more exclusive ideologies.
[01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:47.840]   We need to emphasize a more inclusive one, an approach in which land could be shared.
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:52.360]   And so before I move to modern interpretation, please understand what I'm saying.
[01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:57.480]   I am not saying that I reject Israel's right to exist today or that I'm calling for Israel's
[01:14:57.480 --> 01:15:00.280]   destruction.
[01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:05.880]   I am saying that as a Palestinian, and I should argue that all Christians, should relate to
[01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:13.720]   the state of Israel based on international law, okay, based on human rights, not based
[01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:19.960]   on their divine right or that Israel is a fulfillment of prophecy or that Israel is
[01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:25.440]   a blessing to the nations today that we should accept that as Palestinians and simply stand
[01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:27.800]   out of the land and so on.
[01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:31.340]   And because of that, we cannot be silenced over justice.
[01:15:31.340 --> 01:15:34.160]   My argument is simple.
[01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:36.640]   Let us relate to Israel based on international law.
[01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:41.080]   People, by the way, often ask me, "What is your theology of the Jewish people?"
[01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:45.200]   If you don't believe in this or that, you know, and I simply say, it's very simple.
[01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:46.600]   Love your neighbor as yourself.
[01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:49.760]   That's my theology of the Jewish people.
[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:53.880]   They are created in the image of God, loved by God, and so we should do the same.
[01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:59.600]   We should love them, we should serve them, and if they are unjust, we should challenge
[01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:00.600]   them.
[01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:03.000]   If they are just, we should commend them.
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:07.160]   That is my theology of the Jewish people and simple.
[01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:13.800]   Remember that today in Palestine, and I wish I have the time to explain what I mean by
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:19.880]   just, there is a lot of injustices in the land in all aspects of life.
[01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:23.960]   There is an oppressed and an occupied and an occupier.
[01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:26.240]   There is inequality.
[01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:32.080]   And let us remember that justice matters to God and that the theology of the land is about
[01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:37.160]   a community that embodies justice and calls for justice.
[01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:42.460]   We always say that if your theology is against or trumps the biblical and ethical teachings
[01:16:42.460 --> 01:16:50.500]   of Jesus, of love, equality, and justice, then you must rethink your theology.
[01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:53.740]   If our theology discriminates, there's a problem with it.
[01:16:53.740 --> 01:17:00.240]   If our theology is ethnically based, if our theology is tribal, there is a problem with
[01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:01.240]   it.
[01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:06.520]   Remember Deuteronomy 16, "Justice and only justice you shall follow, that you may live
[01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:09.360]   and inherit the land that the Lord your God is sharing with you."
[01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:18.640]   And so I conclude with my hope and vision that one day the two peoples will be able
[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:25.560]   to share the land, Palestinians and Israelis, and the two peoples will have equality and
[01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:33.320]   that justice will take place, even if that is a challenging reality.
[01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:36.860]   A shared land, I argue, is not simply one option forward.
[01:17:36.860 --> 01:17:40.320]   It is the only option forward, especially, by the way, in Palestine and Israel.
[01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:42.440]   It's such a small land.
[01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:44.000]   You cannot divide it.
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:45.900]   It's impossible.
[01:17:45.900 --> 01:17:50.000]   The only way forward is for Palestinians and Israelis to live together and to cooperate.
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:51.680]   We must find ways.
[01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:55.080]   And it's here that I argue, does our theology promote that?
[01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:57.720]   Do our prayers promote that?
[01:17:57.720 --> 01:18:04.520]   And do our action promote that concept of a shared land, a land in which all people
[01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:07.600]   are treated equally?
[01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:14.760]   I will finish my presentation with a quote from a document called Kairos, Palestine,
[01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:19.960]   written by Palestinian Christian theologians from all theological backgrounds.
[01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:25.600]   It's a beautiful quote about a vision for the land.
[01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:32.560]   In it, Palestinians say, Palestinian Christians, "Our land is God's land, as is the case
[01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:35.840]   with all countries in the world.
[01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:42.880]   It is holy inasmuch as God is present in it, for God alone is holy and sanctifier.
[01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:49.080]   It is the duty of those of us who live here to respect the will of God for this land.
[01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:54.080]   It is our duty to liberate it from the evil of injustice and war.
[01:18:54.080 --> 01:19:00.720]   It is God's land, and therefore it must be a land of reconciliation, peace, and love.
[01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:03.560]   This is indeed possible.
[01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:10.440]   God has put us here as two peoples, and God gives us the capacity, if we have the will,
[01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:18.160]   to live together and establish in it justice and peace, making it in reality God's land."
[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:25.360]   As Psalm 24 says, "The earth is the Lord's, and all that is in it, the world and those
[01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:28.080]   who live in it."
[01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:29.080]   Thank you very much for listening.
[01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:30.080]   God bless you.
