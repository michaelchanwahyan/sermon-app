00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
(音樂)

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Good morning, welcome everyone

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Michael Chu here

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's great to have so many people

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
hundreds of people here in our lecture

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We know we have people from Hong Kong

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
from America and from all over the world

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And this morning we continue to host our

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Josephine So lecture week

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And today is the third lecture

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It's a great honor to have Dr. Mark Lepperton

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
to be our keynote speaker

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Dr. Lepperton has spoken to us

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
on the overall title

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The Crisis of American White Evangelicalism

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Personally for the last two days

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I learned a lot as Mark walked us through

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
the American history and outlined

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
the specific perspective on the American culture

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And Mark also highlights the certain deficiency

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
of evangelism or even the deficiency

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
of evangelical churches

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm particularly impressed by Mark's honesty

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
and courage in the path of self-critique

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Mark, if you don't mind, I would like to address you

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
by your first name

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Because I feel after these two lectures

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I feel so close to you

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We are just like good old friends

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
As if you are talking to me in person

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So Mark will speak to us this morning

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
on the third topic

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Evangelical Perplexities about Power and Leadership

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We will shift our discussion

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
to the leadership part of the churches

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So Mark, we are much looking forward

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
to your speaking to us

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And now we welcome Mark to speak to us

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Thank you very much, Michael

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I appreciate your words

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm grateful again to be here

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Just before I start my lecture

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I want today to do two things briefly

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
First, just to acknowledge that

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I find it perhaps providential

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
that on the day when

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
the Congress of the United States

48
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
voted to impeach for the second time

49
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
the President of the United States

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
we're talking about the issues of power and leadership

51
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
and evangelical perplexities about those things

52
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It's been a very sobering and painful day

53
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
a divisive day in the United States

54
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
and the implications of today

55
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
will be unfolding for some considerable time to come

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I secondly want to just acknowledge that

57
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
in this decision of the Congress

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
there is for so many different reasons

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
ways that the American white evangelical church

60
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
is implicated and involved

61
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
in the things that led up to this moment

62
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
and certainly in the implications of this moment

63
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
as we go forward from here

64
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So I wonder if you would mind

65
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
letting me just offer a prayer

66
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
for the church in the United States

67
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
as well as for all of us

68
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Lord of all, it's to you that we come

69
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You are the one who reigns

70
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
in mercy and justice over all peoples and places

71
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You are the one who sees us as we are

72
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You understand the places in which we see clearly

73
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And you understand the places

74
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
in which our sight and knowledge are so confused

75
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
This day in the United States is a very dark day

76
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's a day in which we acknowledge

77
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
some painful realities about our national life

78
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And as we go forward

79
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
your church is implicated in both

80
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
some of the causes of why the problems exist

81
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And also we pray by your grace

82
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
a church that might be able to be used

83
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
by you for the renewal of the church

84
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
and the renewal of a nation

85
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Tonight as we pray here

86
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
and in the morning as people pray throughout Asia

87
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
and in Hong Kong in particular

88
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
we acknowledge that it's your lordship

89
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
your power, your leadership

90
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
that we need far above and beyond any human agency

91
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So in humility, oh God, we turn to these issues tonight

92
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
acknowledging how much we need you to speak

93
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
to guide, to confront, to transform us

94
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
In the name of Jesus Christ

95
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
who reigns with humility and power

96
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
In Jesus' name, amen

97
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So we come tonight to consider

98
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
evangelical complexities about power and leadership

99
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
We will reflect on issues of evangelical power

100
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
that underline, crown, and even subvert its gospel

101
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
and its witness

102
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
The history of the church has typically been told

103
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
as the story of so-called big men

104
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
that is, a man usually, if not almost always

105
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
through the power of personality, gifts, opportunity

106
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
stealth, privilege of birth, and influence

107
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
to have written the story of the world

108
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I dare say this is true in the east or the west

109
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
it's true in the south and the north

110
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
whether the past or the present

111
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
We seem to be in a time of exceptional global power disorder

112
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
and redefinition

113
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Every continent has evidences of the turmoil

114
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
that's going on inside the United States

115
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It is not a time of world war

116
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
and yet in so many directions

117
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
we see national and international collision

118
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
aggression and hostility

119
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Battles of war, including within and among evangelical Christians

120
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
are clearly afoot

121
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
All of this is, of course, in dramatic contrast

122
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
to the description of Jesus

123
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
that we see in Paul's letter to the Philippians, chapter 2, verses 1 through 8

124
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Hear these words again

125
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Have this mind among yourselves

126
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Which is yours in Christ Jesus

127
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Though he was in the form of God

128
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped

129
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
But emptied himself by taking the form of a servant

130
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Being born in the likeness of men

131
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
And being found in human form

132
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
He humbled himself by taking the form of a servant

133
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And being born in the likeness of men

134
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And being found in human form

135
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
He humbled himself and became obedient

136
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
To the point of death

137
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Even death on a cross

138
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Jesus as the ultimate "big man"

139
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Lays down the assumptions and prerogatives of power

140
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
To live and lead in vulnerability and in weakness

141
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Nevertheless, the big man

142
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
assumptions occupy a very significant place

143
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
in the life of the American Evangelical Church

144
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
From the 18th to the 20th century

145
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
to this day in the 21st

146
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,000
we can point to the quiet, prayerful, faithful, often exemplary lives

147
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
of members of the white Evangelical Church in the U.S.

148
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
and see many true signs of the fruit of the Spirit

149
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Albeit, this can now only be said

150
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
if we acknowledge that this positive legacy

151
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
is often still intertwined

152
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
with the subtle and horrific compromises

153
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
and the absence of self-criticism

154
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
or repentance or lament

155
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
and transformation that could have occurred

156
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It's often a story of hidden piety

157
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
inward piety

158
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
rather than public piety

159
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
matched with justice

160
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Susceptible as human beings are

161
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
to seek a savior and a hero

162
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
it has been an easy assumption

163
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
that God will raise up the leader

164
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
in a U.S. context

165
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
that should be understood primarily

166
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
typically as being white and male

167
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
to be a leader, pastor

168
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
an authoritative, visionary voice

169
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
This archetype is so pervasive and influential

170
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
it's assumed rather than examined

171
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
This is necessarily accompanied by an image

172
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
of a blonde, blue-eyed Jesus

173
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
who serves the dominant interests of an Evangelicalism

174
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
that insists on seeing its image of Jesus

175
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
seeing in its image of Jesus itself

176
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
rather than letting Jesus see his image in us

177
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
On the other hand, it can be acknowledged with gratitude

178
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
that the Evangelical movement in the 20th century

179
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
with all of its blessings and sins

180
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
perhaps ironically and unselfconsciously

181
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
both contributed to and resisted

182
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
the geographic repositioning

183
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
of the center of the global Christian movement

184
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
from being a story centered in the global north

185
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
to one that's now clearly centered in the global south

186
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
and in Asia

187
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
This is a cause for rejoicing and for prominence

188
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
that is primarily about the Spirit of God

189
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
meeting the people of God

190
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
This is really the story of God

191
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
calling, forming, and using leaders

192
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
around the world for such transformative change

193
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
not least throughout Asia

194
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
During the last quarter of the 20th century

195
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
in America and elsewhere

196
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
we saw the rise of the megachurch phenomenon

197
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
that has risen and also fallen

198
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
because of the influence of the big man paradigm

199
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
story of largely unidirectional

200
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
typically white male power in the United States

201
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
This means the need to acknowledge as such

202
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
as part of the observations of the 20th and 21st century

203
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
white Evangelicalism still operates

204
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
largely in a colonialist framework

205
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
both in the U.S. and globally

206
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Several factors explain this

207
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
First is dominion, the theme of dominion

208
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
The specifically Christian theme of dominion

209
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
has been one that has been informed, motivated

210
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
shaped and subverted by our sense of the mission of God

211
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
the missio Dei

212
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
The sense of the mission of God in the world

213
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
as an embodied and proclaimed announcement

214
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
that the reign of God is at hand

215
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
for the sake of all people and places

216
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
a bringing to consummation of all things

217
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
by our Creator, Redeemer and Remaker

218
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
This exercise of divine dominion

219
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
is for the sake of bringing to an end

220
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
the groaning of all humanity

221
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
and of Jesus and of the Spirit

222
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
and of the people of God

223
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
and of the whole created order

224
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
for the sake of God's shalom

225
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
and the well-being of love

226
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
and mercy and justice, harmony

227
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
The so-called doctrine of discovery

228
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
which came into existence in 1493

229
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
was the act of Pope Alexander VI

230
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
and played a highly influential role

231
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
in justifying and shaping the Spanish conquest

232
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
and the colonial project from that point on

233
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
The papal bull that the Pope

234
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
put out gave permission and power

235
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
to discoverers, as they were called

236
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
of any land that was not inhabited by Christians

237
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
that if they discovered such a land

238
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
uninhabited by Christians

239
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
then it was considered to be available

240
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
to be "discovered," claimed

241
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
and exploited by Christian rulers

242
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
and declared that the Catholic faith

243
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
and the Christian religion

244
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
be exalted and be everywhere increased and spread

245
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
that the health of souls be cared for

246
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
and that barbarous nations be overthrown

247
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
and brought to the faith itself

248
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
This doctrine of discovery

249
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
justified all European claims in the Americas

250
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
and the premise justifying

251
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
the Western expansion of the United States

252
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
A book that I would commend to you

253
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
is a book written by Mark Charles and Choon Sa

254
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Sung Chan Ra, entitled "Unsettling Truths"

255
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
which explores this in much more detail

256
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Many other books, likewise, have been written about it

257
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
This aligns with what had been seen

258
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
in the Roman Empire

259
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Constantine's influence, medieval expansionism and war

260
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Yet, through the doctrine of discovery

261
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
the Church is itself the initiator

262
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
in the further coalescence

263
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
of Church and government collusion

264
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
to use power in the name of faith

265
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
for the sake of political, economic and religious ends

266
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It is the full fruit

267
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
of what had long been operational

268
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
and it was unleashed

269
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
in what continues in less obtrusive ways

270
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
to the dominion mindset

271
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
of some American white evangelicals to this day

272
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
The ferocity of the division

273
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
between the American evangelical church

274
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
and the American evangelical church

275
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
is in many ways

276
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
unlocked by the doctrine of discovery

277
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
If you believe, as many do,

278
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
that the ideological, political and religious battles

279
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
going on among white evangelical voices in the U.S.

280
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
has little to do with theology

281
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
it has more to do with power

282
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Its roots for how that power expresses itself

283
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
is evident in the doctrine of discovery

284
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
The assumption is that these battles

285
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
are an extension of the doctrine of discovery

286
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
that is, they now go on

287
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
like an ever-playing fugue line in music

288
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
that undergirds and reassures many

289
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
that this white normativity is the right track

290
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It is a form of aggressive nostalgia

291
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
that longs for an earlier, more racially homogenous

292
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
less racially diverse

293
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
more unquestionably defined

294
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
and controlled white normativity

295
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
that dominates other so-called intrusive voices

296
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I accept Dr. Willie Jennings argument

297
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
that being "white"

298
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
is not strictly about the melatonin level of one's skin

299
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
but about a heart and mindset

300
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
that can take captive any person of any race

301
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Whiteness holds power

302
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
and the claims and rights of power

303
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
simply as an expression of the way

304
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
that reality has established it

305
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
This at least is the blindness of whiteness

306
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
the presumption and normativity

307
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
that is so damaging to white people

308
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
and even more to those who are its victims

309
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Whiteness is the personalized and social form

310
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
of the doctrine of discovery

311
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
holding internally the assumption

312
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
and assertion

313
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
that the individual can claim in relationship to others

314
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
attitudes of conquest, superiority and dominance

315
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
whether it is about owning a gun

316
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
wearing a face mask

317
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
attending an inter-public worship service

318
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
or anything else

319
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I hope all of these themes

320
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
are ones that you've seen

321
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
and given evidence to

322
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
in the American press

323
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Dominion then is our first major problem

324
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
The second problem that's related to it

325
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
is the notion of American exceptionalism

326
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
This as you know

327
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
has a long tail in the narrative of US history

328
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
It starts with the writing

329
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
of a French man of letters

330
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Alexis de Tocqueville

331
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
who described the United States as "exceptional"

332
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
as a "new country"

333
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
and in the convergence of a kind of mindset

334
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
and instincts

335
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
that would allow it to hold unique power

336
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
and influence in North America

337
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
and eventually the world

338
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
One of the deepest assumptions in nationalism

339
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
is that American nationalism

340
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
is not only best for it

341
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
but also best for the world

342
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
that it wants to influence

343
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It is endlessly self-admiring and adulating

344
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
and it is full of the idolatry

345
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
of a nation over any and all other forces

346
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
especially outside forces

347
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
In this model

348
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
the phrase "America first"

349
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
has periodically emerged

350
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
as the battle cry

351
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
in relationship to other nations

352
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
While the internal dangers

353
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
and enemies of powers

354
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
must be limited and opposed as well

355
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
All this has been an intense resurgent

356
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
in recent years in the United States

357
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
certainly since the 1980s

358
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
growing in the 1990s

359
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
and very powerfully present

360
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
throughout the 2000s to date

361
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
And it's attached to the Dominion vision

362
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
that like Napoleon

363
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
simply crowns itself emperor

364
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
America has done that

365
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
in so many painful

366
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
and inappropriate and unjust ways

367
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
When the church adds to it

368
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
the elements of manifest destiny

369
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
that this exceptionalism

370
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
this nationalism

371
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,000
is like America being a new Israel

372
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
and in relation to which

373
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
this nation is first and primary

374
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
in God's and in the church's priorities

375
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
It is an extremely dangerous

376
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
collection of idolatries

377
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
precisely and passionately held up

378
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
as the only true national worship

379
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
This creates a perfect closed circle

380
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
dressed up in Christian speech

381
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
which avoids Christian identity

382
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
and character

383
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
in matters that are both public

384
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
such as the equality of diversity

385
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
peace with justice

386
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
structural and personal racism

387
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
and in private

388
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
such as which voices are heard

389
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
which lives and needs are seen

390
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
which narratives or stories

391
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
are actually believed

392
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
So Dominion, nationalism

393
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
and third is individualism

394
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
White evangelicals in the United States

395
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
seamlessly pair the doctrine of discovery

396
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
with deep-seated autonomous individualism

397
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
That is, the individual autonomous self

398
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
gets to walk through the world

399
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
like nations did

400
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
under the doctrine of discovery

401
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
and make claim on peoples and places

402
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:27,000
jobs, voices, power, influence and so forth

403
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
It's a tragic story

404
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
It's one of America's best and worst traits

405
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
The best side of this kind of individualism

406
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
is the way in which it can be

407
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
attached to a sense that

408
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
individual independent rights

409
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
are a reflection of being made in the image of God

410
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
They are the center in personal, political

411
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
structural, familial, social and religious life

412
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
in the United States

413
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
It must be the individual

414
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Unlike Ubuntu in Africa

415
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
"I am because we are"

416
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
the American slogan is more nearly

417
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
"I am because I make myself"

418
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
This means that power is finally personal

419
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
and that the community

420
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
whether in church or society at large

421
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
are always in third place

422
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
behind family and tribe

423
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
In the end, the culture in which

424
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
American evangelical lives and often thrives

425
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
is on the grounds that each person

426
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
and their own will and personality

427
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
and priorities and values

428
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
should be placed at the center of everything

429
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
So much of America's ethical and moral history

430
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
even to this day

431
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
around issues of human sexuality

432
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
and many other things

433
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
are all reflections

434
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
of this doctor discovery oriented

435
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
racially biased

436
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
individual pleasing form of Christian life

437
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
is into a consumerism

438
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
that's measured by the satisfaction

439
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
of church members

440
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
and not by wisdom or by faithfulness

441
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
This kind of distorted ecology of faith and mind

442
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
heart and will

443
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
to call Jesus Lord, Lord

444
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
but completely separated

445
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
from actually doing the will of God

446
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
The inward private conversion of a disciple

447
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
or the response to the altar call

448
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
to getting saved

449
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
is an especially white evangelicalism

450
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
The Bible is of course clear

451
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
about the value of the individual

452
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
and the need for each of us in the body of Christ

453
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
to seek and find God

454
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
But the weight of the scriptures

455
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
rests on the calling of a people

456
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
not just an individual

457
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
to be God's own people

458
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
and for the call of the ecclesia

459
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
that is those that called out community

460
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
to be communally called out into one new humanity

461
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
is a sign that we collectively

462
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
not just I

463
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
who once was dead

464
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
have not just been revived

465
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
but have actually been made new

466
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
as evidenced through our living

467
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
into a new community of unlike

468
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
The immigrant escape

469
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
from Europe and many other countries since

470
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
has infused in the evangelical movement

471
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
in the United States

472
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
the preference for finding and maintaining

473
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
your tribe

474
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
America can at times be a melting pot

475
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
but that is not the common experience of many

476
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Instead we are a collection of social, racial and economic tribes

477
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
with the white evangelical tribe

478
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
presupposing itself to be always in the lead

479
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
the communion

480
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
that crowns the communion

481
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
that is really the way that is often organized

482
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I will confess that for me personally

483
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
one of the most painful parts of the history

484
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
and influence of Fuller's Seminary

485
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
is the church growth movement

486
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
In a well-researched and motivated beginning

487
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Donald McGovern on Fuller's faculty

488
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
desired to help the gospel reach more of America

489
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
not just one by one

490
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
but in a larger, broader, more communal sense

491
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
He knew this meant a gospel that was attuned to context

492
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
This led him to the discovery, sociologically

493
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
that people come to faith faster and simpler

494
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
if they do not have to cross a cultural threshold

495
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
And if the gospel is embodied in a contextually appealing

496
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:06,000
and recognizable way

497
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
In some ways these are not only legitimate

498
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
but valuable insights

499
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
On the other hand, what these insights become

500
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
is a rationale for what is known as the homogeneous unit principle

501
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
And what later becomes the marketing motivation

502
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
for the church growth

503
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
through gathering simply people who are similar

504
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
not gathering people through the lens

505
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
of a diverse group of people with a kingdom vision

506
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
a brokenness and remaking

507
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
that moves from nothing less than death to life

508
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Instead, we call people to join the church

509
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
as an accommodation to their social context

510
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
assuring them that they will find there

511
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
many who are just like themselves

512
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
What is offered in this way, then

513
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
is simply a gospel that is about appeal

514
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
a warm, positive, life-affirming appeal

515
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
and a community of people of those who together

516
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
believe that "their needs are being met"

517
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Conversion comes to mean that we are putting trust

518
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
in God's eternal hope

519
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
and having a personal relationship with Christ

520
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
that can become nothing more than getting God

521
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
to give us good gifts for our sake

522
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,000
and for the sake of others that we know and love

523
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Pointedly, what is not being offered

524
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
or discipled into many people's lives

525
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
is the fundamental, comprehensive revolution

526
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
of kingdom recreation

527
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
We take the phrase in Corinthians

528
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
all things being made new

529
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
and reattach it to the impact

530
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
of simply saying yes to an affirmation of faith

531
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
But then that gets cut off

532
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
from the deep spiritual transformational process

533
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
by which by word and spirit

534
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
our minds and our lives are meant to be renewed

535
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
in order that we may actually do, that is, perform

536
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
enact, embody the will of God

537
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Romans 12, 1 and 2

538
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:27,000
The next factor in this is what I'm calling agency

539
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
In Matthew 9 we read

540
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
All things are possible through them that love and serve God

541
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
This rich but humble affirmation of God's ability

542
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
to accomplish whatever God may design

543
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
through the power of the Holy Spirit

544
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
can become nothing more than a mantra

545
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
like rubbing the genie lamp

546
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
at the will of the disciple

547
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
God becomes the power

548
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
for the exercise of my own personal agency

549
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I seek God for the power to do my will

550
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
not my will to seek the humility

551
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
to serve the power of God

552
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
In the name of the unassailable

553
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
and incomparable power of God

554
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
there is a kind of teaching about the exercise of faith

555
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
that is really about the role that one can have

556
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
in being the willful believing agent, hence agency

557
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,000
that can accomplish what the prayer may will

558
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
as though by prayerful agency

559
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
the individual or two or three others

560
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,000
can by themselves usher in the kingdom of God

561
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I would argue that if it is the kingdom of God we are naming

562
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
not the kingdom of Christian leaders or nations or individuals

563
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,000
then human beings are never the primary agent of that sentence

564
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
The inference in some white American evangelicalism

565
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
is that human agency

566
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
represented by what is seen as the "truly faithful"

567
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
the true believers

568
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
can bring forth the manifestation of God's will and reign

569
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
It is prayer without doubt

570
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,000
often meaning without humility or self-critique

571
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
or acknowledged finitude or fundamental bias

572
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
that produces blessing

573
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
The best history I know of the prosperity gospel as an aside

574
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
is written by Kate Bowler

575
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
and is in a book that she has written entitled "Blessed"

576
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
She examines and studies firsthand

577
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,000
how this agency theme is managed

578
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
and described by prosperity gospels

579
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
by prosperity churches and preachers

580
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
in the United States and beyond

581
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Agency in the way that I'm talking about it at the moment

582
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
is really just a personalized form of dominion

583
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:59,000
that is exerting the power of our vision, personality or desire

584
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
The important quality of how we have been made in the image of God

585
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
can be another good gift

586
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
turned into little more than self-interest

587
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
We are made to exercise agency in the world

588
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
when we hold it in the way that often has happened

589
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
it plays into what I call consumer Christianity

590
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
in which human agency and desire

591
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
occupies the private place

592
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
with the general assurance that this is appropriate

593
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
because God wants to give us "the desires of our heart"

594
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Psalm 37

595
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
But agency in Israel's life

596
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
is at the heart of the prophet's critique in Isaiah 58

597
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Israel has taken the worship practices of God's people

598
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
and used them, the prophet says, for their own purposes

599
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
such that worship ends up being about them

600
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
and not about God

601
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
No wonder God says this is "as if" worship

602
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
that is, worship that pretends or claims to be about God

603
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,000
as if they were going to actually live in a righteous way

604
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Instead, instead of honoring and using their agency to serve Yahweh

605
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:21,000
in fact, their worship, the prophet says, is about themselves

606
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,000
This is a story of agency gone to seed without any fruit

607
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
The fruit of the Spirit is meant to be productive

608
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,000
and it's meant to be productive that shows itself in ways far beyond

609
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:40,000
productive agency in the bounty of our own self-interest

610
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Instead, the fruit of the Spirit is, you know

611
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:55,000
love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, gentleness, and self-control

612
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:03,000
So dominion, nationalism, individualism, and agency

613
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:09,000
cannot and do not seek or produce the fruit of the Spirit

614
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Those are all elements that by themselves

615
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:18,000
bear the fruit of a lack of faithfulness

616
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
rather than an evidence of it

617
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Another factor for a movement that is founded

618
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Sorry

619
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Christianity and evangelicalism

620
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Sorry

621
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:55,000
is a movement that is founded on the belief that God gives us the peace that passes understanding

622
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:03,000
And yet fear is a significant feature that motivates American white evangelicalism

623
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
particularly so for its leaders

624
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:12,000
There are different fears that correspond to different possible threats

625
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,000
We could start with theological or doctrinal fear

626
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Part of a danger of favored status is then the possibility of losing that status

627
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Fear and anxiety grips a lot of evangelical leaders and pastors

628
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
who then wonder about speaking the truth when the stakes are high

629
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
And if they get it wrong or if people don't like what they say

630
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
the loss can be aggressive and destructive

631
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:48,000
In some cases, it is built into a self-dependent theology of salvation

632
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:54,000
as though a person is really saying, "I am saved by having the right theology."

633
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,000
And that can mean that my salvation is mine to win or lose

634
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Will I or won't I be saved depends on me, not depending on God and what God has done in Jesus Christ

635
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
So the issue then becomes, do I have the doctrine right?

636
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Or am I too dangerously close to quote wrong doctrine, wrong belief, wrong communion, wrong practices?

637
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,000
All of those things being things that Jesus himself was accused of

638
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,000
This kind of an approach to fear is about boundaries

639
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
A boundary that is about who is in the circle

640
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
versus who and what is outside the boundaries of God's grace

641
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Minding the boundaries for oneself or one's family or church or denomination or one's nation and so on

642
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
means that we are fearful about getting it wrong

643
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
The ever-present need to be sure that we are getting it right

644
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:59,000
that our people are right, that our tribe is right, that our church is right, that our denomination is right, that our seminary is right

645
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Within one week recently

646
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I received five phone calls from very experienced pastors

647
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
who called to talk about the fact that these pressures around fear

648
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,000
were going to mean that they themselves feared that they would be fired

649
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
and that they would not be able to find another job

650
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,000
because of being judged unacceptable by leaders around them

651
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Within a couple of weeks of receiving those phone calls myself

652
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
three had been fired

653
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
and not only fired but then maligned

654
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
This is the evidence of what I'm talking about

655
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Another category of fear has to do with the ever-present danger of "the world versus the flesh"

656
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:48,000
The premise here is that faithful disciples are vulnerable to being consumed or shipwrecked

657
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
by the ubiquitous presence of sin and evil in the world

658
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,000
At any moment our enemy is seeking someone to devour

659
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Therefore disciples need not just the tools of spiritual warfare

660
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
but the continual readiness for spiritual battles

661
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:12,000
This tends to stimulate in our brains the kind of neurobiology

662
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,000
and the moral worry that makes finding, naming, and embattling enemies

663
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
an obvious and continuous necessity for many

664
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
History has shown the likelihood of this progression

665
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:30,000
and the historical evidence, not least in exploding numbers of demonimations in the 20th and 21st century

666
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:37,000
In the century of God's greatest wars, the 20th, of the world's greatest wars in the 20th century

667
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
it is plain that enemies are real

668
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,000
and that the church must be alert and aggressively self-protective

669
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
It's a fearful posture that ironically pushes away and down

670
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:54,000
the very lost in need of the evangel

671
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:00,000
This fear plays readily to a spiritual fight or flight response

672
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
which fear often evokes

673
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Both a fear of fighting or fleeing

674
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,000
both toward those inside the church and toward those in the culture

675
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:17,000
It fosters the likelihood of approaching discipleship as embattlement

676
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Now clearly the New Testament uses this imagery

677
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I'm not in any way arguing that

678
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
I'm arguing for the way that it's a dominant theme

679
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,000
and for what it is that Christian leadership should do about that theme

680
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:41,000
The first response of fighting takes up force of various kinds in order to defeat the opponent

681
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
A recent public example of this

682
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
was when the Southern Baptist Convention of Seminary Presidents

683
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:53,000
opposed to, rejected and publicly repudiated

684
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:59,000
the academic study that's known as Critical Race Theory

685
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
This school of thought, Critical Race Theory

686
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,000
attempts to understand the dynamics of racial justice and oppression

687
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,000
When the seminary presidents of the Southern Baptist Convention

688
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
condemned Critical Race Theory

689
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,000
it did so out of a fear that the critique will do damage to the church

690
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
But by condemning Critical Race Theory

691
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
they expose at the same moment unintentionally

692
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:32,000
the underlying fear that the denomination's originating racism will be exposed

693
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Ironically, their condemning action reveals so pointedly

694
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:42,000
that they see CRT, that is Critical Race Theory, as the real enemy

695
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:49,000
rather than the underlying controlling racism that debilitates them and their gospel

696
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
By drawing the battle line as these seminary presidents did

697
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
they fought what they saw as an enemy

698
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
that is a stand-in for the real opponent

699
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:05,000
maintaining the embattlement profile that is so important to their theological and cultural sensibility

700
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,000
And it was done by white, male, evangelical leaders

701
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:14,000
displaying their power to name and control their sense of the reality narrative

702
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:21,000
while masking their fear and their denomination's fear of losing their white supremacy

703
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,000
The chief problem revealed here is what the Apostle Paul says

704
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
is the fear of the weaker brother

705
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
The wrongly fears what does not need to be feared

706
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
while failing to fear what deserves to be feared

707
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:40,000
The fears of many American white evangelicals is a set of fears that center on them

708
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:46,000
on their perceptions, their social location, their beliefs, their tribal interests

709
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
rather than on what matters most to the kingdom of God

710
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Is it too much to think of Jesus' words to the Pharisees

711
00:39:53,000 --> 00:40:02,000
that they "tithe dill and cumin, but avoid the wavier matters of the law, mercy and justice"

712
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Fear management can seem to be one of the defining features of American white evangelicals

713
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:13,000
and for many leaders, this is one of their chief preoccupations

714
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:23,000
American and leadership are words that many in the United States proudly believe belong inextricably together

715
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:29,000
The American white evangelical church in most of the last half century

716
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:37,000
has tried to assert its voice in the cultural, legal and yes, political maelstrom that I've been trying to describe

717
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:44,000
American culture has long since been defined by media and secular culture than ever before

718
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,000
There is a genuine battle to acknowledge and to engage in relation to the controlling influences

719
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
shaping children and teens and young adults

720
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:58,000
The reasons to fear the implications of a highly influential secularism

721
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:05,000
and anti-religious bias, not least in the west and east coast of the United States

722
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Now nations around the world have marveled at the pervasive religiosity of the United States

723
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:16,000
and the high percentage of Americans who believe in God and worship regularly

724
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:24,000
The liberty and protections of religious freedom are long established and also continuously under attack

725
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:32,000
What American white evangelicalism has not done is to find a nationally credible, thoughtful leader practitioner

726
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:39,000
who incarnates and speaks into the public sphere in ways that can capture the imagination and engage the heart

727
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I've tried here to suggest factors that I believe contribute to why this perplexity of leadership has not emerged

728
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:54,000
and perhaps would not even be received as a good idea or a legitimate hope

729
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:04,000
And of course what is needed, far more than a singular voice, is for the church in the United States to live into its true Christian identity

730
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Jesus' strategy for disciple-making is a new community that lives out its surprising eclectic diversity

731
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:24,000
This servant-living communion would dismantle and redefine dominion and nationalism and individualism and agency and fear

732
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:32,000
This kind of Christian community that is so deeply needed would be an authentic, credible communion

733
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,000
that lives as the body of Christ in the world and for the sake of the world

734
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Not inward turning, but living sacrificially and freely for the sake of the world

735
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,000
especially the poor and the marginalized

736
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:52,000
The American white evangelical crisis is not so much in the sense of theological crisis

737
00:42:52,000 --> 00:43:01,000
as it is a church in crisis over a failure to live out the church's identity as a reflection of Jesus Christ

738
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Instead, it has turned out to live as a reflection of the culture in which it is placed

739
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
As simple and plain as that sounds

740
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:18,000
it is the story of great blessings of life put under a basket of American thirst

741
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:25,000
or of salt losing its saltiness for a desire instead to conform

742
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Will that change?

743
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:40,000
On this day, when the President of the United States has been treated in the way that he has by Congress

744
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
in such a legitimate and defensible way

745
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:52,000
shows the barren fruit of the American evangelical story being identified more with power

746
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:59,000
secular, political, social, economic, cultural power

747
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,000
than by the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ

748
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,000
It's only the latter that is the hope of the world

749
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Let me pause there and welcome my two respondents

750
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Thank you, Mark

751
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Thank you for your very perceptive discussion of leadership

752
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:35,000
particularly the leadership of the American white evangelicalism and the churches

753
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:51,000
You also outline quite a few factors which governs or defines our identities as a leader in the Bible

754
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:57,000
I'm particularly impressed by the last point, the fear, the factor of fear

755
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:08,000
that really always shapes how we behave, how we perform, how we relate to one another

756
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
So thank you very much

757
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:16,000
There's a lot of insight into that

758
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:21,000
So now may I ask Dr. Gene Lee and Dr. Bernard Wong

759
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:29,000
our dean and our associate dean to come forward to give their response

760
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,000
I would like to ask Gene first

761
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Thank you, Professor Levitin, for an insightful portrayal of power and leadership in this lecture

762
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:53,000
In particular, I appreciate the personal and contextual narratives you include in these lectures

763
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:59,000
allowing us to integrate theories with reality for a deeper understanding of the matter

764
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Indeed, the big man paradigm has been apparent for a long time

765
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
and all the more in today's world

766
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,000
No matter what the dominant political system is

767
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,000
people do have a natural tendency to look for heroic leaders

768
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I lift the narrative of a little lady in a big man's world

769
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,000
In my late teens and early twenties, I spent nine years in North America

770
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
studying and working in a big man's world

771
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:37,000
My first job was in external audit, a profession where you are pushed every year to advance a grade in the ranks

772
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:44,000
So quickly, I found myself a short, non-white, Asian female leading an audit team

773
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:50,000
The audit team is tall, handsome-looking young white males

774
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
I remember once when we walked into a client's office

775
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,000
the client immediately spotted the leader among us

776
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,000
greeting one of my white male subordinates with a warm handshake

777
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
I still recall how embarrassed the client was

778
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:11,000
when my colleague redirected everyone's attention to the short Asian female among them

779
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Indeed, we are framed by our culture and context

780
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:21,000
We are bombarded daily with values and expectations that may only be partial truth

781
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Not only do we need the firm grasp of our identity in Christ

782
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:30,000
but also continuous vigor in training for theological instinct

783
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,000
that can help us sense the distortions we face

784
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Professor Levitin pointed out a number of perplexities

785
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
in the concepts behind leadership and power

786
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Dominion, nationalism, individualism, agency concepts, and even fear

787
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:54,000
can quickly become tools or justifications for power and dominance

788
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:00,000
In our context, we face similar compromises and distortions

789
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:05,000
especially when different pressure groups may use the same words and phrases

790
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
to mean different things

791
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:13,000
twisting people's minds and thought processes to suit their agenda

792
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:19,000
While Christians from the West may appreciate the relational culture in Asian communities

793
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:25,000
we know that relationships in Chinese actually translates to 'guānxì'

794
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:30,000
a term expressing an obligation of one party to another

795
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:36,000
with a continuing reciprocation of favours in Chinese business culture

796
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Such practice also penetrates other walks of life

797
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:46,000
taking forms of excessive or corrupted gifting or social exchanges

798
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,000
The prosperity gospel is another example of faith distortion

799
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
that presents itself so vividly in our culture

800
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Chinese folk religions have long preyed on human desire

801
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
and a tendency to create a God

802
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
to whom one can give gifts in exchange for favours

803
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Thus we are very much attracted to Matthew 7:7

804
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,000
"Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find;

805
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
knock, and the door will be opened to you."

806
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
This Bible verse is obviously valuable

807
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,000
only that we tend to stop at 'ask and be given'

808
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
without truly seeking and finding God's will

809
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
and discerning the door that gets opened

810
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,000
In recent years, Hong Kong society undergoes drastic changes

811
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
both politically and under COVID-19

812
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Adversities and pressures tear us further apart

813
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
splitting groups of brothers and sisters

814
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:49,000
some down the compromising route, some to fighting in the extremes

815
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Those taking various middle stances are attacked by both sides

816
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,000
We no longer see leadership and power in the traditional sense

817
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:02,000
but rather see these with a negative feeling of distrust

818
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
We are challenged to go back to the very basic

819
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
asking the question

820
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
What does the gospel mean to our culture

821
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,000
and the situation we are facing?

822
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,000
All of us are confronted with our own fear

823
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Be it spiritual, as in the Christian faith

824
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000
or political in the societal sense

825
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Under the changing political climate

826
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
the people in Hong Kong are influenced by fear

827
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
in much deeper ways as never before

828
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Fight or flight takes on another meaning

829
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
as individuals and families decide

830
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
whether to redomicile abroad

831
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,000
under the changing political climate

832
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Hopefully, this decision process involves spiritual discernment

833
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
and that the Lord continues to work in our midst

834
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
that our faith be strong wherever we go

835
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
We continue to pray for God's wonder

836
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,000
in this special time of drastic change

837
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
The big man paradigm is indeed a sharp contrast

838
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,000
to the description of Jesus in Philippians 2, 1-8

839
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:13,000
The humble leader is a subversive paradigm

840
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Even here, we encounter the easy distortion of James 4:10

841
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
and a few other verses that say

842
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,000
"Humble yourselves in the presence of the Lord,

843
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
and He will exalt you."

844
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
It is our natural tendency to live

845
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
according to the system of this world

846
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
so that we can get exalted or rewarded

847
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Nevertheless, in discerning the Lord's work

848
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
during this day and age,

849
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
we observe the rising up of a generation

850
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
of collaborative leaders

851
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
rather than individual heroes

852
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,000
The next generation faces an increasingly complex

853
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
and hostile world

854
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Yet they are individually gifted

855
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
in various new and creative ways

856
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Rather than trusting those at power

857
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
to resolve all the problems

858
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
young leaders today rise to face challenges

859
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
in their own sphere of influence

860
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
in many different ways

861
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
There may be limits to what one can do

862
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
while not in power

863
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
But in collaboration and in discerning God's will

864
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
in this day and age

865
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
there can be no limits to the possibilities

866
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
that open up

867
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Obviously, collaborative leadership

868
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
also has its limits

869
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Decisions may be delayed or out of sync

870
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Actions may be fragmented

871
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
and chaos may result

872
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Nevertheless, collaboration reminds us

873
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:41,000
to humble ourselves and listen to each other

874
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
to discern God's will

875
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
in a story that not us

876
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
but Him is the real hero

877
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
So I stay contented

878
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
as a little lady in a big man's world

879
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
continuing to find my identity in Christ

880
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,000
and to learn to be a faithful follower of Christ

(英文)

1396
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,000
(英文)

1397
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:42,000
(英文)

1398
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:45,000
(英文)

1399
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:48,000
(英文)

1400
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,000
(英文)

1401
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:54,000
(英文)

1402
01:19:55,000 --> 01:20:00,000
而是自我懺悔和憎恨

1403
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,000
如果任何一個宗教的人

1404
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:08,000
不願意做這些基本的事

1405
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:12,000
來實現真實的靈性生活

1406
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:16,000
那我就不認為我們對這件事是有興趣的

1407
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:20,000
這件事在一般情況下是死定的

1408
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:25,000
我認為這件事是如此的自然

1409
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
我用自然來形容

1410
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:31,000
這件事是如此的自然

1411
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:35,000
一個宗教不願意向自己說真相

1412
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:39,000
不願意向別人道歉

1413
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:44,000
這不是一個對耶穌基督的靈性的宗教

1414
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:48,000
我們就變成了社會運動

1415
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:51,000
它會做那些那些人想做的事

1416
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:54,000
他們也許會在耶穌的名下做

1417
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:57,000
但如果他們不願意去活在宗教

1418
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
那就像耶穌說的

1419
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:02,000
那就是一座建築物的故事

1420
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
而不是一座石頭

1421
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
在時間的過程中

1422
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:09,000
那座石頭就是我們的故事的結局

1423
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:12,000
所以我覺得我們在這時期

1424
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:16,000
有著非常重要的事情

1425
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
我不是想要作弊

1426
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:22,000
我認為在美國宗教教會

1427
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:27,000
有著一個第一次的危機

1428
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,000
也許是真的

1429
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
在其他教會和其他地方

1430
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
我沒有被要求討論

1431
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
我只是在討論

1432
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,000
白人的宗教現實

1433
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:42,000
我想問問

1434
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:47,000
如果有些人想參與我剛才說的話

1435
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
我會很高興聽到

1436
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:52,000
我認為Bernard想說幾句話

1437
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
其實我讀出這個問題

1438
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:57,000
我會這樣看待

1439
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:01,000
看來這個人的問題是

1440
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:05,000
如果一個人是自身的危機

1441
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:11,000
那他就不能成為世界的影響力

1442
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:14,000
但我覺得這是一種雙重思考

1443
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:18,000
如果我是真實的

1444
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
那我就要告訴你真相

1445
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:23,000
你就要聽我所說的

1446
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:26,000
我認為這是一個不可思議的

1447
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:29,000
或是一個錯誤的神的任務

1448
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:34,000
我們在帶給世界的一種冒險

1449
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:37,000
我會想像

1450
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:40,000
基督徒在做革命

1451
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:45,000
我們其實是真正的真正的求真相者

1452
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
我們是真正的真正的求真相者

1453
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:51,000
而對於那些還沒有信仰的人來說

1454
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:54,000
我們是真正的真正的求真相者

1455
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:59,000
我們是真正的真正的求真相者

1456
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
所以我認為

1457
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:05,000
這就是一個可以克服這種危機的思考

1458
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
你只要說我有真相

1459
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
你就不會有這種思考

1460
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
是的,非常有幫助,謝謝

1461
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:14,000
我覺得真正的真相

1462
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
是你對著對方說真相

1463
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
我們一起做

1464
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:23,000
這會幫助我們再往前走一步

1465
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:26,000
好,馬克

1466
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:29,000
還有一個問題給你

1467
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:32,000
在今天的世界

1468
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:35,000
世界競爭造成了國家主義

1469
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:40,000
和一些重要的和互相爭議的意義

1470
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:43,000
美國白宮如何教導

1471
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:46,000
健康的友善

1472
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:49,000
也就是愛和熱情

1473
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
對自己的國家

1474
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:56,000
以及慶祝我們的族群的身份

1475
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:59,000
是的,我覺得這是一個非常好的問題

1476
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:03,000
這是美國白宮一直以來

1477
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:07,000
一直在做的一個計劃

1478
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:11,000
我們要愛和熱情

1479
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
我們要為國家服務

1480
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:16,000
我們不需要將我們的國家

1481
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
變成偶像

1482
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,000
甚至是像這樣

1483
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
我們不需要將它變成偶像

1484
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:26,000
我們不需要將它變成偶像

1485
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,000
我們不需要將它變成偶像

1486
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:32,000
我們不需要將它變成偶像

1487
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:35,000
我們不需要將它變成偶像

1488
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:38,000
我們不需要將它變成偶像

1489
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:41,000
我們不需要將它變成偶像

1490
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:44,000
我們不需要將它變成偶像

1491
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:47,000
我們不需要將它變成偶像

1492
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:50,000
我們不需要將它變成偶像

1493
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,000
我們不需要將它變成偶像

1494
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:56,000
我們不需要將它變成偶像

1495
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:59,000
我們不需要將它變成偶像

1496
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:02,000
我們不需要將它變成偶像

1497
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:05,000

Mark,剛才您在講座中提到

"融化盤"

1579
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:11,000
我們有一個問題

1580
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:14,000
請您給我們一些實際的建議

1581
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
如何組織一個

在教會內的多元社區

1583
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:22,000

1592
