 (Music)

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:21,080
 >> Good morning. Welcome, everyone.

3
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,120
 Michael Chu here.

4
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,240
 It's great to have so many people, hundreds of people here

5
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,240
 in our lecture.

6
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,240
 I'm very happy to be here with you all.

7
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,540
 I'm Michael Chu, the president of the

8
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,640
 American Society of Black and Asian

9
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,720
 people, and this morning we continue to host our Josephine

10
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,720
 So lecture week, and today is the third lecture.

11
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:48,020
 It's a great honor to have Dr.

12
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:51,100
 Mark Leperton to be our keynote speaker.

13
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,160
 Dr. Leperton has spoken to us on the

14
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,260
 overall title, the crisis of American white evangelicalism.

15
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,180
 And I'm very impressed by the way he

16
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,280
 has been able to provide us with a

17
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,580
 very deep and deep insight, and Mark

18
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,680
 walks us through the American history

19
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,380
 and outline the specific perspective on

20
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,060
 the American culture, and Mark also

21
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:20,740
 highlights the certain deficiency of

22
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,820
 evangelism or even the deficiency of

23
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,940
 the American culture, and I'm very impressed by his work.

24
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:32,140
 And I'm very impressed by Mark's

25
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:36,320
 honesty and courage in the path of self-critique.

26
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,220
 Mark, if you don't mind, I would like to

27
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,320
 address you by your first name, because I

28
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,400
 feel after these two lectures, I feel so close to you.

29
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,720
 We are just like good old friends.

30
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,720
 So, I would like to ask you to share your

31
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,820

32
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,120
 And then, I would like to ask you to

 And then, I would like to ask you to share your perspective on

39

 And I would like to ask you to share your perspective on the

41

 And I would like to ask you to share your perspective on the

45
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,620
 American culture.

46

 And I would like to ask you to share your perspective on the

47
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,020

48
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,320
 And I would like to ask you to share your perspective on the

49
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,420
 American culture.

50
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,720
 And I would like to ask you to share your perspective on the

51
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,820
 American culture.

52
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:04,120
 And I would like to ask you to share your perspective on the

53
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,220
 American culture.

54
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,520
 And I would like to ask you to share your perspective on the

55
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,620
 American culture.

56
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,920
 And I would like to ask you to share your perspective on the

57
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,020
 American culture.

58
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:23,320
 And I would like to ask you to share your perspective on the

59
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,420
 American culture.

60
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:29,720
 And I would like to ask you to share your perspective on the

61
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,820
 American culture.

62
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:36,120
 And I would like to ask you to share your perspective on the

63
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,220
 American culture.

64
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,520
 And I would like to ask you to share your perspective on the

65
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,620
 American culture.

66
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,920
 And I would like to ask you to share your perspective on the

67
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,020
 American culture.

68
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:55,320
 You are the one who sees us as we are.

69
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,620
 You understand the places in which we see clearly.

70
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:01,920
 And you understand the places in which our sight and knowledge

71
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,020
 are so confused.

72
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:08,320
 This day in the United States is a very dark day.

73
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,620
 It's a day in which we acknowledge some painful

74
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,720
 realities about our national life.

75
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,320
 Your church is implicated in both some of the causes of why

76
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,420
 the problems exist.

77
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:24,720
 And also, we pray by your grace, a church that might be able to

78
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,320
 be used by you for the renewal of the church and the renewal of

79
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,420
 a nation.

80
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:36,020
 Tonight as we pray here and in the morning as people pray

81
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,120
 throughout Asia, in Hong Kong in particular, we acknowledge that

82
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,220
 we are a church that is not only a church that is a church that

83
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:51,860
 We acknowledge that it's your Lordship, your power, your leadership that we need, far above

84
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,700
 and beyond any human agency.

85
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:01,220
 So in humility, O God, we turn to these issues tonight, acknowledging how much we need You

86
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:09,420
 to speak, to guide, to confront, to transform us.

87
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:22,580
 In the name of Jesus Christ, who reigns with humility and power, in Jesus' name, amen.

88
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:31,020
 So we come tonight to consider evangelical complexities about power and leadership.

89
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:37,220
 We will reflect on issues of evangelical power that underline, crown, and even subvert its

90
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:41,940
 gospel and its witness.

91
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:46,820
 The history of the church has typically been told as the story of so-called big men, that

92
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:57,220
 is, a man usually, if not almost always, through the power of personality, gifts, opportunity,

93
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:05,940
 stealth, privilege of birth, and influence, to have written the story of the world.

94
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:10,980
 And I dare say this is true in the East or the West, it's true in the South and the North,

95
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,980
 whether the past or the present.

96
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:20,400
 We seem to be in a time of exceptional global power disorder and redefinition.

97
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:26,580
 Every continent has evidences of the turmoil that's going on inside the United States.

98
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:34,940
 It is not a time of world war, and yet in so many directions, we see national and international

99
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:40,260
 collision, aggression, and hostility.

100
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:49,180
 Battles of war, including within and among evangelical Christians, are clearly afoot.

101
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:54,980
 All of this is, of course, in dramatic contrast to the description of Jesus that we see in

102
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:59,500
 Paul's letter to the Philippians, chapter 2, verses 1 through 8.

103
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,500
 Hear these words again.

104
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:10,340
 Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus.

105
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:17,260
 Though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped,

106
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:24,020
 but emptied himself by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men.

107
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:30,100
 And being found in human form, he humbled himself by taking the form of a servant and

108
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,460
 being born in the likeness of men.

109
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:39,100
 And being found in human form, he humbled himself and became obedient to the point of

110
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:45,420
 death, even death on a cross.

111
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:52,180
 Jesus as the ultimate "big man" lays down the assumptions and prerogatives of power

112
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:58,100
 to live and lead in vulnerability and in weakness.

113
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:04,060
 Nevertheless, the "big man" assumptions occupy a very significant place in the life of the

114
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:07,620
 American evangelical church.

115
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:15,220
 From the 18th to the 20th century, to this day in the 21st, we can point to the quiet,

116
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:21,060
 prayerful, faithful, often exemplary lives of members of the white evangelical church

117
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:27,260
 in the U.S. and see many true signs of the fruit of the Spirit.

118
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:36,420
 Albeit this can now only be said if we acknowledge that this positive legacy is often still intertwined

119
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:42,180
 with the subtle and horrific compromises and the absence of self-criticism or repentance

120
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:47,580
 or lament and transformation that could have occurred.

121
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:54,980
 It's often a story of hidden piety, inward piety, rather than public piety matched with

122
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:57,380
 justice.

123
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:05,260
 Susceptible as human beings are to seek a savior and a hero, it has been an easy assumption

124
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:11,340
 that God will raise up the leader in a U.S. context that should be understood primarily,

125
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:19,140
 typically as being white and male, to be a leader, pastor, and authoritative visionary

126
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,300
 voice.

127
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:27,700
 This archetype is so pervasive and influential it's assumed rather than examined.

128
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:34,060
 This is necessarily accompanied by an image of a blonde, blue-eyed Jesus who serves the

129
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:42,940
 dominant interests of an evangelicalism that insists on seeing its image of Jesus, seeing

130
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:49,580
 in its image of Jesus itself, rather than letting Jesus see his image in us.

131
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:56,300
 On the other hand, it can be acknowledged with gratitude that the evangelical movement

132
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:03,780
 in the 20th century, with all of its blessings and sins, perhaps ironically and unselfconsciously,

133
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:09,700
 both contributed to and resisted the geographic repositioning of the center of the global

134
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:15,860
 Christian movement from being a story centered in the global north to one that's now clearly

135
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:21,340
 centered in the global south and in Asia.

136
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:26,780
 This is a cause for rejoicing and for prominence that is primarily about the Spirit of God

137
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,980
 meeting the people of God.

138
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:36,260
 This is really the story of God calling, forming, and using leaders around the world for such

139
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:41,220
 transformative change, not least throughout Asia.

140
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:45,700
 During the last quarter of the 20th century in America and elsewhere, we saw the rise

141
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:52,620
 of the megachurch phenomenon that has risen and also fallen because of the influence of

142
00:10:52,620 --> 00:11:02,660
 the big man paradigm, a story of largely unidirectional, typically white male power in the United States.

143
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:07,460
 This means the need to acknowledge as such as part of the observations of the 20th and

144
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:14,700
 21st century white evangelicalism still operates largely in a colonialist framework, both in

145
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:18,700
 the US and globally.

146
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,580
 Several factors explain this.

147
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:25,900
 First is dominion, the theme of dominion.

148
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:31,540
 The specifically Christian theme of dominion has been one that has been informed, motivated,

149
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:37,620
 shaped, and subverted by our sense of the mission of God, the missio Dei.

150
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:41,820
 The sense of the mission of God in the world as an embodied and proclaimed announcement

151
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:48,300
 that the reign of God is at hand for the sake of all people and places, a bringing to consummation

152
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:52,740
 of all things by our Creator, Redeemer, and Remaker.

153
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:58,260
 This exercise of divine dominion is for the sake of bringing to an end the groaning of

154
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:05,340
 all humanity and of Jesus and of the Spirit and of the people of God and of the whole

155
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:13,420
 created order for the sake of God's shalom and the well-being of love and mercy and justice,

156
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,540
 harmony.

157
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:24,060
 The so-called doctrine of discovery, which came into existence in 1493, was the act of

158
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:31,340
 Pope Alexander VI and played a highly influential role in justifying and shaping the Spanish

159
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:37,180
 conquest and the colonial project from that point on.

160
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:44,780
 The papal bull that the Pope put out gave permission and power to discoverers, as they

161
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:51,380
 were called, of any land that was not inhabited by Christians, and that if they discovered

162
00:12:51,380 --> 00:13:00,220
 such a land uninhabited by Christians, then it was considered to be available to be "discovered,"

163
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:06,420
 claimed and exploited by Christian rulers and declared that the Catholic faith and the

164
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:13,520
 Christian religion be exalted and be everywhere increased and spread, that the health of souls

165
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:21,760
 be cared for and that barbarous nations be overthrown and brought to the faith itself.

166
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:28,680
 This doctrine of discovery justified all European claims in the Americas and the premise justifying

167
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,120
 the Western expansion of the United States.

168
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:39,160
 A book that I would commend to you is a book written by Mark Charles and Sun Chan-ra entitled

169
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,440
 Unsettling Truths, which explores this in much more detail.

170
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,920
 Many other books likewise have been written about it.

171
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:53,440
 This aligns with what had been seen in the Roman Empire, Constantine's influence, medieval

172
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,320
 expansionism and war.

173
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:02,860
 Yet through the doctrine of discovery, the church is itself the initiator in the further

174
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:10,200
 coalescence of church and government collusion to use power in the name of faith for the

175
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,400
 sake of political, economic and religious ends.

176
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:21,280
 It is the full fruit of what had long been operational, and it was unleashed in what

177
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:28,420
 continues in less obtrusive ways to the dominion mindset of some American white evangelicals

178
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,040
 to this day.

179
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:37,720
 The ferocity of the division in the US evangelical church, even today, is in many ways unlocked

180
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,360
 by the doctrine of discovery.

181
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:47,760
 If you believe, as many do, that the ideological, political and religious battles going on among

182
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:54,800
 white evangelical voices in the US has little to do with theology, it has more to do with

183
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,800
 power.

184
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:02,160
 And its roots for how that power expresses itself would be evident in the doctrine of

185
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,160
 discovery.

186
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:09,520
 The assumption is that these battles are an extension of the doctrine of discovery.

187
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:17,000
 That is, they now go on like an ever playing fugue line in music that undergirds and reassures

188
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,800
 many that this white normativity is the right track.

189
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:29,760
 It is a form of aggressive nostalgia that longs for an earlier, more racially homogeneous,

190
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:36,480
 less racially diverse, more unquestionably defined and controlled white normativity that

191
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,120
 dominates other so-called intrusive voices.

192
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:50,440
 I accept Dr. Willie Jennings' argument that being "white" is not strictly about the melatonin

193
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:57,960
 level of one's skin, but about a heart and mindset that can take captive any person of

194
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,040
 any race.

195
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:06,360
 Whiteness holds power and the claims and rights of power simply as an expression of the way

196
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,400
 reality has established it.

197
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:14,720
 This at least is the blindness of whiteness, the presumption and normativity that is so

198
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:21,400
 damaging to white people and even more to those who are its victims.

199
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:28,800
 Whiteness is the personalized and social form of the doctrine of discovery, holding internally

200
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:35,480
 the assumption and assertion that the individual can claim in relationship to others, attitudes

201
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:43,800
 of conquest, superiority and dominance, whether it is about owning a gun, wearing a face mask,

202
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:49,440
 participating in inter-public worship service or anything else.

203
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:55,520
 I hope all of these themes are ones that you've seen and given evidence to in the American

204
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,520
 press.

205
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:01,880
 Dominion, then, is our first major problem.

206
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:07,720
 The second problem that's related to it is the notion of American exceptionalism.

207
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:13,080
 This as you know has a long tail in the narrative of U.S. history.

208
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:19,120
 It starts with the writing of a French man of letters, Alexis de Tocqueville, who described

209
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:26,240
 the United States as "exceptional," as a "new country," and in the convergence of a kind

210
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:32,080
 of mindset and instincts that would allow it to hold unique power and influence in North

211
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,600
 America and eventually the world.

212
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:42,440
 One of the deepest assumptions in nationalism is that American nationalism is not only best

213
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:47,000
 for it, but also best for the world that it wants to influence.

214
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:54,160
 It is endlessly self-admiring and adulating, and it is full of the idolatry of a nation

215
00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:00,400
 over any and all other forces, especially outside forces.

216
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:07,000
 In this model, the phrase "America first" has periodically emerged as the battle cry

217
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,520
 in relationship to other nations, while the internal dangers and enemies of powers must

218
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:16,840
 be limited and opposed as well.

219
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:22,800
 All this has been an intense resurgent in recent years in the United States, certainly

220
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:30,560
 since the 1980s, growing in the 1990s, and very powerfully present throughout the 2000s

221
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:38,080
 to date, and it's attached to the Dominion vision that, like Napoleon, simply crowns

222
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,640
 itself emperor.

223
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:47,640
 America has done that in so many painful and inappropriate and unjust ways.

224
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:53,560
 When the church adds to it the elements of manifest destiny, that this exceptionalism,

225
00:18:53,560 --> 00:19:03,440
 this nationalism, is like America being a new Israel, and in relation to which this

226
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:10,480
 nation is first and primary in God's and in the church's priorities, it is an extremely

227
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:18,120
 dangerous collection of idolatries, precisely and passionately held up as the only true

228
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,840
 national worship.

229
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:27,440
 This creates a perfect closed circle, dressed up in Christian speech, which avoids Christian

230
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:33,720
 identity and character in matters that are both public, such as the equality of diversity,

231
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:41,320
 peace with justice, structural and personal racism, and in private, such as which voices

232
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:49,840
 are heard, which lives and needs are seen, which narratives or stories are actually believed.

233
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:58,760
 So Dominion, nationalism, and third is individualism.

234
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:05,160
 White evangelicals in the United States seamlessly pair the doctrine of discovery with deep-seated

235
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,200
 autonomous individualism.

236
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:15,480
 That is, the individual autonomous self gets to walk through the world like nations did

237
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:25,400
 under the doctrine of discovery and make claim on peoples and places, jobs, voices, power,

238
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,400
 influence, and so forth.

239
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,140
 It's a tragic story.

240
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:34,480
 It's one of America's best and worst traits.

241
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:42,200
 The best side of this kind of individualism is the way in which it can be attached to

242
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:49,440
 a sense that individual independent rights are a reflection of being made in the image

243
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,440
 of God.

244
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:57,280
 They are the center in personal, political, structural, familial, social, and religious

245
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,480
 life in the United States.

246
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,240
 It must be the individual.

247
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:10,920
 Unlike Ubuntu in Africa, "I am because we are," the American slogan is more nearly,

248
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:14,920
 "I am because I make myself."

249
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:21,760
 This means that power is finally personal and that the community, whether in church

250
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:30,000
 or society at large, are always in third place behind family and tribe.

251
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:37,560
 In the end, the culture in which American evangelical lives and often thrives is on

252
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:44,040
 the grounds that each person and their own will and personality and priorities and values

253
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:47,200
 should be placed at the center of everything.

254
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:54,900
 So much of America's ethical and moral history, even to this day, around issues of human sexuality

255
00:21:54,900 --> 00:22:02,240
 and many other things are all reflections of this doctrine of discovery-oriented, racially

256
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:10,720
 biased, individual-pleasing form of Christian life that plays into a consumerism that's

257
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:20,640
 measured by the satisfaction of church members and not by wisdom or by faithfulness.

258
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:28,800
 This kind of distorted ecology of faith and mind, heart and will, to call Jesus "Lord,

259
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:35,200
 Lord," but completely separated from actually doing the will of God, the inward private

260
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:43,640
 conversion of a disciple or the response to the altar call to getting saved, is an especially

261
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,200
 white evangelicalism.

262
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:50,920
 The Bible is, of course, clear about the value of the individual and the need for each of

263
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:54,840
 us in the body of Christ to seek and find God.

264
00:22:54,840 --> 00:23:02,640
 But the weight of the scriptures rests on the calling of a people, not just an individual,

265
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,740
 to be God's own people.

266
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:12,240
 And for the call of the ecclesia, that is the called-out community, to be communally

267
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:19,200
 called out into one new humanity is a sign that we, collectively, not just I, who once

268
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:27,320
 was dead, have not just been revived, but have actually been made new as evidence through

269
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:32,800
 our living into a new community of unlike.

270
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:38,160
 The immigrant escape from Europe and many other countries since has infused in the evangelical

271
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:45,520
 movement in the United States the preference for finding and maintaining your tribe.

272
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:51,880
 A tribe can, at times, be a melting pot, but that is not the common experience of many.

273
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:58,000
 Instead, we are a collection of social, racial, and economic tribes, with the white evangelical

274
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:07,480
 tribe presupposing itself to be always in the lead, the communion that crowns the communion.

275
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:11,480
 That is really the way that it's often organized.

276
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:16,520
 I will confess that for me, personally, one of the most painful parts of the history and

277
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:22,080
 influence of Fuller Seminary is the church growth movement.

278
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:29,880
 In a well-researched and motivated beginning, Donald McGovern, on Fuller's faculty, desired

279
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:36,680
 to help the gospel reach more of America, not just one by one, but in a larger, broader,

280
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,120
 more communal sense.

281
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,480
 He knew this meant a gospel that was attuned to context.

282
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:50,220
 This led him to the discovery, sociologically, that people come to faith faster and simpler

283
00:24:50,220 --> 00:25:03,440
 if they do not have to cross a cultural threshold and if the gospel is embodied in a contextually

284
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,200
 appealing and recognizable way.

285
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:13,240
 In some ways, these are not only legitimate, but valuable insights.

286
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:19,000
 On the other hand, what these insights become is a rationale for what is known as the homogeneous

287
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:26,720
 unit principle, and what later becomes the marketing motivation for growth through gathering

288
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:33,320
 simply people who are similar, not gathering people through the lens of a diverse group

289
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:39,960
 of people with a kingdom vision, a brokenness and remaking that moves from nothing less

290
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,160
 than death to life.

291
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:49,080
 Instead, we call people to join the church as an accommodation to their social context,

292
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:56,040
 assuring them that they will find there many who are just like themselves.

293
00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:01,960
 What is offered in this way, then, is simply a gospel that is about appeal.

294
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:09,680
 A warm, positive, life-affirming appeal and a community of people of those who together

295
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:15,040
 believe that "their needs are being met."

296
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:19,880
 Conversion comes to mean that we are putting trust in God's eternal hope and having a personal

297
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:26,640
 relationship with Christ that can become nothing more than getting God to give us good gifts

298
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:33,280
 for our sake and for the sake of others that we know and love.

299
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:40,040
 Poignantly, what is not being offered or discipled into many people's lives is the fundamental

300
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:45,720
 comprehensive revolution of kingdom recreation.

301
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:53,320
 We take the phrase in Corinthians, "all things being made new," and we attach it to the impact

302
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:57,600
 of simply saying yes to an affirmation of faith.

303
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:03,760
 But then that gets cut off from the deep spiritual transformational process by which by word

304
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:11,080
 and spirit, our minds and our lives are meant to be renewed in order that we may actually

305
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:21,480
 do, that is, perform, enact, embody the will of God, Romans 12, 1 and 2.

306
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:27,360
 The next factor in this is what I'm calling agency.

307
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:34,040
 In Matthew 9, we read, "All things are possible to them that love and serve God."

308
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:39,500
 This rich but humble affirmation of God's ability to accomplish whatever God may design

309
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:46,600
 through the power of the Holy Spirit can become nothing more than a mantra like rubbing the

310
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:50,560
 genie lamp at the will of the disciple.

311
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:56,080
 That becomes the power for the exercise of my own personal agency.

312
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:03,480
 I seek God for the power to do my will, not my will to seek the humility to serve the

313
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,320
 power of God.

314
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:11,600
 In the name of the unassailable and incomparable power of God, there is a kind of teaching

315
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:16,640
 about the exercise of faith that is really about the role that one can have in being

316
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:26,640
 the willful believing agent, hence agency, that can accomplish what the prayer may will,

317
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:33,520
 as though by prayerful agency, the individual or two or three others can by themselves usher

318
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,320
 in the kingdom of God.

319
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:42,200
 I would argue that if it is the kingdom of God we are naming, not the kingdom of Christian

320
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:49,560
 leaders or nations or individuals, then human beings are never the primary agent of that

321
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,560
 sentence.

322
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:57,400
 The inference in some white American evangelicalism is that human agency, represented by what

323
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:03,700
 is seen as the "truly faithful," the true believers, can bring forth the manifestation

324
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,200
 of God's will and reign.

325
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:13,400
 It is prayer without doubt, often meaning without humility or self-critique or acknowledged

326
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:19,560
 finitude or fundamental bias, that produces blessing.

327
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:25,080
 The best history I know of, of the prosperity gospel as an aside, is written by Kate Bowler

328
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:29,240
 and is in a book that she has written entitled "Blessed."

329
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:38,080
 She examines and studies firsthand how this agency theme is managed and described by prosperity

330
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:45,920
 gospels, by prosperity churches and preachers in the United States and beyond.

331
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:50,960
 Agency in the way that I'm talking about it at the moment is really just a personalized

332
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:59,520
 form of dominion that is exerting the power of our vision, personality, or desire.

333
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:04,360
 The important quality of how we have been made in the image of God can be another good

334
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:09,080
 gift turned into little more than self-interest.

335
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:13,280
 We are made to exercise agency in the world.

336
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:18,200
 When we hold it in the way that often has happened, it plays into what I call consumer

337
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:25,480
 Christianity, in which human agency and desire occupies the private place with the general

338
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:31,000
 assurance that this is appropriate because God wants to give us, quote, "the desires

339
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,800
 of our heart," Psalm 37.

340
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:42,560
 But agency in Israel's life is at the heart of the prophet's critique in Isaiah 58.

341
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:48,560
 Israel has taken the worship practices of God's people and used them, the prophet says,

342
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:55,720
 for their own purposes, such that worship ends up being about them and not about God.

343
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:02,320
 No wonder God says this is as if worship, that is, worship that pretends or claims to

344
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:09,360
 be about God, as if they were going to actually live in a righteous way.

345
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:18,280
 But instead of honoring and using their agency to serve Yahweh, in fact, their worship, the

346
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:21,720
 prophet says, is about themselves.

347
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:27,080
 This is a story of agency gone to seed without any fruit.

348
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:31,780
 The fruit of the Spirit is meant to be productive, and it's meant to be productive that shows

349
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:39,800
 itself in ways far beyond productive agency in the bounty of our own self-interest.

350
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:52,600
 Instead, the fruit of the Spirit, as you know, love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,

351
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,640
 gentleness, and self-control.

352
00:31:54,640 --> 00:32:07,900
 So dominion, nationalism, individualism, and agency cannot and do not seek or produce the

353
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,600
 fruit of the Spirit.

354
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:19,300
 Those are all elements that by themselves bear the fruit of a lack of faithfulness rather

355
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:22,820
 than an evidence of it.

356
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:39,900
 Another factor for a movement that is founded...

357
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:52,260
 Christianity and evangelicalism is a movement that is founded on the belief that God gives

358
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:55,900
 us the peace that passes understanding.

359
00:32:55,900 --> 00:33:04,220
 And yet, fear is a significant feature that motivates American white evangelicalism, particularly

360
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:07,940
 so for its leaders.

361
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:12,580
 There are different fears that correspond to different possible threats.

362
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:17,820
 We could start with theological or doctrinal fear.

363
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:24,860
 Part of a danger of favored status is then the possibility of losing that status.

364
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:31,460
 Fear and anxiety grips a lot of evangelical leaders and pastors who then wonder about

365
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:34,180
 speaking the truth when the stakes are high.

366
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:40,380
 And if they get it wrong or if people don't like what they say, the loss can be aggressive

367
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:43,220
 and destructive.

368
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:49,860
 In some cases, it is built into a self-dependent theology of salvation, as though a person

369
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:54,900
 is really saying, "I am saved by having the right theology."

370
00:33:54,900 --> 00:34:00,060
 And that can mean that my salvation is mine to win or lose.

371
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:06,140
 Will I or won't I be saved depends on me, not depending on God and what God has done

372
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:08,900
 in Jesus Christ.

373
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:14,500
 So the issue then becomes, do I have the doctrine right or am I too dangerously close to, quote,

374
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:20,020
 wrong doctrine, wrong belief, wrong communion, wrong practices?

375
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:25,580
 All of those things being things that Jesus himself was accused of.

376
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:31,820
 This kind of an approach to fear is about boundaries, a boundary that is about who is

377
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:38,660
 in the circle versus who and what is outside the boundaries of God's grace.

378
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:43,460
 Setting the boundaries for oneself or one's family or church or denomination or one's

379
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:48,580
 nation and so on means that we are fearful about getting it wrong.

380
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:52,900
 The ever-present need to be sure that we are getting it right, that our people are right,

381
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:57,420
 that our tribe is right, that our church is right, that our denomination is right, that

382
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:00,620
 our seminary is right.

383
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:07,100
 Within one week recently, I received five phone calls from very experienced pastors

384
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:12,060
 who called to talk about the fact that these pressures around fear were going to mean that

385
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:18,180
 they themselves feared that they would be fired and that they would not be able to find

386
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:24,460
 another job because of being judged unacceptable by leaders around them.

387
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:29,660
 Within a couple of weeks of receiving those phone calls myself, three had been fired and

388
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:33,180
 not only fired but then maligned.

389
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:37,460
 This is the evidence of what I'm talking about.

390
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:41,620
 Another category of fear has to do with the ever-present danger of "the world versus

391
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,740
 the flesh."

392
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:48,780
 The premise here is that faithful disciples are vulnerable to being consumed or shipwrecked

393
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:52,860
 by the ubiquitous presence of sin and evil in the world.

394
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:57,940
 At any moment, our enemy is seeking someone to devour.

395
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:04,460
 Our disciples need not just the tools of spiritual warfare but the continual readiness for spiritual

396
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,460
 battles.

397
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:13,940
 This tends to stimulate in our brains the kind of neurobiology and the moral worry that

398
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:21,500
 makes finding, naming, and embattling enemies an obvious and continuous necessity for many.

399
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:25,940
 History has shown the likelihood of this progression and the historical evidence, not least in

400
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:30,180
 exploding numbers of demonimations in the 20th and 21st century.

401
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:35,580
 In the century of God's greatest wars, the 20th, of the world's greatest wars in the

402
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:41,580
 20th century, it is plain that enemies are real and that the church must be alert and

403
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,580
 aggressively self-protective.

404
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:53,100
 It's a fearful posture that ironically pushes away and down the very lost in need of the

405
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,140
 evangel.

406
00:36:55,140 --> 00:37:02,420
 This fear plays readily to a spiritual fight or flight response, which fear often evokes.

407
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:09,580
 Both a fear of fighting or flight or fleeing, both toward those inside the church and toward

408
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,940
 those in culture.

409
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:18,140
 It fosters the likelihood of approaching discipleship as embattlement.

410
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:21,140
 Now clearly the New Testament uses this imagery.

411
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:23,180
 I'm not in any way arguing that.

412
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:29,700
 I'm arguing for the way that it's a dominant theme and for what it is that Christian leadership

413
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:32,860
 should do about that theme.

414
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:39,140
 The first response of fighting takes up the force of various kinds in order to defeat

415
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,140
 the opponent.

416
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:48,220
 A recent public example of this was when the Southern Baptist Convention of Seminary Presidents

417
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:57,860
 proposed to rejected and publicly repudiated the academic study that's known as critical

418
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:58,860
 race theory.

419
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:04,580
 This school of thought, critical race theory, attempts to understand the dynamics of racial

420
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:08,140
 justice and oppression.

421
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:12,940
 When the Seminary Presidents of the Southern Baptist Convention condemned critical race

422
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:19,780
 theory, it did so out of a fear that the critique will do damage to the church.

423
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:25,620
 But by condemning critical race theory, they expose at the same moment unintentionally

424
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:32,780
 the underlying fear that the denominations originating racism will be exposed.

425
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:40,460
 Ironically, their condemning action reveals so pointedly that they see CRT, that is critical

426
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:46,780
 race theory, as the real enemy rather than the underlying controlling racism that debilitates

427
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:49,940
 them and their gospel.

428
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:54,820
 By drawing the battle line as these Seminary Presidents did, they fought what they saw

429
00:38:54,820 --> 00:39:01,660
 as an enemy, that is a stand-in for the real opponent, maintaining the embattlement profile

430
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:05,700
 that is so important to their theological and cultural sensibility.

431
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:11,780
 And it was done by white male evangelical leaders displaying their power to name and

432
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:17,740
 control their sense of the reality narrative while masking their fear and their denominations

433
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:22,700
 fear of losing their white supremacy.

434
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:27,780
 The chief problem revealed here is what the Apostle Paul says is the fear of the weaker

435
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:28,780
 brother.

436
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:33,660
 The Romney fears what does not need to be feared while failing to fear what deserves

437
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:34,660
 to be feared.

438
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:40,740
 The fears of many American white evangelicals is a set of fears that center on them, on

439
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:46,700
 their perceptions, their social location, their beliefs, their tribal interests, rather

440
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:50,260
 than on what matters most to the kingdom of God.

441
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:56,520
 Is it too much to think of Jesus's words to the Pharisees that they tithe dill and cumin

442
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:03,580
 but avoid the weightier matters of the law, mercy and justice?

443
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:08,660
 Fear management can seem to be one of the defining features of American white evangelicals.

444
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:16,100
 And for many leaders, this is one of their chief preoccupations.

445
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:22,120
 American and leadership are words that many in the United States proudly believe belong

446
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,220
 inextricably together.

447
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:30,300
 The American white evangelical church in most of the last half century has tried to assert

448
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:35,700
 its voice in the cultural, legal and yes, political maelstrom that I've been trying

449
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,480
 to describe.

450
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:44,580
 American culture has long since been defined by media and secular culture than ever before.

451
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:49,540
 There is a genuine battle to acknowledge and to engage in relation to the controlling influences

452
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:53,940
 shaping children and teens and young adults.

453
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:59,100
 The reasons to fear the implications of a highly influential secularism, an anti-religious

454
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:05,380
 bias, not least in the West and East Coast of the United States.

455
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:10,340
 Now nations around the world have marveled at the pervasive religiosity of the United

456
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:16,620
 States and the high percentage of Americans who believe in God and worship regularly.

457
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:22,660
 The liberty and protections of religious freedom are long established and also continuously

458
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:23,660
 under attack.

459
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:30,740
 What American white evangelicalism has not done is to find a nationally credible, thoughtful

460
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:36,540
 leader practitioner who incarnates and speaks into the public sphere in ways that can capture

461
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:39,780
 the imagination and engage the heart.

462
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:45,220
 I've tried here to suggest factors that I believe contribute to why this perplexity

463
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:52,660
 of leadership has not emerged and perhaps would not even be received as a good idea

464
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:55,780
 or a legitimate hope.

465
00:41:55,780 --> 00:42:00,420
 And of course what is needed, far more than a singular voice, is for the church in the

466
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:05,540
 United States to live into its true Christian identity.

467
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:11,580
 Jesus's strategy for disciple making is a new community that lives out its surprising

468
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:13,900
 eclectic diversity.

469
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:21,100
 This servant living communion would dismantle and redefine dominion and nationalism and

470
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:25,300
 individualism and agency and fear.

471
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:31,260
 This kind of Christian community that is so deeply needed would be an authentic, credible

472
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:37,620
 communion that lives as the body of Christ in the world and for the sake of the world.

473
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:43,900
 Not inward turning, but living sacrificially and freely for the sake of the world, especially

474
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:47,100
 the poor and the marginalized.

475
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:52,940
 The American white evangelical crisis is not so much in the sense of theological crisis

476
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:59,780
 as it is a church in crisis over a failure to live out the church's identity as a reflection

477
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:01,460
 of Jesus Christ.

478
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:08,580
 Instead, it has turned out to live as a reflection of the culture in which it is placed.

479
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:15,260
 As simple and plain as that sounds, it is the story of great blessings of life put under

480
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:25,380
 a basket of American first or of salt losing its saltiness for desire instead to conform.

481
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:28,580
 Will that change?

482
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:37,860
 On this day, when the President of the United States has been treated in the way that he

483
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:47,300
 has by Congress in such a legitimate and defensible way, shows the barren fruit of the American

484
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:57,860
 evangelical story being identified more with power, secular, political, social, economic,

485
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:04,140
 cultural power than by the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

486
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:11,020
 It's only the latter that is the hope of the world.

487
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:18,220
 Let me pause there and welcome my two respondents.

488
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:19,740
 Thank you, Mark.

489
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:28,180
 Thank you for your very perceptive discussion of leadership, particularly the leadership

490
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:37,100
 of the American white evangelicalism and the churches.

491
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:49,780
 You also outlined quite a few factors which governs or defines our identities as a leader

492
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:51,740
 in the Bible.

493
00:44:51,740 --> 00:45:01,620
 I'm particularly impressed by the last point, the fear, the factor of fear that really always

494
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:08,820
 shapes how we behave, how we perform, how we relate to one another.

495
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:09,820
 So thank you very much.

496
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:16,940
 There is a lot of insight into that.

497
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:26,780
 So now may I ask Dr. Jean Lee and Dr. Bernard Wong, our dean and our associate dean, to

498
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:29,380
 come forward to give their response.

499
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:39,820
 I would like to ask Jean first.

500
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:45,420
 Thank you, Professor Levitin, for an insightful portrayal of power and leadership in this

501
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:46,580
 lecture.

502
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:52,180
 In particular, I appreciate the personal and contextual narratives you include in these

503
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:58,100
 lectures, allowing us to integrate theories with reality for a deeper understanding of

504
00:45:58,100 --> 00:45:59,420
 the matter.

505
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:05,580
 Indeed, the big man paradigm has been apparent for a long time, and all the more in today's

506
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:06,900
 world.

507
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:12,660
 No matter what the dominant political system is, people do have a natural tendency to look

508
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:15,220
 for heroic leaders.

509
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:20,540
 I lift a narrative of a little lady in a big man's world.

510
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:26,260
 In my late teens and early twenties, I spent nine years in North America, studying and

511
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:28,980
 working in a big man's world.

512
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:35,300
 My first job was in external audit, a profession where you are pushed every year to advance

513
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:37,660
 a grade in the ranks.

514
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:46,020
 So quickly, I found myself a short, non-white, Asian female leading an audit team.

515
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:51,500
 The audit team is tall, handsome-looking, young white males.

516
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:56,620
 I remember once when we walked into a client's office, the client immediately spotted the

517
00:46:56,620 --> 00:47:02,780
 leader among us, greeting one of my white male subordinates with a warm handshake.

518
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:08,380
 I still recall how embarrassed the client was when my colleague redirected everyone's

519
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:12,420
 attention to the short Asian female among them.

520
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:16,580
 Indeed, we are framed by our culture and context.

521
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:22,700
 We are bombarded daily with values and expectations that may only be partial truth.

522
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:28,620
 Not only do we need the firm grasp of our identity in Christ, but also continuous vigor

523
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:36,660
 in training for theological instinct that can help us sense the distortions we face.

524
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:41,740
 Professor Levitin pointed out a number of perplexities in the concepts behind leadership

525
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:43,220
 and power.

526
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:51,820
 Dominion, nationalism, individualism, agency concepts, and even fear can quickly become

527
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:56,060
 tools or justifications for power and dominance.

528
00:47:56,060 --> 00:48:03,180
 In our context, we face similar compromises and distortions, especially when different

529
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:09,100
 pressure groups may use the same words and phrases to mean different things, twisting

530
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:14,900
 people's minds and thought processes to suit their agenda.

531
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:20,460
 While Christians from the West may appreciate the relational culture in Asian communities,

532
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:27,700
 we know that relationships in Chinese actually translates to guan xi, a term expressing an

533
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:34,900
 obligation of one party to another with a continuing reciprocation of favors in Chinese

534
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:37,020
 business culture.

535
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:43,300
 Such practice also penetrates other walks of life, taking forms of excessive or corrupted

536
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:47,420
 gifting or social exchanges.

537
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:53,520
 The prosperity gospel is another example of faith distortion that presents itself so vividly

538
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,340
 in our culture.

539
00:48:55,340 --> 00:49:02,280
 Chinese folk religions have long preyed on human desire and a tendency to create a god

540
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:05,980
 to whom one can give gifts in exchange for favors.

541
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:10,260
 Thus, we are very much attracted to Matthew 7, 7.

542
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:12,660
 Ask and it will be given to you.

543
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:14,340
 Seek and you will find.

544
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:17,580
 Knock and the door will be opened to you.

545
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:24,440
 This Bible verse is obviously valuable, only that we tend to stop at ask and be given without

546
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:31,040
 truly seeking and finding God's will and discerning the door that gets opened.

547
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:36,740
 In recent years, Hong Kong society undergoes drastic changes both politically and under

548
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:37,740
 COVID-19.

549
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:44,460
 Adversities and pressures tear us further apart, splitting groups of brothers and sisters,

550
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:49,700
 some down the compromising route, some to fighting in the extremes.

551
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:53,860
 Those taking various middle stances are attacked by both sides.

552
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:59,900
 We no longer see leadership and power in the traditional sense, but rather see these with

553
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:02,740
 a negative feeling of distrust.

554
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:08,340
 We are challenged to go back to the very basic, asking the question, what does the gospel

555
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:13,140
 mean to our culture and the situation we are facing?

556
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:19,660
 All of us are confronted with our own fear, be it spiritual as in the Christian faith

557
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:23,140
 or political in the societal sense.

558
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:27,900
 Under the changing political climate, the people in Hong Kong are influenced by fear

559
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:31,260
 in much deeper ways as never before.

560
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:37,660
 Fight or flight takes on another meaning as individuals and families decide whether

561
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:42,980
 to redomicile abroad under the changing political climate.

562
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:49,620
 Hopefully, this decision process involves spiritual discernment and that the Lord continues

563
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:54,380
 to work in our midst, that our faith be strong wherever we go.

564
00:50:54,380 --> 00:51:01,180
 We continue to pray for God's wonder in this special time of drastic change.

565
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:07,260
 The big man paradigm is indeed a sharp contrast to the description of Jesus in Philippians

566
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:09,620
 2, 1 to 8.

567
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:14,020
 The humble leader is a subversive paradigm.

568
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:19,740
 Even here, we encounter the easy distortion of James 4.10 and a few other verses that

569
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:25,980
 says, "Humble yourselves in the presence of the Lord and he will exalt you."

570
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:32,280
 It is our natural tendency to live according to the system of this world so that we can

571
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:35,020
 get exalted or rewarded.

572
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:41,060
 Nevertheless, in discerning the Lord's work during this day and age, we observe the rising

573
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:46,780
 up of a generation of collaborative leaders rather than individual heroes.

574
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:53,580
 The next generation faces an increasingly complex and hostile world, yet they are individually

575
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:57,740
 gifted in various new and creative ways.

576
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:03,360
 Rather than trusting those at power to resolve all the problems, young leaders today rise

577
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:09,380
 to face challenges in their own sphere of influence in many different ways.

578
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:15,420
 There may be limits to what one can do while not in power, but in collaboration and in

579
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:20,620
 discerning God's will in this day and age, there can be no limits to the possibilities

580
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:22,660
 that open up.

581
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:28,060
 Obviously, collaborative leadership also has its limits.

582
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:34,980
 Decisions may be delayed or out of sync, actions may be fragmented, and chaos may result.

583
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:41,060
 Nevertheless, collaboration reminds us to humble ourselves and listen to each other,

584
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:48,120
 to discern God's will in a story that not us, but him is the real hero.

585
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:54,540
 So I stay contented as a little lady in a big man's world, continuing to find my identity

586
00:52:54,540 --> 00:53:11,860
 in Christ and to learn to be a faithful follower of Christ.

587
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:15,980
 Thank you, Dr. Labberton, for your very insightful lecture.

588
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:23,660
 Well, I have always thought that USA and Hong Kong are so different that issues the American

589
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:29,140
 Evangelical Church faces have little to do with us.

590
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:36,900
 Unlike USA, Christianity has never been the dominant religion in this part of the world,

591
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:43,360
 and the church has never risen to a position to influence our governments.

592
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:50,460
 Yet your lecture reminds us that we share the same sinful humanity.

593
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:57,960
 Our desire for power, though manifested differently in different contexts, reveals our deep-seated

594
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:02,640
 fear over survival and identity.

595
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:10,300
 Today, I will briefly reflect on how your lecture can shed light on the situation in

596
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:11,300
 Hong Kong.

597
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:19,500
 Dr. Labberton, you said that in European history, the doctrine of discovery is theologically

598
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:29,780
 justified and expansionism and conquest through power, and the land uninhabited by Christians

599
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:37,540
 is assumed undiscovered and must be claimed as part of God's mission in the world.

600
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:44,620
 I find an interesting parallel in a church-planting strategy advocated in Hong Kong.

601
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:54,580
 This strategy says that in a city, if no church exists within a radius of a few hundred meters,

602
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:58,520
 we should plant a church at the center.

603
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:04,260
 This new church will attract enough members to survive.

604
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:10,700
 While this sounds reasonable, it is actually the claiming of territory, not the need of

605
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:14,460
 people that is the motive.

606
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:23,560
 A city area with no church also means no competitors, a condition favorable for church survival.

607
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:30,940
 In fact, this thinking is not unlike the scramble of territories by the European nations during

608
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:33,940
 the colonial era.

609
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:40,020
 While the colonizers wanted to reap resources from the colonies, the church wants to survive

610
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:43,620
 with enough members and dollars.

611
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:51,700
 Besides, successful businesspersons and professions are often invited to give testimonies in individualistic

612
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:54,100
 gatherings.

613
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:59,860
 The assumption is that unbelievers will be attracted to the Christian faith by their

614
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:02,860
 success stories.

615
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:10,260
 While the Hong Kong church does not have much political power, we aspire to economic power,

616
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:15,940
 a power that is very appealing in this financial center of the East.

617
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:25,060
 I must emphasize I'm not against evangelism or church planting, yet our desire for power

618
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:29,380
 can be hidden under our service to Christ.

619
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:34,780
 And the gospel we preach will then be different from that of Christ.

620
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:42,580
 Dr. Labberton, your discussion on fear is very insightful.

621
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:49,620
 I agree with your observation that fear is intricately linked with power.

622
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:58,300
 Our fear of losing things we cherish compels us to use power to hold onto them.

623
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:04,560
 For the American evangelicals, the fear of losing salvation leads them to forge a theology

624
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:09,700
 of correct doctrine, ethics, and even politics.

625
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:17,760
 The fear of losing favored status prompts them to draw boundaries, to identify enemies

626
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:22,060
 so as to condemn and destroy them.

627
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:25,660
 The Hong Kong church is indeed different.

628
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:33,860
 We have never had such favored status to hold onto, and we may not fear losing salvation.

629
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:41,820
 But we have other things to cherish, things we use power to hold onto.

630
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:49,700
 My observation is that Hong Kong people in general cherish stability and prosperity.

631
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:57,940
 The desire for a stable society for everyone to prosper economically has been in our DNA

632
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:02,180
 since the second half of the last century.

633
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:09,660
 Before the handover of Hong Kong to China in the 1990s, the slogan "stability and prosperity"

634
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:16,620
 was created to convince Hong Kong people that the handover would be good for the city.

635
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:22,100
 Indeed, the slogan captured the imagination of all.

636
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:27,100
 Naturally, the church picks up this culture.

637
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:32,580
 Hong Kongers understand stability to mean the freedom to gather and do ministry within

638
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:35,660
 the church building.

639
00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:42,260
 Prosperity means increase in church membership, budget, ministries, and the planting of more

640
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:44,900
 churches.

641
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:54,580
 The recent political unrest and the pandemic make us fear losing this stability and prosperity.

642
00:58:54,580 --> 00:59:01,620
 In fact, we have seen sharp declines in church attendance and donations this past year.

643
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:04,860
 And so our fear is actually not ungrounded.

644
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:11,780
 Well, long-time Christians fear losing the same church ministry or, I would say, church

645
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:17,060
 services that they used to enjoy for years.

646
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:26,780
 Well, as fear is related to power, our response to the current threats reveals how we perceive

647
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:30,540
 and engage with power.

648
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:36,620
 The recent turn of events warns the Hong Kong church that we are under external threats

649
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:44,540
 to speak openly and truthfully, especially against the political power.

650
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:50,820
 To maintain the stability of doing ministries within the confines of the church, some choose

651
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:57,700
 to keep silence in order not to provoke the powerful outside.

652
00:59:57,700 --> 01:00:01,860
 Some attempt to appease or even support them.

653
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:08,260
 It is hoped that we can insulate the church from the power outside so as to maintain our

654
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:15,220
 power to control things inside so prosperity can continue.

655
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:23,260
 However, it is not sure whether and for how long this barricade can hold.

656
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:30,060
 Church leaders who opt for this insulation from outside strategy also exercise their

657
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:37,700
 power inside by disallowing preaching or discussion of things political within the walls of the

658
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:39,980
 church.

659
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:49,180
 They argue that political discussion is unspiritual and disrupts church union, and thus the theological

660
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:58,660
 justification for the policy of no politics in church is born.

661
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:05,820
 Out of the fear of to lose internal stability and prosperity, combined with the fear of

662
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:14,300
 external power, a theology of spiritualisation of the Christian faith and the practice of

663
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:19,100
 superficial church harmony results.

664
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:28,300
 However, splitting the inside and the outside of the church also splits the Christian life.

665
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:34,580
 No wonder many Christians, especially the younger ones, ridicule that the church has

666
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:40,900
 become an alternative universe alongside the society.

667
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:48,220
 The church has become irrelevant to society and the Christian faith to individuals.

668
01:01:48,220 --> 01:01:59,780
 Dr. Leperton, you correctly named that our problem is the fear of the weaker brother,

669
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:07,140
 who wrongly fears what does not need to be feared while failing to fear what deserves

670
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:09,460
 it.

671
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:17,220
 We ought not to fear losing stability and prosperity, nor to fear the power of this

672
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:19,500
 world.

673
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:28,420
 What we should fear, to quote from your lecture, is the failure to live out the church's identity

674
01:02:28,420 --> 01:02:31,300
 as a reflection of Jesus Christ.

675
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:39,700
 I believe the first step to cultivating this fear is a mournful repentance from the wrong

676
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:47,100
 fear that has gripped us all for a long time.

677
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:48,100
 Thank you very much.

678
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:52,100
 [Pause]

679
01:02:52,100 --> 01:03:14,100
 Testing, testing.

680
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:21,100
 Hello friends, we come to the most exciting part, it's the Q&A section.

681
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:27,100
 I encourage you to post your questions on our website in the live stream page.

682
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:31,780
 All you need is just to scroll down the webpage.

683
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:38,380
 Underneath the live stream page in the Putonghua part, there is the Q&A section.

684
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:45,860
 You need to fill in your name and then you can proceed with posting your question there.

685
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:54,380
 Your question could direct to Mark and also to Jean or Bernard individually or all three

686
01:03:54,380 --> 01:03:57,140
 of them.

687
01:03:57,140 --> 01:04:05,100
 We have around 45 minutes for this part, but we can see how it goes.

688
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:10,020
 As the chairperson, I would like to take the opportunity to ask the first question, Mark,

689
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:11,020
 a question for you.

690
01:04:11,020 --> 01:04:14,500
 This is a person I would like to ask you.

691
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:25,900
 You know, the last few days you are very unique in how you describe the phenomenon of the

692
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:30,060
 white evangelism in America.

693
01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:38,860
 And particularly sharp is that you have a very, an approach of self-critiquing.

694
01:04:38,860 --> 01:04:45,140
 And this morning you even come a step further, you would even critique your college, your

695
01:04:45,140 --> 01:04:49,540
 full professor, Donald McIver.

696
01:04:49,540 --> 01:05:00,900
 Now, yes, I think he had a very innovative idea with noble intention to reach out to

697
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:02,540
 people with the gospel.

698
01:05:02,540 --> 01:05:11,060
 But unfortunately, this developed into a theory of a homogeneous uni principle and eventually

699
01:05:11,060 --> 01:05:20,060
 have been used as marketing scheme or tactic or even deprived the kingdom vision.

700
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:25,380
 So it's sad to see that, right?

701
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:31,700
 I'm just thinking as a church leader, as a pastor or even theologian, what lesson we

702
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:34,240
 can learn from that?

703
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:36,620
 We have good intention.

704
01:05:36,620 --> 01:05:46,300
 We mean good to do something, to set up certain policy or draft a theory, but eventually turned

705
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:47,980
 out nasty.

706
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:50,420
 What lesson we can learn from that?

707
01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:51,420
 Thank you.

708
01:05:51,420 --> 01:05:52,780
 Yes, thank you very much.

709
01:05:52,780 --> 01:06:00,100
 I appreciate you coming back to that point because I think Donald McIver himself was

710
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:06,580
 making more of an academic observation and it got turned into, as you say, a pragmatic

711
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:10,540
 strategy for church growth and a marketing approach.

712
01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:16,900
 And in that process, it built a church on very inadequate foundations.

713
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:20,540
 So I think there are many things to learn.

714
01:06:20,540 --> 01:06:25,820
 First to give thanks that God can use even those, I think, misguided purposes to sometimes

715
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:30,020
 call many, many people as has happened around the world to faith in Christ.

716
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:35,260
 So I'm not denying that God can use such misguidedness.

717
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:39,500
 It's the only reason I can even open my mouth on a given day is that God is willing and

718
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:44,500
 able to use misguidedness, which I probably exemplify more often than I would ever want

719
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:45,820
 to imagine.

720
01:06:45,820 --> 01:06:49,220
 So I want to genuinely claim that.

721
01:06:49,220 --> 01:06:53,340
 At the same time, I think other lessons would include things like this.

722
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:58,020
 I think in that case, what got married together that didn't and shouldn't have been married

723
01:06:58,020 --> 01:07:04,020
 together was really pragmatism with blessing.

724
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:08,020
 The assumption was that what worked is a sign of God's blessing.

725
01:07:08,020 --> 01:07:12,820
 Well, all kinds of things work to bring about various results, but they may or may not be

726
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:19,060
 the evidence of the fruit of the Spirit, which is what I was trying to indicate.

727
01:07:19,060 --> 01:07:25,660
 So what shows up and what then gets talked about is which church is the biggest church.

728
01:07:25,660 --> 01:07:30,820
 Can any of us imagine that Jesus would ever be interested in that question?

729
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:37,300
 That he would ever have wandered around Palestine, as it were, and said, "I wonder which collection

730
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:39,980
 of disciples are going to be the most numerous."

731
01:07:39,980 --> 01:07:44,140
 That's just an utterly preposterous idea.

732
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:47,740
 But in American culture, pragmatism is a very, very strong influence.

733
01:07:47,740 --> 01:07:51,900
 And the assumption is if it works, then it must be that God's in it.

734
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:59,460
 Now, in fairness, as we all know, in the wisdom tradition of both the Hebrew Scriptures and

735
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:04,900
 the New Testament, there's a very strong correlation that if you do good, good will happen to you.

736
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:06,940
 If you do bad, bad will happen to you.

737
01:08:06,940 --> 01:08:13,780
 And some pragmatism is built out of an assumption that the laws of the reality of the world

738
01:08:13,780 --> 01:08:20,660
 around us can give us clues to how to best live and practice our lives.

739
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:24,560
 So for some, that would be seen as a form of wisdom.

740
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:30,100
 But what it lacked, I think, in that case was any degree of self-critique.

741
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:35,340
 And I happen to know that there were a number of attempts to try to call that pragmatism

742
01:08:35,340 --> 01:08:41,820
 into question by international voices who came to Donald McGavern and Pete Wagner and

743
01:08:41,820 --> 01:08:46,300
 people like that and said, "This is not a kingdom vision.

744
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:48,660
 This is an American vision of the church.

745
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:56,060
 This is about a kind of practical marketing strategy that at its core is not witnessing

746
01:08:56,060 --> 01:09:03,380
 to the faithfulness and call of God in people's lives and in various cultural settings."

747
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:10,140
 That was unable to be heard, and obviously it went on and became a global phenomenon

748
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:14,660
 with which Fuller is still very closely tied.

749
01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:20,060
 And sometimes, especially in international settings, I will have spoken and someone will

750
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:28,500
 come up to me and say, "So are you Fuller or is church growth Fuller?"

751
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:33,860
 And I say, "Well, church growth is part of Fuller's history.

752
01:09:33,860 --> 01:09:38,540
 I'd like to think that I'm trying to do a faithful job of representing the Fuller of

753
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:39,540
 today."

754
01:09:39,540 --> 01:09:47,340
 And those two things touch, have overlapping areas, but we are starkly different.

755
01:09:47,340 --> 01:09:52,500
 So I think the lessons, to come back to your originating question, the lessons that had

756
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:55,260
 to be asked were, what's really happening here?

757
01:09:55,260 --> 01:09:58,500
 What are the hidden and unrecognized assumptions?

758
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:03,940
 How do we listen to a wide and diverse body of Christ to critique an idea that may be,

759
01:10:03,940 --> 01:10:10,540
 quote, "wise within one culture," but be bankrupt in other cultural settings?

760
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:12,820
 And how do we let that actually make a claim?

761
01:10:12,820 --> 01:10:19,580
 So in a certain way, I would say, with all due respect to Pete Wagner and to Donald McGovern,

762
01:10:19,580 --> 01:10:25,700
 especially to Pete Wagner, who I'm critiquing more than I am Donald McGovern, I would say

763
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:28,340
 it was an example of white normativity.

764
01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:35,020
 I sat in some of those meetings where Pete Wagner was receiving the critique of international

765
01:10:35,020 --> 01:10:37,700
 voices saying, "This isn't Americanism.

766
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:41,460
 This is not a gospel kind of approach."

767
01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:45,780
 And he basically just said, "Well, let me give you more numbers.

768
01:10:45,780 --> 01:10:48,820
 Let me give you more evidence that, quote, 'it works.'"

769
01:10:48,820 --> 01:10:53,820
 And he was unwilling to be critiqued by people whose voices were out of different cultural

770
01:10:53,820 --> 01:11:00,100
 contexts, different theological frames, and he just more or less refused to listen or

771
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:02,580
 hear or respond to the change.

772
01:11:02,580 --> 01:11:06,700
 Now that would be an example to me of a very significant learning.

773
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:11,620
 If we're going to be faithful in the complex challenges of today, we have to listen to

774
01:11:11,620 --> 01:11:12,700
 the context that we're in.

775
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:14,180
 Of course we do.

776
01:11:14,180 --> 01:11:21,340
 But we also have to listen to voices inside that context and beyond it that are going

777
01:11:21,340 --> 01:11:27,320
 to complicate our story and have to cause us to do deeper reflection and consideration.

778
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:30,380
 So let me come back to one final point about this.

779
01:11:30,380 --> 01:11:37,060
 When African Americans in America heard about the homogeneous unit principle, it felt like

780
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:43,540
 a rationalization and further defense against the separation of races in the United States.

781
01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:48,800
 And a lot of the Southern churches that became Southern megachurches were churches built

782
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:55,100
 on the homogeneous unit principle, which was really a form of social segregation that was

783
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:59,780
 built into the assumption of how the church should be founded and what will enable it

784
01:11:59,780 --> 01:12:01,060
 to grow.

785
01:12:01,060 --> 01:12:07,180
 So the issues of social justice related to African Americans, for example, in the South

786
01:12:07,180 --> 01:12:11,620
 or elsewhere, but certainly in the South, was completely disregarded in the name of

787
01:12:11,620 --> 01:12:16,980
 the pragmatism of churches that can grow.

788
01:12:16,980 --> 01:12:19,000
 Thank you.

789
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:24,080
 Gina Burn, I would like to have a following discussion with this.

790
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:25,080
 Yes.

791
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:26,080
 Please.

792
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:33,200
 I think this is a very relevant and very important reminder for the Hong Kong churches is that

793
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:40,680
 we have a tendency to sort of copy the "success" of the American churches.

794
01:12:40,680 --> 01:12:46,320
 And when we count our blessings, we count the numbers and we count the resources that

795
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:52,120
 we receive, but not the fruits that we bear or the people among us.

796
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:58,720
 So this is a very, very good reminder that we have to, in our context, discern and not

797
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:02,400
 be copycats of the big churches.

798
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:03,400
 Okay.

799
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:04,400
 Bernard?

800
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:12,120
 Yeah, I'd just like to add something is that we tend to focus on the results of evangelism,

801
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:16,440
 which means more Christians coming to church and things like that.

802
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:25,720
 But recently I heard some very good opinion saying that actually the way we try to convert

803
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:32,640
 people into Christianity is even more important than the result itself, saying that we sometimes

804
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:40,440
 use some way of prosperity gospel or some way to achieve quick results, but along the

805
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:48,040
 way we turn off a lot of people who fail to believe in the gospel that we try to preach.

806
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:54,040
 And that negative result is actually doing the gospel damage.

807
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:59,600
 So we have to be really careful about how we preach it, because how we preach it actually

808
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:02,400
 embodies the gospel itself.

809
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:04,560
 So I believe there's something to add here.

810
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:05,560
 Absolutely.

811
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:10,880
 And another dimension of that, a very point that's so important, and I appreciate what

812
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:16,760
 both of you have said, is that in that process, we forget why are we trying to convert people?

813
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:19,000
 Why do we want them to become Christians?

814
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,840
 Is it just to say they're Christians?

815
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:23,440
 Well that surely is not the motivation.

816
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:27,840
 And it can't be just for an eternal purpose either.

817
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:33,200
 Jesus is calling us to be living disciples, embodiments, evidences.

818
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:39,000
 The church is meant to be the primary evidence, the chief apologetic for why the gospel is

819
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,000
 trustworthy.

820
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,160
 See how the church lives and loves.

821
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:49,000
 And when we fail to do that, because we fail to disciple people, then we fail again, twice.

822
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,060
 We fail to preach the true gospel.

823
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:53,800
 We fail to convert people out of the right vision.

824
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:56,880
 And then they, of course, fail to live that vision.

825
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:57,880
 What could be less surprising?

826
01:14:57,880 --> 01:15:02,040
 I mean, it's the definition of insanity, of just doing the same thing over and over again

827
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:04,440
 and trying to hope for different results.

828
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:13,360
 Yeah, I think ironically, the American church also take a lead in this sense.

829
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:20,040
 What was happening in America is happening in Hong Kong, and I think all over the world.

830
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:26,680
 So I think just now what we share is really important.

831
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:31,400
 We have a question from the audience.

832
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:38,720
 This question is from yesterday, but relevant to today's lecture.

833
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:49,520
 It says, "Mark, please comment on the phenomenon of the rise and fall of televangelism in the

834
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:50,520
 U.S.

835
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:51,520
 The televangelism."

836
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:57,800
 Well, televangelism arises out of a confluence of several things.

837
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:05,640
 It arises out of the pragmatism of technology, allowing technology to deliver preachers primarily,

838
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:10,200
 initially, to audiences wherever they might be reached.

839
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:18,360
 The second thing is the pragmatism of a kind of fundamentalism that believed that if you

840
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:23,920
 could just say the right words in front of people and get them to say yes to your words,

841
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:27,680
 that you were doing gospel ministry.

842
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:34,760
 As we know, there can be an incidence, an overlap there, but there's not a synonymousness

843
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:36,520
 between those two things.

844
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:41,040
 I could get people to say yes to my words, but be completely disconnected to the meaning

845
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:43,280
 or reality of the words.

846
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:51,240
 And again, in the distance of telecommunication, people might write in and send checks and

847
01:16:51,240 --> 01:17:02,960
 ask for prayer, but often their lives are wildly distant from the gospel itself.

848
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:04,080
 So that would be another reason.

849
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:11,840
 I think another reason is the overconfidence, especially in white evangelicalism, that words

850
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,960
 are more important than actions.

851
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:20,840
 So I think the fact that especially Protestantism in general and American white Protestantism

852
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:29,120
 especially I think has given primacy of place to language and to public speakers who are,

853
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:36,160
 let's say, tall, white, educated males, that sort of a model, the big man that I was describing.

854
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:40,920
 And on television, it's a dominance of words, right?

855
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:43,480
 It's not loving relationships.

856
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:50,240
 It's not challenging difficult evidences of how to love one another when you're facing

857
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:51,960
 pain or disagreement.

858
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:58,920
 Instead, it's literally a program, a show that is being produced to elicit a certain

859
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:04,040
 effect and speech is more important than action.

860
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:11,240
 So if a person echoes back my speech and says, "Yes, I affirm what you just said," then

861
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:15,560
 that's considered a closed loop of communication success.

862
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:21,480
 But in Jesus's mind, it's why he gives the warning at the end of the Sermon on the Mount.

863
01:18:21,480 --> 01:18:28,520
 Don't build your house on rock and think you've done that when in fact you've built on sand.

864
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:32,480
 And the difference between building your house on rock and sand is not whether you can name

865
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:34,800
 the difference between rock and sand.

866
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:39,200
 It's whether you live what you've said.

867
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:43,160
 That's what evidences that you have built your house on rock.

868
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:47,640
 And the rise of televangelism extricates that completely.

869
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:50,320
 It just makes it irrelevant, honestly.

870
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:56,520
 It's just the feedback loop of the television screen, the entertainment, the satisfied consumers,

871
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:58,960
 the sending in of checks, et cetera.

872
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:06,600
 And its implications are literally unseen, unpracticed, and so forth.

873
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:09,640
 I hope that makes sense.

874
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:11,680
 There's so much to say about that subject.

875
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:12,680
 Okay.

876
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:15,480
 Any more comment on this?

877
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:16,480
 Okay.

878
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:20,240
 So, Mark, another question for you.

879
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:21,880
 Yes.

880
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:25,480
 Self-criticism is crucial for church.

881
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:30,640
 And thank you for your self-destruction of dominion and nationalism.

882
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:40,080
 However, if white America embraced this self-criticism and not seeing the true influence of the whole

883
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:43,080
 world, what will happen?

884
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:49,280
 Well, it's a very sober question.

885
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:57,880
 I think the Christian language for self-criticism would be words like confession and repentance

886
01:19:57,880 --> 01:20:00,840
 and lament.

887
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:06,880
 And if the church, if any expression of the church, is unwilling to do those things, which

888
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:14,400
 are so basic to a grounded, truth-telling, spiritual life, then I don't think we're interested

889
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:21,800
 in actually being the church, in which case it can and should die.

890
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:25,200
 I think it is as pragmatic as that.

891
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:31,080
 Here I'm using pragmatic to say it's as consequential, it's as natural as that.

892
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:39,360
 A church that's not going to tell the truth about itself confessionally, lamentingly,

893
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:45,240
 is not a church that is interested in being changed into the likeness of Jesus Christ.

894
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:50,960
 And then we just become a social movement that does whatever that group of people decides

895
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:54,360
 to do, and they may decide to do it in the name of Jesus.

896
01:20:54,360 --> 01:21:00,440
 But if they don't actually live the gospel, then as Jesus says, it will be a story of

897
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:05,040
 building on sand and not on rock.

898
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:09,680
 And in time, that sand will be the end of our story.

899
01:21:09,680 --> 01:21:15,960
 So I think there's something really quite tellingly critical about the moment that we're

900
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:16,960
 in.

901
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:17,960
 I'm not trying to be an alarmist.

902
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:26,720
 I actually really think there is a crisis of a first-order kind in the American evangelical

903
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:27,800
 church.

904
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:33,240
 And while it's perhaps true of other churches and other times and places, I'm not being

905
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:40,680
 asked to talk about that, so I'm just talking about the white American evangelical reality.

906
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:46,480
 I wonder if either of the people who are respondents want to engage in what I just said.

907
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:48,520
 I would be eager to hear if they do.

908
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:51,120
 I think Bernard would like to say a few words.

909
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:52,120
 Yeah, thank you.

910
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:57,600
 Well, actually, when I read the question, I would approach it this way.

911
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:05,720
 It seems that the person asking the question is thinking that if a person is self-critical,

912
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:11,320
 then she could not become influential in the world.

913
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:15,480
 But I think this is kind of dualistic thinking.

914
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:21,960
 It's that if I am true, then I have to bring you the truth and you have to listen to whatever

915
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:23,360
 I say.

916
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:29,360
 And I believe this is the exceptionalism or the wrong kind of God's mission.

917
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:34,120
 I mean, one kind of evangelism that we are bringing into the world.

918
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:43,480
 I would try to imagine Christians doing evangelism this way, saying that we are actually truth

919
01:22:43,480 --> 01:22:47,480
 seekers along the way to seek God.

920
01:22:47,480 --> 01:22:54,280
 And for those people who are not yet believers, let's seek God together.

921
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:55,280
 We can together.

922
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:59,480
 We are fellow human beings seeking truth together.

923
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:05,080
 So I think for myself, it is kind of like a thinking that can overcome this kind of

924
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:07,560
 dualistic, I have the truth and you don't.

925
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:08,560
 This kind of thinking.

926
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:10,560
 Yes, that's very helpful.

927
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:12,600
 Thank you.

928
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:18,520
 I think authenticity, being true to one another and that we pull together, and that would

929
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:23,320
 really help us to take one more step forward.

930
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:24,880
 All right.

931
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:30,720
 So Mark, another question for you.

932
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:38,320
 In today's world, global competition has made nationalism an urgent and controversial ideological

933
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:40,100
 issue.

934
01:23:40,100 --> 01:23:48,200
 How can the American white church teach a healthy patriotism, or that means a love and

935
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:54,640
 a passion for your own nation, and celebration of our ethnic identity?

936
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:59,800
 Yes, I think it's a really wonderful question.

937
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:06,300
 And I think it's a project that has been going on in parts of white evangelicalism in America

938
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:07,900
 all along.

939
01:24:07,900 --> 01:24:13,040
 People who are clear that we are right to love and want to serve our nation in various

940
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:14,040
 ways.

941
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:20,700
 What we don't have to do is turn our nation into an idol or anything even remotely like

942
01:24:20,700 --> 01:24:26,680
 that and give it undue allegiance and deference and power in our lives.

943
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:32,900
 That's when it turns into nationalism, especially when that characterization then makes it supreme

944
01:24:32,900 --> 01:24:35,560
 over any and all other nations.

945
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:43,000
 So to my embarrassment as an American, often American patriotism, which is the healthy

946
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:48,000
 form of the way that we might relate to our nation, has been turned into American nationalism,

947
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,000
 as you know.

948
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:54,100
 And you end up having these outlandish statements that are made that America is the greatest

949
01:24:54,100 --> 01:24:56,580
 country in the world and blah, blah, blah.

950
01:24:56,580 --> 01:25:02,420
 All of this kind of narcissism within an American culture.

951
01:25:02,420 --> 01:25:05,180
 That I think needs to be replaced.

952
01:25:05,180 --> 01:25:08,380
 It needs to be undone and destroyed, frankly.

953
01:25:08,380 --> 01:25:15,020
 And then it needs to be replaced, as that happens, with a very different sense of devotion,

954
01:25:15,020 --> 01:25:17,500
 a genuine, deep love.

955
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:25,980
 I sometimes wonder if the proclivity to move from patriotism to nationalism is driven by

956
01:25:25,980 --> 01:25:32,740
 an unwillingness to love and instead to enter into false worship.

957
01:25:32,740 --> 01:25:38,020
 And if we're given to false worship, then we're going to be prone to something like

958
01:25:38,020 --> 01:25:39,020
 nationalism.

959
01:25:39,020 --> 01:25:44,200
 If we're given, giving ourselves to the task of genuine love, servant love, especially

960
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:50,620
 as Jesus has exemplified it and taught it, then it calls us to a different way of seeing

961
01:25:50,620 --> 01:25:57,820
 our neighbor, a different way of listening, a different way of understanding and empathizing

962
01:25:57,820 --> 01:25:58,820
 with other people.

963
01:25:58,820 --> 01:26:01,840
 Let me give an example.

964
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:09,460
 In Canada, there was an educator of grade school aged children who became aware of increasing

965
01:26:09,460 --> 01:26:12,420
 violence in schools.

966
01:26:12,420 --> 01:26:18,840
 And she became convinced that part of what it was about was a lack of empathy.

967
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:24,820
 That as families were busier and as parents were both working and so forth, empathy taught

968
01:26:24,820 --> 01:26:28,320
 in the home was lacking.

969
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:31,620
 So she developed a curriculum, which is very, very interesting.

970
01:26:31,620 --> 01:26:36,580
 It's a curriculum when a child is about 10 years old or so.

971
01:26:36,580 --> 01:26:42,580
 And for the course of that school year, one part of the curriculum is that a newborn baby

972
01:26:42,580 --> 01:26:46,420
 is brought into the classroom at the beginning of the school year.

973
01:26:46,420 --> 01:26:51,580
 And that baby is going to be a recurrent visitor to the classroom over the course of the whole

974
01:26:51,580 --> 01:26:52,960
 school year.

975
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:58,740
 And she's written a curriculum about how we pay attention to the baby in the classroom.

976
01:26:58,740 --> 01:26:59,740
 What are they doing?

977
01:26:59,740 --> 01:27:00,740
 What do they seem to be learning?

978
01:27:00,740 --> 01:27:02,260
 What are they responding to?

979
01:27:02,260 --> 01:27:04,900
 How might they be feeling, etc.?

980
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:10,740
 But she would say in retrospect, after double blind tests have been done on the high degree

981
01:27:10,740 --> 01:27:17,140
 of effectiveness of this curriculum, the surprising part has been that as she had imagined, but

982
01:27:17,140 --> 01:27:22,500
 not shown before, the great formation influence is not what happens when the baby is in the

983
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:23,660
 room.

984
01:27:23,660 --> 01:27:26,420
 It's what happens when the baby is not in the room.

985
01:27:26,420 --> 01:27:32,700
 And they are, as a class or as individual students, meant to write or think or talk

986
01:27:32,700 --> 01:27:39,820
 about the baby as though they were projecting themselves into the baby's life and trying

987
01:27:39,820 --> 01:27:45,180
 to imagine based on what the baby was like the last time they saw the baby, what might

988
01:27:45,180 --> 01:27:50,220
 the baby be thinking or feeling at this time of the day in the light of these particular

989
01:27:50,220 --> 01:27:51,220
 circumstances?

990
01:27:51,220 --> 01:27:56,260
 Just imagine the baby is fussy, whatever the issues might be.

991
01:27:56,260 --> 01:27:59,940
 And in the long-term studies that have now been done, this has been in place for about

992
01:27:59,940 --> 01:28:05,340
 20 years in Canadian schools, one of the most amazing things is just the high, high, high

993
01:28:05,340 --> 01:28:11,660
 rate of children that have gone through this curriculum having very high sustained empathy

994
01:28:11,660 --> 01:28:18,020
 and others that have not gone through the curriculum having much lower levels of empathy.

995
01:28:18,020 --> 01:28:24,700
 So my point back to the question about nationalism and patriotism is that I just wonder if healthy

996
01:28:24,700 --> 01:28:32,820
 patriotism is built really out of a culture of empathy, of compassion and mercy and justice,

997
01:28:32,820 --> 01:28:38,580
 not out of pride and arrogance and power.

998
01:28:38,580 --> 01:28:42,780
 Now I know that that can sound very idealistic.

999
01:28:42,780 --> 01:28:45,660
 I'm not unaware of that at all.

1000
01:28:45,660 --> 01:28:50,620
 I'm just saying that from a Christian point of view, I think one is much more likely to

1001
01:28:50,620 --> 01:28:57,300
 produce healthy patriotism and much less likely to produce this kind of fierce nationalism.

1002
01:28:57,300 --> 01:28:58,300
 Thank you.

1003
01:28:58,300 --> 01:29:01,300
 No more comment, right?

1004
01:29:01,300 --> 01:29:02,900
 Okay.

1005
01:29:02,900 --> 01:29:08,860
 Just now you mentioned about, in your lecture, you mentioned about melting pot.

1006
01:29:08,860 --> 01:29:16,740
 We have a question that could you give us some practical suggestions for forming a diversified

1007
01:29:16,740 --> 01:29:21,460
 community within the church without it becoming a melting pot?

1008
01:29:21,460 --> 01:29:24,020
 But we'll say it.

1009
01:29:24,020 --> 01:29:25,020
 Right.

1010
01:29:25,020 --> 01:29:30,540
 Well, I developed something at the churches that I have served that I also developed when

1011
01:29:30,540 --> 01:29:33,540
 I came to join the faculty at Fuller.

1012
01:29:33,540 --> 01:29:39,220
 At Fuller, it took a particular form, which is something that we call MICA groups, which

1013
01:29:39,220 --> 01:29:46,540
 are groups of different kinds of people, different backgrounds, different races, different denominations,

1014
01:29:46,540 --> 01:29:53,420
 who gather together and spend two years in a small group discussing content, which is

1015
01:29:53,420 --> 01:29:56,980
 surrounding the issues of the convergence of worship, preaching and justice in this

1016
01:29:56,980 --> 01:30:02,780
 case, where everyone literally brings a different point of view.

1017
01:30:02,780 --> 01:30:07,740
 And you're invited into this group and you're invited to bring what you might hold in common

1018
01:30:07,740 --> 01:30:13,540
 and you're invited to bring what you may hold as differences.

1019
01:30:13,540 --> 01:30:20,380
 And that is actually the value of the group, is to practice conversations, sustained conversation

1020
01:30:20,380 --> 01:30:26,460
 with people who are not like us around issues that really matter.

1021
01:30:26,460 --> 01:30:32,700
 Often small groups are built with people who, again, choose largely homogeneous gatherings.

1022
01:30:32,700 --> 01:30:37,820
 But these groups are built around this different kind of social context.

1023
01:30:37,820 --> 01:30:43,540
 I have to say it's been a very gratifying and joyful thing to see the way that these

1024
01:30:43,540 --> 01:30:45,060
 groups have developed.

1025
01:30:45,060 --> 01:30:51,460
 And I think that a parallel model happening in a local church could really happen, not

1026
01:30:51,460 --> 01:30:52,960
 because you're there to debate.

1027
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:53,960
 We're not there to debate.

1028
01:30:53,960 --> 01:30:59,060
 We're there to actually talk about the subjects that are part of the curriculum that the group

1029
01:30:59,060 --> 01:31:00,660
 is going through.

1030
01:31:00,660 --> 01:31:03,180
 But naturally debates arise.

1031
01:31:03,180 --> 01:31:08,040
 And the commitment as you join the group is, I will choose to stay in this conversation

1032
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:14,220
 with these people for two years, not just for as long as it's happy and easy for me,

1033
01:31:14,220 --> 01:31:18,140
 but I will agree to be part of the group for a two year period.

1034
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:23,580
 I'm going to submit myself to that as a spiritual discipline and let the differences then allow

1035
01:31:23,580 --> 01:31:26,900
 us to learn from one another and get beyond our own categories.

1036
01:31:26,900 --> 01:31:34,060
 Mark, I envy your full experience.

1037
01:31:34,060 --> 01:31:44,140
 Anything we can do from our CGST community?

1038
01:31:44,140 --> 01:31:46,500
 I guess you're looking at our responses.

1039
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:51,780
 Because we have a dean and associate dean here.

1040
01:31:51,780 --> 01:32:00,300
 It is a very good, I would say it is a noble goal and we like to strive towards that.

1041
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:06,660
 And we always struggle between how homogenous and how diverse we can be.

1042
01:32:06,660 --> 01:32:16,180
 Say for example, we hope that our assembly can be more diverse, but because we all have

1043
01:32:16,180 --> 01:32:23,860
 some sort of image to project to outside, and so we kind of naturally attract like-minded

1044
01:32:23,860 --> 01:32:24,860
 people together.

1045
01:32:24,860 --> 01:32:31,740
 Of course we want to be diverse, but so that is also, that is the struggle.

1046
01:32:31,740 --> 01:32:38,100
 And the other struggle we have, I believe in Hong Kong churches right now is that people

1047
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:46,660
 tend not to have this desire to come together with different people because those meetings

1048
01:32:46,660 --> 01:32:56,540
 tend to be very emotionally, psychologically draining and it's very tiring to do it.

1049
01:32:56,540 --> 01:33:02,860
 And so I would, I'm reluctant to offer any advice on that, but the reality is that it

1050
01:33:02,860 --> 01:33:06,460
 is very difficult to do.

1051
01:33:06,460 --> 01:33:10,380
 So yeah, so that is what it would be.

1052
01:33:10,380 --> 01:33:20,300
 Well I think at CJST we always value, our core value is to have an open mind and to

1053
01:33:20,300 --> 01:33:22,680
 be open to whatever we encounter.

1054
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:29,740
 But I think it's a human's natural tendency to form a homogenous community and to stay

1055
01:33:29,740 --> 01:33:31,420
 comfortable there.

1056
01:33:31,420 --> 01:33:40,740
 So yes, I think whether it's churches or seminary, we really need to be open and to

1057
01:33:40,740 --> 01:33:42,460
 encounter different people.

1058
01:33:42,460 --> 01:33:50,180
 And it's paradoxical because only then you become more human and you expand your scope

1059
01:33:50,180 --> 01:33:57,540
 and to learn to love and to appreciate different things in life.

1060
01:33:57,540 --> 01:33:59,220
 Thank you, thank you.

1061
01:33:59,220 --> 01:34:03,300
 I think we have a lot of things to learn from that.

1062
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:11,180
 Mark, just now you mentioned the term CRT, the critical race theory.

1063
01:34:11,180 --> 01:34:16,620
 I must confess that many Hong Kong people are not familiar with that concept.

1064
01:34:16,620 --> 01:34:23,500
 In fact someone asked here, could you explain what exactly is that theory and what's the

1065
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:33,100
 background and what is the incident in this Southwestern practice convention?

1066
01:34:33,100 --> 01:34:36,340
 Yeah, please.

1067
01:34:36,340 --> 01:34:43,820
 Well it was born really in the late 20th century in America and it was a theory that is often

1068
01:34:43,820 --> 01:34:51,740
 attached to people like James Cone, but not only James Cone, who looked at the theological

1069
01:34:51,740 --> 01:34:58,140
 paradigms and made what now seems like very obvious observations that were beginning to

1070
01:34:58,140 --> 01:35:00,460
 emerge by the middle part of the 20th century.

1071
01:35:00,460 --> 01:35:08,740
 That is that our theology claims to be neutral culturally, but in fact it's always contextualized

1072
01:35:08,740 --> 01:35:14,020
 and that we can't really claim to understand anything without an understanding of context.

1073
01:35:14,020 --> 01:35:19,300
 And this is where hyphenated theologies begin to arise like "African American Christianity"

1074
01:35:19,300 --> 01:35:27,420
 or "Asian American Christianity" or "Black Theology," "Feminist Theology," "Queer Theology,"

1075
01:35:27,420 --> 01:35:28,580
 etc.

1076
01:35:28,580 --> 01:35:34,700
 And so the issue becomes what are the underpinnings of our understanding of these categories theologically

1077
01:35:34,700 --> 01:35:38,180
 and how do we critically evaluate them?

1078
01:35:38,180 --> 01:35:44,240
 Now they get intertwined with postmodern critical theory.

1079
01:35:44,240 --> 01:35:54,500
 So you have the critical theory that's gaining ascendancy in the 70s and 80s in Europe and

1080
01:35:54,500 --> 01:35:57,460
 in the United States for sure.

1081
01:35:57,460 --> 01:36:02,580
 And it's basically a critical theory as it was understood at the time that's represented

1082
01:36:02,580 --> 01:36:08,820
 by Jacques Derrida or Michel Foucault or other such people, is that basically there is no

1083
01:36:08,820 --> 01:36:16,020
 absolute of almost anything and that really what we have fundamentally is a complete relativistic

1084
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:18,440
 world.

1085
01:36:18,440 --> 01:36:23,820
 And in that way, I would argue that they are arguing philosophically for something that

1086
01:36:23,820 --> 01:36:30,100
 I as a Christian would not be able to embrace at the level that they do, though I have learned

1087
01:36:30,100 --> 01:36:35,380
 a great deal about race from critical race theory.

1088
01:36:35,380 --> 01:36:41,820
 So that is swirling around and for people on the left politically, they would often,

1089
01:36:41,820 --> 01:36:48,420
 especially people of color, would often see critical race theory as like in the same way

1090
01:36:48,420 --> 01:36:57,540
 that Marxism was often very helpful in understanding the nature and plight of the worker, for example.

1091
01:36:57,540 --> 01:37:05,140
 They would say this is really a great set of tools to be able to dismantle white normativity,

1092
01:37:05,140 --> 01:37:08,340
 for example.

1093
01:37:08,340 --> 01:37:11,300
 And therefore, they would want to use critical race theory.

1094
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:16,980
 And what happened is that then a lot of people in order to reject the left for different

1095
01:37:16,980 --> 01:37:21,420
 reasons have said, oh, the problem is critical race theory.

1096
01:37:21,420 --> 01:37:22,700
 It should be repudiated.

1097
01:37:22,700 --> 01:37:24,980
 That was what I was discussing today.

1098
01:37:24,980 --> 01:37:30,460
 And it should be repudiated because what they want to affirm instead, though they don't

1099
01:37:30,460 --> 01:37:34,900
 usually say it this plainly, is that they want to defend white normativity and they

1100
01:37:34,900 --> 01:37:37,500
 see critical race theory as the problem.

1101
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:41,660
 Whereas what I was trying to get at is that the problem is not critical race theory as

1102
01:37:41,660 --> 01:37:42,660
 a certain theory.

1103
01:37:42,660 --> 01:37:45,460
 It's not the theory that's finally the problem.

1104
01:37:45,460 --> 01:37:48,500
 It's the actual racism that's the problem.

1105
01:37:48,500 --> 01:37:52,980
 And whether you want to examine it through the critical race theory or through some other

1106
01:37:52,980 --> 01:37:58,740
 mechanism, that needs to be addressed, not the theory itself.

1107
01:37:58,740 --> 01:38:03,540
 So to make the theory the problem rather than the actual condition is what I was trying

1108
01:38:03,540 --> 01:38:04,540
 to address.

1109
01:38:04,540 --> 01:38:08,020
 I hope that clarifies it for any who might have been confused.

1110
01:38:08,020 --> 01:38:12,220
 You can certainly find plenty online about critical race theory.

1111
01:38:12,220 --> 01:38:18,620
 And a lot of it is Marxist and a lot of it is very adamantly anti-Christian.

1112
01:38:18,620 --> 01:38:24,460
 I just think like any good theory, though, there's a lot to be learned all the same.

1113
01:38:24,460 --> 01:38:30,060
 Just now the person asked, actually he already Googled it, but I think he wants to know a

1114
01:38:30,060 --> 01:38:31,980
 bit more inside the story.

1115
01:38:31,980 --> 01:38:32,980
 That's all.

1116
01:38:32,980 --> 01:38:33,980
 Yeah.

1117
01:38:33,980 --> 01:38:34,980
 Yes.

1118
01:38:34,980 --> 01:38:35,980
 Okay.

1119
01:38:35,980 --> 01:38:36,980
 I hope I provided that.

1120
01:38:36,980 --> 01:38:37,980
 Did you want more?

1121
01:38:37,980 --> 01:38:38,980
 Yeah, I'm fine.

1122
01:38:38,980 --> 01:38:39,980
 I'm fine.

1123
01:38:39,980 --> 01:38:40,980
 I'm fine.

1124
01:38:40,980 --> 01:38:41,980
 All right.

1125
01:38:41,980 --> 01:38:42,980
 Okay.

1126
01:38:42,980 --> 01:38:44,580
 One more question.

1127
01:38:44,580 --> 01:38:50,460
 The question asked, "We in Hong Kong receive the gospel hand down by the West."

1128
01:38:50,460 --> 01:38:56,320
 You know, the Western missionary from America, from Europe come to Hong Kong from China.

1129
01:38:56,320 --> 01:39:00,220
 So we receive the gospel in this way.

1130
01:39:00,220 --> 01:39:08,580
 But the gospel hand down to us probably mixed with American culture, American tradition,

1131
01:39:08,580 --> 01:39:12,860
 but most of the time we don't really recognize that.

1132
01:39:12,860 --> 01:39:23,100
 So the gospel we receive might be incompatible with our own culture and our own government

1133
01:39:23,100 --> 01:39:24,260
 here.

1134
01:39:24,260 --> 01:39:28,900
 So any suggestion for the Christian in this part of the world?

1135
01:39:28,900 --> 01:39:29,900
 Yes.

1136
01:39:29,900 --> 01:39:35,780
 Well, I would say that no one knows anything purely and neutrally.

1137
01:39:35,780 --> 01:39:38,760
 We all are knowers in locations.

1138
01:39:38,760 --> 01:39:46,260
 So there's no way of getting rid of every element of white American evangelicalism any

1139
01:39:46,260 --> 01:39:53,660
 more than there's an ability to get rid of a certain kind of cultural bias or tendency

1140
01:39:53,660 --> 01:39:56,500
 or whatever it might be.

1141
01:39:56,500 --> 01:39:59,660
 So let's not go for the absolute purity.

1142
01:39:59,660 --> 01:40:03,140
 Let's just go for something better than what we have.

1143
01:40:03,140 --> 01:40:08,320
 I think this is where something like a tool like critical race theory, which I do not

1144
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:16,920
 embrace as a practice, can add to the tool set that we have to try to get a clearer picture

1145
01:40:16,920 --> 01:40:18,720
 of what's going on.

1146
01:40:18,720 --> 01:40:20,440
 I think it's very interesting.

1147
01:40:20,440 --> 01:40:27,800
 And I want to just say I know that I'm stepping into delicate territory in what I'm about

1148
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:28,800
 to say.

1149
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:35,300
 And I'm also aware that I know, I think, a fair amount about this movement, but not

1150
01:40:35,300 --> 01:40:37,720
 all that you would certainly know about it.

1151
01:40:37,720 --> 01:40:44,180
 But when I've heard about the Sinoization of the church in or of Christianity in Asia

1152
01:40:44,180 --> 01:40:50,360
 or in China in particular, it's interesting to me that the two things are happening at

1153
01:40:50,360 --> 01:40:51,700
 the same time.

1154
01:40:51,700 --> 01:40:56,740
 On the one hand, the government, I think, seems to be asking for clarity about what

1155
01:40:56,740 --> 01:41:01,180
 is truly Chinese.

1156
01:41:01,180 --> 01:41:09,180
 And there are things about the gospel that I would say are truly Chinese.

1157
01:41:09,180 --> 01:41:14,900
 And what they're trying to critique is let's get rid of the colonialist past in relationship

1158
01:41:14,900 --> 01:41:23,580
 to Christianity and get down to at least a truly Chinese Christianity.

1159
01:41:23,580 --> 01:41:25,680
 I know this is very complicated territory.

1160
01:41:25,680 --> 01:41:27,260
 So hang in with me here.

1161
01:41:27,260 --> 01:41:32,940
 I'm just trying to make a small point in the middle of an ocean of challenges.

1162
01:41:32,940 --> 01:41:38,240
 But I think in a way, the government's instinct about that is a really worthy one from a Christian

1163
01:41:38,240 --> 01:41:46,460
 point of view, saying, let's understand who we are culturally and how our faith redefines

1164
01:41:46,460 --> 01:41:52,460
 and helps us understand what it means to live as a faithful disciple in any given context,

1165
01:41:52,460 --> 01:41:57,500
 let's say specifically in a Chinese context, as a faithful Christian person of Chinese

1166
01:41:57,500 --> 01:41:58,500
 descent.

1167
01:41:58,500 --> 01:42:05,700
 Now, the ironic part of that is that if that happened, then I think the gospel that would

1168
01:42:05,700 --> 01:42:12,460
 actually be found would be a gospel that would enable the Chinese church both to see that

1169
01:42:12,460 --> 01:42:14,980
 we are inseparably bound together across the world.

1170
01:42:14,980 --> 01:42:20,880
 The gospel is inherently international, intercultural, interracial, et cetera.

1171
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:25,560
 But it would also give, I think, a fresh set of tools to be able to ask, how do we freshly

1172
01:42:25,560 --> 01:42:30,500
 look at how we communicate the gospel, how we articulate the gospel, how we enact the

1173
01:42:30,500 --> 01:42:36,820
 gospel in our setting in a way that might enable the gospel to be strengthened?

1174
01:42:36,820 --> 01:42:43,760
 Now, I know along the way, the fear is, understandably, that the gospel will be lost.

1175
01:42:43,760 --> 01:42:48,220
 And I'm not denying the pressure of that influence.

1176
01:42:48,220 --> 01:42:53,740
 Here having now ventured into this dangerous and complicated territory, let me especially

1177
01:42:53,740 --> 01:42:58,380
 ask my two responders to engage with us, please, with me.

1178
01:42:58,380 --> 01:43:00,580
 Rescue me from the trouble I've just gotten into.

1179
01:43:00,580 --> 01:43:02,460
 >> Okay, thank you, thank you.

1180
01:43:02,460 --> 01:43:03,460
 >> Can I?

1181
01:43:03,460 --> 01:43:04,460
 >> Yes, please.

1182
01:43:04,460 --> 01:43:10,780
 >> I totally agree with you, Dr. Leperton, but I'd like to add something onto that is

1183
01:43:10,780 --> 01:43:19,780
 I believe for Christians that are not in America, like in Hong Kong, we receive the gospel,

1184
01:43:19,780 --> 01:43:23,220
 we are influenced by the American church a whole lot.

1185
01:43:23,220 --> 01:43:29,260
 But I think one important thing for us to do is to understand in what context did that

1186
01:43:29,260 --> 01:43:34,500
 gospel, that version of the gospel came about.

1187
01:43:34,500 --> 01:43:40,900
 And so actually the lecture that Mark, you gave these few days, very important for us

1188
01:43:40,900 --> 01:43:48,300
 because the, what I call and quote, the American version, I mean, there is a lot of truth and

1189
01:43:48,300 --> 01:43:50,860
 treasure within that, we have to say.

1190
01:43:50,860 --> 01:43:55,840
 But of course, there are some pitfalls that comes together with the version.

1191
01:43:55,840 --> 01:44:02,260
 And there are historical and constitutional reason, cultural reason why it all came about.

1192
01:44:02,260 --> 01:44:08,060
 But I believe for us in Hong Kong, when I first, you know, turned to Christ years ago,

1193
01:44:08,060 --> 01:44:13,300
 the version that I listened to, very close to the American version.

1194
01:44:13,300 --> 01:44:20,420
 It was until I came into a seminary and learned theology that I start to realize that the

1195
01:44:20,420 --> 01:44:28,280
 gospel is so-called much wider or has much more different perspectives to look at.

1196
01:44:28,280 --> 01:44:34,940
 So I believe one important thing we have to do outside of America is to understand how

1197
01:44:34,940 --> 01:44:40,580
 that came about in a particular context, instead of throwing away the whole thing and only

1198
01:44:40,580 --> 01:44:42,440
 critiquing the whole thing.

1199
01:44:42,440 --> 01:44:45,940
 So I would say that is my personal experience on that.

1200
01:44:45,940 --> 01:44:46,940
 Yeah, thank you.

1201
01:44:46,940 --> 01:44:47,940
 That's really helpful.

1202
01:44:47,940 --> 01:44:55,220
 Well, I think in this part of the world, Christians are trained more to be quote unquote obedient

1203
01:44:55,220 --> 01:44:58,300
 and they just take in whatever they're taught.

1204
01:44:58,300 --> 01:45:04,940
 And we need to challenge our Christians to think critically for themselves and to develop

1205
01:45:04,940 --> 01:45:12,860
 the sort of theological mind, rather than just listen and just do whatever they're told.

1206
01:45:12,860 --> 01:45:18,900
 I think it's a sort of a different culture than the West.

1207
01:45:18,900 --> 01:45:21,260
 Yes, yes.

1208
01:45:21,260 --> 01:45:22,940
 Okay.

1209
01:45:22,940 --> 01:45:24,940
 Time flies.

1210
01:45:24,940 --> 01:45:27,460
 We have 45 minutes is gone.

1211
01:45:27,460 --> 01:45:30,620
 But one last question, right, Mark?

1212
01:45:30,620 --> 01:45:31,620
 One last question.

1213
01:45:31,620 --> 01:45:32,620
 Yeah.

1214
01:45:32,620 --> 01:45:39,380
 Just now, already you already shared a little bit about your fuller experience to how to

1215
01:45:39,380 --> 01:45:46,140
 form a diversified community with a diversified background.

1216
01:45:46,140 --> 01:45:48,940
 We still have questions to ask.

1217
01:45:48,940 --> 01:45:52,780
 Could you share a little bit more?

1218
01:45:52,780 --> 01:45:55,900
 That means just now what you shared is not enough for that person.

1219
01:45:55,900 --> 01:46:04,620
 Can you share a little bit more about forming a multi-ethnic or multi-something group?

1220
01:46:04,620 --> 01:46:07,220
 This is a very strange question.

1221
01:46:07,220 --> 01:46:11,380
 A multi-ethnic and a multi-something group.

1222
01:46:11,380 --> 01:46:14,300
 How could you form such a...

1223
01:46:14,300 --> 01:46:21,140
 Because in such a church, we have difficulty and conflict and different opinions among

1224
01:46:21,140 --> 01:46:24,660
 members and even members and leaders, whatever.

1225
01:46:24,660 --> 01:46:29,660
 So anything you'd like to share a little bit?

1226
01:46:29,660 --> 01:46:33,780
 Well let me just be very, very personal about it.

1227
01:46:33,780 --> 01:46:43,100
 Like anybody, and in my case being a white American male evangelical leader, I can easily

1228
01:46:43,100 --> 01:46:44,100
 get...

1229
01:46:44,100 --> 01:46:47,100
 I mean, I'm fully guilty as charged.

1230
01:46:47,100 --> 01:46:50,620
 So all of those things are true of me.

1231
01:46:50,620 --> 01:46:56,820
 And I think one of the things that's also true for me is that I realize how much God

1232
01:46:56,820 --> 01:47:02,300
 wants to crack open my imagination and the world of relationships and God's vision for

1233
01:47:02,300 --> 01:47:07,500
 the church in a way that is not a reflection of me and of a reflection of people that are

1234
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:08,500
 like me.

1235
01:47:08,500 --> 01:47:16,620
 It includes people like me, but it also includes here, I think, especially in Ephesians 2.

1236
01:47:16,620 --> 01:47:21,940
 It includes people who do not look like me, who don't talk like me, who don't live in

1237
01:47:21,940 --> 01:47:24,460
 the world in the same way that I do.

1238
01:47:24,460 --> 01:47:30,700
 And since I became a Christian, lo these many, many years ago, I realized that to be a Christian

1239
01:47:30,700 --> 01:47:37,180
 meant that God was changing me in many ways, including my social location.

1240
01:47:37,180 --> 01:47:45,260
 So the social location I was born into is not the social location of the people of God.

1241
01:47:45,260 --> 01:47:47,980
 That social location is now in Christ.

1242
01:47:47,980 --> 01:47:52,980
 And if I'm in Christ, then I am meant to be in communion with people that are also in

1243
01:47:52,980 --> 01:47:54,060
 Christ.

1244
01:47:54,060 --> 01:47:58,160
 And some of them will be like me, and the majority actually will not be like me because

1245
01:47:58,160 --> 01:48:01,200
 the majority of the world is not like me.

1246
01:48:01,200 --> 01:48:10,620
 So I have made it a point over the years to try to just form trusting relationships, friendships,

1247
01:48:10,620 --> 01:48:19,540
 knowledge of people that are like me and not like me, and to build relationships of trust.

1248
01:48:19,540 --> 01:48:25,020
 And I think what's happened over time has been that I have quite an array of friends

1249
01:48:25,020 --> 01:48:32,500
 who do not see the world the same way as I do or as they do in relationship to each other.

1250
01:48:32,500 --> 01:48:38,300
 But because they trust me and they trust that I'm going to respect them, learn from them,

1251
01:48:38,300 --> 01:48:46,060
 receive them as brothers and sisters in Christ, I stumbled really into discovering that they

1252
01:48:46,060 --> 01:48:50,500
 would accept an invitation from me to meet together.

1253
01:48:50,500 --> 01:48:56,740
 Now that meant that there was already a relationship of trust with me.

1254
01:48:56,740 --> 01:49:01,020
 They knew that I was not going to let anything inappropriate happen in the meeting.

1255
01:49:01,020 --> 01:49:08,280
 They knew that I wanted it to be honest discussion, and they knew that this would be the way things

1256
01:49:08,280 --> 01:49:09,780
 could unfold.

1257
01:49:09,780 --> 01:49:17,380
 And so by just stumbling into this idea of gathering unlike people together, I started

1258
01:49:17,380 --> 01:49:23,260
 accumulating experiences of doing this and realized that a lot of other people would

1259
01:49:23,260 --> 01:49:26,940
 like to be in a group like that, but they didn't know how that could come about.

1260
01:49:26,940 --> 01:49:32,540
 And then you have to figure out how can you make it come about in a more systemic way.

1261
01:49:32,540 --> 01:49:36,920
 Let me tell you, though, about a different, related but different experience.

1262
01:49:36,920 --> 01:49:43,780
 When I was a pastor in Berkeley and when evangelicalism of the kind we have been discussing was on

1263
01:49:43,780 --> 01:49:49,080
 the rise, I was the pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of Berkeley, California, which is surrounded

1264
01:49:49,080 --> 01:49:56,380
 by the University of California, which is a wonderful and crazy institution.

1265
01:49:56,380 --> 01:50:04,980
 And in that setting, evangelicalism and Christian faith itself was treated as anathema.

1266
01:50:04,980 --> 01:50:10,700
 So we started a conference that we called the Global Church Conference, "Hearing the

1267
01:50:10,700 --> 01:50:13,500
 Church in the Majority World."

1268
01:50:13,500 --> 01:50:18,240
 And there were several criteria for the people that we wanted to speak to.

1269
01:50:18,240 --> 01:50:20,060
 We wanted to have them come and speak to us.

1270
01:50:20,060 --> 01:50:24,620
 They couldn't have any financial relationship with Fuller, I mean, with that church.

1271
01:50:24,620 --> 01:50:28,800
 We would pay them an honorarium for their speaking, but they were not dependent on any

1272
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:35,860
 resources that our church was sending to them or to their workplace, whatever it might be.

1273
01:50:35,860 --> 01:50:40,900
 Secondly, they needed to come from at least five different places in the world.

1274
01:50:40,900 --> 01:50:42,980
 They needed to be both men and women.

1275
01:50:42,980 --> 01:50:46,380
 Of course, they needed to be multiracial.

1276
01:50:46,380 --> 01:50:52,780
 And the topic from the first year, just so that you know how long these subjects have

1277
01:50:52,780 --> 01:51:01,460
 been living with me, I think the first global church conference was, let's see, it would

1278
01:51:01,460 --> 01:51:04,900
 have been in about 1995 or so.

1279
01:51:04,900 --> 01:51:10,000
 So for at least 15 years, this conference, which continues on to this day, invites people

1280
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:14,900
 from around the world to come and speak around a theme.

1281
01:51:14,900 --> 01:51:22,700
 And that first year's theme was evangelicalism, the gift and the problem.

1282
01:51:22,700 --> 01:51:27,980
 In that setting, on the very first night, these five people from different parts of

1283
01:51:27,980 --> 01:51:32,180
 the world had gathered to give these in-person lectures.

1284
01:51:32,180 --> 01:51:39,300
 And before the conference had even begun, we were together talking and praying, and

1285
01:51:39,300 --> 01:51:42,940
 there was some laughter that went on in one corner of the room.

1286
01:51:42,940 --> 01:51:44,900
 And I said, "What's the laughter about?"

1287
01:51:44,900 --> 01:51:48,580
 And they said, "Well, we've just admitted to each other we tried to think of reasons

1288
01:51:48,580 --> 01:51:52,940
 not to come to this after all."

1289
01:51:52,940 --> 01:51:55,300
 And I said, "Oh, that's fascinating.

1290
01:51:55,300 --> 01:51:57,740
 Why did you think about not wanting to come?"

1291
01:51:57,740 --> 01:52:02,260
 And they said, "Well, because we actually believe that you mean it when you say, 'Come

1292
01:52:02,260 --> 01:52:05,500
 and tell the truth as you would in your own setting.'"

1293
01:52:05,500 --> 01:52:10,540
 Not for an American audience, but as you would tell the truth in your setting, we believe

1294
01:52:10,540 --> 01:52:12,780
 you actually want that to happen.

1295
01:52:12,780 --> 01:52:17,540
 But the thing is, no one in America has ever asked us to come and tell the truth as we

1296
01:52:17,540 --> 01:52:19,700
 would tell it in our setting.

1297
01:52:19,700 --> 01:52:24,380
 They've asked us to come and tell the truth to an American audience that would please

1298
01:52:24,380 --> 01:52:30,260
 an audience and hopefully, potentially, gain some financial support for the mission that

1299
01:52:30,260 --> 01:52:34,500
 they were involved in, rather than telling the truth.

1300
01:52:34,500 --> 01:52:37,300
 Now that was really poignant.

1301
01:52:37,300 --> 01:52:39,740
 It was exactly the purpose of these conferences.

1302
01:52:39,740 --> 01:52:44,860
 And the reason why they've gone on year by year is to stimulate and make public, in a

1303
01:52:44,860 --> 01:52:53,420
 way, the practice of a public conversation, of watching people combined together, all

1304
01:52:53,420 --> 01:52:58,940
 in Christ, but from different parts of the world, with different points of view around

1305
01:52:58,940 --> 01:53:06,860
 the same topic, and show us in doing so, how to do this peaceably and wisely and honestly.

1306
01:53:06,860 --> 01:53:08,300
 It had to be honest.

1307
01:53:08,300 --> 01:53:12,540
 It could not be some kind of easy deference to the other.

1308
01:53:12,540 --> 01:53:18,260
 It had to actually take on the thorny questions that we were trying to work out.

1309
01:53:18,260 --> 01:53:19,780
 It was an amazing experience.

1310
01:53:19,780 --> 01:53:26,300
 And by the end, there were people who, in our final little group time together, probably,

1311
01:53:26,300 --> 01:53:31,620
 were weeping over how significant this had been, because they had never been invited

1312
01:53:31,620 --> 01:53:33,300
 into that sort of experience.

1313
01:53:33,300 --> 01:53:37,020
 And fortunately, that congregation was able to receive it.

1314
01:53:37,020 --> 01:53:42,380
 And from there, the practices of growing these kinds of groups increased.

1315
01:53:42,380 --> 01:53:44,100
 I hope that's a helpful answer.

1316
01:53:44,100 --> 01:53:45,100
 Thank you.

1317
01:53:45,100 --> 01:53:54,060
 I think your personal story speaks a lot and recaps what you mentioned, the points you

1318
01:53:54,060 --> 01:53:55,900
 mentioned earlier.

1319
01:53:55,900 --> 01:53:57,900
 So any more follow-up?

1320
01:53:57,900 --> 01:53:58,900
 No?

1321
01:53:58,900 --> 01:53:59,900
 Okay.

1322
01:53:59,900 --> 01:54:08,100
 So, Mark, this morning, indeed, very terrific that we can hear words from you, words of

1323
01:54:08,100 --> 01:54:15,900
 wisdom, and also you stimulate our thoughts in a profound way.

1324
01:54:15,900 --> 01:54:23,620
 And also, I really appreciate your way of answering questions, very gentle, very clear.

1325
01:54:23,620 --> 01:54:24,820
 Thank you very much.

1326
01:54:24,820 --> 01:54:29,360
 So we look forward to tomorrow's final lecture.

1327
01:54:29,360 --> 01:54:31,780
 We continue to pray for you as well.

1328
01:54:31,780 --> 01:54:33,600
 So thank you.

1329
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:35,460
 Thank you very much, people.

1330
01:54:35,460 --> 01:54:41,780
 Thank you for coming to this lecture this morning, and I pray that everyone is well.

1331
01:54:41,780 --> 01:54:42,780
 All right.

1332
01:54:42,780 --> 01:54:43,780
 Thank you.

1333
01:54:43,780 --> 01:54:43,780
 Bye-bye.

1334
01:54:43,780 --> 01:54:44,280
 Bye-bye.

1335
01:54:44,280 --> 01:55:02,280
 Bye-bye.

1336
01:55:02,280 --> 01:55:04,280
