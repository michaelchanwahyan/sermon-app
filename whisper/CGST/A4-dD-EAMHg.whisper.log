[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   (Music)
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:21.080]   >> Good morning. Welcome, everyone.
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.120]   Michael Chu here.
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.240]   It's great to have so many people, hundreds of people here
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.240]   in our lecture.
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.240]   I'm very happy to be here with you all.
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.540]   I'm Michael Chu, the president of the
[00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.640]   American Society of Black and Asian
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.720]   people, and this morning we continue to host our Josephine
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.720]   So lecture week, and today is the third lecture.
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.020]   It's a great honor to have Dr.
[00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.100]   Mark Leperton to be our keynote speaker.
[00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.160]   Dr. Leperton has spoken to us on the
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.260]   overall title, the crisis of American white evangelicalism.
[00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.180]   And I'm very impressed by the way he
[00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.280]   has been able to provide us with a
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.580]   very deep and deep insight, and Mark
[00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.680]   walks us through the American history
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.380]   and outline the specific perspective on
[00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.060]   the American culture, and Mark also
[00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.740]   highlights the certain deficiency of
[00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.820]   evangelism or even the deficiency of
[00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.940]   the American culture, and I'm very impressed by his work.
[00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:32.140]   And I'm very impressed by Mark's
[00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.320]   honesty and courage in the path of self-critique.
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.220]   Mark, if you don't mind, I would like to
[00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.320]   address you by your first name, because I
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.400]   feel after these two lectures, I feel so close to you.
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.720]   We are just like good old friends.
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.720]   So, I would like to ask you to share your
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.820]   perspective on the American culture.
[00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.120]   And then, I would like to ask you to
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.220]   share your perspective on the American culture.
[00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.520]   And then, I would like to ask you to share your perspective on
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.620]   the American culture.
[00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.920]   And then, I would like to ask you to share your perspective on
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.020]   the American culture.
[00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.320]   And then, I would like to ask you to share your perspective on
[00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.420]   the American culture.
[00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.720]   And I would like to ask you to share your perspective on the
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.820]   American culture.
[00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.120]   And I would like to ask you to share your perspective on the
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.220]   American culture.
[00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.520]   And I would like to ask you to share your perspective on the
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.620]   American culture.
[00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.920]   And I would like to ask you to share your perspective on the
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.020]   American culture.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.320]   And I would like to ask you to share your perspective on the
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.420]   American culture.
[00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.720]   And I would like to ask you to share your perspective on the
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.820]   American culture.
[00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.120]   And I would like to ask you to share your perspective on the
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.220]   American culture.
[00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.520]   And I would like to ask you to share your perspective on the
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.620]   American culture.
[00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.920]   And I would like to ask you to share your perspective on the
[00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.020]   American culture.
[00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.320]   And I would like to ask you to share your perspective on the
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.420]   American culture.
[00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.720]   And I would like to ask you to share your perspective on the
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.820]   American culture.
[00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.120]   And I would like to ask you to share your perspective on the
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.220]   American culture.
[00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.520]   And I would like to ask you to share your perspective on the
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.620]   American culture.
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.920]   And I would like to ask you to share your perspective on the
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.020]   American culture.
[00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.320]   You are the one who sees us as we are.
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.620]   You understand the places in which we see clearly.
[00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.920]   And you understand the places in which our sight and knowledge
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.020]   are so confused.
[00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.320]   This day in the United States is a very dark day.
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.620]   It's a day in which we acknowledge some painful
[00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.720]   realities about our national life.
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.320]   Your church is implicated in both some of the causes of why
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.420]   the problems exist.
[00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.720]   And also, we pray by your grace, a church that might be able to
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.320]   be used by you for the renewal of the church and the renewal of
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.420]   a nation.
[00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:36.020]   Tonight as we pray here and in the morning as people pray
[00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.120]   throughout Asia, in Hong Kong in particular, we acknowledge that
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.220]   we are a church that is not only a church that is a church that
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:51.860]   We acknowledge that it's your Lordship, your power, your leadership that we need, far above
[00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.700]   and beyond any human agency.
[00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:01.220]   So in humility, O God, we turn to these issues tonight, acknowledging how much we need You
[00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:09.420]   to speak, to guide, to confront, to transform us.
[00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:22.580]   In the name of Jesus Christ, who reigns with humility and power, in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:31.020]   So we come tonight to consider evangelical complexities about power and leadership.
[00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:37.220]   We will reflect on issues of evangelical power that underline, crown, and even subvert its
[00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.940]   gospel and its witness.
[00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.820]   The history of the church has typically been told as the story of so-called big men, that
[00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:57.220]   is, a man usually, if not almost always, through the power of personality, gifts, opportunity,
[00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:05.940]   stealth, privilege of birth, and influence, to have written the story of the world.
[00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:10.980]   And I dare say this is true in the East or the West, it's true in the South and the North,
[00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.980]   whether the past or the present.
[00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:20.400]   We seem to be in a time of exceptional global power disorder and redefinition.
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:26.580]   Every continent has evidences of the turmoil that's going on inside the United States.
[00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:34.940]   It is not a time of world war, and yet in so many directions, we see national and international
[00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:40.260]   collision, aggression, and hostility.
[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:49.180]   Battles of war, including within and among evangelical Christians, are clearly afoot.
[00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:54.980]   All of this is, of course, in dramatic contrast to the description of Jesus that we see in
[00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:59.500]   Paul's letter to the Philippians, chapter 2, verses 1 through 8.
[00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:03.500]   Hear these words again.
[00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:10.340]   Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus.
[00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:17.260]   Though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped,
[00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:24.020]   but emptied himself by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men.
[00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:30.100]   And being found in human form, he humbled himself by taking the form of a servant and
[00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.460]   being born in the likeness of men.
[00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:39.100]   And being found in human form, he humbled himself and became obedient to the point of
[00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:45.420]   death, even death on a cross.
[00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:52.180]   Jesus as the ultimate "big man" lays down the assumptions and prerogatives of power
[00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:58.100]   to live and lead in vulnerability and in weakness.
[00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:04.060]   Nevertheless, the "big man" assumptions occupy a very significant place in the life of the
[00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:07.620]   American evangelical church.
[00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:15.220]   From the 18th to the 20th century, to this day in the 21st, we can point to the quiet,
[00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:21.060]   prayerful, faithful, often exemplary lives of members of the white evangelical church
[00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:27.260]   in the U.S. and see many true signs of the fruit of the Spirit.
[00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:36.420]   Albeit this can now only be said if we acknowledge that this positive legacy is often still intertwined
[00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:42.180]   with the subtle and horrific compromises and the absence of self-criticism or repentance
[00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:47.580]   or lament and transformation that could have occurred.
[00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:54.980]   It's often a story of hidden piety, inward piety, rather than public piety matched with
[00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:57.380]   justice.
[00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:05.260]   Susceptible as human beings are to seek a savior and a hero, it has been an easy assumption
[00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:11.340]   that God will raise up the leader in a U.S. context that should be understood primarily,
[00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:19.140]   typically as being white and male, to be a leader, pastor, and authoritative visionary
[00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:21.300]   voice.
[00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:27.700]   This archetype is so pervasive and influential it's assumed rather than examined.
[00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:34.060]   This is necessarily accompanied by an image of a blonde, blue-eyed Jesus who serves the
[00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:42.940]   dominant interests of an evangelicalism that insists on seeing its image of Jesus, seeing
[00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:49.580]   in its image of Jesus itself, rather than letting Jesus see his image in us.
[00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:56.300]   On the other hand, it can be acknowledged with gratitude that the evangelical movement
[00:09:56.300 --> 00:10:03.780]   in the 20th century, with all of its blessings and sins, perhaps ironically and unselfconsciously,
[00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:09.700]   both contributed to and resisted the geographic repositioning of the center of the global
[00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:15.860]   Christian movement from being a story centered in the global north to one that's now clearly
[00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:21.340]   centered in the global south and in Asia.
[00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:26.780]   This is a cause for rejoicing and for prominence that is primarily about the Spirit of God
[00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:28.980]   meeting the people of God.
[00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:36.260]   This is really the story of God calling, forming, and using leaders around the world for such
[00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:41.220]   transformative change, not least throughout Asia.
[00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:45.700]   During the last quarter of the 20th century in America and elsewhere, we saw the rise
[00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:52.620]   of the megachurch phenomenon that has risen and also fallen because of the influence of
[00:10:52.620 --> 00:11:02.660]   the big man paradigm, a story of largely unidirectional, typically white male power in the United States.
[00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:07.460]   This means the need to acknowledge as such as part of the observations of the 20th and
[00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:14.700]   21st century white evangelicalism still operates largely in a colonialist framework, both in
[00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:18.700]   the US and globally.
[00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:21.580]   Several factors explain this.
[00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:25.900]   First is dominion, the theme of dominion.
[00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:31.540]   The specifically Christian theme of dominion has been one that has been informed, motivated,
[00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:37.620]   shaped, and subverted by our sense of the mission of God, the missio Dei.
[00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:41.820]   The sense of the mission of God in the world as an embodied and proclaimed announcement
[00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:48.300]   that the reign of God is at hand for the sake of all people and places, a bringing to consummation
[00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:52.740]   of all things by our Creator, Redeemer, and Remaker.
[00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:58.260]   This exercise of divine dominion is for the sake of bringing to an end the groaning of
[00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:05.340]   all humanity and of Jesus and of the Spirit and of the people of God and of the whole
[00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:13.420]   created order for the sake of God's shalom and the well-being of love and mercy and justice,
[00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:15.540]   harmony.
[00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:24.060]   The so-called doctrine of discovery, which came into existence in 1493, was the act of
[00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:31.340]   Pope Alexander VI and played a highly influential role in justifying and shaping the Spanish
[00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:37.180]   conquest and the colonial project from that point on.
[00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:44.780]   The papal bull that the Pope put out gave permission and power to discoverers, as they
[00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:51.380]   were called, of any land that was not inhabited by Christians, and that if they discovered
[00:12:51.380 --> 00:13:00.220]   such a land uninhabited by Christians, then it was considered to be available to be "discovered,"
[00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:06.420]   claimed and exploited by Christian rulers and declared that the Catholic faith and the
[00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:13.520]   Christian religion be exalted and be everywhere increased and spread, that the health of souls
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:21.760]   be cared for and that barbarous nations be overthrown and brought to the faith itself.
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:28.680]   This doctrine of discovery justified all European claims in the Americas and the premise justifying
[00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:32.120]   the Western expansion of the United States.
[00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:39.160]   A book that I would commend to you is a book written by Mark Charles and Sun Chan-ra entitled
[00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:43.440]   Unsettling Truths, which explores this in much more detail.
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:46.920]   Many other books likewise have been written about it.
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:53.440]   This aligns with what had been seen in the Roman Empire, Constantine's influence, medieval
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:56.320]   expansionism and war.
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:02.860]   Yet through the doctrine of discovery, the church is itself the initiator in the further
[00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:10.200]   coalescence of church and government collusion to use power in the name of faith for the
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:14.400]   sake of political, economic and religious ends.
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:21.280]   It is the full fruit of what had long been operational, and it was unleashed in what
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:28.420]   continues in less obtrusive ways to the dominion mindset of some American white evangelicals
[00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:30.040]   to this day.
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:37.720]   The ferocity of the division in the US evangelical church, even today, is in many ways unlocked
[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:40.360]   by the doctrine of discovery.
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:47.760]   If you believe, as many do, that the ideological, political and religious battles going on among
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:54.800]   white evangelical voices in the US has little to do with theology, it has more to do with
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:55.800]   power.
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:15:02.160]   And its roots for how that power expresses itself would be evident in the doctrine of
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:03.160]   discovery.
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:09.520]   The assumption is that these battles are an extension of the doctrine of discovery.
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:17.000]   That is, they now go on like an ever playing fugue line in music that undergirds and reassures
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.800]   many that this white normativity is the right track.
[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:29.760]   It is a form of aggressive nostalgia that longs for an earlier, more racially homogeneous,
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:36.480]   less racially diverse, more unquestionably defined and controlled white normativity that
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:41.120]   dominates other so-called intrusive voices.
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:50.440]   I accept Dr. Willie Jennings' argument that being "white" is not strictly about the melatonin
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:57.960]   level of one's skin, but about a heart and mindset that can take captive any person of
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:00.040]   any race.
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:06.360]   Whiteness holds power and the claims and rights of power simply as an expression of the way
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:09.400]   reality has established it.
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:14.720]   This at least is the blindness of whiteness, the presumption and normativity that is so
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:21.400]   damaging to white people and even more to those who are its victims.
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:28.800]   Whiteness is the personalized and social form of the doctrine of discovery, holding internally
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:35.480]   the assumption and assertion that the individual can claim in relationship to others, attitudes
[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:43.800]   of conquest, superiority and dominance, whether it is about owning a gun, wearing a face mask,
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:49.440]   participating in inter-public worship service or anything else.
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:55.520]   I hope all of these themes are ones that you've seen and given evidence to in the American
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:56.520]   press.
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:01.880]   Dominion, then, is our first major problem.
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:07.720]   The second problem that's related to it is the notion of American exceptionalism.
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:13.080]   This as you know has a long tail in the narrative of U.S. history.
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:19.120]   It starts with the writing of a French man of letters, Alexis de Tocqueville, who described
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:26.240]   the United States as "exceptional," as a "new country," and in the convergence of a kind
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:32.080]   of mindset and instincts that would allow it to hold unique power and influence in North
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:35.600]   America and eventually the world.
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:42.440]   One of the deepest assumptions in nationalism is that American nationalism is not only best
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:47.000]   for it, but also best for the world that it wants to influence.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:54.160]   It is endlessly self-admiring and adulating, and it is full of the idolatry of a nation
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:18:00.400]   over any and all other forces, especially outside forces.
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:07.000]   In this model, the phrase "America first" has periodically emerged as the battle cry
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.520]   in relationship to other nations, while the internal dangers and enemies of powers must
[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:16.840]   be limited and opposed as well.
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:22.800]   All this has been an intense resurgent in recent years in the United States, certainly
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:30.560]   since the 1980s, growing in the 1990s, and very powerfully present throughout the 2000s
[00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:38.080]   to date, and it's attached to the Dominion vision that, like Napoleon, simply crowns
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:40.640]   itself emperor.
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:47.640]   America has done that in so many painful and inappropriate and unjust ways.
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:53.560]   When the church adds to it the elements of manifest destiny, that this exceptionalism,
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:19:03.440]   this nationalism, is like America being a new Israel, and in relation to which this
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:10.480]   nation is first and primary in God's and in the church's priorities, it is an extremely
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:18.120]   dangerous collection of idolatries, precisely and passionately held up as the only true
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:20.840]   national worship.
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:27.440]   This creates a perfect closed circle, dressed up in Christian speech, which avoids Christian
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:33.720]   identity and character in matters that are both public, such as the equality of diversity,
[00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:41.320]   peace with justice, structural and personal racism, and in private, such as which voices
[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:49.840]   are heard, which lives and needs are seen, which narratives or stories are actually believed.
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:58.760]   So Dominion, nationalism, and third is individualism.
[00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:05.160]   White evangelicals in the United States seamlessly pair the doctrine of discovery with deep-seated
[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:08.200]   autonomous individualism.
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:15.480]   That is, the individual autonomous self gets to walk through the world like nations did
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:25.400]   under the doctrine of discovery and make claim on peoples and places, jobs, voices, power,
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.400]   influence, and so forth.
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:30.140]   It's a tragic story.
[00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:34.480]   It's one of America's best and worst traits.
[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:42.200]   The best side of this kind of individualism is the way in which it can be attached to
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:49.440]   a sense that individual independent rights are a reflection of being made in the image
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:50.440]   of God.
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:57.280]   They are the center in personal, political, structural, familial, social, and religious
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:59.480]   life in the United States.
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:02.240]   It must be the individual.
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:10.920]   Unlike Ubuntu in Africa, "I am because we are," the American slogan is more nearly,
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:14.920]   "I am because I make myself."
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:21.760]   This means that power is finally personal and that the community, whether in church
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:30.000]   or society at large, are always in third place behind family and tribe.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:37.560]   In the end, the culture in which American evangelical lives and often thrives is on
[00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:44.040]   the grounds that each person and their own will and personality and priorities and values
[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:47.200]   should be placed at the center of everything.
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:54.900]   So much of America's ethical and moral history, even to this day, around issues of human sexuality
[00:21:54.900 --> 00:22:02.240]   and many other things are all reflections of this doctrine of discovery-oriented, racially
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:10.720]   biased, individual-pleasing form of Christian life that plays into a consumerism that's
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:20.640]   measured by the satisfaction of church members and not by wisdom or by faithfulness.
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:28.800]   This kind of distorted ecology of faith and mind, heart and will, to call Jesus "Lord,
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:35.200]   Lord," but completely separated from actually doing the will of God, the inward private
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:43.640]   conversion of a disciple or the response to the altar call to getting saved, is an especially
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:46.200]   white evangelicalism.
[00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:50.920]   The Bible is, of course, clear about the value of the individual and the need for each of
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:54.840]   us in the body of Christ to seek and find God.
[00:22:54.840 --> 00:23:02.640]   But the weight of the scriptures rests on the calling of a people, not just an individual,
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:04.740]   to be God's own people.
[00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:12.240]   And for the call of the ecclesia, that is the called-out community, to be communally
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:19.200]   called out into one new humanity is a sign that we, collectively, not just I, who once
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:27.320]   was dead, have not just been revived, but have actually been made new as evidence through
[00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:32.800]   our living into a new community of unlike.
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:38.160]   The immigrant escape from Europe and many other countries since has infused in the evangelical
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:45.520]   movement in the United States the preference for finding and maintaining your tribe.
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:51.880]   A tribe can, at times, be a melting pot, but that is not the common experience of many.
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:58.000]   Instead, we are a collection of social, racial, and economic tribes, with the white evangelical
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:07.480]   tribe presupposing itself to be always in the lead, the communion that crowns the communion.
[00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:11.480]   That is really the way that it's often organized.
[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:16.520]   I will confess that for me, personally, one of the most painful parts of the history and
[00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:22.080]   influence of Fuller Seminary is the church growth movement.
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:29.880]   In a well-researched and motivated beginning, Donald McGovern, on Fuller's faculty, desired
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:36.680]   to help the gospel reach more of America, not just one by one, but in a larger, broader,
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:39.120]   more communal sense.
[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:43.480]   He knew this meant a gospel that was attuned to context.
[00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:50.220]   This led him to the discovery, sociologically, that people come to faith faster and simpler
[00:24:50.220 --> 00:25:03.440]   if they do not have to cross a cultural threshold and if the gospel is embodied in a contextually
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:08.200]   appealing and recognizable way.
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:13.240]   In some ways, these are not only legitimate, but valuable insights.
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:19.000]   On the other hand, what these insights become is a rationale for what is known as the homogeneous
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:26.720]   unit principle, and what later becomes the marketing motivation for growth through gathering
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:33.320]   simply people who are similar, not gathering people through the lens of a diverse group
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:39.960]   of people with a kingdom vision, a brokenness and remaking that moves from nothing less
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:42.160]   than death to life.
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:49.080]   Instead, we call people to join the church as an accommodation to their social context,
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:56.040]   assuring them that they will find there many who are just like themselves.
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:26:01.960]   What is offered in this way, then, is simply a gospel that is about appeal.
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:09.680]   A warm, positive, life-affirming appeal and a community of people of those who together
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:15.040]   believe that "their needs are being met."
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:19.880]   Conversion comes to mean that we are putting trust in God's eternal hope and having a personal
[00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:26.640]   relationship with Christ that can become nothing more than getting God to give us good gifts
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:33.280]   for our sake and for the sake of others that we know and love.
[00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:40.040]   Poignantly, what is not being offered or discipled into many people's lives is the fundamental
[00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:45.720]   comprehensive revolution of kingdom recreation.
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:53.320]   We take the phrase in Corinthians, "all things being made new," and we attach it to the impact
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:57.600]   of simply saying yes to an affirmation of faith.
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:03.760]   But then that gets cut off from the deep spiritual transformational process by which by word
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:11.080]   and spirit, our minds and our lives are meant to be renewed in order that we may actually
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:21.480]   do, that is, perform, enact, embody the will of God, Romans 12, 1 and 2.
[00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:27.360]   The next factor in this is what I'm calling agency.
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:34.040]   In Matthew 9, we read, "All things are possible to them that love and serve God."
[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:39.500]   This rich but humble affirmation of God's ability to accomplish whatever God may design
[00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:46.600]   through the power of the Holy Spirit can become nothing more than a mantra like rubbing the
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:50.560]   genie lamp at the will of the disciple.
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:56.080]   That becomes the power for the exercise of my own personal agency.
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:28:03.480]   I seek God for the power to do my will, not my will to seek the humility to serve the
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:06.320]   power of God.
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:11.600]   In the name of the unassailable and incomparable power of God, there is a kind of teaching
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:16.640]   about the exercise of faith that is really about the role that one can have in being
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:26.640]   the willful believing agent, hence agency, that can accomplish what the prayer may will,
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:33.520]   as though by prayerful agency, the individual or two or three others can by themselves usher
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:36.320]   in the kingdom of God.
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:42.200]   I would argue that if it is the kingdom of God we are naming, not the kingdom of Christian
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:49.560]   leaders or nations or individuals, then human beings are never the primary agent of that
[00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:50.560]   sentence.
[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:57.400]   The inference in some white American evangelicalism is that human agency, represented by what
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:03.700]   is seen as the "truly faithful," the true believers, can bring forth the manifestation
[00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:05.200]   of God's will and reign.
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:13.400]   It is prayer without doubt, often meaning without humility or self-critique or acknowledged
[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:19.560]   finitude or fundamental bias, that produces blessing.
[00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:25.080]   The best history I know of, of the prosperity gospel as an aside, is written by Kate Bowler
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:29.240]   and is in a book that she has written entitled "Blessed."
[00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:38.080]   She examines and studies firsthand how this agency theme is managed and described by prosperity
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:45.920]   gospels, by prosperity churches and preachers in the United States and beyond.
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:50.960]   Agency in the way that I'm talking about it at the moment is really just a personalized
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:59.520]   form of dominion that is exerting the power of our vision, personality, or desire.
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:04.360]   The important quality of how we have been made in the image of God can be another good
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:09.080]   gift turned into little more than self-interest.
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:13.280]   We are made to exercise agency in the world.
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:18.200]   When we hold it in the way that often has happened, it plays into what I call consumer
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:25.480]   Christianity, in which human agency and desire occupies the private place with the general
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:31.000]   assurance that this is appropriate because God wants to give us, quote, "the desires
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.800]   of our heart," Psalm 37.
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:42.560]   But agency in Israel's life is at the heart of the prophet's critique in Isaiah 58.
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:48.560]   Israel has taken the worship practices of God's people and used them, the prophet says,
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:55.720]   for their own purposes, such that worship ends up being about them and not about God.
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:31:02.320]   No wonder God says this is as if worship, that is, worship that pretends or claims to
[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:09.360]   be about God, as if they were going to actually live in a righteous way.
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:18.280]   But instead of honoring and using their agency to serve Yahweh, in fact, their worship, the
[00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:21.720]   prophet says, is about themselves.
[00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:27.080]   This is a story of agency gone to seed without any fruit.
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:31.780]   The fruit of the Spirit is meant to be productive, and it's meant to be productive that shows
[00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:39.800]   itself in ways far beyond productive agency in the bounty of our own self-interest.
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:52.600]   Instead, the fruit of the Spirit, as you know, love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,
[00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:54.640]   gentleness, and self-control.
[00:31:54.640 --> 00:32:07.900]   So dominion, nationalism, individualism, and agency cannot and do not seek or produce the
[00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:10.600]   fruit of the Spirit.
[00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:19.300]   Those are all elements that by themselves bear the fruit of a lack of faithfulness rather
[00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:22.820]   than an evidence of it.
[00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:39.900]   Another factor for a movement that is founded...
[00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:52.260]   Christianity and evangelicalism is a movement that is founded on the belief that God gives
[00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:55.900]   us the peace that passes understanding.
[00:32:55.900 --> 00:33:04.220]   And yet, fear is a significant feature that motivates American white evangelicalism, particularly
[00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:07.940]   so for its leaders.
[00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:12.580]   There are different fears that correspond to different possible threats.
[00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:17.820]   We could start with theological or doctrinal fear.
[00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:24.860]   Part of a danger of favored status is then the possibility of losing that status.
[00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:31.460]   Fear and anxiety grips a lot of evangelical leaders and pastors who then wonder about
[00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:34.180]   speaking the truth when the stakes are high.
[00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:40.380]   And if they get it wrong or if people don't like what they say, the loss can be aggressive
[00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:43.220]   and destructive.
[00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:49.860]   In some cases, it is built into a self-dependent theology of salvation, as though a person
[00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:54.900]   is really saying, "I am saved by having the right theology."
[00:33:54.900 --> 00:34:00.060]   And that can mean that my salvation is mine to win or lose.
[00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:06.140]   Will I or won't I be saved depends on me, not depending on God and what God has done
[00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:08.900]   in Jesus Christ.
[00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:14.500]   So the issue then becomes, do I have the doctrine right or am I too dangerously close to, quote,
[00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:20.020]   wrong doctrine, wrong belief, wrong communion, wrong practices?
[00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:25.580]   All of those things being things that Jesus himself was accused of.
[00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:31.820]   This kind of an approach to fear is about boundaries, a boundary that is about who is
[00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:38.660]   in the circle versus who and what is outside the boundaries of God's grace.
[00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:43.460]   Setting the boundaries for oneself or one's family or church or denomination or one's
[00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:48.580]   nation and so on means that we are fearful about getting it wrong.
[00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:52.900]   The ever-present need to be sure that we are getting it right, that our people are right,
[00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:57.420]   that our tribe is right, that our church is right, that our denomination is right, that
[00:34:57.420 --> 00:35:00.620]   our seminary is right.
[00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:07.100]   Within one week recently, I received five phone calls from very experienced pastors
[00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:12.060]   who called to talk about the fact that these pressures around fear were going to mean that
[00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:18.180]   they themselves feared that they would be fired and that they would not be able to find
[00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:24.460]   another job because of being judged unacceptable by leaders around them.
[00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:29.660]   Within a couple of weeks of receiving those phone calls myself, three had been fired and
[00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:33.180]   not only fired but then maligned.
[00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:37.460]   This is the evidence of what I'm talking about.
[00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:41.620]   Another category of fear has to do with the ever-present danger of "the world versus
[00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:43.740]   the flesh."
[00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:48.780]   The premise here is that faithful disciples are vulnerable to being consumed or shipwrecked
[00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:52.860]   by the ubiquitous presence of sin and evil in the world.
[00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:57.940]   At any moment, our enemy is seeking someone to devour.
[00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:04.460]   Our disciples need not just the tools of spiritual warfare but the continual readiness for spiritual
[00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:05.460]   battles.
[00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:13.940]   This tends to stimulate in our brains the kind of neurobiology and the moral worry that
[00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:21.500]   makes finding, naming, and embattling enemies an obvious and continuous necessity for many.
[00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:25.940]   History has shown the likelihood of this progression and the historical evidence, not least in
[00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:30.180]   exploding numbers of demonimations in the 20th and 21st century.
[00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:35.580]   In the century of God's greatest wars, the 20th, of the world's greatest wars in the
[00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:41.580]   20th century, it is plain that enemies are real and that the church must be alert and
[00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:42.580]   aggressively self-protective.
[00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:53.100]   It's a fearful posture that ironically pushes away and down the very lost in need of the
[00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:55.140]   evangel.
[00:36:55.140 --> 00:37:02.420]   This fear plays readily to a spiritual fight or flight response, which fear often evokes.
[00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:09.580]   Both a fear of fighting or flight or fleeing, both toward those inside the church and toward
[00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:11.940]   those in culture.
[00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:18.140]   It fosters the likelihood of approaching discipleship as embattlement.
[00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:21.140]   Now clearly the New Testament uses this imagery.
[00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:23.180]   I'm not in any way arguing that.
[00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:29.700]   I'm arguing for the way that it's a dominant theme and for what it is that Christian leadership
[00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:32.860]   should do about that theme.
[00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:39.140]   The first response of fighting takes up the force of various kinds in order to defeat
[00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:40.140]   the opponent.
[00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:48.220]   A recent public example of this was when the Southern Baptist Convention of Seminary Presidents
[00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:57.860]   proposed to rejected and publicly repudiated the academic study that's known as critical
[00:37:57.860 --> 00:37:58.860]   race theory.
[00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:04.580]   This school of thought, critical race theory, attempts to understand the dynamics of racial
[00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:08.140]   justice and oppression.
[00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:12.940]   When the Seminary Presidents of the Southern Baptist Convention condemned critical race
[00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:19.780]   theory, it did so out of a fear that the critique will do damage to the church.
[00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:25.620]   But by condemning critical race theory, they expose at the same moment unintentionally
[00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:32.780]   the underlying fear that the denominations originating racism will be exposed.
[00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:40.460]   Ironically, their condemning action reveals so pointedly that they see CRT, that is critical
[00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:46.780]   race theory, as the real enemy rather than the underlying controlling racism that debilitates
[00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:49.940]   them and their gospel.
[00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:54.820]   By drawing the battle line as these Seminary Presidents did, they fought what they saw
[00:38:54.820 --> 00:39:01.660]   as an enemy, that is a stand-in for the real opponent, maintaining the embattlement profile
[00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:05.700]   that is so important to their theological and cultural sensibility.
[00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:11.780]   And it was done by white male evangelical leaders displaying their power to name and
[00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:17.740]   control their sense of the reality narrative while masking their fear and their denominations
[00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:22.700]   fear of losing their white supremacy.
[00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:27.780]   The chief problem revealed here is what the Apostle Paul says is the fear of the weaker
[00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:28.780]   brother.
[00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:33.660]   The Romney fears what does not need to be feared while failing to fear what deserves
[00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:34.660]   to be feared.
[00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:40.740]   The fears of many American white evangelicals is a set of fears that center on them, on
[00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:46.700]   their perceptions, their social location, their beliefs, their tribal interests, rather
[00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:50.260]   than on what matters most to the kingdom of God.
[00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:56.520]   Is it too much to think of Jesus's words to the Pharisees that they tithe dill and cumin
[00:39:56.520 --> 00:40:03.580]   but avoid the weightier matters of the law, mercy and justice?
[00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:08.660]   Fear management can seem to be one of the defining features of American white evangelicals.
[00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:16.100]   And for many leaders, this is one of their chief preoccupations.
[00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:22.120]   American and leadership are words that many in the United States proudly believe belong
[00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:24.220]   inextricably together.
[00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:30.300]   The American white evangelical church in most of the last half century has tried to assert
[00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:35.700]   its voice in the cultural, legal and yes, political maelstrom that I've been trying
[00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:37.480]   to describe.
[00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:44.580]   American culture has long since been defined by media and secular culture than ever before.
[00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:49.540]   There is a genuine battle to acknowledge and to engage in relation to the controlling influences
[00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:53.940]   shaping children and teens and young adults.
[00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:59.100]   The reasons to fear the implications of a highly influential secularism, an anti-religious
[00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:05.380]   bias, not least in the West and East Coast of the United States.
[00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:10.340]   Now nations around the world have marveled at the pervasive religiosity of the United
[00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:16.620]   States and the high percentage of Americans who believe in God and worship regularly.
[00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:22.660]   The liberty and protections of religious freedom are long established and also continuously
[00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:23.660]   under attack.
[00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:30.740]   What American white evangelicalism has not done is to find a nationally credible, thoughtful
[00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:36.540]   leader practitioner who incarnates and speaks into the public sphere in ways that can capture
[00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:39.780]   the imagination and engage the heart.
[00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:45.220]   I've tried here to suggest factors that I believe contribute to why this perplexity
[00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:52.660]   of leadership has not emerged and perhaps would not even be received as a good idea
[00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:55.780]   or a legitimate hope.
[00:41:55.780 --> 00:42:00.420]   And of course what is needed, far more than a singular voice, is for the church in the
[00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:05.540]   United States to live into its true Christian identity.
[00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:11.580]   Jesus's strategy for disciple making is a new community that lives out its surprising
[00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:13.900]   eclectic diversity.
[00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:21.100]   This servant living communion would dismantle and redefine dominion and nationalism and
[00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:25.300]   individualism and agency and fear.
[00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:31.260]   This kind of Christian community that is so deeply needed would be an authentic, credible
[00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:37.620]   communion that lives as the body of Christ in the world and for the sake of the world.
[00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:43.900]   Not inward turning, but living sacrificially and freely for the sake of the world, especially
[00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:47.100]   the poor and the marginalized.
[00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:52.940]   The American white evangelical crisis is not so much in the sense of theological crisis
[00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:59.780]   as it is a church in crisis over a failure to live out the church's identity as a reflection
[00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:01.460]   of Jesus Christ.
[00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:08.580]   Instead, it has turned out to live as a reflection of the culture in which it is placed.
[00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:15.260]   As simple and plain as that sounds, it is the story of great blessings of life put under
[00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:25.380]   a basket of American first or of salt losing its saltiness for desire instead to conform.
[00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:28.580]   Will that change?
[00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:37.860]   On this day, when the President of the United States has been treated in the way that he
[00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:47.300]   has by Congress in such a legitimate and defensible way, shows the barren fruit of the American
[00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:57.860]   evangelical story being identified more with power, secular, political, social, economic,
[00:43:57.860 --> 00:44:04.140]   cultural power than by the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:11.020]   It's only the latter that is the hope of the world.
[00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:18.220]   Let me pause there and welcome my two respondents.
[00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:19.740]   Thank you, Mark.
[00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:28.180]   Thank you for your very perceptive discussion of leadership, particularly the leadership
[00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:37.100]   of the American white evangelicalism and the churches.
[00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:49.780]   You also outlined quite a few factors which governs or defines our identities as a leader
[00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:51.740]   in the Bible.
[00:44:51.740 --> 00:45:01.620]   I'm particularly impressed by the last point, the fear, the factor of fear that really always
[00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:08.820]   shapes how we behave, how we perform, how we relate to one another.
[00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:09.820]   So thank you very much.
[00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:16.940]   There is a lot of insight into that.
[00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:26.780]   So now may I ask Dr. Jean Lee and Dr. Bernard Wong, our dean and our associate dean, to
[00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:29.380]   come forward to give their response.
[00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:39.820]   I would like to ask Jean first.
[00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:45.420]   Thank you, Professor Levitin, for an insightful portrayal of power and leadership in this
[00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:46.580]   lecture.
[00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:52.180]   In particular, I appreciate the personal and contextual narratives you include in these
[00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:58.100]   lectures, allowing us to integrate theories with reality for a deeper understanding of
[00:45:58.100 --> 00:45:59.420]   the matter.
[00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:05.580]   Indeed, the big man paradigm has been apparent for a long time, and all the more in today's
[00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:06.900]   world.
[00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:12.660]   No matter what the dominant political system is, people do have a natural tendency to look
[00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:15.220]   for heroic leaders.
[00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:20.540]   I lift a narrative of a little lady in a big man's world.
[00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:26.260]   In my late teens and early twenties, I spent nine years in North America, studying and
[00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:28.980]   working in a big man's world.
[00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:35.300]   My first job was in external audit, a profession where you are pushed every year to advance
[00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:37.660]   a grade in the ranks.
[00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:46.020]   So quickly, I found myself a short, non-white, Asian female leading an audit team.
[00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:51.500]   The audit team is tall, handsome-looking, young white males.
[00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:56.620]   I remember once when we walked into a client's office, the client immediately spotted the
[00:46:56.620 --> 00:47:02.780]   leader among us, greeting one of my white male subordinates with a warm handshake.
[00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:08.380]   I still recall how embarrassed the client was when my colleague redirected everyone's
[00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:12.420]   attention to the short Asian female among them.
[00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:16.580]   Indeed, we are framed by our culture and context.
[00:47:16.580 --> 00:47:22.700]   We are bombarded daily with values and expectations that may only be partial truth.
[00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:28.620]   Not only do we need the firm grasp of our identity in Christ, but also continuous vigor
[00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:36.660]   in training for theological instinct that can help us sense the distortions we face.
[00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:41.740]   Professor Levitin pointed out a number of perplexities in the concepts behind leadership
[00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:43.220]   and power.
[00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:51.820]   Dominion, nationalism, individualism, agency concepts, and even fear can quickly become
[00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:56.060]   tools or justifications for power and dominance.
[00:47:56.060 --> 00:48:03.180]   In our context, we face similar compromises and distortions, especially when different
[00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:09.100]   pressure groups may use the same words and phrases to mean different things, twisting
[00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:14.900]   people's minds and thought processes to suit their agenda.
[00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:20.460]   While Christians from the West may appreciate the relational culture in Asian communities,
[00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:27.700]   we know that relationships in Chinese actually translates to guan xi, a term expressing an
[00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:34.900]   obligation of one party to another with a continuing reciprocation of favors in Chinese
[00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:37.020]   business culture.
[00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:43.300]   Such practice also penetrates other walks of life, taking forms of excessive or corrupted
[00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:47.420]   gifting or social exchanges.
[00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:53.520]   The prosperity gospel is another example of faith distortion that presents itself so vividly
[00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:55.340]   in our culture.
[00:48:55.340 --> 00:49:02.280]   Chinese folk religions have long preyed on human desire and a tendency to create a god
[00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:05.980]   to whom one can give gifts in exchange for favors.
[00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:10.260]   Thus, we are very much attracted to Matthew 7, 7.
[00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:12.660]   Ask and it will be given to you.
[00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:14.340]   Seek and you will find.
[00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:17.580]   Knock and the door will be opened to you.
[00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:24.440]   This Bible verse is obviously valuable, only that we tend to stop at ask and be given without
[00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:31.040]   truly seeking and finding God's will and discerning the door that gets opened.
[00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:36.740]   In recent years, Hong Kong society undergoes drastic changes both politically and under
[00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:37.740]   COVID-19.
[00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:44.460]   Adversities and pressures tear us further apart, splitting groups of brothers and sisters,
[00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:49.700]   some down the compromising route, some to fighting in the extremes.
[00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:53.860]   Those taking various middle stances are attacked by both sides.
[00:49:53.860 --> 00:49:59.900]   We no longer see leadership and power in the traditional sense, but rather see these with
[00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:02.740]   a negative feeling of distrust.
[00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:08.340]   We are challenged to go back to the very basic, asking the question, what does the gospel
[00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:13.140]   mean to our culture and the situation we are facing?
[00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:19.660]   All of us are confronted with our own fear, be it spiritual as in the Christian faith
[00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:23.140]   or political in the societal sense.
[00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:27.900]   Under the changing political climate, the people in Hong Kong are influenced by fear
[00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:31.260]   in much deeper ways as never before.
[00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:37.660]   Fight or flight takes on another meaning as individuals and families decide whether
[00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:42.980]   to redomicile abroad under the changing political climate.
[00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:49.620]   Hopefully, this decision process involves spiritual discernment and that the Lord continues
[00:50:49.620 --> 00:50:54.380]   to work in our midst, that our faith be strong wherever we go.
[00:50:54.380 --> 00:51:01.180]   We continue to pray for God's wonder in this special time of drastic change.
[00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:07.260]   The big man paradigm is indeed a sharp contrast to the description of Jesus in Philippians
[00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:09.620]   2, 1 to 8.
[00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:14.020]   The humble leader is a subversive paradigm.
[00:51:14.020 --> 00:51:19.740]   Even here, we encounter the easy distortion of James 4.10 and a few other verses that
[00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:25.980]   says, "Humble yourselves in the presence of the Lord and he will exalt you."
[00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:32.280]   It is our natural tendency to live according to the system of this world so that we can
[00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:35.020]   get exalted or rewarded.
[00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:41.060]   Nevertheless, in discerning the Lord's work during this day and age, we observe the rising
[00:51:41.060 --> 00:51:46.780]   up of a generation of collaborative leaders rather than individual heroes.
[00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:53.580]   The next generation faces an increasingly complex and hostile world, yet they are individually
[00:51:53.580 --> 00:51:57.740]   gifted in various new and creative ways.
[00:51:57.740 --> 00:52:03.360]   Rather than trusting those at power to resolve all the problems, young leaders today rise
[00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:09.380]   to face challenges in their own sphere of influence in many different ways.
[00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:15.420]   There may be limits to what one can do while not in power, but in collaboration and in
[00:52:15.420 --> 00:52:20.620]   discerning God's will in this day and age, there can be no limits to the possibilities
[00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:22.660]   that open up.
[00:52:22.660 --> 00:52:28.060]   Obviously, collaborative leadership also has its limits.
[00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:34.980]   Decisions may be delayed or out of sync, actions may be fragmented, and chaos may result.
[00:52:34.980 --> 00:52:41.060]   Nevertheless, collaboration reminds us to humble ourselves and listen to each other,
[00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:48.120]   to discern God's will in a story that not us, but him is the real hero.
[00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:54.540]   So I stay contented as a little lady in a big man's world, continuing to find my identity
[00:52:54.540 --> 00:53:11.860]   in Christ and to learn to be a faithful follower of Christ.
[00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:15.980]   Thank you, Dr. Labberton, for your very insightful lecture.
[00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:23.660]   Well, I have always thought that USA and Hong Kong are so different that issues the American
[00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:29.140]   Evangelical Church faces have little to do with us.
[00:53:29.140 --> 00:53:36.900]   Unlike USA, Christianity has never been the dominant religion in this part of the world,
[00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:43.360]   and the church has never risen to a position to influence our governments.
[00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:50.460]   Yet your lecture reminds us that we share the same sinful humanity.
[00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:57.960]   Our desire for power, though manifested differently in different contexts, reveals our deep-seated
[00:53:57.960 --> 00:54:02.640]   fear over survival and identity.
[00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:10.300]   Today, I will briefly reflect on how your lecture can shed light on the situation in
[00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:11.300]   Hong Kong.
[00:54:11.300 --> 00:54:19.500]   Dr. Labberton, you said that in European history, the doctrine of discovery is theologically
[00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:29.780]   justified and expansionism and conquest through power, and the land uninhabited by Christians
[00:54:29.780 --> 00:54:37.540]   is assumed undiscovered and must be claimed as part of God's mission in the world.
[00:54:37.540 --> 00:54:44.620]   I find an interesting parallel in a church-planting strategy advocated in Hong Kong.
[00:54:44.620 --> 00:54:54.580]   This strategy says that in a city, if no church exists within a radius of a few hundred meters,
[00:54:54.580 --> 00:54:58.520]   we should plant a church at the center.
[00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:04.260]   This new church will attract enough members to survive.
[00:55:04.260 --> 00:55:10.700]   While this sounds reasonable, it is actually the claiming of territory, not the need of
[00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:14.460]   people that is the motive.
[00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:23.560]   A city area with no church also means no competitors, a condition favorable for church survival.
[00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:30.940]   In fact, this thinking is not unlike the scramble of territories by the European nations during
[00:55:30.940 --> 00:55:33.940]   the colonial era.
[00:55:33.940 --> 00:55:40.020]   While the colonizers wanted to reap resources from the colonies, the church wants to survive
[00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:43.620]   with enough members and dollars.
[00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:51.700]   Besides, successful businesspersons and professions are often invited to give testimonies in individualistic
[00:55:51.700 --> 00:55:54.100]   gatherings.
[00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:59.860]   The assumption is that unbelievers will be attracted to the Christian faith by their
[00:55:59.860 --> 00:56:02.860]   success stories.
[00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:10.260]   While the Hong Kong church does not have much political power, we aspire to economic power,
[00:56:10.260 --> 00:56:15.940]   a power that is very appealing in this financial center of the East.
[00:56:15.940 --> 00:56:25.060]   I must emphasize I'm not against evangelism or church planting, yet our desire for power
[00:56:25.060 --> 00:56:29.380]   can be hidden under our service to Christ.
[00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:34.780]   And the gospel we preach will then be different from that of Christ.
[00:56:34.780 --> 00:56:42.580]   Dr. Labberton, your discussion on fear is very insightful.
[00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:49.620]   I agree with your observation that fear is intricately linked with power.
[00:56:49.620 --> 00:56:58.300]   Our fear of losing things we cherish compels us to use power to hold onto them.
[00:56:58.300 --> 00:57:04.560]   For the American evangelicals, the fear of losing salvation leads them to forge a theology
[00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:09.700]   of correct doctrine, ethics, and even politics.
[00:57:09.700 --> 00:57:17.760]   The fear of losing favored status prompts them to draw boundaries, to identify enemies
[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:22.060]   so as to condemn and destroy them.
[00:57:22.060 --> 00:57:25.660]   The Hong Kong church is indeed different.
[00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:33.860]   We have never had such favored status to hold onto, and we may not fear losing salvation.
[00:57:33.860 --> 00:57:41.820]   But we have other things to cherish, things we use power to hold onto.
[00:57:41.820 --> 00:57:49.700]   My observation is that Hong Kong people in general cherish stability and prosperity.
[00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:57.940]   The desire for a stable society for everyone to prosper economically has been in our DNA
[00:57:57.940 --> 00:58:02.180]   since the second half of the last century.
[00:58:02.180 --> 00:58:09.660]   Before the handover of Hong Kong to China in the 1990s, the slogan "stability and prosperity"
[00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:16.620]   was created to convince Hong Kong people that the handover would be good for the city.
[00:58:16.620 --> 00:58:22.100]   Indeed, the slogan captured the imagination of all.
[00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:27.100]   Naturally, the church picks up this culture.
[00:58:27.100 --> 00:58:32.580]   Hong Kongers understand stability to mean the freedom to gather and do ministry within
[00:58:32.580 --> 00:58:35.660]   the church building.
[00:58:35.660 --> 00:58:42.260]   Prosperity means increase in church membership, budget, ministries, and the planting of more
[00:58:42.260 --> 00:58:44.900]   churches.
[00:58:44.900 --> 00:58:54.580]   The recent political unrest and the pandemic make us fear losing this stability and prosperity.
[00:58:54.580 --> 00:59:01.620]   In fact, we have seen sharp declines in church attendance and donations this past year.
[00:59:01.620 --> 00:59:04.860]   And so our fear is actually not ungrounded.
[00:59:04.860 --> 00:59:11.780]   Well, long-time Christians fear losing the same church ministry or, I would say, church
[00:59:11.780 --> 00:59:17.060]   services that they used to enjoy for years.
[00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:26.780]   Well, as fear is related to power, our response to the current threats reveals how we perceive
[00:59:26.780 --> 00:59:30.540]   and engage with power.
[00:59:30.540 --> 00:59:36.620]   The recent turn of events warns the Hong Kong church that we are under external threats
[00:59:36.620 --> 00:59:44.540]   to speak openly and truthfully, especially against the political power.
[00:59:44.540 --> 00:59:50.820]   To maintain the stability of doing ministries within the confines of the church, some choose
[00:59:50.820 --> 00:59:57.700]   to keep silence in order not to provoke the powerful outside.
[00:59:57.700 --> 01:00:01.860]   Some attempt to appease or even support them.
[01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:08.260]   It is hoped that we can insulate the church from the power outside so as to maintain our
[01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:15.220]   power to control things inside so prosperity can continue.
[01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:23.260]   However, it is not sure whether and for how long this barricade can hold.
[01:00:23.260 --> 01:00:30.060]   Church leaders who opt for this insulation from outside strategy also exercise their
[01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:37.700]   power inside by disallowing preaching or discussion of things political within the walls of the
[01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:39.980]   church.
[01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:49.180]   They argue that political discussion is unspiritual and disrupts church union, and thus the theological
[01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:58.660]   justification for the policy of no politics in church is born.
[01:00:58.660 --> 01:01:05.820]   Out of the fear of to lose internal stability and prosperity, combined with the fear of
[01:01:05.820 --> 01:01:14.300]   external power, a theology of spiritualisation of the Christian faith and the practice of
[01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:19.100]   superficial church harmony results.
[01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:28.300]   However, splitting the inside and the outside of the church also splits the Christian life.
[01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:34.580]   No wonder many Christians, especially the younger ones, ridicule that the church has
[01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:40.900]   become an alternative universe alongside the society.
[01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:48.220]   The church has become irrelevant to society and the Christian faith to individuals.
[01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:59.780]   Dr. Leperton, you correctly named that our problem is the fear of the weaker brother,
[01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:07.140]   who wrongly fears what does not need to be feared while failing to fear what deserves
[01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:09.460]   it.
[01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:17.220]   We ought not to fear losing stability and prosperity, nor to fear the power of this
[01:02:17.220 --> 01:02:19.500]   world.
[01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:28.420]   What we should fear, to quote from your lecture, is the failure to live out the church's identity
[01:02:28.420 --> 01:02:31.300]   as a reflection of Jesus Christ.
[01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:39.700]   I believe the first step to cultivating this fear is a mournful repentance from the wrong
[01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:47.100]   fear that has gripped us all for a long time.
[01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:48.100]   Thank you very much.
[01:02:49.100 --> 01:02:52.100]   [Pause]
[01:02:52.100 --> 01:03:14.100]   Testing, testing.
[01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:21.100]   Hello friends, we come to the most exciting part, it's the Q&A section.
[01:03:21.100 --> 01:03:27.100]   I encourage you to post your questions on our website in the live stream page.
[01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:31.780]   All you need is just to scroll down the webpage.
[01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:38.380]   Underneath the live stream page in the Putonghua part, there is the Q&A section.
[01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:45.860]   You need to fill in your name and then you can proceed with posting your question there.
[01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:54.380]   Your question could direct to Mark and also to Jean or Bernard individually or all three
[01:03:54.380 --> 01:03:57.140]   of them.
[01:03:57.140 --> 01:04:05.100]   We have around 45 minutes for this part, but we can see how it goes.
[01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:10.020]   As the chairperson, I would like to take the opportunity to ask the first question, Mark,
[01:04:10.020 --> 01:04:11.020]   a question for you.
[01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:14.500]   This is a person I would like to ask you.
[01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:25.900]   You know, the last few days you are very unique in how you describe the phenomenon of the
[01:04:25.900 --> 01:04:30.060]   white evangelism in America.
[01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:38.860]   And particularly sharp is that you have a very, an approach of self-critiquing.
[01:04:38.860 --> 01:04:45.140]   And this morning you even come a step further, you would even critique your college, your
[01:04:45.140 --> 01:04:49.540]   full professor, Donald McIver.
[01:04:49.540 --> 01:05:00.900]   Now, yes, I think he had a very innovative idea with noble intention to reach out to
[01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:02.540]   people with the gospel.
[01:05:02.540 --> 01:05:11.060]   But unfortunately, this developed into a theory of a homogeneous uni principle and eventually
[01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:20.060]   have been used as marketing scheme or tactic or even deprived the kingdom vision.
[01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:25.380]   So it's sad to see that, right?
[01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:31.700]   I'm just thinking as a church leader, as a pastor or even theologian, what lesson we
[01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:34.240]   can learn from that?
[01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:36.620]   We have good intention.
[01:05:36.620 --> 01:05:46.300]   We mean good to do something, to set up certain policy or draft a theory, but eventually turned
[01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:47.980]   out nasty.
[01:05:47.980 --> 01:05:50.420]   What lesson we can learn from that?
[01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:51.420]   Thank you.
[01:05:51.420 --> 01:05:52.780]   Yes, thank you very much.
[01:05:52.780 --> 01:06:00.100]   I appreciate you coming back to that point because I think Donald McIver himself was
[01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:06.580]   making more of an academic observation and it got turned into, as you say, a pragmatic
[01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:10.540]   strategy for church growth and a marketing approach.
[01:06:10.540 --> 01:06:16.900]   And in that process, it built a church on very inadequate foundations.
[01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:20.540]   So I think there are many things to learn.
[01:06:20.540 --> 01:06:25.820]   First to give thanks that God can use even those, I think, misguided purposes to sometimes
[01:06:25.820 --> 01:06:30.020]   call many, many people as has happened around the world to faith in Christ.
[01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:35.260]   So I'm not denying that God can use such misguidedness.
[01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:39.500]   It's the only reason I can even open my mouth on a given day is that God is willing and
[01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:44.500]   able to use misguidedness, which I probably exemplify more often than I would ever want
[01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:45.820]   to imagine.
[01:06:45.820 --> 01:06:49.220]   So I want to genuinely claim that.
[01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:53.340]   At the same time, I think other lessons would include things like this.
[01:06:53.340 --> 01:06:58.020]   I think in that case, what got married together that didn't and shouldn't have been married
[01:06:58.020 --> 01:07:04.020]   together was really pragmatism with blessing.
[01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:08.020]   The assumption was that what worked is a sign of God's blessing.
[01:07:08.020 --> 01:07:12.820]   Well, all kinds of things work to bring about various results, but they may or may not be
[01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:19.060]   the evidence of the fruit of the Spirit, which is what I was trying to indicate.
[01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:25.660]   So what shows up and what then gets talked about is which church is the biggest church.
[01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:30.820]   Can any of us imagine that Jesus would ever be interested in that question?
[01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:37.300]   That he would ever have wandered around Palestine, as it were, and said, "I wonder which collection
[01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:39.980]   of disciples are going to be the most numerous."
[01:07:39.980 --> 01:07:44.140]   That's just an utterly preposterous idea.
[01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:47.740]   But in American culture, pragmatism is a very, very strong influence.
[01:07:47.740 --> 01:07:51.900]   And the assumption is if it works, then it must be that God's in it.
[01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:59.460]   Now, in fairness, as we all know, in the wisdom tradition of both the Hebrew Scriptures and
[01:07:59.460 --> 01:08:04.900]   the New Testament, there's a very strong correlation that if you do good, good will happen to you.
[01:08:04.900 --> 01:08:06.940]   If you do bad, bad will happen to you.
[01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:13.780]   And some pragmatism is built out of an assumption that the laws of the reality of the world
[01:08:13.780 --> 01:08:20.660]   around us can give us clues to how to best live and practice our lives.
[01:08:20.660 --> 01:08:24.560]   So for some, that would be seen as a form of wisdom.
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:30.100]   But what it lacked, I think, in that case was any degree of self-critique.
[01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:35.340]   And I happen to know that there were a number of attempts to try to call that pragmatism
[01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:41.820]   into question by international voices who came to Donald McGavern and Pete Wagner and
[01:08:41.820 --> 01:08:46.300]   people like that and said, "This is not a kingdom vision.
[01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:48.660]   This is an American vision of the church.
[01:08:48.660 --> 01:08:56.060]   This is about a kind of practical marketing strategy that at its core is not witnessing
[01:08:56.060 --> 01:09:03.380]   to the faithfulness and call of God in people's lives and in various cultural settings."
[01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:10.140]   That was unable to be heard, and obviously it went on and became a global phenomenon
[01:09:10.140 --> 01:09:14.660]   with which Fuller is still very closely tied.
[01:09:14.660 --> 01:09:20.060]   And sometimes, especially in international settings, I will have spoken and someone will
[01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:28.500]   come up to me and say, "So are you Fuller or is church growth Fuller?"
[01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:33.860]   And I say, "Well, church growth is part of Fuller's history.
[01:09:33.860 --> 01:09:38.540]   I'd like to think that I'm trying to do a faithful job of representing the Fuller of
[01:09:38.540 --> 01:09:39.540]   today."
[01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:47.340]   And those two things touch, have overlapping areas, but we are starkly different.
[01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:52.500]   So I think the lessons, to come back to your originating question, the lessons that had
[01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:55.260]   to be asked were, what's really happening here?
[01:09:55.260 --> 01:09:58.500]   What are the hidden and unrecognized assumptions?
[01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:03.940]   How do we listen to a wide and diverse body of Christ to critique an idea that may be,
[01:10:03.940 --> 01:10:10.540]   quote, "wise within one culture," but be bankrupt in other cultural settings?
[01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:12.820]   And how do we let that actually make a claim?
[01:10:12.820 --> 01:10:19.580]   So in a certain way, I would say, with all due respect to Pete Wagner and to Donald McGovern,
[01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:25.700]   especially to Pete Wagner, who I'm critiquing more than I am Donald McGovern, I would say
[01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:28.340]   it was an example of white normativity.
[01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:35.020]   I sat in some of those meetings where Pete Wagner was receiving the critique of international
[01:10:35.020 --> 01:10:37.700]   voices saying, "This isn't Americanism.
[01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:41.460]   This is not a gospel kind of approach."
[01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:45.780]   And he basically just said, "Well, let me give you more numbers.
[01:10:45.780 --> 01:10:48.820]   Let me give you more evidence that, quote, 'it works.'"
[01:10:48.820 --> 01:10:53.820]   And he was unwilling to be critiqued by people whose voices were out of different cultural
[01:10:53.820 --> 01:11:00.100]   contexts, different theological frames, and he just more or less refused to listen or
[01:11:00.100 --> 01:11:02.580]   hear or respond to the change.
[01:11:02.580 --> 01:11:06.700]   Now that would be an example to me of a very significant learning.
[01:11:06.700 --> 01:11:11.620]   If we're going to be faithful in the complex challenges of today, we have to listen to
[01:11:11.620 --> 01:11:12.700]   the context that we're in.
[01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:14.180]   Of course we do.
[01:11:14.180 --> 01:11:21.340]   But we also have to listen to voices inside that context and beyond it that are going
[01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:27.320]   to complicate our story and have to cause us to do deeper reflection and consideration.
[01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:30.380]   So let me come back to one final point about this.
[01:11:30.380 --> 01:11:37.060]   When African Americans in America heard about the homogeneous unit principle, it felt like
[01:11:37.060 --> 01:11:43.540]   a rationalization and further defense against the separation of races in the United States.
[01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:48.800]   And a lot of the Southern churches that became Southern megachurches were churches built
[01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:55.100]   on the homogeneous unit principle, which was really a form of social segregation that was
[01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:59.780]   built into the assumption of how the church should be founded and what will enable it
[01:11:59.780 --> 01:12:01.060]   to grow.
[01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:07.180]   So the issues of social justice related to African Americans, for example, in the South
[01:12:07.180 --> 01:12:11.620]   or elsewhere, but certainly in the South, was completely disregarded in the name of
[01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:16.980]   the pragmatism of churches that can grow.
[01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:19.000]   Thank you.
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:24.080]   Gina Burn, I would like to have a following discussion with this.
[01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:25.080]   Yes.
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:26.080]   Please.
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:33.200]   I think this is a very relevant and very important reminder for the Hong Kong churches is that
[01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:40.680]   we have a tendency to sort of copy the "success" of the American churches.
[01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:46.320]   And when we count our blessings, we count the numbers and we count the resources that
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:52.120]   we receive, but not the fruits that we bear or the people among us.
[01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:58.720]   So this is a very, very good reminder that we have to, in our context, discern and not
[01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:02.400]   be copycats of the big churches.
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:03.400]   Okay.
[01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:04.400]   Bernard?
[01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:12.120]   Yeah, I'd just like to add something is that we tend to focus on the results of evangelism,
[01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:16.440]   which means more Christians coming to church and things like that.
[01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:25.720]   But recently I heard some very good opinion saying that actually the way we try to convert
[01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:32.640]   people into Christianity is even more important than the result itself, saying that we sometimes
[01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:40.440]   use some way of prosperity gospel or some way to achieve quick results, but along the
[01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:48.040]   way we turn off a lot of people who fail to believe in the gospel that we try to preach.
[01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:54.040]   And that negative result is actually doing the gospel damage.
[01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:59.600]   So we have to be really careful about how we preach it, because how we preach it actually
[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:02.400]   embodies the gospel itself.
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:04.560]   So I believe there's something to add here.
[01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:05.560]   Absolutely.
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:10.880]   And another dimension of that, a very point that's so important, and I appreciate what
[01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:16.760]   both of you have said, is that in that process, we forget why are we trying to convert people?
[01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:19.000]   Why do we want them to become Christians?
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:20.840]   Is it just to say they're Christians?
[01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:23.440]   Well that surely is not the motivation.
[01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:27.840]   And it can't be just for an eternal purpose either.
[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:33.200]   Jesus is calling us to be living disciples, embodiments, evidences.
[01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:39.000]   The church is meant to be the primary evidence, the chief apologetic for why the gospel is
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:40.000]   trustworthy.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:43.160]   See how the church lives and loves.
[01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:49.000]   And when we fail to do that, because we fail to disciple people, then we fail again, twice.
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.060]   We fail to preach the true gospel.
[01:14:51.060 --> 01:14:53.800]   We fail to convert people out of the right vision.
[01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:56.880]   And then they, of course, fail to live that vision.
[01:14:56.880 --> 01:14:57.880]   What could be less surprising?
[01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:02.040]   I mean, it's the definition of insanity, of just doing the same thing over and over again
[01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:04.440]   and trying to hope for different results.
[01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:13.360]   Yeah, I think ironically, the American church also take a lead in this sense.
[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:20.040]   What was happening in America is happening in Hong Kong, and I think all over the world.
[01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:26.680]   So I think just now what we share is really important.
[01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:31.400]   We have a question from the audience.
[01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:38.720]   This question is from yesterday, but relevant to today's lecture.
[01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:49.520]   It says, "Mark, please comment on the phenomenon of the rise and fall of televangelism in the
[01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:50.520]   U.S.
[01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:51.520]   The televangelism."
[01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:57.800]   Well, televangelism arises out of a confluence of several things.
[01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:05.640]   It arises out of the pragmatism of technology, allowing technology to deliver preachers primarily,
[01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:10.200]   initially, to audiences wherever they might be reached.
[01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:18.360]   The second thing is the pragmatism of a kind of fundamentalism that believed that if you
[01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:23.920]   could just say the right words in front of people and get them to say yes to your words,
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:27.680]   that you were doing gospel ministry.
[01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:34.760]   As we know, there can be an incidence, an overlap there, but there's not a synonymousness
[01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:36.520]   between those two things.
[01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:41.040]   I could get people to say yes to my words, but be completely disconnected to the meaning
[01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:43.280]   or reality of the words.
[01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:51.240]   And again, in the distance of telecommunication, people might write in and send checks and
[01:16:51.240 --> 01:17:02.960]   ask for prayer, but often their lives are wildly distant from the gospel itself.
[01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:04.080]   So that would be another reason.
[01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:11.840]   I think another reason is the overconfidence, especially in white evangelicalism, that words
[01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:13.960]   are more important than actions.
[01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:20.840]   So I think the fact that especially Protestantism in general and American white Protestantism
[01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:29.120]   especially I think has given primacy of place to language and to public speakers who are,
[01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:36.160]   let's say, tall, white, educated males, that sort of a model, the big man that I was describing.
[01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:40.920]   And on television, it's a dominance of words, right?
[01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:43.480]   It's not loving relationships.
[01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:50.240]   It's not challenging difficult evidences of how to love one another when you're facing
[01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:51.960]   pain or disagreement.
[01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:58.920]   Instead, it's literally a program, a show that is being produced to elicit a certain
[01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:04.040]   effect and speech is more important than action.
[01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:11.240]   So if a person echoes back my speech and says, "Yes, I affirm what you just said," then
[01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:15.560]   that's considered a closed loop of communication success.
[01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:21.480]   But in Jesus's mind, it's why he gives the warning at the end of the Sermon on the Mount.
[01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:28.520]   Don't build your house on rock and think you've done that when in fact you've built on sand.
[01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:32.480]   And the difference between building your house on rock and sand is not whether you can name
[01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:34.800]   the difference between rock and sand.
[01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:39.200]   It's whether you live what you've said.
[01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:43.160]   That's what evidences that you have built your house on rock.
[01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:47.640]   And the rise of televangelism extricates that completely.
[01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:50.320]   It just makes it irrelevant, honestly.
[01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:56.520]   It's just the feedback loop of the television screen, the entertainment, the satisfied consumers,
[01:18:56.520 --> 01:18:58.960]   the sending in of checks, et cetera.
[01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:06.600]   And its implications are literally unseen, unpracticed, and so forth.
[01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:09.640]   I hope that makes sense.
[01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:11.680]   There's so much to say about that subject.
[01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:12.680]   Okay.
[01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:15.480]   Any more comment on this?
[01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:16.480]   Okay.
[01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:20.240]   So, Mark, another question for you.
[01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:21.880]   Yes.
[01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:25.480]   Self-criticism is crucial for church.
[01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:30.640]   And thank you for your self-destruction of dominion and nationalism.
[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:40.080]   However, if white America embraced this self-criticism and not seeing the true influence of the whole
[01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:43.080]   world, what will happen?
[01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:49.280]   Well, it's a very sober question.
[01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:57.880]   I think the Christian language for self-criticism would be words like confession and repentance
[01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:00.840]   and lament.
[01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:06.880]   And if the church, if any expression of the church, is unwilling to do those things, which
[01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:14.400]   are so basic to a grounded, truth-telling, spiritual life, then I don't think we're interested
[01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:21.800]   in actually being the church, in which case it can and should die.
[01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:25.200]   I think it is as pragmatic as that.
[01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:31.080]   Here I'm using pragmatic to say it's as consequential, it's as natural as that.
[01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:39.360]   A church that's not going to tell the truth about itself confessionally, lamentingly,
[01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:45.240]   is not a church that is interested in being changed into the likeness of Jesus Christ.
[01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:50.960]   And then we just become a social movement that does whatever that group of people decides
[01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:54.360]   to do, and they may decide to do it in the name of Jesus.
[01:20:54.360 --> 01:21:00.440]   But if they don't actually live the gospel, then as Jesus says, it will be a story of
[01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:05.040]   building on sand and not on rock.
[01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:09.680]   And in time, that sand will be the end of our story.
[01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:15.960]   So I think there's something really quite tellingly critical about the moment that we're
[01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:16.960]   in.
[01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:17.960]   I'm not trying to be an alarmist.
[01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:26.720]   I actually really think there is a crisis of a first-order kind in the American evangelical
[01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:27.800]   church.
[01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:33.240]   And while it's perhaps true of other churches and other times and places, I'm not being
[01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:40.680]   asked to talk about that, so I'm just talking about the white American evangelical reality.
[01:21:40.680 --> 01:21:46.480]   I wonder if either of the people who are respondents want to engage in what I just said.
[01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:48.520]   I would be eager to hear if they do.
[01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:51.120]   I think Bernard would like to say a few words.
[01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:52.120]   Yeah, thank you.
[01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:57.600]   Well, actually, when I read the question, I would approach it this way.
[01:21:57.600 --> 01:22:05.720]   It seems that the person asking the question is thinking that if a person is self-critical,
[01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:11.320]   then she could not become influential in the world.
[01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:15.480]   But I think this is kind of dualistic thinking.
[01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:21.960]   It's that if I am true, then I have to bring you the truth and you have to listen to whatever
[01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:23.360]   I say.
[01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:29.360]   And I believe this is the exceptionalism or the wrong kind of God's mission.
[01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:34.120]   I mean, one kind of evangelism that we are bringing into the world.
[01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:43.480]   I would try to imagine Christians doing evangelism this way, saying that we are actually truth
[01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:47.480]   seekers along the way to seek God.
[01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:54.280]   And for those people who are not yet believers, let's seek God together.
[01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:55.280]   We can together.
[01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:59.480]   We are fellow human beings seeking truth together.
[01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:05.080]   So I think for myself, it is kind of like a thinking that can overcome this kind of
[01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:07.560]   dualistic, I have the truth and you don't.
[01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:08.560]   This kind of thinking.
[01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:10.560]   Yes, that's very helpful.
[01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:12.600]   Thank you.
[01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:18.520]   I think authenticity, being true to one another and that we pull together, and that would
[01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:23.320]   really help us to take one more step forward.
[01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:24.880]   All right.
[01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:30.720]   So Mark, another question for you.
[01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:38.320]   In today's world, global competition has made nationalism an urgent and controversial ideological
[01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:40.100]   issue.
[01:23:40.100 --> 01:23:48.200]   How can the American white church teach a healthy patriotism, or that means a love and
[01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:54.640]   a passion for your own nation, and celebration of our ethnic identity?
[01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:59.800]   Yes, I think it's a really wonderful question.
[01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:06.300]   And I think it's a project that has been going on in parts of white evangelicalism in America
[01:24:06.300 --> 01:24:07.900]   all along.
[01:24:07.900 --> 01:24:13.040]   People who are clear that we are right to love and want to serve our nation in various
[01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:14.040]   ways.
[01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:20.700]   What we don't have to do is turn our nation into an idol or anything even remotely like
[01:24:20.700 --> 01:24:26.680]   that and give it undue allegiance and deference and power in our lives.
[01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:32.900]   That's when it turns into nationalism, especially when that characterization then makes it supreme
[01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:35.560]   over any and all other nations.
[01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:43.000]   So to my embarrassment as an American, often American patriotism, which is the healthy
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:48.000]   form of the way that we might relate to our nation, has been turned into American nationalism,
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.000]   as you know.
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:54.100]   And you end up having these outlandish statements that are made that America is the greatest
[01:24:54.100 --> 01:24:56.580]   country in the world and blah, blah, blah.
[01:24:56.580 --> 01:25:02.420]   All of this kind of narcissism within an American culture.
[01:25:02.420 --> 01:25:05.180]   That I think needs to be replaced.
[01:25:05.180 --> 01:25:08.380]   It needs to be undone and destroyed, frankly.
[01:25:08.380 --> 01:25:15.020]   And then it needs to be replaced, as that happens, with a very different sense of devotion,
[01:25:15.020 --> 01:25:17.500]   a genuine, deep love.
[01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:25.980]   I sometimes wonder if the proclivity to move from patriotism to nationalism is driven by
[01:25:25.980 --> 01:25:32.740]   an unwillingness to love and instead to enter into false worship.
[01:25:32.740 --> 01:25:38.020]   And if we're given to false worship, then we're going to be prone to something like
[01:25:38.020 --> 01:25:39.020]   nationalism.
[01:25:39.020 --> 01:25:44.200]   If we're given, giving ourselves to the task of genuine love, servant love, especially
[01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:50.620]   as Jesus has exemplified it and taught it, then it calls us to a different way of seeing
[01:25:50.620 --> 01:25:57.820]   our neighbor, a different way of listening, a different way of understanding and empathizing
[01:25:57.820 --> 01:25:58.820]   with other people.
[01:25:58.820 --> 01:26:01.840]   Let me give an example.
[01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:09.460]   In Canada, there was an educator of grade school aged children who became aware of increasing
[01:26:09.460 --> 01:26:12.420]   violence in schools.
[01:26:12.420 --> 01:26:18.840]   And she became convinced that part of what it was about was a lack of empathy.
[01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:24.820]   That as families were busier and as parents were both working and so forth, empathy taught
[01:26:24.820 --> 01:26:28.320]   in the home was lacking.
[01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:31.620]   So she developed a curriculum, which is very, very interesting.
[01:26:31.620 --> 01:26:36.580]   It's a curriculum when a child is about 10 years old or so.
[01:26:36.580 --> 01:26:42.580]   And for the course of that school year, one part of the curriculum is that a newborn baby
[01:26:42.580 --> 01:26:46.420]   is brought into the classroom at the beginning of the school year.
[01:26:46.420 --> 01:26:51.580]   And that baby is going to be a recurrent visitor to the classroom over the course of the whole
[01:26:51.580 --> 01:26:52.960]   school year.
[01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:58.740]   And she's written a curriculum about how we pay attention to the baby in the classroom.
[01:26:58.740 --> 01:26:59.740]   What are they doing?
[01:26:59.740 --> 01:27:00.740]   What do they seem to be learning?
[01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:02.260]   What are they responding to?
[01:27:02.260 --> 01:27:04.900]   How might they be feeling, etc.?
[01:27:04.900 --> 01:27:10.740]   But she would say in retrospect, after double blind tests have been done on the high degree
[01:27:10.740 --> 01:27:17.140]   of effectiveness of this curriculum, the surprising part has been that as she had imagined, but
[01:27:17.140 --> 01:27:22.500]   not shown before, the great formation influence is not what happens when the baby is in the
[01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:23.660]   room.
[01:27:23.660 --> 01:27:26.420]   It's what happens when the baby is not in the room.
[01:27:26.420 --> 01:27:32.700]   And they are, as a class or as individual students, meant to write or think or talk
[01:27:32.700 --> 01:27:39.820]   about the baby as though they were projecting themselves into the baby's life and trying
[01:27:39.820 --> 01:27:45.180]   to imagine based on what the baby was like the last time they saw the baby, what might
[01:27:45.180 --> 01:27:50.220]   the baby be thinking or feeling at this time of the day in the light of these particular
[01:27:50.220 --> 01:27:51.220]   circumstances?
[01:27:51.220 --> 01:27:56.260]   Just imagine the baby is fussy, whatever the issues might be.
[01:27:56.260 --> 01:27:59.940]   And in the long-term studies that have now been done, this has been in place for about
[01:27:59.940 --> 01:28:05.340]   20 years in Canadian schools, one of the most amazing things is just the high, high, high
[01:28:05.340 --> 01:28:11.660]   rate of children that have gone through this curriculum having very high sustained empathy
[01:28:11.660 --> 01:28:18.020]   and others that have not gone through the curriculum having much lower levels of empathy.
[01:28:18.020 --> 01:28:24.700]   So my point back to the question about nationalism and patriotism is that I just wonder if healthy
[01:28:24.700 --> 01:28:32.820]   patriotism is built really out of a culture of empathy, of compassion and mercy and justice,
[01:28:32.820 --> 01:28:38.580]   not out of pride and arrogance and power.
[01:28:38.580 --> 01:28:42.780]   Now I know that that can sound very idealistic.
[01:28:42.780 --> 01:28:45.660]   I'm not unaware of that at all.
[01:28:45.660 --> 01:28:50.620]   I'm just saying that from a Christian point of view, I think one is much more likely to
[01:28:50.620 --> 01:28:57.300]   produce healthy patriotism and much less likely to produce this kind of fierce nationalism.
[01:28:57.300 --> 01:28:58.300]   Thank you.
[01:28:58.300 --> 01:29:01.300]   No more comment, right?
[01:29:01.300 --> 01:29:02.900]   Okay.
[01:29:02.900 --> 01:29:08.860]   Just now you mentioned about, in your lecture, you mentioned about melting pot.
[01:29:08.860 --> 01:29:16.740]   We have a question that could you give us some practical suggestions for forming a diversified
[01:29:16.740 --> 01:29:21.460]   community within the church without it becoming a melting pot?
[01:29:21.460 --> 01:29:24.020]   But we'll say it.
[01:29:24.020 --> 01:29:25.020]   Right.
[01:29:25.020 --> 01:29:30.540]   Well, I developed something at the churches that I have served that I also developed when
[01:29:30.540 --> 01:29:33.540]   I came to join the faculty at Fuller.
[01:29:33.540 --> 01:29:39.220]   At Fuller, it took a particular form, which is something that we call MICA groups, which
[01:29:39.220 --> 01:29:46.540]   are groups of different kinds of people, different backgrounds, different races, different denominations,
[01:29:46.540 --> 01:29:53.420]   who gather together and spend two years in a small group discussing content, which is
[01:29:53.420 --> 01:29:56.980]   surrounding the issues of the convergence of worship, preaching and justice in this
[01:29:56.980 --> 01:30:02.780]   case, where everyone literally brings a different point of view.
[01:30:02.780 --> 01:30:07.740]   And you're invited into this group and you're invited to bring what you might hold in common
[01:30:07.740 --> 01:30:13.540]   and you're invited to bring what you may hold as differences.
[01:30:13.540 --> 01:30:20.380]   And that is actually the value of the group, is to practice conversations, sustained conversation
[01:30:20.380 --> 01:30:26.460]   with people who are not like us around issues that really matter.
[01:30:26.460 --> 01:30:32.700]   Often small groups are built with people who, again, choose largely homogeneous gatherings.
[01:30:32.700 --> 01:30:37.820]   But these groups are built around this different kind of social context.
[01:30:37.820 --> 01:30:43.540]   I have to say it's been a very gratifying and joyful thing to see the way that these
[01:30:43.540 --> 01:30:45.060]   groups have developed.
[01:30:45.060 --> 01:30:51.460]   And I think that a parallel model happening in a local church could really happen, not
[01:30:51.460 --> 01:30:52.960]   because you're there to debate.
[01:30:52.960 --> 01:30:53.960]   We're not there to debate.
[01:30:53.960 --> 01:30:59.060]   We're there to actually talk about the subjects that are part of the curriculum that the group
[01:30:59.060 --> 01:31:00.660]   is going through.
[01:31:00.660 --> 01:31:03.180]   But naturally debates arise.
[01:31:03.180 --> 01:31:08.040]   And the commitment as you join the group is, I will choose to stay in this conversation
[01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:14.220]   with these people for two years, not just for as long as it's happy and easy for me,
[01:31:14.220 --> 01:31:18.140]   but I will agree to be part of the group for a two year period.
[01:31:18.140 --> 01:31:23.580]   I'm going to submit myself to that as a spiritual discipline and let the differences then allow
[01:31:23.580 --> 01:31:26.900]   us to learn from one another and get beyond our own categories.
[01:31:26.900 --> 01:31:34.060]   Mark, I envy your full experience.
[01:31:34.060 --> 01:31:44.140]   Anything we can do from our CGST community?
[01:31:44.140 --> 01:31:46.500]   I guess you're looking at our responses.
[01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:51.780]   Because we have a dean and associate dean here.
[01:31:51.780 --> 01:32:00.300]   It is a very good, I would say it is a noble goal and we like to strive towards that.
[01:32:00.300 --> 01:32:06.660]   And we always struggle between how homogenous and how diverse we can be.
[01:32:06.660 --> 01:32:16.180]   Say for example, we hope that our assembly can be more diverse, but because we all have
[01:32:16.180 --> 01:32:23.860]   some sort of image to project to outside, and so we kind of naturally attract like-minded
[01:32:23.860 --> 01:32:24.860]   people together.
[01:32:24.860 --> 01:32:31.740]   Of course we want to be diverse, but so that is also, that is the struggle.
[01:32:31.740 --> 01:32:38.100]   And the other struggle we have, I believe in Hong Kong churches right now is that people
[01:32:38.100 --> 01:32:46.660]   tend not to have this desire to come together with different people because those meetings
[01:32:46.660 --> 01:32:56.540]   tend to be very emotionally, psychologically draining and it's very tiring to do it.
[01:32:56.540 --> 01:33:02.860]   And so I would, I'm reluctant to offer any advice on that, but the reality is that it
[01:33:02.860 --> 01:33:06.460]   is very difficult to do.
[01:33:06.460 --> 01:33:10.380]   So yeah, so that is what it would be.
[01:33:10.380 --> 01:33:20.300]   Well I think at CJST we always value, our core value is to have an open mind and to
[01:33:20.300 --> 01:33:22.680]   be open to whatever we encounter.
[01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:29.740]   But I think it's a human's natural tendency to form a homogenous community and to stay
[01:33:29.740 --> 01:33:31.420]   comfortable there.
[01:33:31.420 --> 01:33:40.740]   So yes, I think whether it's churches or seminary, we really need to be open and to
[01:33:40.740 --> 01:33:42.460]   encounter different people.
[01:33:42.460 --> 01:33:50.180]   And it's paradoxical because only then you become more human and you expand your scope
[01:33:50.180 --> 01:33:57.540]   and to learn to love and to appreciate different things in life.
[01:33:57.540 --> 01:33:59.220]   Thank you, thank you.
[01:33:59.220 --> 01:34:03.300]   I think we have a lot of things to learn from that.
[01:34:03.300 --> 01:34:11.180]   Mark, just now you mentioned the term CRT, the critical race theory.
[01:34:11.180 --> 01:34:16.620]   I must confess that many Hong Kong people are not familiar with that concept.
[01:34:16.620 --> 01:34:23.500]   In fact someone asked here, could you explain what exactly is that theory and what's the
[01:34:23.500 --> 01:34:33.100]   background and what is the incident in this Southwestern practice convention?
[01:34:33.100 --> 01:34:36.340]   Yeah, please.
[01:34:36.340 --> 01:34:43.820]   Well it was born really in the late 20th century in America and it was a theory that is often
[01:34:43.820 --> 01:34:51.740]   attached to people like James Cone, but not only James Cone, who looked at the theological
[01:34:51.740 --> 01:34:58.140]   paradigms and made what now seems like very obvious observations that were beginning to
[01:34:58.140 --> 01:35:00.460]   emerge by the middle part of the 20th century.
[01:35:00.460 --> 01:35:08.740]   That is that our theology claims to be neutral culturally, but in fact it's always contextualized
[01:35:08.740 --> 01:35:14.020]   and that we can't really claim to understand anything without an understanding of context.
[01:35:14.020 --> 01:35:19.300]   And this is where hyphenated theologies begin to arise like "African American Christianity"
[01:35:19.300 --> 01:35:27.420]   or "Asian American Christianity" or "Black Theology," "Feminist Theology," "Queer Theology,"
[01:35:27.420 --> 01:35:28.580]   etc.
[01:35:28.580 --> 01:35:34.700]   And so the issue becomes what are the underpinnings of our understanding of these categories theologically
[01:35:34.700 --> 01:35:38.180]   and how do we critically evaluate them?
[01:35:38.180 --> 01:35:44.240]   Now they get intertwined with postmodern critical theory.
[01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:54.500]   So you have the critical theory that's gaining ascendancy in the 70s and 80s in Europe and
[01:35:54.500 --> 01:35:57.460]   in the United States for sure.
[01:35:57.460 --> 01:36:02.580]   And it's basically a critical theory as it was understood at the time that's represented
[01:36:02.580 --> 01:36:08.820]   by Jacques Derrida or Michel Foucault or other such people, is that basically there is no
[01:36:08.820 --> 01:36:16.020]   absolute of almost anything and that really what we have fundamentally is a complete relativistic
[01:36:16.020 --> 01:36:18.440]   world.
[01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:23.820]   And in that way, I would argue that they are arguing philosophically for something that
[01:36:23.820 --> 01:36:30.100]   I as a Christian would not be able to embrace at the level that they do, though I have learned
[01:36:30.100 --> 01:36:35.380]   a great deal about race from critical race theory.
[01:36:35.380 --> 01:36:41.820]   So that is swirling around and for people on the left politically, they would often,
[01:36:41.820 --> 01:36:48.420]   especially people of color, would often see critical race theory as like in the same way
[01:36:48.420 --> 01:36:57.540]   that Marxism was often very helpful in understanding the nature and plight of the worker, for example.
[01:36:57.540 --> 01:37:05.140]   They would say this is really a great set of tools to be able to dismantle white normativity,
[01:37:05.140 --> 01:37:08.340]   for example.
[01:37:08.340 --> 01:37:11.300]   And therefore, they would want to use critical race theory.
[01:37:11.300 --> 01:37:16.980]   And what happened is that then a lot of people in order to reject the left for different
[01:37:16.980 --> 01:37:21.420]   reasons have said, oh, the problem is critical race theory.
[01:37:21.420 --> 01:37:22.700]   It should be repudiated.
[01:37:22.700 --> 01:37:24.980]   That was what I was discussing today.
[01:37:24.980 --> 01:37:30.460]   And it should be repudiated because what they want to affirm instead, though they don't
[01:37:30.460 --> 01:37:34.900]   usually say it this plainly, is that they want to defend white normativity and they
[01:37:34.900 --> 01:37:37.500]   see critical race theory as the problem.
[01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:41.660]   Whereas what I was trying to get at is that the problem is not critical race theory as
[01:37:41.660 --> 01:37:42.660]   a certain theory.
[01:37:42.660 --> 01:37:45.460]   It's not the theory that's finally the problem.
[01:37:45.460 --> 01:37:48.500]   It's the actual racism that's the problem.
[01:37:48.500 --> 01:37:52.980]   And whether you want to examine it through the critical race theory or through some other
[01:37:52.980 --> 01:37:58.740]   mechanism, that needs to be addressed, not the theory itself.
[01:37:58.740 --> 01:38:03.540]   So to make the theory the problem rather than the actual condition is what I was trying
[01:38:03.540 --> 01:38:04.540]   to address.
[01:38:04.540 --> 01:38:08.020]   I hope that clarifies it for any who might have been confused.
[01:38:08.020 --> 01:38:12.220]   You can certainly find plenty online about critical race theory.
[01:38:12.220 --> 01:38:18.620]   And a lot of it is Marxist and a lot of it is very adamantly anti-Christian.
[01:38:18.620 --> 01:38:24.460]   I just think like any good theory, though, there's a lot to be learned all the same.
[01:38:24.460 --> 01:38:30.060]   Just now the person asked, actually he already Googled it, but I think he wants to know a
[01:38:30.060 --> 01:38:31.980]   bit more inside the story.
[01:38:31.980 --> 01:38:32.980]   That's all.
[01:38:32.980 --> 01:38:33.980]   Yeah.
[01:38:33.980 --> 01:38:34.980]   Yes.
[01:38:34.980 --> 01:38:35.980]   Okay.
[01:38:35.980 --> 01:38:36.980]   I hope I provided that.
[01:38:36.980 --> 01:38:37.980]   Did you want more?
[01:38:37.980 --> 01:38:38.980]   Yeah, I'm fine.
[01:38:38.980 --> 01:38:39.980]   I'm fine.
[01:38:39.980 --> 01:38:40.980]   I'm fine.
[01:38:40.980 --> 01:38:41.980]   All right.
[01:38:41.980 --> 01:38:42.980]   Okay.
[01:38:42.980 --> 01:38:44.580]   One more question.
[01:38:44.580 --> 01:38:50.460]   The question asked, "We in Hong Kong receive the gospel hand down by the West."
[01:38:50.460 --> 01:38:56.320]   You know, the Western missionary from America, from Europe come to Hong Kong from China.
[01:38:56.320 --> 01:39:00.220]   So we receive the gospel in this way.
[01:39:00.220 --> 01:39:08.580]   But the gospel hand down to us probably mixed with American culture, American tradition,
[01:39:08.580 --> 01:39:12.860]   but most of the time we don't really recognize that.
[01:39:12.860 --> 01:39:23.100]   So the gospel we receive might be incompatible with our own culture and our own government
[01:39:23.100 --> 01:39:24.260]   here.
[01:39:24.260 --> 01:39:28.900]   So any suggestion for the Christian in this part of the world?
[01:39:28.900 --> 01:39:29.900]   Yes.
[01:39:29.900 --> 01:39:35.780]   Well, I would say that no one knows anything purely and neutrally.
[01:39:35.780 --> 01:39:38.760]   We all are knowers in locations.
[01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:46.260]   So there's no way of getting rid of every element of white American evangelicalism any
[01:39:46.260 --> 01:39:53.660]   more than there's an ability to get rid of a certain kind of cultural bias or tendency
[01:39:53.660 --> 01:39:56.500]   or whatever it might be.
[01:39:56.500 --> 01:39:59.660]   So let's not go for the absolute purity.
[01:39:59.660 --> 01:40:03.140]   Let's just go for something better than what we have.
[01:40:03.140 --> 01:40:08.320]   I think this is where something like a tool like critical race theory, which I do not
[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:16.920]   embrace as a practice, can add to the tool set that we have to try to get a clearer picture
[01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:18.720]   of what's going on.
[01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:20.440]   I think it's very interesting.
[01:40:20.440 --> 01:40:27.800]   And I want to just say I know that I'm stepping into delicate territory in what I'm about
[01:40:27.800 --> 01:40:28.800]   to say.
[01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:35.300]   And I'm also aware that I know, I think, a fair amount about this movement, but not
[01:40:35.300 --> 01:40:37.720]   all that you would certainly know about it.
[01:40:37.720 --> 01:40:44.180]   But when I've heard about the Sinoization of the church in or of Christianity in Asia
[01:40:44.180 --> 01:40:50.360]   or in China in particular, it's interesting to me that the two things are happening at
[01:40:50.360 --> 01:40:51.700]   the same time.
[01:40:51.700 --> 01:40:56.740]   On the one hand, the government, I think, seems to be asking for clarity about what
[01:40:56.740 --> 01:41:01.180]   is truly Chinese.
[01:41:01.180 --> 01:41:09.180]   And there are things about the gospel that I would say are truly Chinese.
[01:41:09.180 --> 01:41:14.900]   And what they're trying to critique is let's get rid of the colonialist past in relationship
[01:41:14.900 --> 01:41:23.580]   to Christianity and get down to at least a truly Chinese Christianity.
[01:41:23.580 --> 01:41:25.680]   I know this is very complicated territory.
[01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:27.260]   So hang in with me here.
[01:41:27.260 --> 01:41:32.940]   I'm just trying to make a small point in the middle of an ocean of challenges.
[01:41:32.940 --> 01:41:38.240]   But I think in a way, the government's instinct about that is a really worthy one from a Christian
[01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:46.460]   point of view, saying, let's understand who we are culturally and how our faith redefines
[01:41:46.460 --> 01:41:52.460]   and helps us understand what it means to live as a faithful disciple in any given context,
[01:41:52.460 --> 01:41:57.500]   let's say specifically in a Chinese context, as a faithful Christian person of Chinese
[01:41:57.500 --> 01:41:58.500]   descent.
[01:41:58.500 --> 01:42:05.700]   Now, the ironic part of that is that if that happened, then I think the gospel that would
[01:42:05.700 --> 01:42:12.460]   actually be found would be a gospel that would enable the Chinese church both to see that
[01:42:12.460 --> 01:42:14.980]   we are inseparably bound together across the world.
[01:42:14.980 --> 01:42:20.880]   The gospel is inherently international, intercultural, interracial, et cetera.
[01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:25.560]   But it would also give, I think, a fresh set of tools to be able to ask, how do we freshly
[01:42:25.560 --> 01:42:30.500]   look at how we communicate the gospel, how we articulate the gospel, how we enact the
[01:42:30.500 --> 01:42:36.820]   gospel in our setting in a way that might enable the gospel to be strengthened?
[01:42:36.820 --> 01:42:43.760]   Now, I know along the way, the fear is, understandably, that the gospel will be lost.
[01:42:43.760 --> 01:42:48.220]   And I'm not denying the pressure of that influence.
[01:42:48.220 --> 01:42:53.740]   Here having now ventured into this dangerous and complicated territory, let me especially
[01:42:53.740 --> 01:42:58.380]   ask my two responders to engage with us, please, with me.
[01:42:58.380 --> 01:43:00.580]   Rescue me from the trouble I've just gotten into.
[01:43:00.580 --> 01:43:02.460]   >> Okay, thank you, thank you.
[01:43:02.460 --> 01:43:03.460]   >> Can I?
[01:43:03.460 --> 01:43:04.460]   >> Yes, please.
[01:43:04.460 --> 01:43:10.780]   >> I totally agree with you, Dr. Leperton, but I'd like to add something onto that is
[01:43:10.780 --> 01:43:19.780]   I believe for Christians that are not in America, like in Hong Kong, we receive the gospel,
[01:43:19.780 --> 01:43:23.220]   we are influenced by the American church a whole lot.
[01:43:23.220 --> 01:43:29.260]   But I think one important thing for us to do is to understand in what context did that
[01:43:29.260 --> 01:43:34.500]   gospel, that version of the gospel came about.
[01:43:34.500 --> 01:43:40.900]   And so actually the lecture that Mark, you gave these few days, very important for us
[01:43:40.900 --> 01:43:48.300]   because the, what I call and quote, the American version, I mean, there is a lot of truth and
[01:43:48.300 --> 01:43:50.860]   treasure within that, we have to say.
[01:43:50.860 --> 01:43:55.840]   But of course, there are some pitfalls that comes together with the version.
[01:43:55.840 --> 01:44:02.260]   And there are historical and constitutional reason, cultural reason why it all came about.
[01:44:02.260 --> 01:44:08.060]   But I believe for us in Hong Kong, when I first, you know, turned to Christ years ago,
[01:44:08.060 --> 01:44:13.300]   the version that I listened to, very close to the American version.
[01:44:13.300 --> 01:44:20.420]   It was until I came into a seminary and learned theology that I start to realize that the
[01:44:20.420 --> 01:44:28.280]   gospel is so-called much wider or has much more different perspectives to look at.
[01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:34.940]   So I believe one important thing we have to do outside of America is to understand how
[01:44:34.940 --> 01:44:40.580]   that came about in a particular context, instead of throwing away the whole thing and only
[01:44:40.580 --> 01:44:42.440]   critiquing the whole thing.
[01:44:42.440 --> 01:44:45.940]   So I would say that is my personal experience on that.
[01:44:45.940 --> 01:44:46.940]   Yeah, thank you.
[01:44:46.940 --> 01:44:47.940]   That's really helpful.
[01:44:47.940 --> 01:44:55.220]   Well, I think in this part of the world, Christians are trained more to be quote unquote obedient
[01:44:55.220 --> 01:44:58.300]   and they just take in whatever they're taught.
[01:44:58.300 --> 01:45:04.940]   And we need to challenge our Christians to think critically for themselves and to develop
[01:45:04.940 --> 01:45:12.860]   the sort of theological mind, rather than just listen and just do whatever they're told.
[01:45:12.860 --> 01:45:18.900]   I think it's a sort of a different culture than the West.
[01:45:18.900 --> 01:45:21.260]   Yes, yes.
[01:45:21.260 --> 01:45:22.940]   Okay.
[01:45:22.940 --> 01:45:24.940]   Time flies.
[01:45:24.940 --> 01:45:27.460]   We have 45 minutes is gone.
[01:45:27.460 --> 01:45:30.620]   But one last question, right, Mark?
[01:45:30.620 --> 01:45:31.620]   One last question.
[01:45:31.620 --> 01:45:32.620]   Yeah.
[01:45:32.620 --> 01:45:39.380]   Just now, already you already shared a little bit about your fuller experience to how to
[01:45:39.380 --> 01:45:46.140]   form a diversified community with a diversified background.
[01:45:46.140 --> 01:45:48.940]   We still have questions to ask.
[01:45:48.940 --> 01:45:52.780]   Could you share a little bit more?
[01:45:52.780 --> 01:45:55.900]   That means just now what you shared is not enough for that person.
[01:45:55.900 --> 01:46:04.620]   Can you share a little bit more about forming a multi-ethnic or multi-something group?
[01:46:04.620 --> 01:46:07.220]   This is a very strange question.
[01:46:07.220 --> 01:46:11.380]   A multi-ethnic and a multi-something group.
[01:46:11.380 --> 01:46:14.300]   How could you form such a...
[01:46:14.300 --> 01:46:21.140]   Because in such a church, we have difficulty and conflict and different opinions among
[01:46:21.140 --> 01:46:24.660]   members and even members and leaders, whatever.
[01:46:24.660 --> 01:46:29.660]   So anything you'd like to share a little bit?
[01:46:29.660 --> 01:46:33.780]   Well let me just be very, very personal about it.
[01:46:33.780 --> 01:46:43.100]   Like anybody, and in my case being a white American male evangelical leader, I can easily
[01:46:43.100 --> 01:46:44.100]   get...
[01:46:44.100 --> 01:46:47.100]   I mean, I'm fully guilty as charged.
[01:46:47.100 --> 01:46:50.620]   So all of those things are true of me.
[01:46:50.620 --> 01:46:56.820]   And I think one of the things that's also true for me is that I realize how much God
[01:46:56.820 --> 01:47:02.300]   wants to crack open my imagination and the world of relationships and God's vision for
[01:47:02.300 --> 01:47:07.500]   the church in a way that is not a reflection of me and of a reflection of people that are
[01:47:07.500 --> 01:47:08.500]   like me.
[01:47:08.500 --> 01:47:16.620]   It includes people like me, but it also includes here, I think, especially in Ephesians 2.
[01:47:16.620 --> 01:47:21.940]   It includes people who do not look like me, who don't talk like me, who don't live in
[01:47:21.940 --> 01:47:24.460]   the world in the same way that I do.
[01:47:24.460 --> 01:47:30.700]   And since I became a Christian, lo these many, many years ago, I realized that to be a Christian
[01:47:30.700 --> 01:47:37.180]   meant that God was changing me in many ways, including my social location.
[01:47:37.180 --> 01:47:45.260]   So the social location I was born into is not the social location of the people of God.
[01:47:45.260 --> 01:47:47.980]   That social location is now in Christ.
[01:47:47.980 --> 01:47:52.980]   And if I'm in Christ, then I am meant to be in communion with people that are also in
[01:47:52.980 --> 01:47:54.060]   Christ.
[01:47:54.060 --> 01:47:58.160]   And some of them will be like me, and the majority actually will not be like me because
[01:47:58.160 --> 01:48:01.200]   the majority of the world is not like me.
[01:48:01.200 --> 01:48:10.620]   So I have made it a point over the years to try to just form trusting relationships, friendships,
[01:48:10.620 --> 01:48:19.540]   knowledge of people that are like me and not like me, and to build relationships of trust.
[01:48:19.540 --> 01:48:25.020]   And I think what's happened over time has been that I have quite an array of friends
[01:48:25.020 --> 01:48:32.500]   who do not see the world the same way as I do or as they do in relationship to each other.
[01:48:32.500 --> 01:48:38.300]   But because they trust me and they trust that I'm going to respect them, learn from them,
[01:48:38.300 --> 01:48:46.060]   receive them as brothers and sisters in Christ, I stumbled really into discovering that they
[01:48:46.060 --> 01:48:50.500]   would accept an invitation from me to meet together.
[01:48:50.500 --> 01:48:56.740]   Now that meant that there was already a relationship of trust with me.
[01:48:56.740 --> 01:49:01.020]   They knew that I was not going to let anything inappropriate happen in the meeting.
[01:49:01.020 --> 01:49:08.280]   They knew that I wanted it to be honest discussion, and they knew that this would be the way things
[01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:09.780]   could unfold.
[01:49:09.780 --> 01:49:17.380]   And so by just stumbling into this idea of gathering unlike people together, I started
[01:49:17.380 --> 01:49:23.260]   accumulating experiences of doing this and realized that a lot of other people would
[01:49:23.260 --> 01:49:26.940]   like to be in a group like that, but they didn't know how that could come about.
[01:49:26.940 --> 01:49:32.540]   And then you have to figure out how can you make it come about in a more systemic way.
[01:49:32.540 --> 01:49:36.920]   Let me tell you, though, about a different, related but different experience.
[01:49:36.920 --> 01:49:43.780]   When I was a pastor in Berkeley and when evangelicalism of the kind we have been discussing was on
[01:49:43.780 --> 01:49:49.080]   the rise, I was the pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of Berkeley, California, which is surrounded
[01:49:49.080 --> 01:49:56.380]   by the University of California, which is a wonderful and crazy institution.
[01:49:56.380 --> 01:50:04.980]   And in that setting, evangelicalism and Christian faith itself was treated as anathema.
[01:50:04.980 --> 01:50:10.700]   So we started a conference that we called the Global Church Conference, "Hearing the
[01:50:10.700 --> 01:50:13.500]   Church in the Majority World."
[01:50:13.500 --> 01:50:18.240]   And there were several criteria for the people that we wanted to speak to.
[01:50:18.240 --> 01:50:20.060]   We wanted to have them come and speak to us.
[01:50:20.060 --> 01:50:24.620]   They couldn't have any financial relationship with Fuller, I mean, with that church.
[01:50:24.620 --> 01:50:28.800]   We would pay them an honorarium for their speaking, but they were not dependent on any
[01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:35.860]   resources that our church was sending to them or to their workplace, whatever it might be.
[01:50:35.860 --> 01:50:40.900]   Secondly, they needed to come from at least five different places in the world.
[01:50:40.900 --> 01:50:42.980]   They needed to be both men and women.
[01:50:42.980 --> 01:50:46.380]   Of course, they needed to be multiracial.
[01:50:46.380 --> 01:50:52.780]   And the topic from the first year, just so that you know how long these subjects have
[01:50:52.780 --> 01:51:01.460]   been living with me, I think the first global church conference was, let's see, it would
[01:51:01.460 --> 01:51:04.900]   have been in about 1995 or so.
[01:51:04.900 --> 01:51:10.000]   So for at least 15 years, this conference, which continues on to this day, invites people
[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:14.900]   from around the world to come and speak around a theme.
[01:51:14.900 --> 01:51:22.700]   And that first year's theme was evangelicalism, the gift and the problem.
[01:51:22.700 --> 01:51:27.980]   In that setting, on the very first night, these five people from different parts of
[01:51:27.980 --> 01:51:32.180]   the world had gathered to give these in-person lectures.
[01:51:32.180 --> 01:51:39.300]   And before the conference had even begun, we were together talking and praying, and
[01:51:39.300 --> 01:51:42.940]   there was some laughter that went on in one corner of the room.
[01:51:42.940 --> 01:51:44.900]   And I said, "What's the laughter about?"
[01:51:44.900 --> 01:51:48.580]   And they said, "Well, we've just admitted to each other we tried to think of reasons
[01:51:48.580 --> 01:51:52.940]   not to come to this after all."
[01:51:52.940 --> 01:51:55.300]   And I said, "Oh, that's fascinating.
[01:51:55.300 --> 01:51:57.740]   Why did you think about not wanting to come?"
[01:51:57.740 --> 01:52:02.260]   And they said, "Well, because we actually believe that you mean it when you say, 'Come
[01:52:02.260 --> 01:52:05.500]   and tell the truth as you would in your own setting.'"
[01:52:05.500 --> 01:52:10.540]   Not for an American audience, but as you would tell the truth in your setting, we believe
[01:52:10.540 --> 01:52:12.780]   you actually want that to happen.
[01:52:12.780 --> 01:52:17.540]   But the thing is, no one in America has ever asked us to come and tell the truth as we
[01:52:17.540 --> 01:52:19.700]   would tell it in our setting.
[01:52:19.700 --> 01:52:24.380]   They've asked us to come and tell the truth to an American audience that would please
[01:52:24.380 --> 01:52:30.260]   an audience and hopefully, potentially, gain some financial support for the mission that
[01:52:30.260 --> 01:52:34.500]   they were involved in, rather than telling the truth.
[01:52:34.500 --> 01:52:37.300]   Now that was really poignant.
[01:52:37.300 --> 01:52:39.740]   It was exactly the purpose of these conferences.
[01:52:39.740 --> 01:52:44.860]   And the reason why they've gone on year by year is to stimulate and make public, in a
[01:52:44.860 --> 01:52:53.420]   way, the practice of a public conversation, of watching people combined together, all
[01:52:53.420 --> 01:52:58.940]   in Christ, but from different parts of the world, with different points of view around
[01:52:58.940 --> 01:53:06.860]   the same topic, and show us in doing so, how to do this peaceably and wisely and honestly.
[01:53:06.860 --> 01:53:08.300]   It had to be honest.
[01:53:08.300 --> 01:53:12.540]   It could not be some kind of easy deference to the other.
[01:53:12.540 --> 01:53:18.260]   It had to actually take on the thorny questions that we were trying to work out.
[01:53:18.260 --> 01:53:19.780]   It was an amazing experience.
[01:53:19.780 --> 01:53:26.300]   And by the end, there were people who, in our final little group time together, probably,
[01:53:26.300 --> 01:53:31.620]   were weeping over how significant this had been, because they had never been invited
[01:53:31.620 --> 01:53:33.300]   into that sort of experience.
[01:53:33.300 --> 01:53:37.020]   And fortunately, that congregation was able to receive it.
[01:53:37.020 --> 01:53:42.380]   And from there, the practices of growing these kinds of groups increased.
[01:53:42.380 --> 01:53:44.100]   I hope that's a helpful answer.
[01:53:44.100 --> 01:53:45.100]   Thank you.
[01:53:45.100 --> 01:53:54.060]   I think your personal story speaks a lot and recaps what you mentioned, the points you
[01:53:54.060 --> 01:53:55.900]   mentioned earlier.
[01:53:55.900 --> 01:53:57.900]   So any more follow-up?
[01:53:57.900 --> 01:53:58.900]   No?
[01:53:58.900 --> 01:53:59.900]   Okay.
[01:53:59.900 --> 01:54:08.100]   So, Mark, this morning, indeed, very terrific that we can hear words from you, words of
[01:54:08.100 --> 01:54:15.900]   wisdom, and also you stimulate our thoughts in a profound way.
[01:54:15.900 --> 01:54:23.620]   And also, I really appreciate your way of answering questions, very gentle, very clear.
[01:54:23.620 --> 01:54:24.820]   Thank you very much.
[01:54:24.820 --> 01:54:29.360]   So we look forward to tomorrow's final lecture.
[01:54:29.360 --> 01:54:31.780]   We continue to pray for you as well.
[01:54:31.780 --> 01:54:33.600]   So thank you.
[01:54:33.600 --> 01:54:35.460]   Thank you very much, people.
[01:54:35.460 --> 01:54:41.780]   Thank you for coming to this lecture this morning, and I pray that everyone is well.
[01:54:41.780 --> 01:54:42.780]   All right.
[01:54:42.780 --> 01:54:43.780]   Thank you.
[01:54:43.780 --> 01:54:43.780]   Bye-bye.
[01:54:43.780 --> 01:54:44.280]   Bye-bye.
[01:54:44.280 --> 01:55:02.280]   Bye-bye.
[01:55:02.280 --> 01:55:04.280]   [MUSIC]
