[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.920]   (soft piano music)
[00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:17.840]   - Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.400]   fellow sisters and brothers in Christ.
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.760]   Welcome back to the fourth and final lecture
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.760]   of this year's Josephine So Culture and Ethics lectures.
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.720]   In this session, our distinguished speaker,
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.960]   Reverend Dr. Christopher Wright,
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.280]   Langham's Global Ambassador and Ministry Director,
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.440]   will continue to speak to us
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.440]   on the relevance of the Old Testament to our Christian faith.
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.580]   In the previous three lectures,
[00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.520]   he finally elucidated for us how the Old Testament
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.800]   may bear on our understanding of our Christian identity,
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.760]   missions, and ethics.
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.280]   Tonight, he'll stretch our horizon a bit forward
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.560]   and cast a look into the future.
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.760]   Tonight's topic is the Old Testament and Christian hope,
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.820]   where will it all end?
[00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.600]   Over the dinner, I confessed to Dr. Wright
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.320]   that the Chinese translation are written by me.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.980]   So all the distortions and mistakes were on me.
[00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:32.600]   Accompanying our speaker on stage tonight
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.160]   is our Emeritus President, Dr. Stephen Lee.
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.960]   Dr. Lee shares the same enthusiasm as our speaker
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.340]   in helping Christians to reckon the Old Testament
[00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.760]   as an indismissible part of their faith.
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.440]   Some 20-odd years ago,
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.360]   I listened to one of his talks on the cassette tape.
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.520]   Do you know cassette tapes ever existed on this earth?
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.360]   No, okay.
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.840]   And the title of his talk is
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.080]   A Bible with Only the Upper but No Ground Floor.
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.440]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.200]   In which he explained that our Christian faith
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.600]   is grounded in both the Old and the New Testament.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.560]   As for tonight, Drs. Wright and Dr. Lee
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.640]   will have a dialogue on this interesting topic,
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.560]   Old Testament and Christian hope.
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.400]   Dr. Wright will give his first lecture,
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.920]   will give the lecture first, a 25-minute speech,
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.720]   followed by Dr. Lee's response of about the same length.
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.080]   Then, they'll further exchange their views
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.520]   for another half an hour,
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.320]   and then the discussion will be open to the floor.
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.640]   So for the time being, you may ask our ushers
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.080]   for a piece of paper or a piece of note
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.280]   to write down your questions or thoughts.
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.120]   And without further ado, let's welcome Dr. Wright.
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.480]   (audience applauding)
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.320]   - Thank you so much, Simon, Dr. Chung, and welcome again.
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.200]   And if you have been with me all through these four,
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.680]   well done.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.320]   It's kind of a marathon for all of us,
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.320]   but it's good to see you again.
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.640]   Let me just get to my right page on the notes.
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.480]   There we are.
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:38.600]   So yes, our title this time is Where Will It All End?
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.440]   We've seen, haven't we, in these previous three lectures
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.520]   how the Old Testament shapes the identity
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.040]   and the mission and the ethic of God's people.
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.440]   Those of us who are in Christ, as Paul says in Galatians,
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.960]   are in Abraham.
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.840]   We are part of that people, believing Jews and Gentiles,
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.560]   and we are shaped together by the scriptures as a whole,
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.720]   the scriptures of our Lord Jesus Christ, of course,
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.920]   what we now call the Old Testament.
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.760]   So the Old Testament then, topped by the New,
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.360]   tells us who we are, why we are here,
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.000]   and how we are to live.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.320]   That's what we've been thinking about
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.560]   over the three lectures.
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.800]   But what's the point?
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.360]   Where is it all going to end?
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.400]   Where does this story go?
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.640]   All human religions and philosophies and ideologies
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.440]   express some elements of narrative or story
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.600]   to explain how things are
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.040]   and how they got to be the way they are
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.200]   and how we could make them better if we want to.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.000]   And the Bible, as a canonical whole,
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.240]   the whole scripture that we have,
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.920]   is also, in that sense, a narrative,
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.680]   indeed, a metanarrative.
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.280]   It tells the big story that runs from creation,
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.800]   right through to new creation, from Genesis to Revelation.
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.160]   But it's not just a story.
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.200]   It claims to be the story,
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.720]   the true story of the whole universe.
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.120]   Now, in other places and in some of my books,
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.360]   I've tried to pick up an idea that I first got from,
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.680]   well, originally from Tom Wright
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.760]   and then from Michael Goheen and Craig Bartholomew,
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.680]   who talk about the Bible as rather like a great drama,
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.600]   that is, a great cosmic play that has taken several acts.
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.040]   You know how dramas have different acts,
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.760]   in which God is the author and, of course,
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.160]   the chief character,
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.560]   but there's a cast of thousands as well.
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.240]   And one way in which I've tried to portray this
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.680]   is in a kind of diagram,
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.840]   which I've put into one of my other books
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.840]   called "The Great Story and the Great Commission,"
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.400]   which is published by Baker,
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.120]   like this, with sort of symbols
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.680]   that express the different acts of the Bible.
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.760]   So here it is as a drama in seven acts.
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.480]   I'll try to go through this fairly quickly,
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.560]   watching my time,
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.400]   'cause I'm very aware that there are two of us this evening.
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.920]   Act one of the Bible story, of course, is the creation.
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.960]   In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth,
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.320]   and I've put this as a triangle because there is God.
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.640]   He created the earth and he put human beings in it.
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.960]   Act one, all a good start.
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.200]   But then, of course, we know that everything went wrong
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.600]   because we chose to rebel against our creator,
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.560]   to distrust his goodness, to disobey his instructions.
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.680]   And so that symbol expresses the sense of rebellion.
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.360]   Act two of the story is where all the problems begin.
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.040]   And then act three is basically
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.840]   the rest of the Old Testament.
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.840]   It's a very long act and there's an awful lot in it.
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.680]   And it's not just a story, of course.
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.760]   It's full of other things like poetry
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.760]   and Psalms and wisdom and everything else.
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:43.680]   But the arrow pointing forward has this sense of movement,
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.600]   that it is going somewhere,
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.600]   because it's based on God's promise,
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.240]   the promise that he made to Abraham,
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.760]   that he would be a nation and through him,
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:52.880]   the nations would be blessed,
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.680]   as we've been thinking repeatedly
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.520]   through these last couple of days.
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.560]   Act three, therefore, is a story
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.960]   which ultimately leads up to act four,
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.000]   which, of course, is the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.760]   when the God of Israel keeps his promise,
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.080]   enters into human history as a human being,
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.600]   the word becomes flesh, and then lives and teaches,
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.920]   dies the atoning death on the cross,
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.920]   and rises again and returns to his father.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.360]   So that cross symbol at the center
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.840]   is not just the crucifixion,
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.720]   but is intended to represent
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.960]   everything we have in the Gospels,
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.600]   from the conception by the Holy Spirit
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.880]   through to the ascension of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.600]   But the Bible doesn't end there, does it?
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.440]   Of course not.
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.320]   It moves on through the book of Acts
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:41.640]   into the outpouring of God's spirit on his people,
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.880]   sending the people of God out in mission
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.720]   to the ends of the earth.
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.120]   We live within that era of mission,
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:51.400]   begun in the New Testament and continuing to this day,
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:55.040]   which leads to the last two great acts of the story.
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.640]   I put a tick here for the final judgment,
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:58.800]   might seem a wrong symbol,
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.720]   but in a sense, that is when God puts everything right.
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.600]   It's when God deals with evil,
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.840]   so evil will not have the last word, thank God.
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:11.240]   The judgment is actually good news in Paul's thinking,
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.120]   because it is when God rectifies
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.520]   all that went wrong in the story.
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.520]   And that then leads to the new creation,
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.120]   the new heavens and the new earth
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.360]   that we read about there in Revelation 21 and 22,
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.960]   but of course actually promised in the book of Isaiah.
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.360]   Now, that's simply trying to portray
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.880]   the whole Bible story on the back of an envelope,
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.840]   in a sense, which is where I first saw it done,
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.240]   actually with a friend of mine in the US
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.880]   with some other slightly different symbols,
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.240]   but the same idea.
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.480]   I've even done this on the back of a napkin
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.720]   in a restaurant sitting beside somebody
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.680]   and say, "What do you think the whole Bible is?"
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.960]   Well, just draw it like this,
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.160]   and here's the whole story of the Bible in one piece.
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.920]   And this helps us to see, of course,
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:57.560]   that we now, we are somewhere in Act 5.
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:59.880]   That is to say, we are in between
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.040]   the resurrection of Christ and the return of Christ.
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:04.160]   We are in the Bible.
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.560]   Did you know you're in the Bible?
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.560]   We are, we are actually participating in this drama.
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:09.920]   We are part of the story.
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.160]   This is the story we are in.
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.480]   And of course, this Act 5 is not the end.
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.160]   We know that ultimately,
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.560]   this story is leading to a glorious future,
[00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.320]   which gives us hope.
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.880]   That's why I use the word hope in the title of the lecture.
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.080]   Now, hope, of course,
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:29.360]   is one of those massive New Testament words.
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.000]   In fact, the apostle Paul puts it
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   in his favorite three, doesn't he?
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.520]   "Now abide faith, hope, and love."
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:39.440]   But Christian hope is not just optimism.
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.280]   It doesn't just mean, oh, we like to think
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.320]   that everything's going to get better and better.
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.560]   That's the myth of modernity,
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:49.040]   that somehow human progress, science, and wisdom
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:51.400]   will eventually create a better world.
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.920]   Well, Jesus told us that things may well get worse
[00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:56.560]   as they get better.
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.200]   In other words, the wheat of the kingdom of God
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.320]   and the weeds of the evil one work together
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.320]   all the way through history.
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.280]   So Christian hope is not optimism.
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:09.960]   Rather, it is the certainty, the biblical certainty,
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.600]   that the future of this planet,
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.520]   indeed the future of the universe, is in God's hands,
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:17.840]   and God's sovereign purpose will be accomplished
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:20.920]   in the reconciliation of his whole creation
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.480]   and the ingathering of people
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.680]   from every tribe and nation and language,
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:28.560]   and that that hope has indeed already been accomplished
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.600]   in anticipation through the cross
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.800]   and resurrection of Christ, as we shall see.
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.240]   Now, what I want us to see
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.720]   is that this sense of Christian hope
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.720]   didn't just sort of drop into the apostle Paul's mind
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.240]   from nowhere.
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:46.280]   It actually comes very deeply rooted in his scriptures,
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:48.760]   even before his conversion.
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.440]   In other words, Paul tells us, doesn't he,
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:53.080]   that he was a Hebrew-speaking Jew,
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:56.040]   that he was a Torah-observant Pharisee.
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.440]   Tells us that in Philippians.
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.880]   So he knew the scriptures.
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:02.520]   He probably knew masses of the Old Testament by heart.
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:06.040]   So therefore, he knew about the God of hope
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:10.040]   as he speaks in Romans 15.
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:14.320]   Indeed, I think if you had asked Saul of Tarsus,
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.280]   before his experience of the Damascus Road,
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.800]   what gave him hope for the future,
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.920]   he would have taken you to some of the texts
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.160]   that we're just going to look at in a moment,
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.320]   to multiple scriptures.
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.760]   He would have believed that the future
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:29.800]   would include God's restoration of Israel.
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.080]   That's what would happen.
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.760]   And then after the restoration of Israel
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:34.720]   would come the ingathering of the nations,
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.880]   and then ultimately would come a new heaven and a new earth,
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.360]   which he would have read about in Isaiah.
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:44.480]   And if you were to ask the same question to Saul of Tarsus
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.800]   after he had become the apostle Paul,
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:50.600]   after his experience on the Damascus Road,
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.200]   then he would have done the same,
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.760]   because he actually did.
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:57.880]   When he wants to talk about the hope that we have,
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:01.000]   he uses the Old Testament scriptures to do so.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.520]   And that's why I wanted to use this text
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:06.960]   as a kind of control text here from Romans chapter 15,
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:10.280]   because hope figures again and again in it.
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:13.320]   Romans chapter 15, verse four, says this.
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:15.760]   He says, Paul says,
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.160]   that everything that was written in the past,
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.440]   and of course he means the scriptures
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.240]   of what we call the Old Testament,
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.920]   was written to teach us
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:25.560]   so that through the endurance taught in the scriptures
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:29.360]   and the encouragement they provide, we might have hope.
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:32.520]   Paul says, the whole Old Testament was to give us hope.
[00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:33.960]   Have you ever thought of that?
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.640]   The Old Testament gives you a lot of problems
[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:39.080]   and a lot of classes and a lot of exams and everything else.
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:41.360]   But Paul says, the Old Testament is given to us
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:42.240]   to give us hope.
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:45.720]   And then immediately in the following verses,
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:46.560]   verses eight and nine,
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:50.040]   he summarizes what I just described as Acts 3, 4, and 5
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.520]   of the biblical narrative,
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:54.520]   because he says, I tell you, says Paul,
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:58.800]   that the Messiah Christ has become a servant of the Jews,
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.560]   that's the story of the gospels, isn't it,
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.160]   on behalf of God's truth,
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.280]   so that the promises made to the patriarchs
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:06.520]   might be confirmed, and moreover,
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:09.800]   that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy.
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:13.680]   So Paul says, Jesus came as the servant of the Lord,
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:17.720]   that's Act 4, the gospel story there, the cross narrative,
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:19.600]   as portrayed in Isaiah,
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:22.320]   but he had come in order to fulfill God's promises
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.680]   to the patriarchs, meaning, of course, Abraham,
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:27.520]   so that was Act 3 of the drama,
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:30.280]   and he says that was so that all nations,
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:32.920]   the Gentiles, would come to find their hope
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:36.240]   and their blessing and the glorifying God for his mercy,
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:38.640]   which was now happening in Act 5,
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:41.120]   because Paul was taking the gospel to the nations
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.240]   and seeing the responding to God's mercy.
[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:48.620]   And then, in order to reinforce that climactic point,
[00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:51.280]   which is, let's remember that Romans 15
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:53.040]   is the climax of the whole letter.
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.000]   Paul didn't write a postcard to the Romans,
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.520]   which ended at Romans 8.
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:59.120]   He wrote a whole letter to the Romans,
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:01.640]   which comes right up to chapter 15 and 16.
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:03.200]   So let's hold it all together.
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.200]   He said that God's intention, his intention,
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:08.040]   from chapter one, was to bring about
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:10.320]   the obedience of faith among the nations,
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:12.320]   that's what the gospel is all about,
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.720]   and so Paul, when he gets to this point,
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:18.220]   that it's for the glory of God among the nations,
[00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:21.420]   throws in four Old Testament quotations
[00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:22.500]   immediately afterwards.
[00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:24.540]   I referred to this in an earlier lecture,
[00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:27.260]   from the Psalms, the Torah, and the prophets,
[00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.940]   all of which speak about the Gentiles,
[00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:33.000]   the nations, rejoicing along with Israel,
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.620]   because now, under the reign of the Messiah,
[00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:39.060]   King Jesus, Son of David,
[00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:41.620]   they have hope for the future of the world.
[00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:44.260]   Here's how Paul concludes that list.
[00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.660]   It's in, again, still in Romans, sorry,
[00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:49.500]   in Romans chapter 15.
[00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:52.140]   He says, "Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles,
[00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:55.260]   "rejoice you Gentiles, praise the Lord you Gentiles.
[00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:56.920]   "The root of Jesse will arise,
[00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:00.740]   "and in him the Gentiles will hope."
[00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:02.340]   That's his climax.
[00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:05.540]   Hope for the world, hope for the nations,
[00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:07.340]   is the climax of the book of Romans,
[00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:10.180]   because Jesus of Nazareth has fulfilled
[00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:12.780]   the promises of the Old Testament scriptures,
[00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:15.460]   and the mercy and the glory of God
[00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:17.660]   is now going to the ends of the earth.
[00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:19.420]   That vision is now being fulfilled
[00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:21.460]   through Christ and his victory,
[00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:24.100]   and it's being extended to every sinner,
[00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:27.820]   and to all nations, and indeed to the whole of creation.
[00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:30.980]   So that was simply a kind of a glimpse at Romans 15.
[00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:33.220]   It's a significant passage.
[00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:34.580]   Please don't overlook it,
[00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:38.420]   because you can't get past Romans 9 to 11, or something.
[00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:40.460]   It's a very important way in which Paul
[00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:43.060]   draws his letter to a conclusion.
[00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:44.660]   So I want us to think of this hope, then,
[00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:47.320]   the God of hope, briefly, in three areas.
[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:50.680]   As I said, hope for sinners, hope for the nations,
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:52.340]   and hope for creation.
[00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:55.780]   So first of all, then, hope for sinners
[00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:58.460]   takes us right back, of course,
[00:15:58.460 --> 00:15:59.860]   to the big problem that we have,
[00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:01.740]   which is in Genesis 3,
[00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:04.540]   which is because we chose in Adam and Eve
[00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:06.860]   to distrust and disobey God.
[00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:09.180]   The result was sin, evil, and death,
[00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:12.300]   and that penetrates to every dimension
[00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:14.060]   of the human personality.
[00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:17.580]   It's remarkable in that little story there
[00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:20.460]   in Genesis chapter 3, of how,
[00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:25.460]   when Eve is confronted by this temptation from the serpent,
[00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:29.620]   that the evil that is somehow there,
[00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:31.680]   and it's not explained where this has come from,
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:32.940]   or why it has happened,
[00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:36.540]   but it speaks into her spiritual relationship with God.
[00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:39.140]   Did God really say, "You don't want to believe him"?
[00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:40.540]   It penetrates her mind,
[00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:43.580]   because she now rationalizes the fruit of the tree.
[00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:45.740]   It's good, it's beautiful, it's good to eat,
[00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:47.100]   it makes you wise.
[00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:49.500]   And then also, it enters her physical body.
[00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:51.660]   She takes, she eats,
[00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:54.180]   and then it enters into her social relationship
[00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:56.300]   with her husband, because she gives it to him.
[00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:58.660]   He was with her, the text says.
[00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:01.860]   Please notice, you men, including myself.
[00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:03.580]   Adam was not somewhere else in the garden.
[00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:06.360]   He was with her while this was happening.
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:07.860]   So he was a witness to it.
[00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:11.900]   So sin enters into every dimension of the human person,
[00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:14.820]   and indeed to all of us, because as Paul would say,
[00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:18.020]   "All of us have sinned in Adam."
[00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:20.780]   And so that leads, of course, to the promise of God
[00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:22.580]   in Genesis 3, verse 15,
[00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:26.100]   sometimes called the first gospel, or the Protoevangelium,
[00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:29.580]   where God says, even in the context of that, the fall,
[00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:31.300]   God says to the serpent,
[00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:33.620]   that I will put enmity between you and the woman,
[00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:35.100]   and your offspring and hers.
[00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:38.780]   He, that is the seed of the woman, a human being,
[00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:41.860]   he will crush your head, the head of the serpent,
[00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:43.740]   and you will strike his heel.
[00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:46.140]   So there'll be warfare between the serpent
[00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:47.940]   and what the serpent represents,
[00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:51.340]   and the human race represented by the seed of Eve.
[00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:53.900]   But it will be a human being who ultimately
[00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:56.900]   will be the serpent crusher, as it were,
[00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:58.820]   and destroy that evil.
[00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:00.900]   Now, very quickly to say,
[00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:03.140]   the rest of the Old Testament shows
[00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:06.980]   not just the fact that we are all sinners,
[00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:10.380]   but that there is an awareness that God's forgiveness
[00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:13.820]   and mercy and grace is available to sinners.
[00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:16.300]   It's there in the Psalms at an individual level
[00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:18.660]   when the Psalmist celebrate the fact
[00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:21.220]   that when they confess their sin, God forgives it.
[00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:25.780]   Psalm 32, Psalm 51, Psalm 130, for example.
[00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:29.460]   "God, if you kept a record of sin, who could stand?
[00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:31.580]   "But with you there is forgiveness."
[00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:35.860]   Amazing words of personal, individual forgiveness.
[00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:37.260]   But how is that happening?
[00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:39.500]   Well, you look at Isaiah 53,
[00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:41.660]   and as we saw in an earlier lecture,
[00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:45.700]   the servant of the Lord, the climax of those songs
[00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:48.900]   is when he will bear the sins of many,
[00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.020]   and because he would bear their sins,
[00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:53.940]   they would then receive the righteousness of God
[00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:55.300]   or be right with God.
[00:18:55.300 --> 00:19:00.300]   That's in Isaiah 53, that he took up our pain,
[00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:03.740]   bore our suffering, crushed for our transgressions,
[00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:07.060]   and the punishment that brought us peace was on him,
[00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:09.780]   and by his wounds we are healed,
[00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:11.740]   which of course is picked up in the New Testament
[00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:14.100]   by Jesus and by Peter.
[00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:16.980]   But the passage that I wanted particularly to take us to
[00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:20.300]   is that one on the screen of Romans chapter five,
[00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:22.740]   where Paul explicitly makes the link
[00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:26.020]   between the sin that entered the world through Adam
[00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:28.220]   and the forgiveness that enters the world
[00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:30.340]   through the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:31.460]   Romans five, verse 12,
[00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:34.660]   "Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man
[00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:37.020]   and death through sin, and in this way,
[00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:40.100]   death came to all people because all have sinned,"
[00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:42.060]   that's what comes into the world,
[00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:46.780]   then says Paul in verse, a little bit later in verse,
[00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:48.560]   have I got it, 19, he says,
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:51.780]   "Therefore, just as the disobedience of the one man,
[00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:53.940]   many were made sinners,
[00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:56.700]   so also through the obedience of the one man,"
[00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:59.980]   Jesus, of course, "the many will be made righteous."
[00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:02.800]   So that just as sin reigned in death,
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:05.760]   so also grace might reign through righteousness
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:08.980]   to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:11.520]   So that's the first point of the hope
[00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:15.860]   of the future of eternal life, which we have in Christ,
[00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:18.540]   is because we can have our sins forgiven.
[00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:20.340]   There is hope for sinners,
[00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:22.180]   and it's promised in the Old Testament
[00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:23.860]   and accomplished by Jesus.
[00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:26.980]   And for some people, that's it, that's the gospel,
[00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:29.020]   that's all they ever preach,
[00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:32.260]   which I think is true, but very short-sighted,
[00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:34.180]   because it's not all the Bible says
[00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:37.460]   about what God has accomplished through the cross of Christ,
[00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:39.140]   because there's also, of course, secondly,
[00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:41.120]   hope for the nations.
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:43.260]   You see, the opening chapters of Genesis,
[00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:45.300]   that Act I and II,
[00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:48.620]   present not just that all human beings are sinners,
[00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:50.660]   but also the problem of the nations,
[00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:54.500]   that the nations, too, are scattered and broken and divided.
[00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:57.020]   God's got a very big problem on his hands.
[00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:59.820]   It's not just that we are sinned and the earth is cursed,
[00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:02.800]   but that nations are also scattered and divided.
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:06.340]   And the chapters four to 11 of Genesis
[00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:10.000]   show very clearly that sin isn't just personal.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.320]   It affects society and cultures and generations,
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:16.940]   so much so that by the time of Noah,
[00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:19.320]   we are told several times in those chapters
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.360]   that God saw that the earth was filled
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:23.580]   with corruption and violence.
[00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:25.340]   Now, those are social things.
[00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:27.660]   That's what people do to each other.
[00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:30.220]   And so that's why, as we've been seeing earlier on,
[00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:32.820]   the promise of Genesis 12 is so important,
[00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:34.140]   that God says to Abraham,
[00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:37.060]   in the context of the Tower of Babel in chapter 11,
[00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:38.460]   God says that through you,
[00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:41.500]   all nations on earth will be blessed,
[00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:43.940]   not just experiencing that curse.
[00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:47.980]   The blessing of God is to go far as the curse is found
[00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:51.120]   in Isaac Newton's great hymn, "Joy to the World."
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:53.540]   Unfortunately, the modern translation of that hymn
[00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:56.700]   has spoiled Isaac Newton's meaning,
[00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:58.580]   because you know that where it says,
[00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:00.460]   "No more let thorns and thistles grow
[00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:01.900]   "or sin infest the ground.
[00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:04.540]   "He comes to make his blessings flow
[00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:06.900]   "far as the curse is found."
[00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:10.940]   That's explicitly relating Genesis 12, 11, and 12.
[00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:14.100]   The more recent version of that hymn says,
[00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:17.140]   "Far as guilt, wherever guilt is found,"
[00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:20.220]   which again, reduces, it's theological reductionism,
[00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:22.340]   as if somehow God's blessing
[00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:24.420]   was only because of human guilt,
[00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:26.220]   whereas actually the text,
[00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:27.900]   and what Isaac Newton was saying,
[00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:30.260]   was that God's blessing is for the whole of creation as well
[00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:31.900]   wherever the curse is found,
[00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:33.980]   not just wherever guilt is found.
[00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:36.100]   Anyway, that was an aside, it isn't in my text,
[00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:39.060]   so sorry, Stephen, you didn't have that earlier.
[00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:43.540]   Now what we see then, is that God's promises you see then
[00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:46.020]   speak of his blessing for nations
[00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:47.460]   as well as for individuals,
[00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:49.580]   and we saw some of that in the Psalms,
[00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:51.020]   in the second lecture,
[00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:53.900]   Psalms which speak about all the nations you have made
[00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:55.300]   will come to worship you,
[00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:57.020]   all the families of the nations,
[00:22:57.020 --> 00:23:00.820]   but in Isaiah, which of course is so influential on Paul,
[00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:02.940]   it's particularly the case
[00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:05.500]   that this is seen as part of the hope
[00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:08.260]   of the reign of the Messiah, son of David,
[00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:10.220]   that when he comes to reign,
[00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:12.820]   then it's good news for the nations specifically.
[00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:14.820]   So, Isaiah chapter two,
[00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:16.980]   when the mountain of the Lord is lifted up
[00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:19.220]   and all the nations will stream to it,
[00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:20.460]   many peoples will come and say,
[00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:23.100]   hey, let's go up to the mountain of Yahweh the Lord,
[00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:24.500]   the temple of the God of Jacob,
[00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:26.260]   he will teach us his ways,
[00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:27.980]   we will walk in his ways,
[00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:30.540]   and then he will judge between the nations
[00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:32.980]   and settle disputes, wouldn't that be great?
[00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:35.220]   And they will beat their swords into plowshares
[00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:36.900]   and their spears into pruning hooks,
[00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:39.300]   and nations will not take up sword against nation,
[00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:41.060]   they won't train for war anymore.
[00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:44.220]   What a hope for the nations, the ending of war,
[00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:46.420]   and that's what Isaiah specifically says,
[00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:49.860]   and then he repeats it in Isaiah chapter 11,
[00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:52.660]   that the shoot of Jesse, i.e. the son of David,
[00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:55.740]   will come and it will bring blessing and righteousness
[00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:59.060]   and justice to the nations and indeed to creation.
[00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:01.820]   Isaiah chapter 60 speaks about all the nations
[00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:03.820]   coming to worship God,
[00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:07.340]   and at the very end of Isaiah, in Isaiah chapter 66,
[00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:09.020]   we read God saying this,
[00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:14.020]   God says that I, because of what they have planned and done,
[00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.140]   I am about to come and gather the people
[00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:18.180]   of all nations and languages,
[00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:20.820]   and they will come and see my glory,
[00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:22.940]   and I will set my sign among them,
[00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:25.460]   and then it says they will proclaim my glory
[00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:26.860]   among the nations.
[00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:29.700]   So you see, when Paul talks in Romans 15
[00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:34.300]   about the hope of the nations, of the God of that hope,
[00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:36.100]   it's speaking about all the nations,
[00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:37.980]   and it comes from the Old Testament,
[00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:39.620]   and it comes, of course, to its climax,
[00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:42.060]   as you can see on the screen in Romans chapter,
[00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:45.340]   in Revelation chapter seven, verses nine and 10,
[00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:46.860]   I've referred to this earlier,
[00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:49.500]   where John says that there I saw a great multitude
[00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:52.780]   from every tribe, nation, people, and language
[00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:55.860]   standing before the throne and before the Lamb.
[00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:57.980]   That's there in Revelation seven,
[00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:00.140]   and it isn't forgotten in the rest of the book,
[00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:03.980]   because in Revelation 21, we read this,
[00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:08.740]   in verses 24 to 26, that the nations will walk by its light,
[00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:10.740]   that is the light of the city of God,
[00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:13.180]   and the kings of the earth will bring their splendor
[00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:15.060]   into the city of God.
[00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:17.860]   The glory and the honor of the nations
[00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:19.700]   will be brought into the city of God.
[00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:21.140]   Now, that's astonishing,
[00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:23.060]   because all through the book of Revelation,
[00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:26.420]   the kings and the nations are the bad guys.
[00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:28.580]   They're the ones who are in rebellion against God.
[00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:30.460]   They're persecuting the people of God.
[00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:32.620]   They've got the blood of the martyrs on their hands.
[00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:36.020]   So in some radical transformation,
[00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:38.220]   the kings and the nations of the world
[00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:41.380]   are there in this new creation, as nations,
[00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:45.020]   as kings, bringing their glory into the kingdom of God.
[00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:48.820]   So much so that the book of Revelation can end, almost,
[00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:51.300]   in its closing verses in chapter 22,
[00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:54.460]   with the tree of life, and the leaves of the tree
[00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:57.820]   are for the healing of the nations.
[00:25:57.820 --> 00:25:59.180]   An incredible statement there,
[00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:00.780]   right at the end of the Bible.
[00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:04.220]   So from the old through to the new, there is hope.
[00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:08.180]   Hope not only for sinners, but hope for the nations.
[00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:10.980]   Now, I don't know what that means.
[00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:14.220]   I don't know how to get my head around that
[00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:16.140]   in terms of what is that going to mean
[00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:17.100]   in our human history.
[00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:19.260]   It's bigger than I can imagine.
[00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:21.340]   That's 'cause it comes from God,
[00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:23.740]   and God is always bigger than we can imagine.
[00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:26.780]   But it gives us hope for the future, for this planet,
[00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:28.900]   that God ultimately has a plan
[00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:31.060]   that will bring blessing, peace, healing,
[00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:33.820]   and the end of war and strife to the nations of this world.
[00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:34.660]   Isn't that good?
[00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:35.500]   Good news?
[00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:36.340]   Hallelujah?
[00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:37.300]   Thank you.
[00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:38.780]   But more than that, finally,
[00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:41.860]   there is hope for creation itself.
[00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:43.900]   You see, again, God's big problem
[00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:46.620]   wasn't just that Adam and Eve had sinned.
[00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:49.220]   It wasn't just that the nations were scattered,
[00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:50.980]   but that he said, "Cursed is the earth,
[00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:53.220]   "the ground, because of you."
[00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:55.140]   There is something in creation
[00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:58.300]   that is not the way it was intended to be.
[00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:00.500]   Now, there's all sorts of ways of talking about that
[00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:01.820]   that I don't want to go into,
[00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:04.180]   but the Apostle Paul in Romans 8 agrees.
[00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:08.300]   He says that creation was subjected to frustration.
[00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:10.260]   He uses the word mataiotes,
[00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:12.460]   which is the same in the Greek translation
[00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:15.700]   of Ecclesiastes, Hevel, which was translated vanity.
[00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:18.260]   It's all something about this world,
[00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:22.460]   which is frustrated and not the way it should be.
[00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:25.460]   Yes, we can say that creation gives glory to God,
[00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:27.180]   and indeed, the Psalms will tell us that.
[00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:30.900]   The whole creation is singing the praises and glory of God,
[00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:32.740]   and yet, even though it is doing that,
[00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:36.100]   it's still, in some sense, frustrated in it.
[00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:37.540]   And I have to say that there are times
[00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:39.740]   when I look out at the glories of our world
[00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:41.380]   on a wonderful day, or the mountains,
[00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:43.900]   or the grandeur of some great scene,
[00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:45.220]   and I say to myself, wow,
[00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:47.700]   if this is what it looks like when it's frustrated,
[00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:50.380]   what's it gonna look like when it's liberated
[00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:52.180]   in God's new creation?
[00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:54.260]   So the creation itself, then, is frustrated,
[00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:58.180]   but God says in both the Psalms and in Isaiah
[00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:00.180]   that his plans are, indeed,
[00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:02.740]   for a whole new heaven and a new earth,
[00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:05.700]   not in the sense of a complete replacement heaven and earth,
[00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:08.140]   but a renewal, a restoration
[00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:10.060]   of what the earth was intended to be.
[00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:14.380]   So read Isaiah chapter 65, verses 17 to 25.
[00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:15.220]   Yes, there it is.
[00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:17.500]   "See, I am creating," says God.
[00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:18.580]   It's a participle.
[00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:21.340]   "I am creating new heavens and a new earth."
[00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:25.020]   And then it describes that new heavens and new earth
[00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:27.860]   in the most wonderfully earthy language.
[00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:31.020]   It talks about human life, about family.
[00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:32.060]   It talks about work.
[00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:34.620]   It talks about building houses and vineyards,
[00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:38.740]   and satisfaction, and no more frustration in our work,
[00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:39.580]   and so on.
[00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:41.540]   It's a wonderful picture of the new creation
[00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:43.180]   there in Isaiah 65.
[00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:44.900]   It's repeated in chapter 66,
[00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:48.500]   and of course it influenced John in Revelation chapter 21
[00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:50.900]   of the new creation.
[00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:53.700]   But it's also there in the Psalms and elsewhere
[00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:56.420]   where the psalmist portrays the whole of creation
[00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:57.780]   as rejoicing.
[00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:00.580]   And yes, it's poetic,
[00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:03.860]   and we need to understand it in that sense,
[00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:05.900]   but it is still pretty marvelous
[00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:08.540]   that when you have said among the nations
[00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:09.580]   that the Lord reigns,
[00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:11.900]   the kingdom of God in among the nations,
[00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:13.700]   then let the heavens rejoice,
[00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:14.780]   let the earth be glad,
[00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:16.620]   let the sea resign and all that's in it,
[00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:18.780]   let the fields be jubilant and everything in them,
[00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:21.540]   let all the trees of the field sing for joy,
[00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:25.260]   let all creation rejoice before the Lord.
[00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:26.300]   Why?
[00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:28.580]   That he's coming because he comes.
[00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:29.580]   And what's he gonna do?
[00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:32.860]   He comes to judge the world with righteousness.
[00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:35.980]   In other words, he's coming to put things right,
[00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:38.260]   'cause that's what it means when God acts as judge.
[00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:40.860]   He gets things sorted out, he puts things right.
[00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:42.900]   And the whole of creation is rejoicing
[00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:46.340]   and waiting for that day when God puts everything right.
[00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:49.420]   That's, I think, what influenced Paul in Romans 8,
[00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:52.340]   when he says in Romans 8, verses 18 to 25,
[00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:55.860]   that the whole of creation is just longing for that day
[00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:59.180]   when it will be liberated at the same time
[00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:02.300]   as we experience the redemption of our bodies.
[00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:05.180]   Paul puts together the resurrection of the body
[00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:06.820]   with the redemption of creation.
[00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:08.420]   That's a fascinating parallel.
[00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:11.420]   It's actually very important when people try to think of,
[00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:14.180]   well, what is the new creation gonna be like?
[00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:16.980]   Well, it's gonna be like our resurrection bodies,
[00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:19.580]   and our resurrection bodies are like the body of Jesus
[00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:21.420]   who was risen from the dead.
[00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:24.060]   And when you ask, well, the risen Jesus,
[00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:27.100]   was he the same as the earthly Jesus or different?
[00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:28.460]   Yeah, both.
[00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:30.140]   It was the same Jesus.
[00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:31.580]   They recognized him.
[00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:34.460]   They saw the wounds in his hands and his feet and his side.
[00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:35.540]   So it was the same Jesus,
[00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:37.940]   and yet it was a resurrected Jesus.
[00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:41.940]   He was a whole new mode of being in the new creation,
[00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:43.980]   the first fruits of the new creation.
[00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:45.300]   And so in that sense, I think,
[00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:47.380]   when we talk about the new heavens and the new earth,
[00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:49.020]   will it be just like this old heaven?
[00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:50.140]   Well, yes and no.
[00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:51.260]   It will be this earth.
[00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:52.780]   It will be this heaven,
[00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:56.460]   but it will be now restored, refreshed, renewed,
[00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:59.700]   cleansed, purged in the new creation.
[00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:02.300]   That's what I think Paul is talking about in Romans 8.
[00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:04.220]   And he says that's already been accomplished
[00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:07.300]   in Colossians 1, verses 15 to 20.
[00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:09.580]   That marvelous passage where Paul,
[00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:11.220]   it's just incredible what he says.
[00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:14.980]   About five times, he talks about all things,
[00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:16.860]   all things in heaven and earth.
[00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:18.300]   He couldn't make it any more clear
[00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:20.340]   that he's talking about the whole of creation.
[00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:22.140]   And he says Christ is the origin.
[00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:23.060]   He's the head.
[00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:23.900]   He's the source.
[00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:25.380]   He holds it all together.
[00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:27.700]   And through him, through Christ,
[00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:31.540]   God was pleased to reconcile to himself all things,
[00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:33.540]   whether things in earth or things in heaven,
[00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:37.980]   by making peace through his blood shed on the cross.
[00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:39.020]   Have you ever thought about that?
[00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:41.860]   That the cross is cosmic in its scope.
[00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:44.700]   It brings me salvation, brings you salvation.
[00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:47.780]   It also brings salvation to the whole of creation.
[00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:50.860]   So we're not going to be saved out of this world.
[00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:53.100]   I wish we didn't have so many hymns and songs
[00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:55.580]   which talk about going somewhere else.
[00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:58.660]   You know, they're really not biblical.
[00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:01.620]   In fact, I get our music leaders at All Souls
[00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:03.940]   to change the words sometimes.
[00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:05.900]   Even great hymns like, you know,
[00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:08.900]   how great thou art,
[00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:11.140]   when Christ shall come with shout of acclamation
[00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:12.420]   and take me home,
[00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:15.020]   he's not coming to take me anywhere.
[00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:17.700]   He is coming to make his home here.
[00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:20.500]   So we sing that, when Christ shall come and makes his home.
[00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:21.900]   That's the way we sing it at All Souls,
[00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:24.180]   because that's what it says in the Bible.
[00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:27.740]   The Bible does not end with us going up to heaven.
[00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:30.700]   The Bible ends with God bringing heaven to earth,
[00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:32.580]   bringing the city of God here.
[00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:35.900]   Then the dwelling place of God will be with us,
[00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:39.500]   it says in Revelation 21, three times.
[00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:42.540]   Revelation 21 is the great Emmanuel fulfillment,
[00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:44.060]   God with us.
[00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:45.660]   Emmanuel means God with us,
[00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:47.660]   not us going somewhere to be with God,
[00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:50.220]   but God coming to restore his creation
[00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:53.260]   in Revelation 21 and 22.
[00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:54.620]   We could go on about that.
[00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:56.100]   Perhaps the last thing to say then
[00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:58.500]   is very close to the end of the Bible
[00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:00.980]   in Revelation 22, verse three.
[00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:04.620]   Immediately after it says that the leaves of the tree
[00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:07.100]   will be for the healing of the nations,
[00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:12.020]   the next verse says, no longer will there be any curse.
[00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:16.300]   The curse on the earth will be gone in the new creation.
[00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:20.420]   So therefore we need our whole Bible, I will end by saying,
[00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:24.860]   to tell us who we are, to tell us why we're here,
[00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:27.260]   to tell us how we should live,
[00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:30.060]   and to tell us what we can look forward to
[00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:34.180]   in the hope of sinners, of the nations, and of creation.
[00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:38.900]   So may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace
[00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:43.900]   as you trust in him so that you may overflow with hope
[00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:45.540]   by the power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:47.260]   Amen.
[00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:50.700]   (gentle music)
[00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:53.280]   (gentle music)
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:55.860]   (gentle music)
[00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:58.440]   (gentle music)
[00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:01.020]   (gentle music)
