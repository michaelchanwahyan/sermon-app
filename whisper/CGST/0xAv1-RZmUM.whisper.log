[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.400]  (音樂)
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.440]  Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.800]  fellow sisters and brothers in Christ.
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.320]  Welcome back to the fourth and final lecture
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.600]  of this year's Josephine So Culture and Ethics lectures.
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.280]  In this session, our distinguished speaker,
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.600]  Reverend Dr. Christopher Wright,
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.720]  Langham's Global Ambassador and Ministry Director,
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.120]  will continue to speak to us
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.400]  on the relevance of the Old Testament to our Christian faith.
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.200]  In the previous three lectures,
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.240]  he finally elucidated for us
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.920]  how the Old Testament may bear on our understanding
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.080]  of our Christian identity, missions and ethics.
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.800]  Tonight, he'll stretch our horizon a bit forward
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.800]  and cast a look into the future.
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.600]  Tonight's topic is
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.280]  The Old Testament and Christian Hope,
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.720]  Where Will It All End?
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.040]  Over the dinner, I confessed to Dr. Wright that
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.200]  the Chinese translations are written by me.
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.880]  So all the distortions and mistakes were on me.
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.040]  Accompanying our speaker on stage tonight
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.000]  is our Emeritus President, Dr. Stephen Lee.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.480]  Dr. Lee shares the same enthusiasm as our speaker
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.160]  in helping Christians to reckon the Old Testament
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.800]  as an indismissible part of their faith.
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.600]  Some 20-odd years ago,
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.800]  I listened to one of his talks on the cassette tape.
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.840]  Do you know cassette tapes ever existed on this earth?
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.240]  No, okay.
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.200]  And the title of his talk is
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.640]  A Bible with Only the Upper but No Ground Floor
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.520]  只有樓上沒有樓下的聖經
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.120]  in which he explained that
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.040]  our Christian faith is grounded
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.360]  in both the Old and the New Testament.
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.600]  As for tonight,
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.080]  Dr. Wright and Dr. Lee
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.040]  will have a dialogue on this interesting topic
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.600]  Old Testament and Christian Hope.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.080]  Dr. Wright will give his first lecture
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.520]  will give the lecture first
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.360]  a 25-minute speech
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.040]  followed by Dr. Lee's response
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.880]  of about the same length.
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.360]  Then, they will further exchange their views
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.960]  for another half an hour.
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.640]  And then the discussion
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.520]  will be open to the floor.
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.360]  So for the time being,
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.320]  you may ask our ushers
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.720]  for a piece of paper or a piece of note
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.040]  to write down your questions or thoughts.
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.040]  And without further ado,
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.680]  let's welcome Dr. Wright.
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:17.280]  Thank you so much, Simon, Dr. Chung.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.120]  And welcome again.
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.240]  And if you have been with me
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.640]  all through these four, well done.
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.160]  It's a kind of a marathon for all of us,
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.360]  but it's good to see you again.
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.480]  Let me just get to my right page on the notes.
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.000]  There we are.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.440]  So yes, our title this time is
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.440]  Where Will It All End?
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.520]  We've seen, haven't we,
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.320]  in these previous three lectures
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.160]  how the Old Testament shapes
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.080]  the identity and the mission
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.880]  and the ethic of God's people.
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.520]  Those of us who are in Christ,
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.280]  as Paul says in Galatians,
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.800]  are in Abraham.
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.160]  We are part of that people
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.280]  believing Jews and Gentiles.
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.440]  And we are shaped together
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.400]  by the scriptures as a whole,
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.160]  the scriptures of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.200]  of course, what we now call the Old Testament.
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.040]  So the Old Testament then,
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.520]  topped by the New,
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.160]  tells us who we are,
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.680]  why we are here,
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.600]  and how we are to live.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.120]  That's what we've been thinking about
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.280]  over the three lectures.
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.120]  But what's the point?
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.120]  Where is it all going to end?
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.040]  Where does this story go?
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.720]  All human religions and philosophies
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.960]  and ideologies
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.840]  express some elements of narrative or story
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.280]  to explain how things are
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.440]  and how they got to be the way they are
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.360]  and how we could make them better
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.280]  if we want to.
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.720]  And the Bible as a canonical whole,
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.640]  the whole scripture that we have,
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.480]  is also in that sense a narrative,
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.440]  indeed, a metanarrative.
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.440]  It tells the big story
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.800]  that runs from creation,
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.600]  right through to new creation,
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.520]  from Genesis to Revelation.
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.640]  But it's not just a story.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.080]  It claims to be the story,
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.760]  the true story of the whole universe.
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.720]  Now,in other places
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.000]  and in some of my books,
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.280]  I've tried to pick up an idea
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.480]  that I first got from,
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.520]  well,originally from Tom Wright
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.000]  and then from Michael Goheen
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.080]  and Craig Bartholomew,
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.800]  who talk about the Bible
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.760]  as rather like a great drama,
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.840]  that is a great cosmic play
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.520]  that has taken several acts,
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.520]  you know how dramas
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.600]  have different acts,
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.680]  in which God is the author
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.760]  and, of course, the chief character,
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.960]  but there's a cast of thousands as well.
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.400]  And one way in which
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.080]  I've tried to portray this
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.600]  is in a kind of diagram
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.600]  which I put into
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.720]  one of my other books
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:40.720]  called The Great Story
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.120]  and the Great Commission,
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.000]  which is published by Baker,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.960]  like this, with sort of symbols
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.560]  that express the different acts
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.280]  of the Bible.
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:49.280]  So here it is
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.640]  as a drama in seven acts.
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:51.600]  I'll try to go through this
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.160]  fairly quickly, watching my time,
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.280]  because I'm very aware
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.960]  that there are two of us this evening.
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.000]  Act one of the Bible story,
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.760]  of course, is the creation.
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:00.640]  In the beginning,
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.400]  God created the heavens and the earth.
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.320]  And I've put this as a triangle
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.240]  because there is God.
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.120]  He created the earth
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.360]  and he put human beings in it.
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.520]  Act one, all a good start.
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:10.720]  But then, of course,
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.080]  we know that everything went wrong
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.720]  because we chose
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.560]  to rebel against our Creator,
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.160]  to distrust his goodness,
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.280]  to disobey his instructions.
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.160]  And so that symbol expresses
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.240]  the sense of rebellion.
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.920]  Act two of the story
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.560]  is where all the problems begin.
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.960]  And then act three is basically
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.400]  the rest of the Old Testament.
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.960]  It's a very long act
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.760]  and there's an awful lot in it.
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.080]  And it's not just a story.
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.920]  Of course, it's full of other things
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.240]  like poetry and psalms
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.280]  and wisdom and everything else.
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.880]  But the arrow pointing forward
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.920]  has this sense of movement
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.160]  that it is going somewhere
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.760]  because it's based on
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:47.560]  God's promise,
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.080]  the promise that he made to Abraham
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.120]  that he would be a nation
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.120]  and through him the nation
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:52.760]  is to be blessed
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:53.800]  as we've been thinking
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.040]  repeatedly through these
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.280]  last couple of days.
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.600]  Act three, therefore,
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.160]  is a story which ultimately
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.640]  leads up to act four,
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.400]  which, of course, is the coming
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.680]  of the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.280]  when the God of Israel
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.400]  keeps his promise,
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.120]  enters into human history
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.000]  as a human being,
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.280]  the Word becomes flesh
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.480]  and then lives and teaches,
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:14.960]  dies the atoning death
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:15.600]  on the cross
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:16.960]  and rises again
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.560]  and returns to his father.
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.080]  So that cross symbol at the centre
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.440]  is not just the crucifixion
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.640]  but is intended to represent
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.640]  everything we have in the Gospels,
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.000]  from the conception
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.280]  by the Holy Spirit
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.800]  through to the ascension
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.440]  of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.200]  But the Bible doesn't end there,
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.080]  does it? Of course not.
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.960]  It moves on through the book of Acts
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.480]  into the outpouring of God's Spirit
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.280]  on his people,
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.840]  sending the people of God
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:43.800]  out in mission
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:44.920]  to the ends of the earth.
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.040]  We live within that era of mission
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.320]  begun in the New Testament
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.960]  and continuing to this day,
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.720]  which leads to the last two
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.240]  great acts of the story.
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.920]  I put a tick here
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.080]  for the final judgment.
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.760]  It might seem a wrong symbol,
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:07:59.480]  but in a sense,
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.520]  that is when God puts everything right.
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.560]  It's when God deals with evil,
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.680]  so evil will not have the last word.
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:07.280]  Thank God.
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.640]  The judgment is actually good news
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:10.880]  in Paul's thinking
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.080]  because it is when God rectifies
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.200]  all that went wrong
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.360]  in the story.
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.400]  And that then leads
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:18.480]  to the new creation,
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.680]  the new heavens and the new earth
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.120]  that we read about there
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.360]  in Revelation 21 and 22,
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.680]  but of course actually promised
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.440]  in the book of Isaiah.
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:29.080]  Now,that's simply trying to portray
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.720]  the whole Bible story
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:31.800]  on the back of an envelope,
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:32.480]  in a sense,
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.400]  which is where I first saw it done,
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.400]  actually with a friend of mine
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:37.840]  in the US with some other
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:38.840]  slightly different symbols,
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:39.800]  but the same idea.
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:41.040]  I've even done this
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:42.160]  on the back of a napkin
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:43.120]  in a restaurant
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.320]  sitting beside somebody
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:45.360]  and say,
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.600]  what do you think the whole Bible is?
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.920]  Well,just draw it like this.
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.360]  Here's the whole story of the Bible
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.960]  in one piece.
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.160]  And this helps us to see,
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:53.600]  of course,
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.080]  that we now,
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.480]  we are somewhere in Act 5,
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.200]  that is to say,
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.520]  we are in between
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.160]  the resurrection of Christ
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.320]  and the return of Christ.
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.120]  We are in the Bible.
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.160]  Did you know you're in the Bible?
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.040]  We are.
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.560]  We are actually participating
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.480]  in this drama.
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.600]  We are part of the story.
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.320]  This is the story we are in.
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.600]  And of course,
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.280]  this Act 5 is not the end.
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:15.880]  We know that ultimately
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.280]  this story is leading
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.840]  to a glorious future,
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.640]  which gives us hope.
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.560]  That's why I use the word hope
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.000]  in the title of the lecture.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.760]  Now,hope,of course,
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:27.400]  is one of those massive
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.880]  New Testament words.
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:29.600]  In fact,
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.840]  the Apostle Paul puts it
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:31.960]  in his favourite three,
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:32.520]  doesn't he?
[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.120]  Now abide faith,
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.680]  hope and love.
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.360]  But Christian hope
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:39.040]  is not just optimism.
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.080]  It doesn't just mean,
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.120]  oh,we like to think
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:41.760]  that everything's going
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:42.800]  to get better and better.
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.160]  That's the myth of modernity,
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.240]  that somehow human progress,
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.760]  science and wisdom
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:49.640]  will eventually
[00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:50.760]  create a better world.
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.440]  Well,Jesus told us
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.320]  that things may well get worse
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.120]  as they get better.
[00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:56.920]  In other words,
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:59.080]  the wheat of the kingdom of God
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:01.280]  and the weeds of the evil one
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:02.240]  work together
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.360]  all the way through history.
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.000]  So Christian hope
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:05.960]  is not optimism.
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.840]  Rather,it is the certainty,
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.440]  the biblical certainty
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:11.480]  that the future of this planet,
[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:12.920]  indeed,the future of the universe
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.120]  is in God's hands
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.160]  and God's sovereign purpose
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:17.320]  will be accomplished
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.080]  in the reconciliation
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.520]  of his whole creation
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.360]  and the ingathering of people
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.280]  from every tribe
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.360]  and nation and language
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.720]  and that that hope
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.240]  has indeed already
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.240]  been accomplished
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.560]  in anticipation
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:30.480]  through the cross
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.680]  and resurrection of Christ,
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:32.560]  as we shall see.
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.920]  Now,what I want us to see
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.160]  is that this sense of Christian hope
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.000]  didn't just sort of drop
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.640]  into the Apostle Paul's mind
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:41.520]  from nowhere.
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.040]  It actually comes
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.480]  very deeply rooted
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:45.720]  in his scriptures
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:48.040]  even before his conversion.
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.200]  In other words,
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.000]  Paul tells us,
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:50.360]  doesn't he,
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.680]  that he was a Hebrew-speaking Jew,
[00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:55.600]  that he was a Torah-observant Pharisee.
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.160]  He tells us that in Philippians.
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:58.800]  So he knew the scriptures.
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.080]  He probably chewed masses
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.840]  of the Old Testament by heart.
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:02.960]  So therefore,
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.360]  he knew about the God of hope
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:09.200]  as he speaks in Romans 15.
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.040]  Indeed,I think if you had asked
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.680]  Saul of Tarsus
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.760]  before his experience
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:16.760]  of the Damascus Road,
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:19.080]  what gave him hope for the future,
[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.800]  he would have taken you
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:21.840]  to some of the texts
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:22.960]  that we're just going to look at
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:23.880]  in a moment,
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:25.280]  to multiple scriptures.
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.000]  He would have believed
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.320]  that the future would include
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.520]  God's restoration of Israel.
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:30.800]  That's what would happen.
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.240]  And then after the restoration
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:33.040]  of Israel would come
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.400]  the ingathering of the nations
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.080]  and then ultimately would come
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.600]  a new heaven and a new earth,
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:38.840]  which he would have read about
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:39.560]  in Isaiah.
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:41.520]  And if you were to ask
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:42.800]  the same question
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.400]  to Saul of Tarsus
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:45.240]  after he had become
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.320]  the Apostle Paul,
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:49.240]  after his experience
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.240]  on the Damascus Road,
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.640]  then he would have done the same
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:54.040]  because he actually did.
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.000]  When he wants to talk
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.560]  about the hope that we have,
[00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:59.280]  he uses the Old Testament
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:00.400]  scriptures to do so.
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:01.920]  And that's why I wanted
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.320]  to use this text
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.880]  as a kind of control text
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.520]  here from Romans chapter 15
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.400]  because hope figures
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:09.640]  again and again in it.
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.120]  Romans chapter 15 verse 4
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.080]  says this.
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:15.360]  He says, Paul says,
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.760]  that everything that was
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:18.080]  written in the past,
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:18.840]  and of course he means
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.000]  the scriptures of what we call
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:20.720]  the Old Testament,
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.640]  was written to teach us
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.360]  so that through the endurance
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.480]  taught in the scriptures
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.360]  and the encouragement
[00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:26.960]  they provide,
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:28.680]  we might have hope.
[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.000]  Paul says the whole Old Testament
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000]  was to give us hope.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.360]  Have you ever thought of that?
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.640]  The Old Testament
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:35.560]  gives you a lot of problems
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:36.600]  and a lot of classes
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.400]  and a lot of exams
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:37.960]  and everything else.
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.720]  But Paul says
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:40.440]  the Old Testament
[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:41.280]  was given to us
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:41.960]  to give us hope.
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:44.680]  And then immediately
[00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:45.640]  in the following verses,
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:46.520]  verses 8 and 9,
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:47.560]  he summarizes
[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:48.560]  what I just described
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.000]  as Acts 3, 4 and 5
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.040]  of the biblical narrative.
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:53.080]  Because he says,
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.120]  I tell you, says Paul,
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.000]  that the Messiah Christ
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.520]  has become a servant
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:58.680]  of the Jews,
[00:12:58.680 --> 00:12:59.440]  that's the story
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:00.280]  of the Gospels, isn't it?
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.920]  on behalf of God's truth
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:03.160]  so that the promises
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.200]  made to the patriarchs
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.160]  might be confirmed
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.280]  and moreover,
[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:07.320]  that the Gentiles
[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:08.400]  might glorify God
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:09.200]  for his mercy.
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:10.480]  So Paul says,
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:11.720]  Jesus came
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:13.200]  as the servant of the Lord,
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.680]  that's Act 4,
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:16.000]  the Gospel story there,
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.080]  the cross narrative,
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:19.280]  as portrayed in Isaiah,
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:20.280]  but he had come
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:21.400]  in order to fulfill
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.240]  God's promises
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:23.080]  to the patriarchs,
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.560]  meaning, of course, Abraham.
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:26.080]  So that was Act 3
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:26.960]  of the drama.
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.000]  And he says,
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.080]  that was so that
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:30.200]  all nations,
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.000]  the Gentiles,
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.280]  would come to find
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:32.800]  their hope
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:33.720]  and their blessing
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.160]  and the glorifying God
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:35.880]  for his mercy,
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:37.360]  which was now happening
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.560]  in Act 5,
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:39.600]  because Paul was taking
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:40.760]  the Gospel to the nations
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:41.680]  and seeing the
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:43.000]  responding to God's mercy.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.760]  And then,
[00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:45.880]  in order to
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:47.120]  reinforce that
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:48.520]  climactic point,
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:48.920]  which is,
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:49.600]  let's remember that
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.200]  Romans 15
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.080]  is the climax
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:52.800]  of the whole letter.
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:54.800]  Paul didn't write
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:55.880]  a postcard to the Romans,
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:57.080]  which ended at Romans 8.
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:58.360]  He wrote a whole letter
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.040]  to the Romans,
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:13:59.760]  which comes right up
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:01.200]  to chapter 15 and 16.
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.920]  So let's hold it all together.
[00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:05.000]  He said that God's intention,
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.000]  his intention,
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.200]  from chapter 1,
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:07.960]  was to bring about
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:09.120]  the obedience of faith
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:10.000]  among the nations.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.080]  That's what the Gospel
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:11.760]  is all about.
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:12.960]  And so Paul,
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.280]  when he gets to this point,
[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:16.680]  that it's for the glory of God
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:17.760]  among the nations,
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:18.920]  throws in
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:21.280]  four Old Testament quotations
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:22.400]  immediately afterwards.
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:23.200]  I referred to this
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.200]  in an earlier lecture
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:25.280]  from the Psalms,
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:26.000]  the Torah,
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:26.720]  and the Prophets,
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:28.160]  all of which
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.800]  speak about the Gentiles,
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:30.640]  the nations,
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:32.880]  rejoicing along with Israel.
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.240]  Because now,
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.840]  under the reign of
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:36.520]  the Messiah,
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:37.480]  King Jesus,
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:38.640]  Son of David,
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:39.960]  they have hope
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:41.360]  for the future of the world.
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:42.440]  Here's how Paul
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:43.680]  concludes that list.
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:44.840]  It's in,
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:45.240]  again,
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:46.000]  still in Romans,
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:46.560]  sorry,
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:47.880]  in Romans,
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:48.720]  chapter 15.
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:49.840]  He says,
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:51.000]  "Therefore I will praise you
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.080]  among the Gentiles,
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:53.480]  rejoice you Gentiles,
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:54.160]  praise the Lord,
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:54.920]  you Gentiles.
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:56.040]  The root of Jesse
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:56.680]  will arise,
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:58.000]  and in him
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.200]  the Gentiles will hope."
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.880]  That's his climax.
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:03.360]  Hope for the world,
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:05.040]  hope for the nations,
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.320]  is the climax
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:07.200]  of the Book of Romans,
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.040]  because Jesus of Nazareth
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:10.680]  has fulfilled the promises
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:12.240]  of the Old Testament Scriptures,
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.320]  and the mercy
[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:15.320]  and the glory of God
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:16.480]  is now going to the ends
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:17.200]  of the earth.
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:19.280]  That vision is now being fulfilled
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.120]  through Christ and his victory.
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.400]  And it's being extended
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:23.800]  to every sinner
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:25.160]  and to all nations
[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:26.400]  and indeed to the whole
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:27.160]  of creation.
[00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:28.400]  So that was simply
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:29.400]  a kind of a glimpse
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:30.840]  at Romans 15.
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.880]  It's a significant passage.
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.240]  Please don't overlook it
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.960]  because you can't get past
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:37.000]  Romans 9 to 11
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:37.520]  or something.
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:39.560]  It's a very important way
[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:41.320]  in which Paul draws his letter
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:42.440]  to a conclusion.
[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.000]  So I want us to think of this
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.240]  hope then, the God of hope,
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.160]  briefly in three areas.
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:48.920]  As I said, hope for sinners,
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.320]  hope for the nations,
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:51.800]  and hope for creation.
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.320]  So first of all then,
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.520]  hope for sinners
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.920]  goes, takes us right back,
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:59.240]  of course, to the big problem
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:15:59.760]  that we have,
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:01.200]  which is in Genesis 3,
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:03.400]  which is because we chose
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:04.440]  in Adam and Eve
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:06.440]  to distrust and disobey God
[00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:08.200]  The result was sin, evil
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:08.680]  and death
[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:10.880]  and that penetrates
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:12.160]  to every dimension
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:13.800]  of the human personality.
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.840]  It's remarkable
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:17.480]  in that little story there
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.120]  in Genesis chapter 3
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:22.320]  of how when Eve is,
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:23.640]  you know, confronted
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:24.720]  by this temptation
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:25.520]  from the serpent
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:28.400]  that the evil
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:29.520]  that is somehow there
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:30.600]  and it's not explained
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:31.560]  where this has come from
[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:32.480]  or why it has happened,
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:34.280]  but it speaks into her
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:35.800]  spiritual relationship
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:36.440]  with God.
[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:37.640]  Did God really say
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:38.720]  you don't want to believe him?
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.440]  It penetrates her mind
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:42.320]  because she now rationalizes
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:43.480]  the fruit of the tree.
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:44.920]  It's good, beautiful.
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:45.640]  It's good to eat.
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:46.640]  It makes you wise.
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.240]  And then also it enters
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:49.440]  her physical body.
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:50.840]  She takes, she eats,
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:52.680]  and then it enters
[00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:54.080]  into her social relationship
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:54.720]  with her husband
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.200]  because she gives it to him.
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.760]  He was with her,
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:58.560]  the text says.
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:16:59.760]  Please notice, you men,
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:01.080]  including myself.
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.400]  Adam was not
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:03.480]  somewhere else in the garden.
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:04.800]  He was with her
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:06.080]  while this was happening.
[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:07.520]  So he was a witness to it.
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:08.840]  So sin enters
[00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:10.080]  into every dimension
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:11.280]  of the human person
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:13.320]  and indeed to all of us
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:14.520]  because as Paul would say,
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:17.280]  all of us have sinned in Adam.
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:19.120]  And so that leads, of course,
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:20.680]  to the promise of God
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.240]  in Genesis 3, verse 15,
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:23.360]  sometimes called
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:24.400]  the first gospel
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:25.640]  of the Proto-Evangelium,
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:26.960]  where God says
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.160]  even in the context
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:29.160]  of that, the fall,
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:30.880]  God says to the serpent
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:32.320]  that I will put enmity
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:33.480]  between you and the woman
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:34.920]  and your offspring and hers.
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:36.240]  He, that is,
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.360]  the seed of the woman,
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:38.440]  a human being,
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.360]  he will crush your head,
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:41.520]  the head of the serpent,
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.280]  and you will strike his heel.
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:44.600]  So there will be warfare
[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.000]  between the serpent
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.480]  and what the serpent represents
[00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.960]  and the human race
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:51.080]  represented by the seed of Eve.
[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:52.680]  But it will be a human being
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:53.560]  who ultimately
[00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:55.680]  will be the serpent crusher,
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:56.600]  as it were,
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:58.160]  and destroy that evil.
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.240]  Now, very quickly to say,
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:02.200]  the rest of the Old Testament
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.520]  shows not just the fact
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:06.200]  that we are all sinners,
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.840]  but that there is an awareness
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:10.280]  that God's forgiveness
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:11.480]  and mercy and grace
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:13.080]  is available to sinners.
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:15.080]  It's there in the Psalms
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:16.200]  at an individual level
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:17.120]  when the psalmist
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:18.560]  celebrate the fact
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:20.000]  that when they confess their sin,
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:20.880]  God forgives it.
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:23.320]  Psalm 32, Psalm 51,
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:25.480]  Psalm 130, for example.
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:28.160]  God, if you kept a record of sin,
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.240]  who could stand?
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:31.160]  But with you there is forgiveness.
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.440]  Amazing words
[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:34.280]  of personal, individual,
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:35.520]  forgiveness.
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.000]  But how is that happening?
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.240]  Well, you look at Isaiah 53,
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:40.600]  and as we saw earlier
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:41.600]  in an earlier lecture,
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:42.840]  the servant of the Lord,
[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:45.360]  the climax of those songs
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:47.000]  is when he will bear
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.480]  the sins of many,
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:49.920]  and because he would
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:50.960]  bear their sins,
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:51.880]  they would then be
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.440]  received the righteousness
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:54.960]  of God or be right with God.
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:57.720]  That's in Isaiah 53,
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:00.360]  that he took up our pain,
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:01.640]  bore our suffering,
[00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:03.440]  crushed for our transgressions
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:04.440]  and the punishment
[00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:05.760]  that brought us peace
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:06.760]  was on him
[00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:08.040]  and by his wounds
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:09.480]  we are healed,
[00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:10.760]  which of course is picked up
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:11.640]  in the New Testament
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.440]  by Jesus and by Peter.
[00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:14.800]  But the passage
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:15.920]  that I wanted particularly
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:16.720]  to take us to
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.040]  is that one on the screen
[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:19.440]  of Romans chapter 5,
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.400]  where Paul explicitly
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:22.080]  makes the link
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.560]  between the sin
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:24.400]  that entered the world
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.120]  through Adam
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:26.920]  and the forgiveness
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:28.120]  that enters the world
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:29.560]  through the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:31.440]  Romans 5, verse 12.
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:32.560]  Therefore just as sin
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:33.320]  entered the world
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:34.240]  through one man
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:35.960]  and death through sin
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:37.000]  and in this way
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.280]  death came to all people
[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:39.760]  because all have sinned,
[00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:40.840]  that's what comes
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:41.720]  into the world.
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:43.000]  Then says Paul
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:43.800]  in verse,
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.040]  a little bit later
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.080]  in verse,
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:47.120]  have I got it?
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:47.840]  19.
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:48.600]  He says,
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:49.800]  therefore just as
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:50.680]  the disobedience
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:51.560]  of the one man,
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:53.480]  many were made sinners,
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:54.920]  so also through
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:56.520]  the obedience of the one man,
[00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:57.520]  Jesus of course,
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:59.720]  the many will be made righteous.
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:01.320]  So that just as sin
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:02.440]  reigned in death,
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:03.960]  so also grace
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:04.520]  might reign
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:05.520]  through righteousness
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:06.960]  to bring eternal life
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:08.440]  through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.080]  So that's the first point
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.120]  of the hope
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:12.320]  of the future
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.600]  of eternal life
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.560]  which we have in Christ
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:16.920]  is because we can have
[00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:18.200]  our sins forgiven.
[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:19.840]  There is hope for sinners
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:20.960]  and it's promised
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:21.880]  in the Old Testament
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:23.640]  and accomplished by Jesus.
[00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:25.440]  And for some people
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:25.840]  that's it,
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:26.760]  that's the gospel,
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:28.080]  that's all we ever preach,
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.200]  which I think is true
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.880]  but very short-sighted
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:33.760]  because it's not all the Bible says
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:35.680]  about what God has accomplished
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:37.040]  through the cross of Christ
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:38.200]  because there's also,
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:38.560]  of course,
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:39.040]  secondly,
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:40.160]  hope for the nations.
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:41.280]  You see,
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.160]  the opening chapters of Genesis,
[00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:44.560]  that Act 1 and 2,
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:46.440]  present not just that
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:48.240]  all human beings are sinners
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:49.680]  but also the problem
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:50.520]  of the nations,
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:51.800]  that the nations too
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:52.560]  are scattered
[00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:53.920]  and broken and divided.
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.880]  God's got a very big problem
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:56.600]  on his hands.
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:58.240]  It's not just that we are sinned
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.520]  and the earth is cursed
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:01.040]  but that nations are also
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:02.160]  scattered and divided.
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:05.040]  And the chapters 4 to 11
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:07.120]  of Genesis show very clearly
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:09.600]  that sin isn't just personal,
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.440]  it affects society
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.920]  and cultures and generations.
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:16.560]  So much so that by the time of Noah,
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.240]  we are told several times
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:19.000]  in those chapters
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.600]  that God saw that the earth
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:22.040]  was filled with corruption
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:22.920]  and violence.
[00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:25.160]  Now those are social things.
[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.200]  That's what people do
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:26.840]  to each other.
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:28.480]  And so that's why,
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.840]  as we've been seeing earlier on,
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.760]  the promise of Genesis 12
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:32.560]  is so important
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.040]  that God says to Abraham
[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:35.720]  in the context of the Tower of Babel
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:36.680]  in chapter 11,
[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:38.360]  God says that through you,
[00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:39.920]  all nations on earth
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.160]  will be blessed,
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.640]  not just experiencing that curse.
[00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:44.960]  The blessing of God
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:47.240]  is to go far as the curse is found
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:49.560]  in Isaac Newton's great hymn,
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:50.520]  Joy to the World.
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:51.800]  Unfortunately,
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.480]  the modern translation of that hymn
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.800]  has spoiled Isaac Newton's meaning
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:57.600]  because you know that
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:58.320]  where it says,
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:00.080]  "No more at thorns and thistles
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:01.760]  grow or sin infest the ground.
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:04.280]  He comes to make his blessings flow
[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:06.320]  far as the curse is found."
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.320]  That's explicitly relating
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:10.120]  Genesis 12, 11 and 12.
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:13.720]  The more recent version of that hymn
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:15.640]  says,far as guilt,
[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:16.960]  wherever guilt is found,
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.040]  which again reduces
[00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:19.480]  theological reductionism,
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:22.240]  as if somehow God's blessing
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.840]  was only because of human guilt,
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:26.080]  whereas actually the text
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:27.480]  and what Isaac Newton was saying
[00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:28.760]  was that God's blessing
[00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:29.760]  is for the whole of creation
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:31.360]  as well, wherever the curse is found,
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:33.200]  not just wherever guilt is found.
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:35.200]  Anyway, that was an aside.
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:36.000]  It isn't in my text.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.440]  So sorry, Stephen.
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.800]  You didn't have that earlier.
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:41.280]  Now what we see then
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:42.880]  is that God's promises
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:43.960]  you see then speak of
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:45.640]  his blessing for nations
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:47.360]  as well as for individuals.
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:49.120]  And we saw some of that in the Psalms
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:50.720]  in the second lecture,
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.040]  Psalms which speak about
[00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:53.800]  all the nations you have made
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:55.000]  will come to worship you,
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.640]  all the families of the nations.
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:58.120]  But in Isaiah,
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:22:59.600]  which of course is so influential
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:00.400]  on Paul,
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:02.560]  it's particularly the case
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:04.800]  that this is seen as part of
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.160]  the hope of the reign
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:07.720]  of the Messiah, Son of David,
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:10.000]  that when he comes to reign,
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:10.920]  then it's good news
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:12.320]  for the nations specifically.
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:14.520]  So Isaiah chapter 2,
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:15.920]  when the mountain of the Lord
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:16.600]  is lifted up
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:18.280]  and all the nations
[00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:19.160]  will stream to it,
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:20.480]  many peoples will come and say,
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:21.240]  "Hey, let's go up to
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:22.840]  the mountain of Yahweh, the Lord,
[00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:24.400]  the temple of the God of Jacob.
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:26.000]  He will teach us his ways.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.640]  We will walk in his ways."
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.000]  And then he will judge
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.320]  between the nations
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:31.840]  and settle disputes.
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:32.640]  Wouldn't that be great?
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:33.760]  And they will beat
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.160]  their swords into plowshares
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:35.800]  and their spears
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:36.680]  into pruning hooks.
[00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:37.840]  And nations will not
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:39.240]  take up sword against nation.
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:40.760]  They won't train for war anymore.
[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:42.440]  What a hope for the nations,
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:43.680]  the ending of war.
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:44.560]  And that's what
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:46.040]  Isaiah specifically says.
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:47.360]  And then he repeats it
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:49.240]  in Isaiah chapter 11,
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:51.120]  that the shoot of Jesse,
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:52.560]  i.e. the Son of David,
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:54.080]  will come and it will bring
[00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:55.640]  blessing and righteousness
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.000]  and justice to the nations
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.600]  and indeed to creation.
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.160]  Isaiah chapter 60
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:01.680]  speaks about all the nations
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:03.440]  coming to worship God.
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.240]  And at the very end of Isaiah,
[00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:06.920]  in Isaiah chapter 66,
[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:08.720]  we read God saying this.
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:11.480]  God says that I,
[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:12.800]  because of what they have
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:13.680]  planned and done,
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:14.920]  I am about to come
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:16.000]  and gather the people
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.840]  of all nations and languages
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:19.040]  and they will come
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.360]  and see my glory
[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.000]  and I will set my sign
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:22.560]  among them.
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:23.560]  And then it says,
[00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:25.160]  they will proclaim my glory
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:26.360]  among the nations.
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:27.120]  So you see,
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:28.080]  when Paul talks
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:29.200]  in Romans 15,
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:31.640]  about the hope of the nations,
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:34.120]  of the God of that hope,
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:35.680]  it's speaking about all the nations
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:37.440]  and it comes from the Old Testament
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:38.320]  and it comes,
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:38.720]  of course,
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:39.480]  to its climax,
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:40.680]  as you can see on the screen
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:41.840]  in Romans chapter,
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:43.800]  in Revelation chapter 7,
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:44.920]  verses 9 and 10.
[00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:46.440]  I've referred to this earlier
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:47.800]  where John says that
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:49.360]  there I saw a great multitude
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:50.560]  from every tribe,
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:51.280]  nation,
[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:52.480]  people and language
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:54.080]  standing before the throne
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:55.320]  and before the Lamb.
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.520]  That's there in Revelation 7
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:58.840]  and it isn't forgotten
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:24:59.760]  in the rest of the book
[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:02.440]  because in Revelation 21,
[00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:03.800]  we read this
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.440]  in verses 24 to 26
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:06.640]  that the nations
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:08.600]  will walk by its light,
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:10.360]  that is the light of the city of God
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:11.880]  and the kings of the earth
[00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:13.080]  will bring their splendor
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:14.720]  into the city of God.
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:16.400]  The glory and the honor
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:17.520]  of the nations
[00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:18.320]  will be brought
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:19.320]  into the city of God.
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:20.560]  Now that's astonishing
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:21.680]  because all through
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:22.760]  the book of Revelation,
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:24.680]  the kings and the nations
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:25.800]  are the bad guys.
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:26.880]  They're the ones
[00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:28.320]  who are in rebellion against God.
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:29.280]  They're persecuting
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:30.200]  the people of God.
[00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:31.040]  They've got the blood
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:32.200]  of the martyrs on their hands.
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:35.280]  So in some radical transformation,
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:37.080]  the kings and the nations
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:37.680]  of the world
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:40.320]  are there in this new creation
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:41.240]  as nations,
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:42.800]  as kings bringing their glory
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:44.320]  into the kingdom of God.
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:45.800]  So much so that
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:47.080]  the book of Revelation
[00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:48.360]  can end almost
[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:49.760]  in its closing verses
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:50.880]  in chapter 22
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:52.400]  with the tree of life
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.320]  and the leaves of the tree
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:56.240]  are for the healing
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:57.240]  of the nations.
[00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:58.840]  An incredible statement
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:25:59.720]  there right at the end
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:00.320]  of the Bible.
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:01.600]  So from the old
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:02.640]  through to the new,
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:03.640]  there is hope.
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:05.520]  Hope not only for sinners,
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:07.240]  but hope for the nations.
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:08.440]  Now,
[00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:10.880]  I don't know what that means.
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:12.080]  I don't know how to
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:14.120]  get my head around that
[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:14.720]  in terms of
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:15.880]  what is that going to mean
[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:17.000]  in our human history.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.480]  It's bigger than I can imagine.
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:20.560]  That's because it comes from God.
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:22.320]  And God is always bigger
[00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:23.200]  than we can imagine.
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:24.680]  But it gives us hope
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:25.440]  for the future,
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:26.320]  for this planet,
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:28.440]  that God ultimately has a plan
[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:29.760]  that will bring blessing,
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:30.200]  peace,
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:30.720]  healing
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.400]  and the end of war and strife
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:33.680]  to the nations of this world.
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:34.280]  Isn't that good?
[00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:35.040]  Good news.
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:35.640]  Hallelujah.
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:36.320]  Thank you.
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:38.040]  But more than that,
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:38.600]  finally,
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:40.960]  there is hope for creation itself.
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:42.200]  You see,
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:42.880]  again,
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:43.800]  God's big problem
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:45.000]  wasn't just that Adam and Eve
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:45.640]  had sinned.
[00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:47.280]  It wasn't just
[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:48.840]  that the nations were scattered,
[00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:49.720]  but that he said,
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:50.960]  "Cursed is the earth,
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:52.440]  the ground because of you."
[00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:54.880]  There is something in creation
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:56.080]  that is not the way
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:57.280]  it was intended to be.
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:58.640]  Now,
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:26:59.640]  there's all sorts of ways
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:00.400]  of talking about that
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:01.440]  that I don't want to go into,
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:02.760]  but the apostle Paul
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:03.960]  in Romans 8 agrees.
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:05.320]  He says that creation
[00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:07.520]  was subjected to frustration.
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:10.160]  He uses the word "mataiotes,"
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:11.360]  which is the same
[00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:12.360]  in the Greek translation
[00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:13.920]  of Ecclesiastes' Hevel,
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:15.600]  which was translated "vanity."
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:16.720]  It's all something
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:17.840]  about this world
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:18.880]  which is,
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:19.680]  you know,
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:20.440]  frustrated
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:21.720]  and not the way it should be.
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:22.720]  Yes,
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:23.880]  we can say that creation
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:25.000]  gives glory to God,
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:25.880]  and indeed,
[00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:27.040]  the Psalms will tell us that.
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:27.880]  The whole creation
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:29.640]  is singing the praises
[00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:30.520]  and glory of God,
[00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:31.240]  and yet,
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:32.640]  even though it is doing that,
[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:33.160]  it's still,
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:33.880]  in some sense,
[00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:35.160]  frustrated in it.
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:36.680]  And I have to say
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:37.440]  that there are times
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:38.000]  when I look out
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.320]  at the glories of our world
[00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:40.600]  on a wonderful day
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:41.280]  or the mountains
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:42.440]  or the grandeur
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:43.480]  of some great scene,
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:44.520]  and I say to myself,
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:44.880]  "Wow,
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:46.200]  if this is what it looks like
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:47.080]  when it's frustrated,
[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:48.520]  what's it going to look like
[00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:49.360]  when it's liberated
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:51.560]  in God's new creation?"
[00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:52.440]  So,
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:53.680]  the creation itself,
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:53.840]  then,
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:54.160]  is frustrated,
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:55.600]  but God says,
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:57.080]  in both the Psalms
[00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:57.920]  and in Isaiah,
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:59.880]  that his plans are indeed
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:01.520]  for a whole new heaven
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:02.280]  and a new earth,
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.360]  not in the sense
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:04.720]  of a complete replacement
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:05.400]  heaven and earth,
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:06.520]  but a renewal,
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:07.560]  a restoration
[00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:08.720]  of what the earth
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:09.720]  was intended to be.
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:14.320]  So read Isaiah 65:17-25.
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:14.520]  Yes,
[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:15.000]  there it is.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:15.640]  See,
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:16.840]  I am creating,
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:17.400]  says God.
[00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:18.320]  It's a participle.
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:19.840]  I am creating new heavens
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:20.680]  and a new earth.
[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:23.240]  And then it describes
[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:24.160]  that new heavens
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:24.680]  and new earth
[00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:26.120]  in the most wonderfully
[00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:27.360]  earthy language.
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:29.360]  It talks about human life,
[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:30.920]  about family.
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:31.960]  It talks about work.
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:32.520]  It talks about
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:33.400]  building houses
[00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:34.520]  and vineyards
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:36.320]  and satisfaction
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.120]  and no more frustration
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:38.640]  in our work
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:39.000]  and so on.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.120]  It's a wonderful picture
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:41.480]  of the new creation
[00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:42.880]  there in Isaiah 65.
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.640]  It's repeated in chapter 66.
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:45.320]  And of course,
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:46.440]  it influenced John
[00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:48.360]  in Revelation chapter 21
[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:50.440]  of the new creation.
[00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:51.760]  But it's also there
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:52.720]  in the Psalms
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:53.400]  and elsewhere
[00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:54.800]  where the psalmist
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:56.360]  portrays the whole of creation
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:57.200]  as rejoicing.
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:57.960]  And,
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:58.640]  you know,
[00:28:58.640 --> 00:28:59.000]  yes,
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:28:59.840]  it's poetic.
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:02.120]  And we need to understand it
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:03.280]  in that sense.
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:04.600]  But it is still
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:05.520]  pretty marvelous
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:06.920]  that when you have said
[00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:08.320]  among the nations
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:09.520]  that the Lord reigns,
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:10.400]  the kingdom of God
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:11.560]  in among the nations,
[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:13.640]  then let the heavens rejoice,
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:14.720]  let the earth be glad,
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:15.720]  let the sea resign
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:16.360]  and all that's in it.
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:17.960]  Let the fields be jubilant
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:18.720]  and everything in them.
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:20.080]  Let all the trees of the field
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:21.520]  sing for joy.
[00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:23.360]  Let all creation
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:25.000]  rejoice before the Lord.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:25.680]  Why?
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:26.880]  Because he's coming.
[00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:28.280]  Because he comes.
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:29.480]  And what's he going to do?
[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:30.840]  He comes to judge
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:32.400]  the world with righteousness.
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:33.520]  In other words,
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:35.400]  he's coming to put things right.
[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:36.760]  Because that's what it means
[00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:38.040]  when God acts as judge.
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:39.480]  He gets things sorted out.
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:40.480]  He puts things right.
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:42.200]  And the whole of creation
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:42.880]  is rejoicing
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:44.040]  and waiting for that day
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:45.920]  when God puts everything right.
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:46.520]  That's,
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:46.880]  I think,
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:48.040]  what influenced Paul
[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:49.080]  in Romans 8
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:50.600]  when he says in Romans 8
[00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:52.040]  verses 18 to 25
[00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:53.600]  that the whole of creation
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.800]  is just longing for that day
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:57.800]  when it will be liberated
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:00.200]  at the same time as we experience
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:01.720]  the redemption of our bodies.
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:03.240]  Paul puts together
[00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:04.640]  the resurrection of the body
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:06.520]  with the redemption of creation.
[00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:08.080]  That's a fascinating parallel.
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:09.440]  It's actually very important
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:11.160]  when people try to think of,
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:11.720]  well,
[00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:13.400]  what is the new creation
[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:14.120]  going to be like?
[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:14.480]  Well,
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:15.200]  it's going to be like
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:16.520]  our resurrection bodies.
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:18.240]  And our resurrection bodies
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:19.480]  are like the body of Jesus
[00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:20.560]  who was risen from the dead.
[00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:22.120]  And when you ask,
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:22.640]  well,
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:24.000]  the risen Jesus,
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.040]  was he the same
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:26.400]  as the earthly Jesus
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:26.920]  or different?
[00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:27.480]  Yeah,
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:28.000]  both.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.080]  It was the same Jesus.
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:31.200]  They recognized him.
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:33.080]  They saw the wounds in his hands
[00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:34.120]  and his feet and his side.
[00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:35.480]  So it was the same Jesus.
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:35.840]  And yet,
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:37.880]  it was a resurrected Jesus.
[00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:40.240]  He was a whole new mode of being
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:41.880]  in the new creation,
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:43.480]  the first fruits of the new creation.
[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:44.680]  And so in that sense,
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:45.080]  I think,
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:46.600]  when we talk about the new heavens
[00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:47.320]  and the new earth,
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:48.680]  will it be just like this old heaven?
[00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:49.280]  Well,
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:50.080]  yes and no.
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:51.200]  It will be this earth.
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:52.200]  It will be this heaven.
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:54.360]  But it will be now restored,
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:55.640]  refreshed,
[00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:56.400]  renewed,
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:57.040]  cleansed,
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:57.720]  purged
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:59.200]  in the new creation.
[00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:00.560]  That's what I think Paul
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:02.000]  was talking about in Romans 8.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.320]  And he says that's already
[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:04.120]  been accomplished
[00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:06.960]  in Colossians 1:15-20.
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:08.520]  That marvelous passage
[00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:09.200]  where Paul,
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.520]  it's just incredible
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:11.120]  what he says.
[00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:12.600]  About five times
[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:14.440]  he talks about all things,
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:16.520]  all things in heaven and earth.
[00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:18.200]  He couldn't make it any more clear
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:18.920]  that he's talking about
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:19.880]  the whole of creation.
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:22.000]  And he says Christ is the origin.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:22.760]  He's the head.
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:23.760]  He's the source.
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:24.880]  He holds it all together.
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:26.440]  And through him,
[00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:27.280]  through Christ,
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:29.440]  God was pleased to reconcile
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:31.200]  to himself all things,
[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:32.360]  whether things in earth
[00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:33.200]  or things in heaven,
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.640]  by making peace
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:37.120]  through his blood shed on the cross.
[00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:38.880]  Have you ever thought about that?
[00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:40.320]  That the cross is cosmic
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:41.240]  in its scope.
[00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:43.120]  It brings me salvation,
[00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:44.280]  brings you salvation.
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:45.800]  It also brings salvation
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:46.800]  to the whole of creation.
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:49.040]  So we're not going to be saved
[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:50.080]  out of this world.
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:51.680]  I wish we didn't have
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:52.960]  so many hymns and songs
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:53.520]  which talk about
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:54.560]  going somewhere else.
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:55.760]  You know,
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:57.840]  they're really not biblical.
[00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:58.840]  In fact,
[00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:00.880]  I get my music leaders
[00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:01.480]  at All Souls
[00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:02.920]  to change the words sometimes.
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:05.120]  Even great hymns like,
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:05.640]  you know,
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:08.320]  How great thou art!
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:09.720]  When Christ shall come
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:10.960]  with shout of acclamation
[00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:11.920]  and take me home.
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:13.000]  He's not coming
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.200]  to take me anywhere.
[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:17.160]  He is coming to make his home here.
[00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:18.240]  So we sing that
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:19.240]  when Christ shall come
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:20.360]  and make his home.
[00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:21.160]  That's the way we sing it
[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:21.720]  at All Souls
[00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:22.840]  because that's what it says
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:23.360]  in the Bible.
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:25.280]  The Bible does not end
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:27.160]  with us going up to heaven.
[00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:28.520]  The Bible ends
[00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:30.120]  with God bringing heaven to earth,
[00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:32.080]  bringing the city of God here.
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:34.120]  Then the dwelling place of God
[00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:35.520]  will be with us,
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:37.840]  it says in Revelation 21,
[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:38.960]  three times.
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:40.480]  Revelation 21
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:42.360]  is the great Emmanuel fulfillment,
[00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:43.480]  God with us.
[00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:45.520]  Emmanuel means God with us,
[00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:46.440]  not us going somewhere
[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:47.160]  to be with God,
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:48.960]  but God coming to restore
[00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:49.800]  his creation
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:52.280]  in Revelation 21 and 22.
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:54.280]  We could go on about that.
[00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:55.360]  Perhaps the last thing
[00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:56.280]  to say then is
[00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:57.800]  very close to the end
[00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:58.320]  of the Bible
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:32:59.920]  in Revelation 22,
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:00.560]  verse 3,
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:02.840]  immediately after it says
[00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:04.440]  that the leaves of the tree
[00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:05.480]  will be for the healing
[00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:06.480]  of the nations,
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:08.160]  the next verse says
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:09.880]  no longer will there be
[00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:11.240]  any curse.
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:13.120]  The curse on the earth
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:14.160]  will be gone
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.480]  in the new creation.
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:17.000]  So therefore,
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.520]  we need our whole Bible,
[00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:19.960]  I will end by saying
[00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:22.040]  to tell us who we are,
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:24.240]  to tell us why we're here,
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:26.480]  to tell us how we should live,
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:27.960]  and to tell us
[00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:29.240]  what we can look forward to
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:31.560]  in the hope of sinners,
[00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:32.520]  of the nations,
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:33.640]  and of creation.
[00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:35.360]  So may the God of hope
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:38.720]  fill you with all joy and peace
