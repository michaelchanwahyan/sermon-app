1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,500
My name is Daniel Lee.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,900
I teach systematic theology at CGST here.

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:16,900
It's my great privilege to introduce our honored speaker,

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:20,500
Professor Nguyen Van Mugman tonight.

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,100
Actually, Professor Nguyen Van Mugman

7
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:28,100
does not need an introduction.

8
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,100
He has long been distinguished

9
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:36,400
as one of the most acclaimed theologians of our time

10
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,600
since the publication of his celebrated

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,800
Theology of Hope in 1964.

12
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,300
He is the architect of post-Auschwitz theology

13
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:54,300
as well as a pioneering voice in political theology,

14
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,300
ecological theology,

15
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:00,100
feminist and Jewish-Christian dialogue.

16
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:04,300
He demonstrates a life that has dedicated itself

17
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,100
to seeking a Christian response

18
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:11,600
to the turmoil and opportunities of our time.

19
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,100
His publication list is breathtaking in length

20
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:20,700
and many of his books are immensely influential.

21
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:26,500
So just name a few.The Crucified God in 1974.

22
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:32,100
The Church in the Power of the Holy Spirit,1977.

23
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,900
The Trinity and the Kingdom of God in 1981.

24
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,100
God in Creation in 1985.

25
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,300
The Way of Jesus Christ in 1990.

26
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,700
The Spirit of Life in 1992.

27
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,900
The Coming of God in 1996.

28
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:56,100
Experiences in Theology in 1999.

29
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,900
Ethics of Hope,2010.

30
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:03,500
Professor Mugman truly has great delight

31
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,500
and vitality in writing.

32
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,500
We've been told that he's going to publish

33
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:14,500
a new book on Christian patients this year.

34
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,700
So in his profound theological works,

35
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:22,300
there has been a great passion for life.

36
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:26,500
This reminds me of a beautiful prayer

37
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:32,500
I have read in Professor Mugman's autobiography.

38
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,100
It serves a quotation here.

39
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,700
Quote, "When I love God,

40
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,100
I love the beauty of bodies,

41
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,700
the rhythm of movements,

42
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,700
the shining of eyes,

43
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,500
the embraces,

44
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,700
the feelings,

45
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,100
the sense,

46
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:53,900
the sense of all these protein creation.

47
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,100
When I love you, my God,

48
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,700
I want to embrace it all,

49
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,500
for I love you with all my senses

50
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,500
in the creations of your love.

51
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,100
In all the things that encounter me,

52
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,700
you are waiting for me."

53
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,900
The experience of God

54
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,300
deepens the experiences of life.

55
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,100
It does not reduce them,

56
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,300
for they are ways

57
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:24,500
the unconditional yes to life.

58
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,300
The more I love God,

59
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,100
the more gladly I exist.

60
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,700
The more immediately and wholly I exist,

61
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,700
the more I sense the living God,

62
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,500
the inexhaustible source of life

63
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,900
and eternal livingness."

64
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,900
End quote.

65
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,700
Such a great passion for life

66
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,700
is why we are so thankful

67
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,300
to have him in our midst tonight

68
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,500
and to listen to his insights

69
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,700
on the topic,

70
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,300
a culture of life

71
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,500
in the dangers of our time.

72
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,900
So please join me

73
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,700
and offer our warm welcome

74
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,100
to Professor Yungel Mokhmar.

75
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:08,300
Thank you, Professor Daniel Lee,

76
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:12,900
for your kind words of introduction

77
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,900
and of welcome.

78
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,900
In this lecture,

79
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,900
ladies and gentlemen,

80
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,900
I would like to introduce

81
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,900
the famous professor,

82
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,900
Professor Daniel Lee.

83
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,900
Ladies and gentlemen,

84
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,900
I grapple with what have been

85
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,900
my most urgent concerns

86
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,900
for some time,

87
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,900
a culture of life

88
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:50,900
stronger than the terror of death,

89
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,900
a love for life

90
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,900
that overcomes

91
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,900
the destructive forces

92
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,900
in our world today

93
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,900
and a confidence

94
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,900
in the future

95
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,900
that overcomes anxiety

96
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,900
and fatalism.

97
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,900
These issues are for me

98
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,900
most urgent

99
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,900
because with a poet,

100
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,900
Friedrich Hölderlin,

101
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,900
I believe strongly

102
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,900
that where there is danger,

103
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,900
salvation also grows.

104
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,900
We should inquire

105
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,900
whether it,

106
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,900
to what extent,

107
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,900
this hope will wait

108
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,900
as we explore the possibilities

109
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,900
of a culture of life

110
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,900
and of a future.

111
00:05:54,900 --> 00:06:00,900
In the face of the real annihilation

112
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:05,900
with which our world is threatened,

113
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,900
I will begin by addressing

114
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,900
some of the dangers of our time

115
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,900
in part one.

116
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,900
And in part two,

117
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,900
I will offer some answers

118
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,900
by considering dimensions

119
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,900
of the world

120
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,900
capable of supporting life

121
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,900
and in a quite literal sense,

122
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:41,900
a world that is worth of our love.

123
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,900
And in the end,

124
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:47,900
I'll return to the first verse

125
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:52,900
of the poem by Hölderlin.

126
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,900
Life is God,

127
00:06:54,900 --> 00:07:00,900
but difficult to grasp.

128
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,900
Part one.

129
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:08,900
The terror of universal death.

130
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,900
Number one.

131
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:16,900
Life is today in danger.

132
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,900
It is not in danger

133
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,900
because it is mortal.

134
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:27,900
Human life has always been mortal.

135
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,900
It is in danger

136
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:34,900
because it is no longer loved,

137
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:40,900
in respected and affirmed and accepted.

138
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:44,900
The French author Albert Camus

139
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,900
wrote after World War II,

140
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:52,900
This is the mystery of Europe.

141
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:57,900
Life is no longer loved.

142
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,900
The 20th century

143
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:06,900
was a century of mass exterminations

144
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,900
and mass executions.

145
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:15,900
State terror from above.

146
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,900
The beginning of the 20th,

147
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,900
21st century

148
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:28,900
saw private terror from below

149
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,900
of senseless killings

150
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:36,900
with suicide assassins.

151
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:43,900
In the terror rest of the 21st century,

152
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:49,900
a new religion of death is confronting us.

153
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:55,900
I do not mean the religion of Islam,

154
00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:01,900
but rather the ideology of terror.

155
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,900
Your young people love life,

156
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:13,900
said the late Mullah Omar of the Taliban in Afghanistan.

157
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:18,900
Our young people love death.

158
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:26,900
After the mass murder in Madrid on March 11, 2004,

159
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:32,900
there were acknowledgments by the terrorists

160
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,900
with the same message.

161
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:42,900
You love life, we love death.

162
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:48,900
A German who joined the Taliban in Afghanistan

163
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:53,900
declared, "We don't want to win.

164
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:58,900
We want to kill and be killed."

165
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:07,900
Why? I think because they view killing as power

166
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:16,900
and they experience themselves as gods over their enemies

167
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:27,900
and they love publicity and this they get.

168
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:33,900
This seems to be the modern terrorist ideology

169
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:38,900
of suicide assassins.

170
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:44,900
I remember we had this love of death in Europe

171
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:52,900
some 70 or 80 years ago.

172
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:59,900
"Viva la muerte" cried an old fascist general

173
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:03,900
in the Spanish Civil War.

174
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,900
Long live death.

175
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:13,900
And the German SS troops in the Second World War

176
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:20,900
had the saying, "Death gives and death takes away."

177
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:27,900
And wore the symbol of the skull and the bones.

178
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:35,900
It is not possible to deter suicide assassins

179
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:40,900
for they have broken the fear of death.

180
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,900
They don't love life anymore.

181
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:50,900
They want to die with their victims.

182
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:58,900
Second, behind this terrorist ideological surface

183
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:04,900
a greater danger is hidden.

184
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:12,900
Peace, disarmament, and non-proliferation

185
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:17,900
treaties between the nations

186
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,900
share an obvious assumption

187
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:29,900
namely that on both sides there is a will to survive

188
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:33,900
and a will to live.

189
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:39,900
Yet what happens if one partner

190
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,900
does not want to survive

191
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:49,900
but is willing to die is through death.

192
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:55,900
That partner can destroy this whole wicked

193
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,900
or godless world.

194
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:04,900
Until now we have had to deal only

195
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:14,900
with an international network of suicide assassins

196
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:18,900
overcome by a death wish.

197
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:26,900
What happens when a nation possessing nuclear weapons

198
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:32,900
becomes obsessed with this religion of death

199
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:39,900
and turns into a collective suicide assassin

200
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:44,900
against the rest of the human world

201
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:49,900
because it is driven into a corner

202
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,900
and gives up all hope.

203
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:57,900
Deterrence works only so long

204
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:02,900
as all partners have the will to live

205
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:06,900
and want to survive.

206
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:15,900
When it is of no matter whether one lives or dies

207
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:24,900
one has lost the fear that is necessary for deterrence.

208
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:33,900
Whoever is convinced for ideological or religious reasons

209
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:39,900
that he or she must become a sacrifice

210
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:43,900
in order to save the world

211
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:48,900
can no longer be threatened with death.

212
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:57,900
The one who clamors for the great war or the end war

213
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:03,900
even if it means one's own destruction

214
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:08,900
is beyond deterrence.

215
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:13,900
The attraction of destroying a world

216
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:22,900
that is considered rotten or disordered or godless

217
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:30,900
can obviously grow into a universal death wish

218
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:37,900
to which one sacrifices one's own life.

219
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:43,900
Death then becomes this fascinating divinity

220
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:49,900
inflaming a desire for destruction.

221
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:54,900
This apocalyptic religion of death

222
00:15:54,900 --> 00:16:00,900
is a real enemy of the will to live

223
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:09,900
the love of life and the affirmation of being.

224
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:17,900
Number three, the suicide program.

225
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:22,900
Behind this present political danger

226
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:28,900
endangering the common life of the nations

227
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:35,900
there is still an older threat lurking

228
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:39,900
the nuclear threat.

229
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:45,900
The first atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima

230
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,900
in August 1945

231
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:55,900
brought the world war to an end.

232
00:16:55,900 --> 00:17:00,900
At the same time is marked the beginning

233
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:07,900
of the end time for the whole of humankind.

234
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:11,900
The end time is in the age

235
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:20,900
in which the end of humankind is possible at any moment.

236
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:27,900
No human being could survive the nuclear winter

237
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:35,900
that would follow a great atomic war.

238
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:41,900
Remember humankind was at the cusp

239
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:45,900
of such a great atomic war

240
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,900
for more than 40 years

241
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:52,900
during the cold war time.

242
00:17:52,900 --> 00:18:01,900
It is true that since the end of the cold war in 1990

243
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:08,900
the great atomic war is not as likely.

244
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:16,900
We live in relative peace.

245
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:24,900
Yet there are so many atomic and hydrogen bombs

246
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:30,900
stored up in the arsenals of the great nations

247
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,900
and some smaller ones as well

248
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:40,900
that the self annihilation of humankind

249
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:46,900
remains a distinct possibility.

250
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:52,900
The Russian atomic scientist Sakharov

251
00:18:52,900 --> 00:19:00,900
called it collective suicide of humankind.

252
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:07,900
Whoever fires first dies second.

253
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,900
For those 40 years

254
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:21,900
we depended on mutual destruction for security.

255
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:27,900
Most people had forgotten this atomic threat

256
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:38,900
until President Barack Obama in 2009 speech

257
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:42,900
lived in Prague

258
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:51,900
revived the old dream of the world free of atomic bombs

259
00:19:51,900 --> 00:20:01,900
and started new disarmament negotiations with Russia.

260
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:14,900
But in 2017 Donald Trump threatened North Korea

261
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:24,900
with fury and fire with atomic bombs.

262
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:32,900
Then many of us became aware again of this destiny

263
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:38,900
hanging like a dark cloud over the nations.

264
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:47,900
Strangely enough we feel the presence of the nuclear threat

265
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:58,900
publicly in what American psychologists call nuclear numbing.

266
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:02,900
We repress our anxiety

267
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:06,900
try to forget this threat

268
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:13,900
and live if this danger were not there.

269
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:22,900
Yet it is gnawing at our subconsciousness

270
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:29,900
in impairing our love of life.

271
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:36,900
Number four, the social conditions of misery.

272
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:43,900
A general impairment of life also exists

273
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:48,900
in the miserable social conditions.

274
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:54,900
For more than 40 years we have heard repeatedly

275
00:21:54,900 --> 00:22:04,900
and everywhere the charge that despite of all political efforts

276
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:12,900
the social gap between the rich and the poor is widening.

277
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:20,900
It is not just in the poorer countries of the third world

278
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:27,900
that a small rich sector of the population

279
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:33,900
rules over the masses of the poor.

280
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:38,900
In the democracies of the developed world

281
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:51,900
the financial asset gap between financiers on the one hand

282
00:22:51,900 --> 00:23:01,900
and low income workers, welfare recipients, the unemployed

283
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:12,900
and those not able to work on the other hand takes on obscene proportions.

284
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:20,900
Yet democracy is grounded not only in the freedom of the citizens

285
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:30,900
but also in the equality without social justice in life opportunities.

286
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:39,900
In the comparability of life circumstances

287
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:50,900
the common will dies and with it what holds a society together falls apart.

288
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:54,900
Trust is lost.

289
00:23:54,900 --> 00:24:07,900
Since the democratic revolutions in England, the United States and France

290
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:14,900
the political task in the European states

291
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:25,900
has been the balancing of individual freedom and social equity.

292
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:34,900
The deregulation of the economy and fiscal institutions

293
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:45,900
wrought by American politics with all its destructive consequences

294
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:53,900
has led to an imbalance between freedom and equality

295
00:24:53,900 --> 00:25:00,900
that has become life threatening for many people.

296
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:08,900
It has led to the disempowerment and poverty.

297
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:16,900
A capitalism that is no longer politically controllable

298
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:25,900
through the common wealth becomes an enemy of democracy

299
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:33,900
because it destroys the common meaning of a society.

300
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:41,900
Climbing on the social ladder brings anxiety.

301
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:48,900
In the modern competitive society

302
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:56,900
the loser creates the force of the winner.

303
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:01,900
The winner creates the anxiety of life.

304
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:06,900
The anxiety of life creates nothing

305
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:15,900
but the anxiety of existence for modern human beings.

306
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:25,900
Yet is anxiety a good incentive for life, for work and for happiness?

307
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,900
I doubt.

308
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:39,900
At the end, the ecological conditions of world destruction

309
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:52,900
unlike the nuclear threat, climate change is not only a threat

310
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:59,900
but already an emerging reality everywhere.

311
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:05,900
It is not only a latent problem

312
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:13,900
but also very much a matter of public consciousness.

313
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:24,900
People know it because they can see it, feel it and sometimes smell it.

314
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:34,900
The biosphere of the planet Earth is the only space we have for life.

315
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:46,900
The globalization of the human civilization has reached its limits

316
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:55,900
and is beginning to alter the conditions of life on Earth.

317
00:27:55,900 --> 00:28:01,900
The destruction of the environment

318
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:10,900
that we are causing through our present global economic system

319
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:21,900
will undoubtedly, seriously jeopardize the survival of humanity

320
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:25,900
in the 21st century.

321
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:37,900
Modern industrial society is thrown out of the balance,

322
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:44,900
the equilibrium of the Earth organism

323
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:52,900
and is on the way to the universal ecological death.

324
00:28:52,900 --> 00:29:00,900
Unless we can change the way things are developing.

325
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:10,900
Year after year, vulnerable species of animals and plants die out.

326
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:26,900
Scientists have shown that certain chemical emissions are destroying the ozone layer

327
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:37,900
while the use of chemical fertilizers and a multitude of pesticides

328
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:47,900
is polluting our drinking water and making the soil infertile.

329
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:54,900
They have shown that the global climate is already changing

330
00:29:54,900 --> 00:30:04,900
so that we are now experiencing an increasing number of

331
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:09,900
so-called natural catastrophes

332
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:21,900
such as droughts and floods, expanding deserts and incessant storms.

333
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:34,900
These are not simply natural but also caused by human activities.

334
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:40,900
All in all, life on Earth is under threat.

335
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:45,900
Why is this so?

336
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:56,900
This is some irony, I say, some do not know what they are doing

337
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:04,900
while others do not know what they are knowing.

338
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:13,900
This ecological crisis is fundamentally a crisis

339
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:22,900
wrought by the Western scientific and technological civilization.

340
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:32,900
Yet it is a mistake to think that our environmental problems

341
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:41,900
are problems for the industrialized countries of the region.

342
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:51,900
On the contrary, ecological catastrophes are increasing even more

343
00:31:51,900 --> 00:32:03,900
in the midst of a rising global economic and social crisis in their development.

344
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:16,900
Indira Gandhi was right when she said poverty is the worst pollution.

345
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:25,900
Despite the well-known document of limits of growth,

346
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:33,900
the ideology of permanent growth continues.

347
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:39,900
We know all this, but we are paralyzed

348
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:47,900
and do not change our economy or our lifestyle.

349
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:55,900
This paralysis will be called ecological numbing.

350
00:32:55,900 --> 00:33:01,900
Nothing accelerates an imminent catastrophe

351
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:08,900
so much as the paralysis of doing nothing.

352
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:20,900
We do not know whether humanity will survive this self-made destiny.

353
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:25,900
This is actually a good thing.

354
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:35,900
If we knew with certainty that we would not survive,

355
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:38,900
we would do nothing.

356
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:44,900
If we knew with certainty that we will survive,

357
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:48,900
we would also do nothing.

358
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:55,900
Only if the future is open for both possibilities

359
00:33:55,900 --> 00:34:05,900
are we forced to do today what is necessary to survive tomorrow.

360
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:13,900
We cannot know whether humankind will survive,

361
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:22,900
so we must act today as if the future of life depends on us

362
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:33,900
and trust at the same time that our children will survive.

363
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:41,900
But must a human race exist and survive

364
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:49,900
or are we just an accident of nature?

365
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:53,900
We can ask cynically,

366
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:59,900
didn't the dinosaurs come and go?

367
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:07,900
So it ends with the question of existence,

368
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:13,900
whether humanity should be or not be.

369
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:19,900
That is a humbled question of our days.

370
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:27,900
More than 8 billion human beings already live on earth today.

371
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:34,900
This number will likely grow rapidly.

372
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:40,900
An alternative for the future

373
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:47,900
is that the earth could be uninhabited.

374
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:52,900
The earth existed without human beings

375
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:58,900
for more than millions of years

376
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:04,900
and may survive perhaps for millions of years

377
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:10,900
after the human race disappears.

378
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:16,900
This raises the even deeper question,

379
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:22,900
are we human beings on earth only by chance

380
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:33,900
or are we human beings a necessary result of the evolution?

381
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:41,900
If nature would show a strong anthropic principle,

382
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:49,900
we could feel at home in the universe with Stuart Kaufman.

383
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:59,900
If such a stark anthropological principle cannot be proved,

384
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:09,900
the universe gives no answer to this existential question of humankind.

385
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:24,900
Looking to the universe for an answer to the question of a reason for being,

386
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:32,900
we encounter the sad conjecture of Steven Weinberg.

387
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:38,900
The more the universe seems comprehensible,

388
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:45,900
the more it also seems pointless.

389
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:50,900
The silence of the world's expanses

390
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:59,900
and the coldness of the universe can lead to our despondence.

391
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:06,900
In any case,neither the stars nor our genes

392
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:15,900
say whether human beings should be there or not.

393
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:25,900
How can we love life and affirm our being as humans

394
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:31,900
if humanity is only an accident of nature,

395
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:39,900
so perfidious and without relevance for the universe,

396
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:46,900
but is only a mistake of the evolution?

397
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:54,900
Is there a duty to be as Hans Jonas claimed?

398
00:38:54,900 --> 00:39:04,900
Is there any reason to love life and affirm human beings

399
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:13,900
if we find no answer to this existential question

400
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:21,900
every culture of life is uncertain in its fundamentals

401
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:26,900
and built on shaky grounds?

402
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:31,900
With this I start part two.

403
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:39,900
A culture of life must be a culture of common life

404
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:45,900
in the human and the natural world.

405
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:54,900
First point,can we live with a bomb?

406
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:58,900
Are the dangers growing faster

407
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:04,900
than what can save us?

408
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:11,900
I think we can grow in wisdom,but how?

409
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:19,900
President Obama's dream of a world without atomic weapons

410
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:25,900
is an honorable one,but only a dream.

411
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:32,900
Human beings will never again become incapable

412
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:36,900
of what they can do now.

413
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:44,900
Whoever has learned the formula of atomic fission

414
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,900
will never forget.

415
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:52,900
Since Hiroshima in 1945,

416
00:40:52,900 --> 00:41:01,900
human kind has lost its atomic innocence.

417
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:06,900
Yet the atomic end time

418
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:13,900
is also the first common age of the nations.

419
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:21,900
All the nations are sitting in the same boat.

420
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:26,900
We all share the same threat.

421
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:33,900
Everyone can become the victim.

422
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:37,900
In this new situation,

423
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:42,900
human kind must organize itself

424
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:47,900
as the subject of common survival.

425
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:55,900
The foundation of the United Nations in 1945

426
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:58,900
was a first step.

427
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:03,900
International security partnership

428
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:10,900
can serve peace and give us time to live.

429
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:13,900
And someday,

430
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:21,900
perhaps a transnational unification of humankind

431
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:29,900
will keep the means of nuclear destruction under control.

432
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:34,900
By science and technology,

433
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:40,900
we learned to gain power over nature.

434
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,900
But by wisdom,

435
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:50,900
we learned to gain moral control of our powers.

436
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:58,900
The development of public and political wisdom

437
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:07,900
is as important as the scientific progress.

438
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:12,900
The first lesson we learned is this.

439
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:20,900
Deterrence does not secure peace anymore.

440
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:29,900
Only justice serves peace between the nations.

441
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:34,900
There is no way to peace in our world

442
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:38,900
except through just action

443
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:44,900
and harmonious balance of interests.

444
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:49,900
Peace is not the absence of violence,

445
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:56,900
but the presence of justice.

446
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:59,900
Peace is a process,

447
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:04,900
not a property of one nation.

448
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:11,900
Peace is a common way of reducing violence

449
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:16,900
and constructing justice

450
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:26,900
in the social and global relationships of humankind.

451
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:29,900
Point two.

452
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:36,900
Social justice creates social peace.

453
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:43,900
The gap between the poor and the rich widens.

454
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:52,900
But the alternative to poverty is not poverty.

455
00:44:52,900 --> 00:45:01,900
The alternative to poverty and poverty is community.

456
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:05,900
One can live in poverty

457
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:11,900
when it is born in common with others

458
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:14,900
as was the case in Europe

459
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:22,900
in the years of hunger after the World War II.

460
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:31,900
It is injustice that makes poverty insufferable.

461
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:37,900
The spirit of communal solidarity

462
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:42,900
and mutual help was demolished

463
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:46,900
by the flight from Texas

464
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:53,900
which in turn aroused the anger of the people.

465
00:45:53,900 --> 00:46:01,900
If everyone is in the same situation

466
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:06,900
then all give mutual help.

467
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:16,900
Remove equality because one wins and the other loses

468
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:22,900
then mutual help also vanishes.

469
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:27,900
By community I here mean

470
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:34,900
the visible community of solidarity

471
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:41,900
as well as the inner togetherness of society

472
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:47,900
in social balance and social freedom.

473
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:53,900
It is not in the end the football games

474
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:57,900
that unite a society.

475
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:01,900
It is social justice

476
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:08,900
that creates lasting social peace.

477
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:12,900
The individualism that says

478
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:22,900
everyone is his or her own neighbor

479
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:30,900
looking out for himself and herself

480
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:35,900
makes the human beings powerless.

481
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:39,900
The fragmenting of work

482
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:44,900
by making it temporarily insecure

483
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:47,900
and without benefits

484
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:53,900
harms the life planning of those

485
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:58,900
at the mercy of the system

486
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:02,900
and destroys their future.

487
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:07,900
In communities of solidarity

488
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:12,900
human beings are strong and wealthy

489
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:17,900
that is wealthy in relationships

490
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:20,900
with neighbors and friends

491
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:24,900
companions and colleagues

492
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:28,900
of which one can depend.

493
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:34,900
They are thus made strong

494
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:37,900
by being recognized

495
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:41,900
and by being esteemed as worthy.

496
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:45,900
Many helpful actions

497
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:50,900
emerge in such communities

498
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:55,900
as child care, care of the sick

499
00:48:55,900 --> 00:49:00,900
and care of the aged, associations

500
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:07,900
of the handicapped and the health peace movement.

501
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:11,900
Market position and competition

502
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:17,900
are certainly strong incentives for work

503
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:23,900
but they remain humane

504
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:28,900
only in the framework of a common life

505
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:33,900
and that means only in the bounds

506
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:39,900
of social and ecological justice.

507
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:43,900
There are dimensions of life

508
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:47,900
that may not be determined

509
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:51,900
by the market logic

510
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:56,900
because they follow other laws.

511
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:04,900
Patients are not customers of doctors and nurses

512
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:10,900
and students are not consumers of science

513
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:16,900
and research in our universities.

514
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:26,900
Security must not be a private property

515
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:30,900
and the reverence for life

516
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:34,900
because human society

517
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:40,900
is a natural environment

518
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:45,900
for a total life system

519
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:51,900
where there is a crisis of dying in nature

520
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:57,900
a crisis of the whole life system

521
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:01,900
emerges as well.

522
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:08,900
We call today the ecological crisis

523
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:14,900
is not only a crisis in our environment

524
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:20,900
but also a total crisis of our life system

525
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:28,900
and cannot be solved by technological means alone.

526
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:35,900
It also demands a change in our lifestyle

527
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:40,900
and a change in the basic values

528
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:45,900
and convictions of our society.

529
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:50,900
Modern industrial societies

530
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:53,900
are no longer in harmony

531
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:59,900
with the cycles and rhythms of the earth

532
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:07,900
as was the case in pre-modern agrarian societies.

533
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:16,900
Modern societies are predicated on progress

534
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:22,900
and expansion of the projects of humanity.

535
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:29,900
We reduce the nature of the earth

536
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:33,900
to our environment

537
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:40,900
and destroy the life space of other forms of life.

538
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:46,900
Nothing works so much destruction

539
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:56,900
as with using nature to more than an environment for humans.

540
00:52:56,900 --> 00:53:06,900
We need a change from modern domination of nature

541
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:10,900
to the reverence for life

542
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:14,900
as Albert Schweitzer teaches us.

543
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:23,900
Reverence for life is respect for every single form of life

544
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:31,900
and for our common life in the human and the natural world

545
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:37,900
and for the great community of all the living.

546
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:43,900
The post-modern life centrism

547
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:49,900
will have to replace the western and modern

548
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:54,900
anthropocentrism of culture.

549
00:53:54,900 --> 00:54:03,900
Of course we cannot return to the cosmos orientation

550
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:10,900
of the ancient and pre-modern agrarian world

551
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:17,900
but we can begin the necessary

552
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:25,900
ecological transformation of our industrial world.

553
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:32,900
For this we must change our concept of time.

554
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:37,900
The linear concept of progress

555
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:43,900
in production, consumption and waste

556
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:50,900
has the future, the present and the past

557
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:58,900
must give way to the concept of the cyclical time

558
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:03,900
of renewable energy

559
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:08,900
and the recycling economy.

560
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:13,900
Only this cycles of life

561
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:20,900
can give stability to our world of progress.

562
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:25,900
Yet as long as the children of Ghana

563
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:29,900
bear the burden of recycling

564
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:33,900
or electronic scrap

565
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:39,900
we must say that the recycling economy

566
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:46,900
is still the economy of the poor people.

567
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:59,900
The 2000s charter points in the right direction.

568
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:03,900
Humanity is part of nature

569
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:08,900
or other life forms of nature

570
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:13,900
have their worth independent of their worth

571
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:16,900
for human beings.

572
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:19,900
We are part of nature

573
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:23,900
and can only survive

574
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:32,900
by preserving nature's integrity.

575
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:40,900
The last part, the love of life in times of danger.

576
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:46,900
Human being is not only a gift of life

577
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:52,900
but also a task of being human.

578
00:56:52,900 --> 00:57:00,900
To accept this task of humanity in times of terror

579
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:07,900
requires the strength of life

580
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:11,900
and the courage to be.

581
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:17,900
Life must be a front against terror

582
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:20,900
to say simply

583
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:25,900
life must be lived

584
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:29,900
and then the beloved life

585
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:32,900
will be stronger

586
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:39,900
than the threat of universal annihilation.

587
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:46,900
I see three major factors

588
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:50,900
for this courage to be

589
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:54,900
and this courage to live.

590
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:59,900
First, human life must be affirmed

591
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:06,900
because it can also be denied.

592
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:13,900
As we know, a child can only grow

593
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:20,900
and live in an atmosphere of affirmation

594
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:25,900
and an atmosphere of rejection

595
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:32,900
that child will fade away in soul and body.

596
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:37,900
If experiencing affirmation

597
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:41,900
is the occasion for a child

598
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:47,900
to affirm himself or herself.

599
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:50,900
What is true for a child

600
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:53,900
is true for human beings

601
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:56,900
throughout their lives.

602
00:58:56,900 --> 00:59:03,900
We are accepted, appreciated and affirmed.

603
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:07,900
We are motivated to live

604
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:13,900
where we feel a hostile world of contempt

605
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:17,900
and rejection and mistrust.

606
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:25,900
We retire into ourselves and become defensive.

607
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:31,900
We need a strong affirmation of life

608
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:37,900
that can deal with such negations of life.

609
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:42,900
Each year to life is stronger

610
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:47,900
than every negation of life

611
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:52,900
because it can create something new

612
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:56,900
against the negations.

613
00:59:56,900 --> 01:00:02,900
Second, human life is participation.

614
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:05,900
We become alive

615
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:10,900
where we feel the sympathy of others

616
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:13,900
and we stay alive

617
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:18,900
where we share our life with others.

618
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:24,900
As long as we are interested, we are alive.

619
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:30,900
The counterproof can be easy to make.

620
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:35,900
Indifference leads to apathy

621
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:41,900
and apathy is a sickness unto death.

622
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:46,900
Complete lack of participation

623
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:51,900
is completely unlived life.

624
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:56,900
Third, human life is a life

625
01:00:56,900 --> 01:01:01,900
in the pursuit of fulfillment.

626
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:06,900
Human life gains its dynamic

627
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:11,900
from this inborn striving.

628
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:15,900
The pursuit of happiness

629
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:20,900
is since the writing of the Declaration

630
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:24,900
of Independence of America

631
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:29,900
one essential human right

632
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:33,900
to pursue one's happiness

633
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:38,900
is not only a private human right

634
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:43,900
but also a public human right.

635
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:47,900
We speak of a good life

636
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:50,900
and we mean a life

637
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:55,900
that lives out its best potential

638
01:01:55,900 --> 01:02:01,900
in the public life of a good society.

639
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:08,900
When we take this pursuit of happiness seriously

640
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:13,900
we encounter the misfortune

641
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:18,900
of the masses of poor and sick people

642
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:24,900
and to begin to suffer with the unfortunate.

643
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:29,900
The compassion by which we are drawn

644
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:33,900
into their passion of life

645
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:41,900
is the reverse side of the pursuit of happiness.

646
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:49,900
The more we become capable of the happiness of life

647
01:02:49,900 --> 01:03:00,900
the more we become also capable of sorrow and compassion.

648
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:07,900
This is the great dialectic of human life.

649
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:14,900
But where there is danger, salvation also grows.

650
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:19,900
How is salvation growing?

651
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:28,900
I've tried to show how being can take in non-being

652
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:35,900
and how life can overcome death through love

653
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:43,900
and how deadly contradictions can change into a life.

654
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:49,900
And how death can change into a protective differences

655
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:57,900
and higher forms of living and community.

656
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:04,900
Near is God and difficult to grasp.

657
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:11,900
Here at the end I will allow the theologian

658
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:17,900
with declarations of Christian faith.

659
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:25,900
Should humanity be or I be superfluous?

660
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:33,900
Is there a duty to survive or our life and death

661
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:38,900
simply take or leave it matter?

662
01:04:38,900 --> 01:04:43,900
In the evolution of life,

663
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:52,900
are we an accident or a mistake of life?

664
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:58,900
The existential questions of humankind

665
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:05,900
are not only answered by rational arguments.

666
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:12,900
But first of all by pre-rational assurance

667
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:21,900
or a lack of assurance that leads the interest of our reason.

668
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:26,900
Difficult to grasp is God.

669
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:38,900
Not because God is distant from us human beings

670
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:47,900
but rather near and therefore difficult to grasp.

671
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:55,900
What is near indeed nearer to us than we ourselves

672
01:05:55,900 --> 01:06:00,900
is not to be grasped by us.

673
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:07,900
We would need distance for that.

674
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:14,900
If we were however grasped by the nearness of God

675
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:23,900
we would know the answer to our existential questions.

676
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:29,900
In the eternal yes of the living God

677
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:36,900
we affirm our fragile and vulnerable humanity

678
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:43,900
in spite of death and say yes to life.

679
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:47,900
In the eternal love of God

680
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:55,900
we love life and resist its devastations.

681
01:06:55,900 --> 01:07:02,900
In the ungraspable nearness of God

682
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:12,900
we trust in what is saving even if dangers are growing.

683
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:15,900
Here ends the lecture.

684
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:24,900

685
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:26,900
