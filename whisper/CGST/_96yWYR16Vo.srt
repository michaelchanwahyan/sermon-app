1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (gentle music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:16,120
 - Good afternoon.

3
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:21,080
 Honorable guests, speakers,

4
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,180
 CGST family, brothers and sisters.

5
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,720
 It is my pleasure to welcome everyone

6
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,720
 to the CGST Josephine Soh Culture and Ethics Lecture Week.

7
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:36,400
 The CGST Josephine Soh Culture and Ethics Lectures

8
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,920
 are sponsored by the Josephine Soh Foundation.

9
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,520
 Every two years, we invite overseas scholars

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,960
 and church leaders to speak on issues regarding Christianity,

11
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,760
 culture and ethics that are of concern to Chinese believers.

12
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,040
 This year, we have the honor and privilege

13
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,480
 in welcoming Dr. Christopher Wright,

14
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,960
 Global Ambassador and Ministry Director

15
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,600
 of the Land-Game Partnership.

16
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,480
 He will be our keynote speaker

17
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,040
 for all four sessions of the lectures.

18
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,440
 We are grateful that Dr. Wright is present in person

19
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,900
 to speak to us, which we know

20
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,840
 is no longer given during COVID times.

21
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,120
 The theme for his lecture this week is "Written for Us,

22
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:26,120
 "The Old Testament as Christian Scripture."

23
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,600
 In this afternoon's first lecture,

24
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,280
 Dr. Wright will talk about the Old Testament

25
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,360
 and Christian identity.

26
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,200
 Who are we?

27
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,400
 After his speech, I will introduce our two correspondents

28
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,200
 who will give their responses, followed by time for Q&A.

29
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,320
 Now, please join us in welcoming Dr. Christopher Wright.

30
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,480
 (audience applauding)

31
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:58,640
 - Thank you.

32
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,360
 Thank you.

33
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,920
 Thank you so much, Professor Lee, for your welcome

34
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,680
 and to CGST for having me back.

35
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,800
 It's lovely to be here again.

36
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,440
 I remember standing at this podium several times

37
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,760
 in the past and enjoying both some teaching

38
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,640
 and some lecturing over the years.

39
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,560
 So it's good to be back and back in Hong Kong

40
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,560
 and grateful to God that things have made it possible

41
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,800
 these days to do so.

42
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,880
 It is, of course, an honor as well to bring you greetings

43
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,160
 from my home city of London, where I live.

44
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,520
 That's London, England, not Ontario, London, England.

45
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,320
 And from my church, All Souls Church, Langham Place,

46
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,560
 from which the Langham Foundation here in Hong Kong

47
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,120
 gets the name, not from the hotel

48
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,840
 or from any shopping center,

49
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,360
 but from just the place where John Stott's church

50
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,080
 still is, All Souls Church, Langham Place.

51
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,320
 And so that's who I also represent

52
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,560
 and bring you greetings from them.

53
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,880
 And it is, of course, also a great honor

54
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,160
 to be invited to give these lectures,

55
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,280
 the Josephine Soh Lectures.

56
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,320
 And Simon Chung was giving me a little bit of background

57
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,680
 as to who she was and how influential she was

58
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,160
 and as the founder of the Breakthrough Center as well,

59
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,080
 where I've also had the privilege of staying

60
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,280
 several times in past years.

61
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,160
 So here we are then, as Professor Lee said,

62
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,200
 with the title written for us,

63
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,320
 The Old Testament as Christian Scripture.

64
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,280
 And some of you will know that that's my own field,

65
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,120
 is Old Testament studies, and particularly

66
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,000
 in their relevance to Christian ethics and mission.

67
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,920
 So I'm going to be reading my lecture

68
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,320
 because I find that's the best way

69
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,440
 that I can make sure I keep on topic and roughly on time,

70
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,120
 and also so that my very esteemed responders

71
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,200
 won't hear anything different from what they've already read,

72
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,160
 which I'm sure is to their relief.

73
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,160
 So here is our first title,

74
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:57,400
 The Old Testament and Christian Identity, Who Are We?

75
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,920
 You see, the problem is that it's sadly true these days

76
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,720
 that many Christian believers wonder

77
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,720
 whether the Old Testament is really relevant to themselves.

78
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,280
 Or even if they accept that the Old Testament

79
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,160
 is part of the Bible and they ought to take it seriously,

80
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,640
 they struggle with how it relates

81
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:20,280
 to what they think of as their Christian faith.

82
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,520
 Is the Old Testament really compatible

83
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,080
 with Christianity, they think?

84
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,880
 Which is not only sad, but also deeply ironic,

85
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,960
 because putting the question that way round

86
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,800
 is the diametric opposite to the problem

87
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,560
 that was faced by the earliest followers of Jesus.

88
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,240
 You see, their question was not,

89
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,720
 as it is for so many today,

90
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,840
 is the Old Testament compatible with Christianity,

91
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,720
 rather they wrestled with the reverse question

92
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,240
 in their faith and their claims,

93
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,960
 namely, is the Christian church that we have formed,

94
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,080
 is it compatible with the scriptures?

95
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,320
 That is to say, they did not judge the scriptures,

96
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,920
 the authoritative word of God that they had

97
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,080
 in what we now call the Old Testament

98
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,000
 in the light of the Christian faith, but the reverse.

99
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,720
 They evaluated their Christian claims

100
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,560
 in the light of what we now call the Old Testament,

101
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,280
 the scriptures that they had.

102
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,200
 And that was especially so in relation

103
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,760
 to this whole new multi-ethnic reality

104
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,560
 of Jews and Gentiles together claiming

105
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,720
 to be the covenant people of God

106
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,480
 without observing Jewish identity criteria

107
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,680
 such as circumcision or Sabbath observance or food laws.

108
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,120
 How could you justify that scripturally, in other words?

109
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,000
 Well, the apostle Paul, as we know,

110
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,680
 devotes the whole of the letter to the Galatians

111
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,840
 and some of the letter to the Romans to that very issue.

112
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,200
 And in these four lectures, I want to follow Paul's example,

113
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,140
 which is a good thing to do, I'm sure,

114
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,000
 as well as the example of Peter

115
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,080
 and indeed of Jesus himself in exploring

116
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,640
 how the Christian faith, that is the faith of the church,

117
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,480
 is deeply rooted and grounded

118
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,280
 in the Old Testament scriptures

119
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,480
 and therefore how our Christian faith,

120
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,400
 that is what we personally believe about ourselves

121
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,160
 and God, needs to be intentionally informed

122
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,920
 by those scriptures, which were our scriptures,

123
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,240
 I want to say, not written to us, of course,

124
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,720
 but certainly, as Paul says, written for us.

125
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,840
 And because the Old Testament is so vast

126
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,040
 and there are so many ways one could tackle this,

127
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,320
 I wanted to take this single theme

128
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:34,200
 of who are we as the church, as the people of God?

129
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,280
 What is our identity, our mission, our ethics,

130
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,800
 and our hope?

131
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,760
 And in each case of those four things,

132
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,640
 I want us to see that the New Testament itself

133
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,280
 draws profoundly on the scriptures,

134
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,080
 the scriptures of the Old Testament,

135
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,540
 in articulating its answers to those great themes.

136
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,860
 So here then is indeed the first one,

137
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,000
 the Old Testament and Christian identity,

138
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,840
 who are we, we as Christians, as the people of God?

139
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,620
 And I want to answer it in two ways,

140
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,080
 broadly speaking, over these next minutes.

141
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,600
 First of all, to say that we are a people

142
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,520
 who have been formed by God's story,

143
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:17,800
 and secondly, that we are a people created for God's glory.

144
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,080
 So first of all, a people formed by God's story,

145
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,400
 and secondly, a people created for God's glory.

146
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,760
 We think of both of those.

147
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,720
 So here's the first then,

148
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,420
 we are a people formed by God's story.

149
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,920
 Now, the story of God, of course,

150
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,640
 begins right at the beginning.

151
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,560
 In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth,

152
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,320
 and so this whole universe that we inhabit is,

153
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,640
 we are told, the creation of the one living personal God

154
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:51,400
 who made it good, created us human beings in his own image

155
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,760
 in order to rule over the earth on his behalf,

156
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,360
 in a sense, as kings within creation in Genesis 1,

157
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,420
 and to serve and to care for the earth,

158
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:04,480
 as he says to Adam in chapter two.

159
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,360
 So this is indeed the first thing

160
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,080
 we would have to say about ourselves

161
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,560
 if we're asking the question, who are we?

162
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,320
 Well, we are human beings created in the image of God

163
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,240
 and intended to function as God's kings and priests

164
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,240
 within God's creation, ruling and serving on God's behalf.

165
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,880
 That is a role which we'll see once or twice

166
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,800
 as we go through these lectures, kings and priests,

167
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,120
 which we meet again in the case of Israel in Exodus 19,

168
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,040
 and again in the identity of the church

169
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:39,880
 in 1 Peter chapter two, and eschatologically

170
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,400
 in the book of Revelation at the very end of the Bible

171
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,920
 as the redeemed humanity from all nations

172
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,880
 whom God will have made kings and priests for him.

173
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,120
 So the story of creation, but then, of course,

174
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,840
 as we know with the entrance of sin and evil

175
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,720
 into human life, this all went wrong.

176
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,560
 Everything was fractured, broken, and distorted.

177
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,380
 Why?

178
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:05,440
 Because we chose, we chose to rebel against our creator,

179
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,480
 to substitute our own moral autonomy for his authority.

180
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,600
 We would choose what it is to be good or evil

181
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,800
 and not depend on God, and so we have brought

182
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,920
 into this world all manner of personal and social sin,

183
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,120
 fear, anger, violence, injustice, oppression, corruption,

184
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,920
 and it's all there.

185
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,040
 It's early in the Bible, it's Genesis four to 11.

186
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,340
 So we exploit, we pollute, we destroy the earth

187
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,340
 that God told us to care for,

188
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,340
 and we fight and kill one another.

189
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:40,340
 And so that story, that early story of the fall

190
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:44,420
 comes to its climax in chapter 11 with the Tower of Babel

191
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:48,080
 where God, in order to prevent humanity

192
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,140
 from frustrating his purposes, which was that we should

193
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,900
 scatter and fill the earth, which was happening

194
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,380
 in Genesis 10, we wanted to stop that

195
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,660
 by this arrogant homolinguistic unity

196
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,300
 of the Tower of Babel.

197
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:05,940
 God confuses human languages, scatters the nations anyway,

198
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,640
 but scatters them in division and misunderstanding

199
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,560
 of one another.

200
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:13,980
 So by the end of that part of the Bible story, Genesis 11,

201
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,060
 we find a humanity that is fractured and divided,

202
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:20,580
 scattered over the face of an earth that has been cursed.

203
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,300
 So is there any hope for humanity?

204
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,660
 But the story continues, doesn't it?

205
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,660
 The great Bible story moves from creation through fall

206
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,820
 to redemption within history,

207
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,820
 leading to its ultimate climax in the new creation.

208
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,300
 And that is a story that takes us

209
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,820
 through the rest of the Bible,

210
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:39,100
 from Genesis 12 to Revelation 22,

211
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,220
 centered, of course, on the cross

212
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,740
 and the resurrection of Jesus Christ.

213
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,180
 And it will come to its climax when Christ returns

214
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,580
 to reign over the new creation.

215
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,060
 And the great thing about this story

216
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:55,620
 is that it involves humanity, who we are,

217
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,820
 in this world of nations from beginning to end.

218
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,740
 In Genesis 11, the nations of the world

219
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:06,740
 are united in arrogance, but then scattered in confusion.

220
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:10,460
 Whereas in Revelation 7, they will be gathered

221
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,780
 as a great multitude whom no one could count,

222
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:15,460
 from every nation, tribe, people, and language,

223
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,860
 but they will be gathered in unity

224
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,640
 to worship the Lord who was on the throne,

225
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,660
 the Lamb of God himself.

226
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,500
 And that picture there in Revelation,

227
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,940
 at the end of the Bible, the end of the story,

228
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,620
 is, of course, a portrait of the church.

229
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:33,280
 It is us, the multinational community

230
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,500
 of God's redeemed humanity.

231
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,160
 And that takes you right back to the promise

232
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,540
 that God first made to Abraham,

233
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:44,100
 that through him all nations on earth would be blessed.

234
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,560
 So we are the people, then, in that sense,

235
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,100
 who have been created within and for this story,

236
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,860
 this story of God, this story of God's purposes

237
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,100
 for the earth, his creation,

238
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,220
 and for all the nations who live on it.

239
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,340
 That's who we are.

240
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:05,580
 We are that redeemed people of God within the Bible story.

241
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:09,560
 But let's look at that in just a little bit more detail

242
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:13,460
 from two other perspectives, as you can see on the screen,

243
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:17,220
 that we are also the community, or we learn from,

244
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:20,180
 the community of Abraham in the book of Genesis,

245
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:23,080
 where God first talks about bringing blessing

246
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,360
 to all the nations and his descendants.

247
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,860
 And then also from Abraham, of course,

248
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:31,740
 we are from the community of Israel of the Old Testament.

249
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:36,580
 What was their story that helps us to understand ours?

250
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,280
 So what, then, can we learn about this community

251
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,880
 from the call of Abraham and those early stories?

252
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,220
 I want to suggest four things,

253
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,740
 as you can see on the screen,

254
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,440
 that we are a community of blessing,

255
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,300
 of faith, obedience, and hope.

256
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:55,260
 We see all of those four things in the story of Abraham,

257
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:59,100
 and they also are the marks of the people of Abraham,

258
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,080
 the seed of Abraham, as Paul calls us.

259
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,980
 First of all, a community of blessing.

260
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:09,980
 Now, blessing was indeed God's first word to creation,

261
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,220
 apart from the word of creation itself.

262
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,280
 You remember there, back in Genesis 1,

263
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:19,280
 he successfully blesses his own acts of creation.

264
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,760
 And then, after the flood,

265
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,760
 God blesses Noah with a covenant with all life on earth.

266
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,540
 So blessing comes back, in a sense,

267
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,840
 into creation with Noah.

268
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,760
 But then, as you know, the repeated sin and failure

269
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,120
 that goes on in the following chapters

270
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,360
 seems to reinforce what chapter three had said

271
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,660
 about God's curse on the earth.

272
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:46,060
 Where can blessing be found

273
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,660
 in a world which lies under God's curse?

274
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,460
 Even Noah's own father was worried about that.

275
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:55,020
 Oh, that God would lift the curse from the earth.

276
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,080
 And so, with Abraham,

277
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,640
 when the language of blessing comes back,

278
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,420
 and God says, "I will bless you,

279
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,960
 "and you will be a blessing,

280
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,460
 "and through you, all nations will be blessed,"

281
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,860
 there is, in a sense, a fresh start there,

282
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,980
 in Genesis chapter 12.

283
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,920
 But the point I want to make here is

284
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:16,260
 that that blessing is not just a blessing received,

285
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,500
 but a mandate that, through you,

286
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:22,460
 all nations will be blessed, will come into blessing.

287
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:25,560
 So here, then, is a community, God's people,

288
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,280
 who both experience the blessing of God

289
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:32,060
 and are the means of that being passed on to others.

290
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:35,740
 Blessing received and blessing shared

291
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,200
 is part of the very essence

292
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,600
 of what it means to be the people of God.

293
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,320
 If we are to live within the story that God puts us in,

294
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,340
 then being a people of blessing is part of our identity.

295
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,520
 We could spend the rest of the day

296
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,160
 just talking about what that would mean in practice,

297
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,800
 but I think, in principle, it's very important.

298
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,680
 Then, secondly, a community of faith,

299
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,920
 because we are told, aren't we,

300
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,000
 that Abraham believed God,

301
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,460
 and it was credited to him as righteousness.

302
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:08,340
 That's what it says in Genesis 15, verse six,

303
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,340
 and, of course, Paul quotes that

304
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:14,120
 in Galatians, chapter three, verse six.

305
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,240
 When he is showing how we are within Abraham,

306
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,620
 he makes that connection between the faith

307
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,020
 and the righteousness of Abraham.

308
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,440
 Hebrews, of course, also strongly highlights

309
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,800
 Abraham as a man of faith,

310
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,880
 has a lot about Abraham's faith in Hebrews 11,

311
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:34,320
 "Having earlier said," Hebrews, that is, "about Enoch,

312
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,540
 "that without faith it is impossible to please God."

313
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:41,940
 So the community, then, that stems from Abraham

314
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:46,460
 must be a people who will trust the promise of God

315
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:49,700
 rather than trusting in their own ability

316
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,020
 to build something for their own security,

317
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,980
 which they tried to do at Babel.

318
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:56,620
 Remember, in chapter 11, there we find a people

319
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:00,660
 who want to build a tower for themselves, as it were,

320
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:04,360
 and God says, "Now I will bless you if you will trust me,

321
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:08,320
 "that through you all nations will be blessed."

322
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,360
 So Abraham, then, as a man of faith,

323
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,960
 as a believer in God's promises,

324
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:16,840
 is one of the reasons why one of the earliest names

325
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:20,120
 for Christians, even before they were called Christians,

326
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,920
 is that we are believers.

327
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,160
 We are people of faith.

328
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,520
 We are called to participate in the story of God,

329
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:32,000
 God's plan for creation, God's plan for humanity.

330
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,900
 It's a story which has a future, a future new creation,

331
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,800
 and when we enter into that story,

332
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,960
 we put our faith in the God of the story

333
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,280
 and say, "I believe that God will accomplish

334
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,080
 "what he will accomplish,"

335
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,280
 because he has already proved it, of course,

336
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,840
 in the cross and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ.

337
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,340
 So a community of blessing, of faith,

338
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,840
 and thirdly, of obedience.

339
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:01,440
 It was because of his faith that Abraham obeyed God.

340
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,600
 In fact, Romans stresses that,

341
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,200
 so does Hebrew, so does James in his letter.

342
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,560
 Abraham got up, he left his homeland,

343
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,800
 he went out at God's command,

344
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:16,200
 and in the supreme test, in Genesis chapter 22,

345
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,680
 he was even prepared to sacrifice his own son,

346
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:23,680
 the son of the promise, in order to obey God

347
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,200
 until God intervened to stop him.

348
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,520
 And you remember that the way in which Hebrews

349
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,320
 interprets that is that Abraham must have even believed

350
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,840
 that God had the power to raise the dead,

351
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,240
 because if the promise of God was going to be fulfilled

352
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,840
 through Isaac, then somehow Isaac must survive

353
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,580
 in order to have descendants.

354
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:46,640
 So Abraham was prepared to believe God and to obey God,

355
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,120
 and in fact, God then comments on that

356
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,360
 in Genesis chapter 22, after he has stopped Abraham

357
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,960
 from actually sacrificing his son.

358
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,080
 God says twice at the beginning and the end of that section,

359
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,160
 he says, "Because you have obeyed me,

360
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,160
 "because you have done this,"

361
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,400
 God renews his promise and his oath

362
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,480
 to bring blessing to the nations.

363
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,120
 And so that's why, as I said, in Hebrews 11

364
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:16,440
 and James chapter two, they set Abraham's obedience

365
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,520
 alongside Abraham's faith as the proof

366
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,520
 of his authentic relationship with God,

367
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,400
 which then both Paul and Hebrews and James

368
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,200
 all emphasize as being fundamental to Christian experience

369
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,040
 and Christian imitation, belief and obey.

370
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,760
 And then fourthly, a community of hope,

371
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,400
 because you see that promise of God to Abraham,

372
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,320
 that through, that he would become a great nation

373
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,040
 and that through his people,

374
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,080
 all nations on earth would experience blessing,

375
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,440
 that remained the foundation for Israel's hope

376
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,920
 for the future all through the succeeding generations

377
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:59,520
 and centuries, even in times of the most appalling

378
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,040
 unfaithfulness, even in times of God's judgment,

379
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:08,040
 they knew that God would not, could not abandon his people.

380
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,260
 Or at least he could not do it

381
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,720
 without breaking his covenant with Abraham.

382
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,080
 And he couldn't break his covenant with Abraham

383
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,960
 because that had been sworn on God's own self,

384
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:21,440
 by myself have I sworn, says the Lord.

385
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,900
 So God was eternally committed by his own existence

386
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,120
 in a sense to keep his promise to Abraham.

387
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,560
 And that promise of course, included not only

388
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,560
 that Israel would be a people

389
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,980
 and therefore they would continue as a people,

390
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:38,120
 but that through him all nations on earth

391
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,520
 would find blessing.

392
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,080
 And so the hope of Israel, as Paul would put it later,

393
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,600
 is indeed hope for the world.

394
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,920
 That's why Simeon with baby Jesus in his arms

395
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,660
 could say that he was seeing the Lord's salvation,

396
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,680
 not just the glory of his people Israel,

397
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,180
 but a light to lighten the nations.

398
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,920
 The mission of God through Abraham

399
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,200
 generates the mission of God's people

400
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,120
 to the ends of the earth.

401
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,040
 And of course, we think more about that

402
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:09,000
 in the next lecture later this afternoon,

403
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,700
 when we're thinking about the mission of God's people.

404
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,680
 So to summarize then this part of our lecture,

405
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:19,280
 the church, when we trace our roots back to God's call

406
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,000
 and promise to Abraham,

407
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 finds here some key identity marks or markers

408
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,400
 that are established right there at the beginning

409
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,880
 of the story in the book of Genesis.

410
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,000
 As the seed of Abraham,

411
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,480
 we are a community that not only experiences

412
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,180
 the blessing of God,

413
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:40,100
 but are commissioned to be the means of blessing others.

414
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,380
 We are a community that live by faith

415
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,380
 in the promises of God,

416
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:47,580
 and prove that faith by practical

417
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,960
 and sometimes sacrificial obedience to God.

418
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,100
 And it is a community of hope,

419
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,660
 a hope for the future,

420
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,100
 which is guaranteed because God is sovereign

421
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,880
 and will always keep his word.

422
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,660
 So that's something that we learn

423
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,740
 simply from the book of Genesis,

424
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:07,260
 and the way it is then applied in the New Testament.

425
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,980
 But I wanted to move on secondly,

426
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,540
 on the screen as you can see,

427
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,420
 to Israel's story,

428
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:15,660
 the ongoing story of the Old Testament.

429
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:18,100
 Because if the church as the biblical people of God

430
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,660
 began really with Abraham, as we did,

431
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,260
 then we need to give some attention

432
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:27,220
 to the rest of that Old Testament part of our story.

433
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:30,780
 And to look at some of the significant moments

434
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,700
 in that story of Israel,

435
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,740
 and the theological inferences

436
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:38,460
 that are then drawn from that story and those events

437
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,460
 in terms of the relationship with God,

438
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,780
 and then how they are reflected

439
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,940
 in what the New Testament says

440
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,860
 about the Christian church's existence

441
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,100
 and our mission in the world.

442
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,180
 Now, just at this point as a slightly as an aside,

443
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,020
 but I think a quite an important one.

444
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:58,340
 I want to be very clear that this is not as

445
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:02,060
 I'm sometimes accused of a super sessionist argument,

446
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,580
 that is a replacement theology,

447
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:07,580
 as if to say that the Christian church

448
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:11,540
 has simply replaced the Jews in the plan of God.

449
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:14,020
 As some people say, well, God had the Jews up to here,

450
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,300
 got fed up with them, now he's got the Christians.

451
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,540
 That kind of very simplistic super sessionism

452
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,260
 is not what I'm saying.

453
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:25,340
 Rather, what the New Testament does affirm

454
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,820
 is that that Old Testament, as we call it,

455
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:31,140
 that scriptural story of Israel

456
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:35,340
 has found its climax, its life, and its fulfillment

457
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:40,140
 in the life and death and resurrection of Israel's Messiah,

458
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:44,140
 Jesus of Nazareth, and that through the Messiah,

459
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:48,860
 Israel's story, Israel's reality continues, grows,

460
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:52,660
 is fulfilled in the identity and mission of God

461
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:55,060
 through this multinational community of people,

462
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:59,500
 including believing Jews and Gentiles in Christ,

463
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:03,140
 as Paul puts it in Romans and Galatians.

464
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:07,860
 In other words, it's not that the church replaces the Jews,

465
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:11,540
 but that Israel expands to include the Gentiles

466
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:15,020
 in God's fulfillment, as he always said they would.

467
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,660
 So I just wanted to get that point in

468
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,660
 in order to try to at least clarify

469
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:22,180
 and defend myself against that accusation.

470
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:25,140
 So here are, again, just three main points,

471
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:28,140
 and one at the end of the story of Israel.

472
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,460
 First of all, of course, election.

473
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,020
 The foundation of Israel's faith

474
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:36,980
 was that God had chosen them as his own people

475
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:39,780
 through the historic act of calling Abraham

476
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,740
 out of Ur of the Chaldees,

477
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:44,100
 and then making those remarkable promises

478
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,780
 to Abraham and Sarah.

479
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:48,660
 So Israel knew that they were not a nation

480
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:53,300
 who happened to have chosen to worship this particular God,

481
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:56,380
 but rather this God, Yahweh God,

482
00:23:56,380 --> 00:24:00,100
 had chosen them as a particular people.

483
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,540
 They would not exist on the planet

484
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,980
 apart from God's choice and God's calling

485
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,900
 and God's creation.

486
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,900
 And so two things need to be said immediately about that,

487
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:14,620
 which also apply to us as their followers.

488
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,940
 First of all, that Israel were not to imagine

489
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:20,900
 that their election by God, that is God's choice of them,

490
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,820
 owed anything to their greatness,

491
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,900
 numerical or moral superiority.

492
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,540
 Far from it, they are told in the book of Deuteronomy

493
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,700
 several times, they were a tiny nation,

494
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,580
 they were an insignificant people,

495
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,540
 and they were certainly no more righteous

496
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,820
 than other nations.

497
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:40,380
 No, the roots of their election lay exclusively

498
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:44,140
 in the love and the grace of God.

499
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,780
 He loved them because he loved them.

500
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:50,060
 And that's axiomatic, you can't get behind that.

501
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:52,700
 There's no other reason given among them.

502
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,540
 So it's based on the grace and love of God.

503
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:57,100
 And secondly, that they had been chosen

504
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:00,540
 for the sake of the rest of the nations.

505
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:03,860
 So blessing choosing Abraham and his descendants

506
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:07,020
 was God's intended means of bringing blessing

507
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,900
 to all the nations that were there

508
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,500
 in Genesis chapter 10 especially.

509
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:15,580
 So election then means being chosen for that task,

510
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:20,180
 to be the means by which God will fulfill his mission.

511
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:23,060
 And what then of the church in the light of this?

512
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:27,620
 Well, you said Peter to the Christians

513
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:30,380
 that he was writing to in his letter, 1 Peter,

514
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:34,900
 you he said, you are that chosen people.

515
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,740
 In other words, he takes that language of the Old Testament

516
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:41,060
 and he applies it to this multinational community

517
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:44,660
 of believers in Jesus the Messiah, Jews and Gentiles,

518
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:47,580
 who are standing then in organic continuity

519
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:51,460
 with Old Testament Israel as the elect people of God,

520
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:54,340
 which is the language he uses in his first chapter.

521
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:57,620
 And so the same two points apply to us

522
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:01,940
 if we want to think about election as part of our identity

523
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,140
 as the people of God.

524
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:06,740
 First of all, that it's entirely by God's grace.

525
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:09,020
 There is nothing at all about us

526
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:12,580
 that made us worthy of God choosing us.

527
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:13,980
 It's by God's grace.

528
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:18,940
 And secondly, that it is fundamentally missional in purpose.

529
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:21,980
 That's to say our election being chosen by God

530
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,260
 is not so that we would be the only ones

531
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,540
 who would ever enjoy salvation,

532
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,940
 but that we would be the means

533
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:30,940
 by which God will bring salvation to others,

534
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:33,220
 which is what Peter goes on to emphasize

535
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,940
 immediately after that in chapter two,

536
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:38,740
 that we're to live such godly lives among the nations

537
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:41,700
 that they will see something of the glory of God

538
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,580
 and come to praise our God.

539
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,780
 So the church then exists in the world

540
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:48,540
 just as Israel did in the Old Testament

541
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:52,420
 as a community that God has chosen and called

542
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,900
 in order to serve God's mission

543
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,820
 of bringing the nations of the world ultimately

544
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:01,220
 from their condition in Genesis four to 11

545
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,460
 in rebellion against God

546
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:06,220
 to that portrayed in Revelation seven

547
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:09,820
 as a community of nations in worship and praise

548
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,860
 of the God as their redeemer.

549
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:14,540
 And we'll talk a bit more about that in the next lecture.

550
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,620
 So that's election.

551
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:19,860
 Secondly, redemption is a word that is used,

552
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:22,020
 first of all, in the Old Testament about Israel.

553
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:25,980
 They were a people whom God had redeemed.

554
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,820
 And the language of redemption, of course,

555
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,460
 goes back to the Exodus, doesn't it?

556
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,820
 To that great historical deliverance

557
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:34,980
 of their ancestors from slavery in Egypt.

558
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:39,140
 And they saw that Exodus as proof of God's love

559
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:42,300
 and God's justice and God's power and greatness.

560
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,620
 That's why they could sing about it

561
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:46,460
 and celebrate it as they did in Exodus 15,

562
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:49,020
 but also, of course, in many of the Psalms.

563
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,580
 And so there's a huge range of vocabulary

564
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:54,780
 of words and concepts that are linked to the Exodus.

565
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:59,780
 Redemption, salvation, mighty acts, justice, and so on.

566
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:02,100
 And then, of course, it leads through

567
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,660
 into the law and the covenant and the worship

568
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:07,940
 that they had in the book of Psalms and elsewhere.

569
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:10,740
 And this memory of the Exodus was kept alive

570
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:13,420
 through the annual Passover salvation

571
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:15,780
 because Israel was a people who remembered

572
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:19,420
 and renewed and refreshed their historical memory

573
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,900
 year after year after year.

574
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:24,980
 They knew their God, Yahweh, above all

575
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:27,540
 as their saving redeemer God.

576
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,940
 That's the language of Exodus.

577
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,740
 Now, when we come to the New Testament,

578
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,220
 of course, it's very clear that the New Testament

579
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:39,220
 sees the cross of Christ through the lens of the Exodus.

580
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:42,180
 In fact, on the Mount of Transfiguration,

581
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:45,660
 we read, Luke tells us in Luke 9, verse 31,

582
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:49,220
 that when the disciples saw Jesus in his glory

583
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,620
 on the Mount of Transfiguration

584
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:54,500
 conversing with Moses and Elijah,

585
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,880
 and what they were talking about was, says Luke,

586
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:02,880
 the Exodus that Jesus was going to accomplish in Jerusalem.

587
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,020
 It's usually translated as his departure,

588
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:08,700
 which is a sort of airport term,

589
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,220
 which is not really the way in which we usually speak

590
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,620
 about our death, and we don't usually speak

591
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,660
 about our death as something we accomplish.

592
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,020
 Did you accomplish dying?

593
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,980
 No, no, you just die.

594
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:23,340
 But these are discussing the Exodus

595
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:26,260
 that Jesus would accomplish in Jerusalem,

596
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:28,540
 speaking, of course, of the cross.

597
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:30,300
 Because it was at the cross, wasn't it,

598
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,840
 that God achieved, accomplished the redemption of the world,

599
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,140
 defeated the force of evil, liberated his people.

600
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:40,060
 And so we as Christians, we look back to Calvary

601
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,260
 and to the cross, and through the cross,

602
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:44,860
 back with Israel to the Exodus.

603
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:47,740
 Because as Paul puts it, Christ, our Passover lamb,

604
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:51,220
 has been sacrificed for us, and therefore,

605
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:55,440
 we have had our Exodus experience when God brought us,

606
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,580
 as Peter would say, out of darkness

607
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,580
 into his marvelous light.

608
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:02,380
 So we too are a people who have experienced

609
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:06,660
 the redeeming, delivering power of God through the cross.

610
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:09,220
 That means that we too, like Israel,

611
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:12,620
 are a people of memory and of hope.

612
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:15,300
 We look back and we look forward.

613
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:19,540
 And we do both also through a meal, the Passover meal having,

614
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:23,180
 in a sense, been absorbed into the Eucharist, the Lord's

615
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:27,500
 Supper, which was significantly instituted in the Passover meal

616
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:30,580
 immediately before Jesus died on the cross.

617
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,660
 So again, we see that the church stands

618
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:37,540
 in this organic, spiritual, theological continuity

619
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:40,780
 with God's people, Israel, in the Old Testament.

620
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:45,140
 So election, redemption, and then thirdly, covenant.

621
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:47,900
 This is another, of course, dominant concept

622
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:51,860
 in Israel's theology, this covenant relationship with God.

623
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:54,340
 Goes back originally to Abraham, where

624
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:59,860
 it involves a combination of promise and response.

625
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:03,020
 There's a promise and a commitment made by God.

626
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:05,460
 God says, this is what I'm going to do.

627
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,980
 And then there's a required response for Abraham,

628
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:12,060
 walk before me in obedience, trust and obey.

629
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:15,140
 God promised Abraham, and Abraham's response

630
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,140
 is faith and obedience.

631
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,740
 That's the essence of the covenant.

632
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:21,660
 And then, of course, shortly after that in the Bible,

633
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,340
 you get to the book of Exodus.

634
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,780
 You arrive at Mount Sinai with the Israelites

635
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:28,100
 after they've been redeemed out of Egypt.

636
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:31,460
 And the covenant-making ceremony takes place there

637
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:34,940
 in Exodus chapters 19 to 24.

638
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:38,340
 And within that context, God makes known his personal name,

639
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:41,460
 Yahweh, the name which is then associated forever

640
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:45,980
 after with the Exodus and with God's saving power.

641
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:50,060
 God redeems his name, his character, his law.

642
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:52,340
 His covenant is made with Israel.

643
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:56,100
 He's committed to them in salvation and protection

644
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,220
 and blessing.

645
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,940
 And he calls them to be committed to him

646
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:04,100
 in covenantal obedience and worship exclusively of God,

647
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,900
 Yahweh God alone.

648
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:10,500
 And so the law of Israel, which then follows in Exodus

649
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,140
 and then also, of course, in Leviticus and Deuteronomy,

650
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:16,340
 the gift of God's law comes in that context.

651
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,500
 This is so important to grasp this,

652
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:22,980
 that God gives his law to people whom he has already redeemed.

653
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:26,460
 The covenant is made on the basis of the grace

654
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,860
 and the redemption of God.

655
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:31,900
 And we'll think a bit more about that in the third lecture

656
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,860
 when we're looking at the ethics of Israel.

657
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:37,820
 So here again, we find just as with election

658
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:42,020
 and with redemption, we find this organic theological

659
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:45,500
 continuity because the church is the people

660
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:49,300
 of the new covenant, which is foretold in the Old Testament

661
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,900
 explicitly by Jeremiah, but referred to in other ways

662
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,260
 by other prophets.

663
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:57,700
 And the new covenant is inaugurated quite explicitly

664
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:01,100
 by Jesus Christ just before his death.

665
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,740
 In fact, in the context of his death.

666
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:06,940
 And those words of Jesus at the Last Supper

667
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:10,780
 where he uses the words which we use again and again

668
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,580
 in the Lord's Supper or the Holy Communion

669
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,980
 echo these Old Testament texts.

670
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:19,260
 Jesus says, "This is the blood of the covenant,"

671
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,140
 which echoes Exodus 24.

672
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,980
 He said, "Which has been poured out for many,"

673
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:26,500
 which is an echo of Isaiah 53.

674
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,900
 "For the forgiveness of sins,"

675
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:31,460
 which is an echo of Jeremiah 31.

676
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:35,540
 So in so many ways, the deepest moment

677
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:38,260
 of our Christian identity in the Holy Communion

678
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:41,060
 is saturated with words and language

679
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,820
 which come from the Old Testament itself.

680
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:46,380
 So here we are then, we are a community

681
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:49,620
 of experience of God's election and God's redemption

682
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:52,820
 and God's covenant united to the Lord Jesus Christ

683
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,820
 through faith in his blood.

684
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:59,660
 But the last word on that page,

685
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:03,900
 these were the great foundational truths of Israel.

686
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:07,660
 These were the great, in a sense, historical realities

687
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:11,100
 of their existence and their theology.

688
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:15,500
 But we know that they struggled with all of these

689
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:20,500
 as a human nation in the midst of a world of nations

690
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:24,500
 all just as fallen and sinful as one another.

691
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,340
 Indeed, the prophets tell Israel

692
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,500
 that they become even more wicked

693
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,340
 than the surrounding nations.

694
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:34,020
 And so the Old Testament records honestly and painfully

695
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,940
 and surprisingly, given that this is

696
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:39,080
 the national literature of the nation,

697
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:42,500
 the Old Testament records Israel's failures

698
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,260
 alongside the affirmations of their faith

699
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,460
 and their aspirations.

700
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:50,820
 This is who they knew they were and what they wanted to be,

701
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,740
 but this is how they actually failed.

702
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:56,780
 They sinned, they suffered, they fail internally,

703
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,920
 they are attacked externally.

704
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,660
 And their whole history of Israel,

705
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,820
 as we know in the Old Testament,

706
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:06,520
 is just one long catalog of struggle

707
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:09,700
 between those who brought the word of God to them,

708
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,420
 taught them what they needed to believe,

709
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:14,340
 the prophets, the psalmists, Moses, and so on,

710
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:17,900
 and those who at street level, as we might say,

711
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,040
 were determined to resist the will of God

712
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,460
 and the ways of God.

713
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:25,260
 And yet, of course, the apostle Paul

714
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:30,260
 discerns and realizes this enormous paradox

715
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:33,420
 that it was through that failure of Israel,

716
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:36,700
 even to the point of rejecting their own Messiah

717
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,240
 and putting him to death,

718
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:43,220
 which in God's foreknowledge and God's sovereignty

719
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:46,440
 would be the means by which God would bring redemption,

720
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,500
 not only to the Jews, the Israelites,

721
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,940
 who would believe in Christ and accepted him

722
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:54,020
 as Messiah, but also to those from any nation

723
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,900
 and every nation, the Gentiles,

724
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:58,260
 who would come through faith in Jesus

725
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,800
 into the blessing of Abraham, as he explained.

726
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,540
 So there then, in all those ways,

727
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:07,820
 to get this sort of, so it's more than halfway through,

728
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:10,140
 this first part, that we are a people

729
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,520
 who stand in organic continuity,

730
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,220
 I've used that word several times,

731
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:17,260
 with Old Testament reason, with Old Testament Israel,

732
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:20,460
 because, in a sense, we share the same story.

733
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:23,220
 The people of God, we are the people

734
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,940
 who are chosen and called by God

735
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:28,440
 for his purpose of blessing the nations.

736
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,280
 We are also, like them, people who have experienced

737
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,500
 the redeeming grace and power of God in history,

738
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,660
 for them through the Exodus, ultimately, of course,

739
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:39,100
 for all people through Christ on the cross.

740
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,460
 We are people who stand in a committed,

741
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,820
 covenant relationship with God

742
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,700
 through the Lord Jesus Christ,

743
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:48,260
 enjoying the security of his promises

744
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:51,620
 and responding with exclusive loyalty and obedience.

745
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:54,660
 We are a people who have been set apart by him

746
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:58,600
 to live in distinct, holy ways in the world,

747
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,320
 as we'll think about later.

748
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,400
 And we are a people who, like them,

749
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:07,000
 show this, as it were, this tension

750
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 between knowing the God we worship

751
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,040
 and wanting to live for him,

752
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,120
 and yet struggling with all the ambiguities

753
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:18,400
 and pain and struggle of historical life on this planet,

754
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,920
 in which nothing is perfect, especially ourselves,

755
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,480
 that we also struggle.

756
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,300
 So in all these ways, it seems,

757
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:28,000
 the church stands in continuity with Israel,

758
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,320
 the same promise, the same inheritance,

759
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,000
 the same ultimate gospel.

760
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,640
 Their story is our story.

761
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,660
 It's one story, the story of God.

762
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:39,920
 That leads to the second big area

763
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,960
 that I wanted to bring to us,

764
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,420
 not only a people formed by God's story,

765
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:46,900
 but a people created for God's glory.

766
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:50,220
 Now that phrase itself, of course,

767
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:52,320
 comes from the Old Testament,

768
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,160
 from what God says through Isaiah.

769
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,080
 This is Isaiah 43, verses six and seven.

770
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,280
 "Bring my sons from afar and my daughters

771
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,680
 "from the ends of the earth,

772
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,040
 "everyone who is called by my name,

773
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,360
 "whom I created for my glory,

774
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,420
 "whom I formed and made," says God.

775
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:13,180
 "My people, my chosen, the people I formed for myself,

776
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:16,120
 "that they may proclaim my praise,

777
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:20,800
 "created for my glory, created to proclaim my praise."

778
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,360
 That's the language of Isaiah.

779
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:26,880
 Now, Jeremiah provides an interesting metaphor

780
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,960
 for this particular purpose of God

781
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,080
 in creating his people, to create somebody

782
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:35,440
 that would be glorifying and praising to him.

783
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,720
 It comes in Jeremiah chapter 13.

784
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:41,720
 It's a kind of acted prophecy, one of several.

785
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,660
 You remember, well, I don't know if you remember it,

786
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:44,780
 but I'll tell you anyway.

787
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:47,780
 In Jeremiah chapter 13, God tells Jeremiah

788
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:52,420
 to go and buy a brand new linen waistband.

789
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:54,140
 Our Bibles often say just belt,

790
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,220
 but it's more than just a belt.

791
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:57,340
 It would be a whole band around his waist

792
00:38:57,340 --> 00:39:00,500
 of lovely, bright, clean, white linen,

793
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,780
 such as the priests would wear.

794
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:05,540
 And so he wears this for a while around Jerusalem.

795
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:08,020
 Imagine people, "Oh, nice, nice, nice clothes, Jeremiah.

796
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:10,740
 "Very, very smart," you know, that they'd be saying to him.

797
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:15,740
 But then God tells him to go and bury it in some wet soil.

798
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:17,820
 It says by the river Euphrates.

799
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,240
 He won't be going quite that far,

800
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,160
 but he buries it for a long time.

801
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,840
 So then he goes back to get it, to retrieve it,

802
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,860
 and it's become rotten and unwearable.

803
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:26,820
 It's falling apart.

804
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:29,460
 It's full of mud and worms and all of that

805
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:30,400
 being in the soil.

806
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,740
 And so that's the way God says it's like

807
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:34,860
 for him with Israel.

808
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:37,260
 And I now quote Jeremiah 13.

809
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:40,340
 "For as a belt is wound around the waist

810
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:44,080
 "so I, God, I bound all the people of Israel

811
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,760
 "and all the people of Judah to me, says the Lord,

812
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:51,760
 "to be my people for my renown and my praise and my honor."

813
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:57,460
 See, God says, "I created Israel so that I could look good."

814
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:59,580
 God wanted his people, as it were,

815
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:04,300
 to be something that would be commendable to the wearer.

816
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,820
 You know, when I say to my wife,

817
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,180
 "What a really lovely dress you're wearing, my dear,"

818
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,380
 I don't often say that, but you know,

819
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:10,540
 if I were to say that to her,

820
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:12,460
 "It's a lovely dress you're wearing,"

821
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:15,540
 my compliment is for her, not really the dress,

822
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:19,020
 I'm saying, "You look good dressed like that.

823
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:22,660
 "It makes you look beautiful, that dress."

824
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:24,700
 And that, in a sense, is what God is saying here

825
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:25,540
 about Israel.

826
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:28,940
 He wanted Israel to make the God they worship

827
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:30,960
 look good in the eyes of the nations,

828
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,380
 that when people would look at Israel,

829
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,340
 they'd say, "Who's their God?"

830
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:35,380
 You see what I'm saying?

831
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,540
 So that's God's intention,

832
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:39,460
 that the quality of Israel's life

833
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:42,140
 would display something of the glory of their God

834
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:44,060
 and bring him praise among the nations.

835
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,840
 But the tragedy was, of course,

836
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:49,580
 that the rottenness of their sinful, rebellious society

837
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,860
 meant that they were nothing but an embarrassment to God,

838
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:56,040
 a disgrace, like a rotten garment would be to its wearer.

839
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,820
 You know, Yahweh couldn't be seen wearing those people,

840
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,820
 couldn't go out looking like that,

841
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:03,220
 is the intention of the metaphor.

842
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:06,260
 So God's people are created for God's glory.

843
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:09,060
 Now, I just wanted to then use that idea

844
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:12,180
 to pick up three or four of the pictures

845
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,580
 that are used for Israel in the Old Testament,

846
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:17,500
 each of which has a New Testament equivalent,

847
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:20,020
 which is also picked up in the New Testament.

848
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:24,260
 In fact, there is only one metaphor for the church

849
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:28,340
 in the New Testament, which is unique to the New Testament,

850
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:31,500
 and indeed, unique to the apostle Paul himself,

851
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,500
 and that is when Paul describes the church

852
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,300
 as the body of Christ.

853
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:37,540
 It's a very familiar one, it comes from Paul,

854
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:39,660
 but it's the only picture of the church

855
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:41,860
 in the New Testament which doesn't have

856
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:43,480
 Old Testament roots.

857
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:46,620
 In the Old Testament, there are many metaphors for Israel,

858
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:47,860
 and here are just a few.

859
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,540
 First of all, God's people.

860
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,900
 We may just have time for three, we'll see how we go.

861
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,100
 First of all, God's people.

862
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:56,220
 It's not really a metaphor, but it is interesting

863
00:41:56,220 --> 00:42:00,040
 that they describe themselves as an am, a people,

864
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:03,140
 rather than the word used for the nations,

865
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:06,740
 which is goi, or goyim, the plural of the nations.

866
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:10,020
 In Exodus 19, verse six, God says that Israel

867
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:13,700
 will be a goi kadosh, a holy nation,

868
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:17,380
 meaning, yes, you will be a nation, like the other nations,

869
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:19,300
 but you will be a nation distinctive,

870
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,900
 set apart from the other nations.

871
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:23,220
 You will be my am, my people.

872
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:27,300
 Now, Israel, as you know, had an ethnic core,

873
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,640
 the 12 tribes of the sons of Jacob,

874
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,540
 but in reality, historical reality,

875
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:33,820
 Israel is a very mixed community.

876
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:36,380
 Exodus tells us that there were multitudes of people

877
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:39,220
 of other tribes who came out with the Hebrews

878
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:41,700
 when they left Egypt, so from the very start,

879
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:42,900
 they were a mixed community,

880
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,540
 and then in the book of Joshua,

881
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:46,380
 we get other people who joined them,

882
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:48,780
 and Leviticus and Deuteronomy speak repeatedly

883
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:51,220
 of the foreigners who were living among them.

884
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:54,340
 So what held Israel together was not so much

885
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:57,060
 that they were a single ethnicity

886
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:59,800
 as that they were the covenantly loyal people

887
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,440
 of this one God.

888
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,980
 They are the people of Yahweh, Yahweh's people.

889
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:08,260
 They bear his name, and indeed, they are commanded

890
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:09,580
 in the third commandment,

891
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:13,060
 do not bear the name of the Lord in vain,

892
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:15,000
 which doesn't mean stop swearing.

893
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,060
 It means don't be a disgrace to the God

894
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:18,700
 whose name you bear.

895
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:21,380
 I think that's what the passage means.

896
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:23,680
 And so, indeed, that was a problem to God

897
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,980
 when he scattered the Israelites in exile

898
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:29,100
 was, as Ezekiel puts it,

899
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:32,200
 that they were profaning the name of Yahweh.

900
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:35,200
 That is, they were making Yahweh the God of Israel

901
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,440
 looking no better than the defeated gods

902
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,360
 of the other nations.

903
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,840
 They were making the name Yahweh just common,

904
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:44,060
 ordinary, profaning it, not cursing and swearing,

905
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:47,640
 but just making Yahweh no different from the other gods.

906
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:51,780
 And so Yahweh, God says, I'm going to restore my people

907
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:56,580
 for the sake of my name, my reputation among the nations.

908
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:58,700
 But that title, people of Yahweh,

909
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:01,500
 the people of God, could be expanded.

910
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,740
 And this is the amazing thing that in the Old Testament,

911
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:06,900
 as we see a little bit more later on today,

912
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:10,780
 that the Old Testament envisages people from other nations

913
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:14,620
 coming to be included within the people of Yahweh.

914
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:18,680
 So Isaiah chapter 19 can say that even Egypt

915
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,700
 will be called my people, Egypt,

916
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:23,860
 and even Assyria, my inheritance,

917
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:25,540
 and Israel, my handiwork.

918
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:27,660
 The other nations become included.

919
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:30,260
 Psalm 87 says that this one and that one,

920
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:32,500
 and then it lists a number of nations around,

921
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,420
 will be born in Zion.

922
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:37,220
 They will be enfranchised as citizens of Zion.

923
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:39,500
 Many nations will come and join Zion,

924
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,540
 says God in Zechariah 2.

925
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:45,780
 And so that Old Testament inclusion of other nations

926
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:48,760
 within, quote, "the people of Yahweh,"

927
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:52,220
 or the people of Zion, is exactly what the New Testament

928
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:55,860
 says was beginning to happen through the Gentile mission

929
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:58,100
 of the church, that others were coming

930
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:00,020
 to become part of that people.

931
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:02,460
 So in that sense, then, the church, we as the people,

932
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:03,060
 who are we?

933
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:04,860
 We are a people.

934
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:07,540
 But in this sense, we are the people,

935
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:11,540
 the people of this God, the God of the scriptures,

936
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:15,580
 the God of biblical faith, a multinational people,

937
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:18,520
 not defined by ethnicity, not defined

938
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:21,340
 by whether you're Jew or Gentile, male or female,

939
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:22,700
 slave or free.

940
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:26,220
 But you, says Peter, again, that plural you,

941
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:29,020
 quoting both Exodus and Hosea, you

942
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:31,420
 are a people belonging to God.

943
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:33,580
 Once you were not a people, but now you

944
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:37,660
 are the people of God, a worldwide community of peoples

945
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:40,020
 fulfilling God's promise to Abraham.

946
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:43,380
 So even that word itself is quite a remarkable biblical

947
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:44,300
 term.

948
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:48,580
 And then secondly, we are God's household or family.

949
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:50,460
 Now, we know that in the Old Testament,

950
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:56,060
 Israel was structured around a network of kinship.

951
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:58,780
 There were the tribes, the largest unit.

952
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:00,780
 And then within the tribes, there were clans,

953
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:02,040
 the mishpachoth.

954
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:05,340
 And then within the clans, there were the households.

955
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:08,860
 The basic unit was, quote, "the father's house."

956
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:11,560
 That's the term that's used throughout the Old Testament.

957
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:14,460
 It was a kind of extended family,

958
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:17,300
 more like, in many ways, Asian families still

959
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:21,780
 are today than my own experience of Western nuclear families.

960
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:25,180
 Israel's families would have been three or four generations

961
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:26,660
 from the head of the family.

962
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:29,860
 It would include sons and their wives and their children,

963
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:32,380
 their servants, their agricultural workers,

964
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:34,780
 and even some of the resident foreigners practicing

965
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:35,900
 their trade among them.

966
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:39,580
 So it was a robust, large community, the household,

967
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:41,100
 the father's house.

968
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:44,380
 And it was a place in which the individual Israelite

969
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:49,500
 would find personal identity, because your name in Israel

970
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:50,860
 was virtually an address.

971
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:54,420
 You were the so-and-so, the son of X, the son of Y,

972
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:57,340
 the son of Z. And you would go through your personal name,

973
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:59,020
 your father's name, the name--

974
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:00,580
 that's your biological father--

975
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:02,260
 then the name of the head of the house,

976
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:04,860
 who might by now be dead, and then the clan name,

977
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:06,380
 and then the tribe name.

978
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:07,460
 That was your full name.

979
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:09,300
 It gave you identity.

980
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:11,340
 It also, therefore, created inclusion.

981
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:13,500
 You knew who you belonged to.

982
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,940
 It was a place of security, because if you

983
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:17,740
 belonged in an Israelite family, then you

984
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:19,700
 had a place on the land.

985
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:21,820
 That's why the genealogies were so important.

986
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:23,540
 When they returned to the land, you

987
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:27,340
 had security, a share in Israel's inheritance.

988
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:30,340
 And of course, it was a place of nurture and teaching,

989
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:33,580
 because it was where you learned the faith from your fathers,

990
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:36,140
 who would be teaching them, from the way in which the law was

991
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:39,020
 observed, and from the annual Passover, and so on.

992
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:42,060
 So to call Israel the household of Yahweh,

993
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:46,660
 the house of Israel, was a very significantly rich term.

994
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:51,060
 It meant that you were identified, included, secure,

995
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:54,260
 and nurtured within that faith.

996
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:56,940
 So it's not surprising, then, that Christians

997
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:59,740
 adopted very similar language to speak of the church.

998
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:03,380
 Paul calls the church in Timothy the household of God.

999
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:07,620
 We are his house, says Hebrews, chapter 3, verse 6.

1000
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:09,740
 This was probably made easier by the fact

1001
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:11,140
 that in the early days, of course,

1002
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:15,100
 these Christians would have met in homes, initially,

1003
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:18,060
 especially when it moved out into the Roman Empire.

1004
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:21,220
 So this sense, then, of these little Christian communities

1005
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:24,380
 being an extended family together

1006
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:26,060
 must have been very strong.

1007
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:28,900
 But it was strong in a countercultural way,

1008
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:31,060
 because these communities of believers

1009
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:36,460
 included men and women meeting together, parents and children

1010
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:40,540
 in the same room, slaves and their owners in the same room,

1011
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:43,180
 listening to the letters of Paul being read out.

1012
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:45,900
 So here were countercultural households

1013
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:49,900
 of faith in which individuals would have their identity.

1014
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:54,140
 I'm now a man or a woman in Christ, even if I'm a slave.

1015
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:56,820
 They would be given a sense of inclusion

1016
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:59,740
 within this fellowship of sisters and brothers,

1017
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:03,380
 as they would call one another, even if by faith in Christ

1018
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:06,500
 they had been excluded from their earthly family.

1019
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:09,580
 And they were given security, because as Peter says,

1020
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:13,260
 now you have an inheritance, greater even the land,

1021
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:15,900
 an inheritance that cannot spoil or fade,

1022
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:18,980
 because it's an eternal inheritance, as the land was.

1023
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:22,020
 And of course, it was the place of nurture and teaching

1024
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:24,940
 in the scriptures, teaching and admonishing one another.

1025
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:27,500
 So these household communities of the Church--

1026
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:32,300
 and that word for the Church had deep social, spiritual,

1027
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:35,220
 and theological roots in the Old Testament.

1028
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:37,660
 So for those who might have been severed

1029
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:40,060
 from their natural families and households

1030
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:42,020
 because of their loyalty to Christ,

1031
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:45,660
 the Church becomes a new household, a new family.

1032
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:49,940
 And then thirdly, God's dwelling place.

1033
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:53,100
 Going back, right back again to the Exodus,

1034
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:57,020
 we all know that the Exodus was a great act of liberation.

1035
00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:59,980
 It gave Israel freedom from slavery and oppression

1036
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:01,300
 in Egypt.

1037
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:02,980
 But according to the book of Exodus,

1038
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:05,300
 that was not the final goal.

1039
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:07,640
 It wasn't as if God says, OK, I brought you out of Egypt.

1040
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:08,940
 There you are.

1041
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:09,500
 Go on.

1042
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:10,180
 Be free.

1043
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:13,020
 I'll see you in heaven when you die, or anything like that.

1044
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:15,260
 No, God says, I brought you out of Egypt

1045
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:18,900
 in order to bring you to myself here at Sinai.

1046
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:21,420
 And then what God says to Moses, tell you what,

1047
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:23,660
 when you go back down from Mount Sinai,

1048
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:27,380
 I want you to build me a tent, just a tent.

1049
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:29,780
 God said, I want to go camping with my people.

1050
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:30,980
 I want to dwell among them.

1051
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:33,220
 I want to be in the midst of my people.

1052
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:34,380
 It's quite remarkable, really.

1053
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:36,220
 It's very incarnational there, actually,

1054
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:37,500
 in the book of Exodus.

1055
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:43,540
 And here in Exodus 29, verses 44 to 45, Exodus 29, 40, 45,

1056
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:44,260
 God says this.

1057
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:46,900
 I will consecrate the tent of meeting, and the altar,

1058
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:47,620
 and so on.

1059
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:51,740
 And then I will dwell among the Israelites and be their God.

1060
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:55,100
 And they will know that I am the Lord their God, who

1061
00:50:55,100 --> 00:51:00,020
 brought them out of Egypt so that I might dwell among them.

1062
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:01,660
 I am the Lord their God.

1063
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:03,900
 God says, the very reason I brought Israel out of Egypt,

1064
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:05,320
 because I want to live among them.

1065
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:07,100
 I want to dwell among my people.

1066
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:10,220
 So the people of God, therefore, in the Old Testament,

1067
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:13,460
 are to be the dwelling place of God.

1068
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:16,220
 It's as if they're going to be his home address on Earth,

1069
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:17,540
 so to speak.

1070
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:19,100
 And this is so important.

1071
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:20,740
 Moses recognized how important it

1072
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:24,460
 was that he couldn't even envisage the people of Israel

1073
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:27,500
 moving on from Mount Sinai unless God would be with them

1074
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:29,900
 in that sense, actually dwelling among them.

1075
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:31,780
 Wasn't content with an angel.

1076
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:34,060
 Had to be God in their midst.

1077
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:35,900
 Now, later on, of course, the tabernacle

1078
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:37,780
 was replaced by the temple.

1079
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:40,700
 And like the tabernacle, it has this double significance.

1080
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:43,740
 It's a dwelling place for God, not in the sense

1081
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:46,380
 that he would live in that little house,

1082
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:49,780
 but that that temple house would represent, as it were,

1083
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:53,380
 the focal point of the God who is dwelling among his people.

1084
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:55,820
 He was living among them, walking among them.

1085
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:57,500
 And secondly, it would be the place where

1086
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,060
 they would meet with God.

1087
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:01,680
 So those two words are used in the temple, a dwelling place

1088
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,180
 and a meeting place.

1089
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:06,500
 It's where God dwells, and it's where you meet with him

1090
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:09,820
 and where you go in songs of pilgrimage and so on.

1091
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:13,020
 Now, when you come to the New Testament, of course,

1092
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:18,380
 you find that Jesus, as the Lord's anointed Messiah,

1093
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:23,180
 has significant impact on that physical temple.

1094
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:24,500
 In fact, it's very destructive.

1095
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,380
 Jesus says the temple would be torn down

1096
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:31,580
 because Jesus himself now becomes the person, no longer

1097
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:36,580
 just the place, of God's presence on Earth.

1098
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:39,100
 That's why John puts it, isn't it, that the word became

1099
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:41,860
 flesh and tabernacled among us.

1100
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:47,780
 God came to dwell no longer in a temple or a tent or a temple,

1101
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:52,160
 but God dwells in the person of Jesus, the incarnate Jesus.

1102
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,860
 God becomes flesh.

1103
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:56,180
 And then also, of course, it's through Jesus

1104
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:59,940
 that people must come to meet with God in worship.

1105
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:05,820
 As Jesus says to the woman at the well in John chapter 4,

1106
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:07,620
 that we must worship him in spirit and truth

1107
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:10,380
 because he has now come as the Messiah.

1108
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:13,740
 And as Hebrews will later put it in Hebrews chapter 12,

1109
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:16,700
 we who are believers in Jesus have already

1110
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:19,920
 come to Mount Zion, to the temple.

1111
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,820
 Not in that sense to the old Mount Zion, he says,

1112
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:26,340
 but to the one that is there through the Lord Jesus Christ.

1113
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:28,980
 So we are that temple because Paul

1114
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:33,940
 uses this temple language of a dwelling place

1115
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:36,260
 language in three different ways.

1116
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:39,620
 First, he says individually that individual Christians

1117
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:42,420
 are the temple of the Holy Spirit, 1 Corinthians chapter

1118
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:43,140
 6.

1119
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:46,400
 So we don't abuse our bodies with sexual immorality

1120
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,560
 because our bodies are, in that sense,

1121
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:49,820
 the dwelling place of God.

1122
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:52,060
 He indwells us as his temple.

1123
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:54,820
 But secondly, he speaks of the local church.

1124
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:57,020
 In 1 Corinthians chapter 3, he says,

1125
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:59,500
 you, meaning you Christians in Corinth,

1126
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:03,700
 as a local body of believers, you are God's temple.

1127
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:06,300
 And therefore, he warns them not to take part

1128
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:08,860
 in things that were happening in pagan temples

1129
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:11,180
 because we are the temple of the living God.

1130
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:15,420
 And then he uses it also in the sense of the universal church.

1131
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:18,300
 In Ephesians chapter 2, addressing all Gentile

1132
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:20,460
 believers, he says that they have now

1133
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:24,380
 been united, Jews and Gentiles together,

1134
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:29,500
 to become built together, he says, into a living temple

1135
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:32,260
 for God to indwell by his spirit.

1136
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:35,900
 So that the temple imagery of the Old Testament

1137
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:40,540
 is there used to describe not just a church, but indeed

1138
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:44,580
 the one whole church on earth, the church of the living God

1139
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:47,740
 with his one dwelling place through his one spirit.

1140
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:51,900
 But it's one dwelling place for people of all nations.

1141
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:54,660
 Now, I'll not go on to talk about priesthood, I think,

1142
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:58,860
 because I'll refer to that in the next lecture a bit.

1143
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:01,540
 It's used there of the people of God, the people of Israel

1144
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:02,420
 as God's priesthood.

1145
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:05,500
 It's also used of ourselves by Peter.

1146
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:07,060
 And of course, we could add others.

1147
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:08,660
 I need to draw to a close.

1148
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:10,820
 But there are many other metaphors

1149
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:13,580
 that the Old Testament uses for Israel, which are then picked

1150
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:15,300
 up in the New Testament church.

1151
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:17,500
 There is the picture of a vine--

1152
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:19,940
 Jesus used that-- of an olive tree--

1153
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:22,460
 Paul uses that-- of a bride--

1154
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:23,820
 comes all over the place--

1155
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:27,940
 and indeed, of a flock of sheep with God as the shepherd.

1156
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:32,380
 And all of these ways of thinking about the people of God

1157
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:34,220
 are distinctive in the Old Testament,

1158
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:37,860
 but they feed through into the New.

1159
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:39,940
 So I hope that for now, at least,

1160
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:41,420
 I've said enough to show that if we

1161
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:44,820
 are going to answer this question of Christian identity,

1162
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:50,740
 who are we, we simply can't do without the rich theological,

1163
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:55,060
 historical truths of the faith and the scriptures of Israel

1164
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:56,740
 in our Old Testament.

1165
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:57,740
 Thank you.
