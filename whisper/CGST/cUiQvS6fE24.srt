00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,920
 (soft piano music)

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:13,320
 - Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen,

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,480
 fellow Christian brothers and sisters,

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,360
 gathered greetings in our Lord Jesus Christ to you all.

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:23,360
 Welcome to join us in our CJSC Josephine Stoll

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,880
 Culture and Ethics Lecture.

7
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,600
 What a wonderful moment to have us all back here

8
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,360
 gathering together in person for lectures.

9
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,440
 My name is Grace L, your host this afternoon.

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,000
 Since 1985, CJSC has been hosting this lecture series

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,600
 on a biannual basis to commemorate Josephine Stoll,

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,480
 an influential Christian thinker and leader in Hong Kong

13
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,960
 after her untimely death in 1982.

14
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,000
 This year, our lecture series is entitled,

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,160
 "Written for Us, the Old Testament as Christian Scripture."

16
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,360
 It is said to take a look at how the scripture,

17
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,600
 in particular, the Old Testament,

18
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,960
 is relevant to us as Christians today.

19
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,640
 And it is our honor to have Dr. Christopher Wright

20
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,280
 as our distinguished and keynote speaker.

21
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,240
 Dr. Wright is the global ambassador

22
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,600
 and ministry director of Langham Partnership.

23
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,800
 He is also a prolific writer.

24
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,960
 He has numerous profound publications,

25
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,480
 "The Mission of God," "Cultivating the Fruits of the Spirit,"

26
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,040
 "Old Testament Ethics for the People of God,"

27
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,840
 just to give you a few examples.

28
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,560
 As you can see from this book list,

29
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,840
 Dr. Wright's passion to bring to life

30
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,680
 the relevance of the Old Testament

31
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,360
 for Christian mission and ethics is more than obvious.

32
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,080
 Following the first two lectures

33
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,560
 on Christian identity and mission,

34
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,840
 this afternoon, Dr. Wright will deliver the third lecture

35
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,520
 entitled, "The Old Testament and Christian Ethics,

36
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,920
 "How Should We Live?"

37
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,120
 Without further ado, please join me

38
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,240
 in welcoming Dr. Christopher Wright.

39
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:08,400
 - Thank you, Dr. Ah.

40
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,360
 That was a very kind and warm welcome.

41
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,880
 And it's lovely to be here on a sunny day today.

42
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,480
 It's not quite like London,

43
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,800
 but still very, very much more like the Hong Kong

44
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,840
 that I remember from previous visits.

45
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,280
 Let me again, as I did yesterday,

46
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,120
 just in case you're here today, this afternoon,

47
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,960
 for the first time, say that I bring greetings

48
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,040
 from my home church of All Souls Church,

49
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,680
 Langham Place in London,

50
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,080
 from which the Langham Foundation gets its name,

51
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,640
 from that street in London where John Stott

52
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,200
 used to live and minister,

53
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,040
 and founded the Langham Partnership,

54
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,080
 which is here in Hong Kong, known as Langham Foundation.

55
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,240
 So greetings to you from us and from them.

56
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,760
 So now, as I said, we are moving today

57
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,320
 into the third of our lectures in this topic.

58
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:00,000
 And in our first lecture, as you remember,

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 we saw how our Christian identity is deeply rooted

60
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,800
 and shaped by the identity of Israel in the Old Testament.

61
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,680
 And in Christ, we, the multinational community of believers,

62
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,840
 Jews and Gentiles, Paul says, are the seed of Abraham.

63
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,680
 And we observed in that lecture

64
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,520
 how there are various metaphors

65
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,360
 within that great story of Israel,

66
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,720
 which describe them as a people,

67
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,680
 which are then picked up in the New Testament

68
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,400
 and applied with Christ-centered significance

69
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,040
 to God's people in all nations.

70
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,120
 And then in our second lecture,

71
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,680
 we saw how that identity of Israel

72
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,880
 generated a missional purpose of being a people

73
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,600
 who are created and called by Yahweh, their God,

74
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,320
 to be something for him in the world.

75
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,520
 God had declared his intention to Abraham

76
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,160
 to bring blessing to all nations on earth through him.

77
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,400
 And when we turn to the New Testament,

78
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,400
 we saw that our mission, as we think of it

79
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,960
 as Christian people, derives ultimately from God's mission,

80
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:08,280
 God's objective of bringing blessing to the world.

81
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,560
 And therefore, our mission includes being a blessing,

82
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,320
 serving, witnessing, terms which all go back

83
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,640
 to the scriptures.

84
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,520
 And so today then, in our third lecture,

85
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,840
 we are seeing how that missional identity of Israel

86
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,880
 generated a distinctive ethic.

87
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,400
 That's to say, Israel was not just to be the people of God,

88
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,320
 but to live as the people of God

89
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:35,320
 in ways that would reflect the character

90
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,920
 and the demands of Yahweh, their God, in everyday life,

91
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,400
 in the ordinary things of life as a nation.

92
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,820
 And what we're going to observe today

93
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,800
 is that this powerfully ethical dimension

94
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,520
 of Israel's faith in the Old Testament

95
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,080
 became the motivation, the source, the impact

96
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,920
 for what is written for our learning

97
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,880
 as we also strive to walk in the ways of the Lord.

98
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,880
 And once again, what we're going to do today

99
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,280
 is to follow the same pathway

100
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,760
 that we did in our last two lectures,

101
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:12,480
 which is to see the trajectory of Israel's journey with God

102
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,080
 through election, chosen in Abraham, in Genesis,

103
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,680
 through the story of redemption in the Exodus,

104
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,000
 in the book of Exodus,

105
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,800
 and then to the covenant that God made with Israel

106
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,880
 at Mount Sinai, and to have a look

107
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,800
 at the book of Deuteronomy.

108
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,800
 So first of all then, Abraham and election

109
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,640
 and missional ethics.

110
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,900
 This phrase, missional ethics,

111
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,320
 is really just my shorthand way of trying to say

112
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,120
 living as God's people for the sake of God's mission.

113
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,440
 We are to be living in a certain way,

114
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,000
 that's ethics for the sake of mission.

115
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,760
 So missional ethics just means that,

116
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,680
 and here we're thinking of Abraham and election.

117
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,640
 Because we saw, didn't we, right in our first lecture,

118
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:00,040
 that our identity goes right back to Abraham

119
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,640
 because it is through him and through the Lord Jesus Christ

120
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,360
 that we are the seed of Abraham.

121
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,560
 And therefore that sense of being a blessing

122
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,640
 to the nations comes from him.

123
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,120
 What we see now is that God's election of his people

124
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,080
 through Abraham was not only a missional thing

125
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,680
 for the sake of the nations,

126
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,120
 but had an explicitly ethical intention.

127
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,920
 And the text that I want us to focus on here,

128
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,280
 as you can see on the screen,

129
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,320
 is another one from Exodus, from Genesis,

130
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,760
 but not this time chapter 12,

131
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:34,080
 but chapter 18, verses 18 and 19,

132
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,080
 where God says this.

133
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,860
 This is God actually speaking to himself in Genesis 18.

134
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,800
 God says, "Abraham will indeed become

135
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,200
 a great and mighty nation,

136
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,560
 and all nations on earth will find blessing through him."

137
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,560
 This is my own translation.

138
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,560
 "For I have known or chosen him for the purpose that,

139
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,040
 for the sake and in order that,

140
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,560
 he will teach his sons and his household after him

141
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,240
 so that they will keep the way of Yahweh,

142
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,040
 the way of the Lord, by doing righteousness and justice,

143
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,760
 for the purpose that, in order that,

144
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,960
 Yahweh can bring about for Abraham

145
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,300
 what he has promised to him."

146
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,340
 That's the verse that I want us to concentrate on

147
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,820
 in this first part of the lecture.

148
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,460
 Now, this little divine soliloquy,

149
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,260
 God talking to himself,

150
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,540
 comes in the middle of a narrative

151
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:30,020
 which really spans chapters 18 and 19

152
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,540
 of the book of Genesis.

153
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:34,840
 It's the story of God's judgment on Sodom and Gomorrah.

154
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,460
 And in the context of that,

155
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,980
 God has a meal with Abraham and Sarah,

156
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:43,060
 and then makes this renewed promise of blessing

157
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,580
 that they would have a son,

158
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,540
 and the purpose of that,

159
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,580
 which is to bring blessing to all nations.

160
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,980
 So this, in many ways, is a reminder by God

161
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,220
 to God's own self,

162
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:56,280
 it's a kind of note to self by God,

163
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:00,420
 in the story of his original purpose in choosing Abraham,

164
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,980
 but in the context of bringing judgment

165
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,880
 on Sodom and Gomorrah.

166
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,040
 So we need to think, first of all,

167
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,160
 for a moment or two,

168
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,540
 about that aspect of these chapters,

169
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,360
 which is that Sodom stands here

170
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,160
 very much as a picture of our world.

171
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,320
 And I always use the word Sodom,

172
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,560
 I mean Sodom and Gomorrah,

173
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,480
 I'm talking about those both cities,

174
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,400
 but just for short, speaking of Sodom.

175
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,240
 Now, as you know, Sodom and Gomorrah

176
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,440
 stand in the scripture as a kind of prototype,

177
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,940
 a proverbial prototype of human wickedness,

178
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,100
 and of the judgment of God

179
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:36,280
 that will ultimately fall upon evildoers.

180
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,800
 But it's quite important,

181
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:42,140
 because the word Sodom has been used in a particular way

182
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:45,400
 in the West, in Western culture and biblical history,

183
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,760
 to recognize that the Bible portrays

184
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,900
 the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah in a very broad way.

185
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,600
 Here in this chapter, in verses 20 and 21,

186
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,360
 immediately after our verse,

187
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,880
 the Lord says, "The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah

188
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,480
 "is so great, and their sin is so grievous,

189
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,420
 "that I will go down and see if what they have done

190
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:08,440
 "is as bad as the outcry that has reached me."

191
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,880
 Now, that word coming twice there in verses 20 and 21

192
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,440
 is the Hebrew word tza'akah,

193
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,200
 which is one of those onomatopoeic words,

194
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,720
 and it means what it sounds like.

195
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,480
 It is a cry for pain, ah!

196
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,920
 It's a yell, a scream, a technical word, indeed,

197
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,480
 is used in a number of places in the Old Testament

198
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,420
 of a cry for help from someone who is suffering,

199
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,680
 either blows or cruelty or oppression,

200
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,880
 or indeed, sexual assault,

201
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,200
 as in the case of a woman being raped

202
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,200
 in the book of Deuteronomy.

203
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,240
 It's a cry for pain.

204
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,300
 Now, earlier in the book of Genesis, in chapter 13,

205
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,940
 we read that, quote, "The men of Sodom were wicked

206
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,080
 "and were sinning greatly against the Lord."

207
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,920
 So we've already been told that in chapter 13,

208
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,720
 and here we're told that the sin specifically

209
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,640
 is that of what was causing an outcry,

210
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,160
 the oppression, the suffering, the cruelty

211
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,200
 that was happening in the city.

212
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,840
 Some people in Sodom and Gomorrah are crying out

213
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,560
 against that, and God hears it.

214
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,640
 He says, "I've heard that, and I'm coming down

215
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,500
 "to see if it's as bad as it sounds."

216
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,340
 Then, of course, as we move on into Genesis chapter 19,

217
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:22,920
 we read further of the hostile, violent, attempted rape

218
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,520
 by, quote, "All the men from every part of the city

219
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,240
 "of Sodom, both young and old," all of them,

220
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,040
 "on the two men," who are actually angels,

221
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,760
 but the two apparently men who had come

222
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,040
 to the home of Lot and his family.

223
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,520
 That's in chapter 19, the violent, attempted rape.

224
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,060
 The prophets go even further in describing

225
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,280
 the sin of Sodom.

226
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:49,060
 Isaiah, for example, accuses Jerusalem and says,

227
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,000
 "If the Lord had not spared us," he says,

228
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,520
 "we would have been like Sodom.

229
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,640
 "We would have been like Gomorrah."

230
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,240
 And you can hear the kind of protest

231
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,080
 that would have come to that.

232
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,600
 Who are you calling Sodom and Gomorrah?

233
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,920
 We're Jerusalem.

234
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,560
 So verse 10, Isaiah chapter one, verse 10,

235
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,640
 "Hear the word of the Lord, you rulers of Sodom.

236
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,280
 "Listen to the instruction of our God,

237
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,800
 "you people of Gomorrah."

238
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,720
 That's Isaiah talking to the people

239
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,000
 of Israel and Jerusalem.

240
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,960
 Why?

241
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,920
 Well, you read the rest of the chapter

242
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,920
 and he's condemning them for their bloodshed,

243
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,140
 their corruption, their injustice,

244
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,580
 their failure to help the poor and needy.

245
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,840
 That's what made them like Sodom and Gomorrah.

246
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,600
 That's Isaiah chapter one.

247
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,080
 And Ezekiel is even more caustic

248
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,320
 in the way he describes the Israelites,

249
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,800
 in fact, the Northern Kingdom,

250
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,960
 of being even worse than Sodom and Gomorrah.

251
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,400
 This is Ezekiel chapter 16, verse 49.

252
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,320
 He says, "This was the sin of your sister Sodom.

253
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,760
 "She and her daughters,"

254
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,080
 that means the villages, the towns around the city,

255
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:52,080
 "they were arrogant, overfed, unconcerned.

256
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,200
 "They did not help the poor and needy."

257
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,480
 Sodom's sin, says Ezekiel, was arrogance,

258
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,680
 affluence, and callousness to the needy,

259
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,760
 overproud, overfed, and underconcerned.

260
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,720
 It's a very modern-sounding list of accusations.

261
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,440
 So that's why, when you put all that together,

262
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,800
 that Sodom stands as a kind of model

263
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,480
 or a picture or paradigm of human society at its worst

264
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,040
 and the inevitable consequences of God's judgment

265
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,640
 that falls upon that.

266
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,160
 It was a place that was full of oppression,

267
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,760
 cruelty, violent sexual abuse, idolatry,

268
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,600
 pride, greedy consumption,

269
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,600
 but empty of compassion and care for the needy.

270
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,040
 And that's a picture, surely,

271
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,680
 of the world that we still live in.

272
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,760
 And it's precisely that world that God comes to

273
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,160
 in both judgment, but also, remarkably,

274
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,640
 in redemption in relation to Lot,

275
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,080
 but also what he now says to Abraham.

276
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,080
 And it's on his way to bring judgment onto that world

277
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:02,200
 that God stops off for a meal with Abraham and Sarah.

278
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,000
 God didn't need to do that, did he?

279
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,040
 I mean, he could've just zapped down from heaven to Sodom

280
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,320
 and do what he did, but he stops.

281
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,840
 He pauses on the way and renews his promise

282
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,920
 to Abraham and Sarah that they will have a son next year.

283
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,960
 They'd been waiting for 25 years already,

284
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,480
 so that's what made Sarah laugh a bit.

285
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,160
 And God says, "Why did you laugh?"

286
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,000
 "No, I didn't."

287
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,840
 "Yes, you did."

288
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,680
 "No, you didn't," and so on.

289
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,800
 It's a wonderfully told narrative.

290
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,360
 So here, you see, is God on his way to judgment,

291
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,840
 who stops to remind himself of his ultimate purpose

292
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:41,600
 of blessing to all nations through this elderly couple,

293
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,040
 Abraham and Sarah, who haven't yet had a child at all.

294
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,560
 So we need to see what God says here now

295
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,160
 in these verses that we're looking at

296
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,400
 in that context of God's ultimate judgment

297
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,960
 on the world of Sodom, but with his purpose

298
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,520
 of bringing redemption into the world

299
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,600
 through the children of Abraham.

300
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,360
 And that brings us, therefore, to the next point

301
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,560
 that I want to bring from these verses,

302
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,800
 which is the way of the Lord, as we read there,

303
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,920
 as a model or a picture for God's people

304
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,240
 and for how they're to live.

305
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,640
 Coming back now to Genesis 18, verse 19.

306
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,200
 Let me read it to you again.

307
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,020
 God says, "I have chosen him," that is Abraham,

308
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,080
 "so that he will direct his children

309
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,880
 "and his household after him to keep the way of the Lord

310
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,800
 "by doing righteousness and justice,

311
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,780
 "so that the Lord will bring about for Abraham

312
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,280
 "what he has promised him."

313
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,880
 But what has God promised him?

314
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,360
 To bring blessing to all the nations.

315
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,960
 It's in the previous verse.

316
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,600
 That's why God chose Abraham

317
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,360
 to bring blessing to the nations.

318
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,560
 So you have election on one side, I have chosen him,

319
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,160
 and you have mission at the end of the verse

320
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,680
 to bring blessing to the nations, that's God's promise,

321
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,660
 and right in the middle comes this ethical component

322
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,620
 of the whole thing, the way of the Lord,

323
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:57,160
 doing righteousness and justice.

324
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:01,140
 God says that he's chosen Abraham to be a teacher,

325
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:04,720
 to be an instructor in the ways of the Lord

326
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,500
 and a teacher of righteousness and justice.

327
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,960
 Both of those phrases, the way of the Lord

328
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,160
 and righteousness and justice,

329
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,380
 are worth just pausing with for a moment.

330
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,800
 If you'd asked the average Old Testament Israelite,

331
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,360
 "Can you tell me about Old Testament ethics?"

332
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,240
 They wouldn't have said,

333
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,300
 "Well, you need to read the book by Chris Wright."

334
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,060
 They'd probably have looked very blank

335
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,440
 and not known what you were talking about.

336
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,280
 But if you'd asked them,

337
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,040
 "Can you tell me about the way of the Lord?"

338
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,640
 They'd say, "Ah, now I know what you mean."

339
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,000
 Because that was a common expression in the Old Testament

340
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 for a life lived in righteous obedience to God's law,

341
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,960
 in faithful obedience to God.

342
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,160
 You get a lot of it in the Psalms and elsewhere.

343
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,140
 And the way of the Lord implies a contrast.

344
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:57,640
 It's walking in Yahweh's way

345
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:01,160
 as distinct from the way of other gods

346
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:06,160
 or of other nations or of oneself

347
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,040
 or the way of sinners, as for example in Psalm 1.

348
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,400
 Walk in Yahweh's way.

349
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,000
 And in this verse, of course, this context,

350
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,960
 the contrast is very clear

351
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,080
 between the way of Yahweh the Lord

352
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,480
 and the way of Sodom that immediately follows it.

353
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,480
 So walking in the way of the Lord

354
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,600
 means something different

355
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,380
 from the world that God is about to judge.

356
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:33,920
 As a metaphor, it seems to have had

357
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,520
 two possible ways of understanding it,

358
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,560
 which were more or less complementary.

359
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,840
 One, to walk in somebody's way means to follow them.

360
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,400
 You watch their footsteps, you watch where they're going,

361
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,720
 and you follow their way.

362
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,640
 It's an aspect of imitation of God.

363
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,540
 You observe what Yahweh is like,

364
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,960
 and you try to do the same.

365
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:56,960
 You follow suit, follow in his footsteps, as it were.

366
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:00,720
 Or it can be taken more in the way of an instruction.

367
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,040
 You ask somebody, "What is the way to that place?"

368
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,560
 And they say, "Well, follow this road.

369
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,680
 Go there. Don't turn that way.

370
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,560
 Don't turn that. Go this way."

371
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,160
 You follow the instructions to the way that they tell you

372
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,560
 without turning off to the left or the right

373
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,560
 to what might be a wrong way or a dangerous way.

374
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,400
 And those two ideas go well together, I think,

375
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,080
 for what the Israelites meant by obedience to the law of God

376
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,800
 to reflect the character of God

377
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,440
 and to follow the instructions of God.

378
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,680
 The two go together.

379
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:34,560
 A very good example of this, I think,

380
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:38,200
 comes in the book of Deuteronomy 10,

381
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,800
 where Moses, in the text,

382
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:44,840
 is kind of summarizing what God really wants.

383
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,660
 Like many a preacher, they say,

384
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,240
 "Well, what is it really all about?

385
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,800
 What does it all boil down to?

386
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,800
 What's the bottom line?"

387
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:56,320
 And so in Deuteronomy 10, verse 12,

388
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,600
 we read, "Now, Israel,

389
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,000
 what does the Lord your God ask of you

390
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,240
 but, one, to fear the Lord your God,

391
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,720
 to walk in all his ways,

392
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:09,000
 to love him, serve him, and observe his commands?"

393
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,280
 That's all God wants, okay?

394
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,640
 That's all it is, just those five things,

395
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,780
 fear, walk, love, serve, and obey.

396
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,080
 And there you see that expression,

397
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,920
 "to walk in the ways of the Lord."

398
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,280
 In my NIV, it says, "to walk in obedience to him."

399
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,720
 It's actually, "walk in the ways of the Lord."

400
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,520
 So what are the ways of the Lord?

401
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,440
 You can imagine some Israelite asking.

402
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,400
 That's all very well.

403
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,320
 We'll try to do that,

404
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,360
 but tell us, what are the ways of the Lord?

405
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,560
 So a little bit later in the same chapter,

406
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,280
 just a couple of verses later,

407
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,120
 this is what Yahweh is like.

408
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,520
 "The Lord shows no partiality.

409
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,600
 He does not accept bribes."

410
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,280
 So you can't corrupt him.

411
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:50,080
 "He defends the cause of the fatherless and the widow,

412
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,760
 and he loves the alien, giving him food and clothing."

413
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,520
 That's what Yahweh God is like.

414
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,760
 If you want to walk in his ways,

415
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,600
 you need to find out where he is.

416
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,880
 And where you will find Yahweh God

417
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,560
 is not at the top of the social pile

418
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,040
 with the kings and the government and the powers that be.

419
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:12,200
 You will find Yahweh God right at the bottom

420
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,920
 with the widows, the orphans, the poor,

421
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,960
 the foreigners, the immigrants,

422
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,440
 feeding them, clothing them.

423
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,440
 That's what he is like.

424
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,680
 Oh, and by the way, Israel, you know that

425
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,540
 because you were like that once

426
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,280
 when you were aliens in Egypt,

427
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,040
 and God saved you and clothed you and fed you

428
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,720
 and watered you and led you.

429
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,400
 So the very next verse says,

430
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,760
 "That's the way of the Lord,

431
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,720
 and you therefore are to love those who are foreigners,

432
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,160
 for you yourselves were aliens in Egypt."

433
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,000
 So to walk in the way of the Lord then

434
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 means doing for others what God wishes to be done for them,

435
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,400
 or in Israel's case, doing for others

436
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,000
 what God had already done for Israel

437
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,720
 in delivering them and providing for them.

438
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,220
 So to walk in the way of the Lord

439
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:59,640
 has that very practical, ethical emphasis

440
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,760
 that you find throughout Deuteronomy

441
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,640
 and the Psalms and elsewhere.

442
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,820
 And therefore, doing righteousness and justice

443
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,840
 is a kind of explication of that,

444
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,220
 just in case you didn't quite catch

445
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,640
 what it means to walk in the way of the Lord.

446
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,120
 The narrator expands it, walk in the ways of the Lord

447
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:20,000
 and doing righteousness and justice,

448
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,720
 a pair of words which would come very high up

449
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,720
 on any list of Old Testament ethical values.

450
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,000
 They occur individually, but they often occur together.

451
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,200
 One, the word translated justice is mishpat,

452
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,040
 which is a fairly active word.

453
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,040
 It usually means doing something, you do mishpat.

454
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:45,360
 It's to do something which will restore a situation back

455
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,320
 to what is right and fair in relationships,

456
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,000
 which is more what the other word means,

457
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,120
 righteousness, tzedak or tzedakah.

458
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,120
 Mishpat is a kind of set of actions, it's something you do,

459
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,400
 whereas tzedakah is a state of affairs,

460
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,120
 it's what you're trying to achieve, fairness and justice.

461
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,560
 And these two words go together so often

462
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,080
 in the Old Testament that they form

463
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,160
 what is technically known as a hendiodes,

464
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:15,160
 that is, expressing a single idea with two related words,

465
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:18,680
 like law and order or health and safety.

466
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,000
 We often put two words together,

467
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,560
 and probably the nearest kind of English translation

468
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,500
 of these two words together

469
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,980
 would be something like social justice,

470
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:32,360
 doing what is right and just in society.

471
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,880
 Okay, Abraham then, says God,

472
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,120
 is to be the founding teacher, as it were,

473
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,960
 of an academy of ethical instruction

474
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,440
 in the way of the Lord and doing righteousness and justice.

475
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,900
 And God says, that's why I chose him,

476
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:51,480
 that he would be that, that this ethical core

477
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,480
 to Abraham's purpose in God's mission and his descendants,

478
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,680
 not just him, but his household after him.

479
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,040
 But let's come back to that verse 19,

480
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,440
 because I'd like us to see

481
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,500
 the missional logic of it in there.

482
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,340
 I tried to read it in this way

483
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:11,620
 in order to express the point I'm trying to make,

484
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:14,800
 because here's a verse which has three clauses

485
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,040
 joined together by two expressions of purpose.

486
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,620
 And I've translated it in this way,

487
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:25,000
 I have known him, that is, I have chosen him,

488
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,800
 for the purpose that he will teach his household

489
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,560
 and children after him to keep the way of the Lord

490
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,600
 and so on, for the purpose that the Lord

491
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,760
 will bring about for Abraham what he has promised.

492
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,080
 And the reason why I've put it like that

493
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,520
 is because the word in the Hebrew

494
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,840
 is quite emphatically meaning that.

495
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,880
 It's, as you may know, if you study Hebrew at all,

496
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,940
 it's a very kind of paratactic language.

497
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,280
 They tend to just to put things side by side

498
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,200
 and stick what in the middle,

499
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,800
 and you just read the intention of the sentence into it.

500
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,560
 But here it is quite explicit,

501
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:02,560
 the word that means in order, l'ma'am, is here twice.

502
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:06,800
 So God says, I chose him, election, l'ma'am,

503
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,520
 so that he will do these things, l'ma'am,

504
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,240
 so that I will be able to keep my promise to him.

505
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,200
 So here is a verse then which binds together

506
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,040
 in one sentence, election, I chose him,

507
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,000
 ethics, where the Lord and righteous justice,

508
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,360
 and mission.

509
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,320
 They're together syntactically

510
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,880
 in the grammar of the sentence

511
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,640
 and theologically in the purposes of God,

512
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,320
 'cause this is God speaking about God's own self.

513
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,940
 I mean, this is pretty pure theology.

514
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,480
 If you want pure theology,

515
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,120
 it's God talking to God about God,

516
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,840
 and that's what's happening here.

517
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,960
 God expresses his own intention that this is what he wants.

518
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,440
 And it's a relatively easy step, it seems to me,

519
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,360
 from this verse here in Genesis 18

520
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,200
 to the way the apostle Paul

521
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,060
 expressed the purpose of his mission,

522
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:02,040
 which he says twice in Romans,

523
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,400
 at the beginning and the end of Romans,

524
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,080
 Romans 1, verse five, and Romans 16, verse 26,

525
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,720
 Paul says that his whole life's work

526
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:14,720
 was to bring about the obedience of faith among all nations.

527
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,280
 Faith among all nations is very Abrahamic.

528
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,000
 The obedience of faith is very Abrahamic,

529
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,960
 and Paul says he wants to create communities

530
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,920
 among the nations of faith and obedience

531
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,360
 who have been chosen in Abraham

532
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,720
 that are also committed to living in the ways of Abraham.

533
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,800
 That is an ethical obedience.

534
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,800
 So this, to draw this part to a close,

535
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,920
 this shows us again, doesn't it,

536
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:44,200
 the importance of recognizing what we mean by election

537
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,720
 when we talk about the election of God's people.

538
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,720
 We saw in our earlier lectures

539
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,000
 that it's not merely soteriological,

540
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,840
 that is to do with salvation,

541
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,880
 it's also missiological,

542
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,520
 it's to do with the purpose of our election.

543
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,040
 And it's not only soteriological and missiological,

544
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,600
 it's also ethical.

545
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,680
 It's in order that we should live in a certain way.

546
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,740
 God has chosen his community

547
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:12,120
 to be a community shaped by himself,

548
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,380
 by his own ethical character,

549
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:17,920
 walking in the ways of this God, the Lord God,

550
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:21,180
 and a community that is being taught to do that,

551
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:24,200
 to do the way of the Lord in righteousness and justice,

552
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:29,200
 and being taught to live that way in a world like Sodom,

553
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,840
 a world filled with oppression and injustice

554
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,760
 and perversion and disorder of all kinds.

555
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,880
 The people of God are to be a community

556
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,040
 that will bring a blessing to the nations.

557
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,240
 So in other words, according to this verse,

558
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,160
 Genesis 18, verse 19,

559
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:47,040
 the ethical quality of the life of God's people

560
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,720
 is the vital link in the verse

561
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,760
 between their election and their mission.

562
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:56,840
 You can't separate the two or the three in this verse.

563
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:01,360
 There is no biblical mission without biblical ethics,

564
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,800
 without biblical living.

565
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,040
 So that's what I wanted to say from Abraham

566
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,440
 and from that text in Genesis 18.

567
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,360
 Let's move on then to the Exodus

568
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,600
 and back again to the verse

569
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,600
 where we were the other day, yesterday.

570
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,240
 And here we've moved on from election

571
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,240
 to redemption and missional ethics,

572
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,520
 because of course the book of Exodus

573
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,640
 is the whole story of Israel's redemption out of Egypt

574
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,940
 and all that then flowed from that

575
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:33,560
 in terms of the covenant and the law and so on.

576
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,040
 So here's the verse that we had yesterday.

577
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:39,920
 I've read it before, Exodus chapter 19, verses four to six,

578
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,560
 where God says to the Israelites,

579
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:44,520
 and again, this is my own translation,

580
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,200
 "You yourselves have seen what I did,

581
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,740
 "what I have done to Egypt,

582
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,920
 "and I carried you on wings of eagles

583
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,560
 "and brought you to myself."

584
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,220
 Here you are at Mount Sinai.

585
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:57,760
 "Now then, if you really obey my voice

586
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,440
 "and keep my covenant,

587
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,120
 "you will be for me,"

588
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:06,360
 li, for me, "a special personal possession

589
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,720
 "among all the peoples.

590
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,280
 "For to me," it's the same word,

591
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,180
 "belongs the whole earth.

592
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:16,160
 "But you, you will be for me,"

593
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,240
 the same word again,

594
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,120
 "a priestly kingdom and a holy nation."

595
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:23,040
 So here is God claiming, as it were,

596
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:26,320
 this possessive relationship with Israel.

597
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,200
 You are my people, my special possession,

598
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,040
 that possessive word, li,

599
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,400
 but also is expressed in terms of,

600
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,600
 you will be that for me

601
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,960
 in the context of all the peoples

602
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,800
 and the whole earth,

603
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,720
 which also belongs to me.

604
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,680
 To me belongs the whole earth.

605
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,520
 You will be, for me,

606
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,400
 a people within that context.

607
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:51,120
 This is very much a hinge text

608
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,400
 in the book of Exodus.

609
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:57,160
 The earlier chapters, chapters one to 18,

610
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:00,120
 have all been the narrative of redemption,

611
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,640
 the great story of the Exodus,

612
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,440
 plagues of Egypt, crossing the Red Sea,

613
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,680
 and all of that.

614
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,920
 And the rest of the book

615
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,840
 will be about the giving of the law

616
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,880
 and the covenant,

617
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,560
 and then the building of the temple.

618
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,600
 And here is this verse right in the middle,

619
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,040
 in a sense, looking back to God's past action.

620
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,960
 You've seen what I have done.

621
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,120
 And also setting that within the universal context

622
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,320
 of God's ownership of the whole earth

623
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,800
 and all the nations.

624
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,480
 So God's intention for Israel

625
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,240
 is again being set within the framework

626
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,680
 of God's intention for all the nations,

627
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,840
 as per Abraham.

628
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,320
 Now, in the last lecture,

629
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,880
 the second lecture yesterday,

630
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,680
 we thought about what it meant for Israel

631
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,640
 to be God's priesthood

632
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,560
 in the midst of the nations,

633
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,880
 as the people who would be for God,

634
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,840
 for the nations,

635
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,040
 bringing the knowledge of God to the nations,

636
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,320
 bringing the nations to the experience of God,

637
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,520
 God's representatives in the world.

638
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,640
 But as I said yesterday,

639
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,960
 how would Israel be that?

640
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,720
 They could only be a priestly nation

641
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,720
 if, like their own priests,

642
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,880
 they were a holy nation,

643
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,160
 that is set apart for God.

644
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,520
 And that's the word that I'm picking up now.

645
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,160
 Now, like the word priest itself,

646
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,880
 the word holiness or holy,

647
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,560
 in Eastern English,

648
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:21,440
 I don't know what that sounds in Cantonese or Chinese,

649
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,960
 holiness is one of those words

650
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,360
 which is easily misunderstood

651
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,280
 because it sounds very religious.

652
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,680
 It sounds like God is saying,

653
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,880
 you will be the most religious people on earth,

654
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,720
 or something like that,

655
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,880
 which is not what he's saying at all.

656
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,400
 To be holy basically meant to be different,

657
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,800
 to be set apart,

658
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,400
 to be distinctive.

659
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,880
 So, you've got lots of plates and cups

660
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,720
 and vessels and things that people use,

661
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,160
 but some will be set apart

662
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,680
 to be used for God's service in the temple.

663
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,160
 And there are lots of people around,

664
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,320
 you know, men, women, and so on,

665
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,520
 but some are going to be set apart to be priests.

666
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,840
 There's a distinctiveness about that holiness.

667
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,480
 And so that's what God is saying here

668
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,160
 about Israel as a nation.

669
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,840
 It means being a distinctive,

670
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,920
 different kind of people

671
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,360
 because they worship Yahweh,

672
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,200
 who is a very different God

673
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,320
 from the gods of the nations.

674
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,440
 Now, you'll see in the text

675
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,360
 that I mentioned two passages in Leviticus,

676
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,240
 and the first says this very clearly.

677
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,280
 It's Leviticus chapter 18, verses three to four,

678
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:30,360
 where God says this, I quote,

679
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:34,480
 "You must not do as they do in Egypt,

680
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,640
 "where you used to live.

681
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:39,360
 "And you must not do as they do

682
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,360
 "in the land of Canaan, where I'm bringing you.

683
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,240
 "Do not follow their practices.

684
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,280
 "You must obey my laws

685
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,720
 "and be careful to follow my decrees

686
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:53,320
 "because I am Yahweh the Lord, your God.

687
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,000
 "You shall be holy for I am holy,"

688
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,560
 says Leviticus 19, verse two.

689
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,160
 In other words, Israel was to be distinctive,

690
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,400
 as distinctive from the other nations

691
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,440
 as Yahweh was different from all the other gods.

692
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,960
 That emphasis there comes very clearly

693
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,800
 in the past and the future.

694
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,200
 Don't be like the Egyptians.

695
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,920
 They worship the gods of empire,

696
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:19,120
 of armies, of power, of glory and splendor, all that.

697
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,560
 You don't need to be like that.

698
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,680
 And don't do as they do in Canaan,

699
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,160
 where they worship sex, health, wealth, and all that

700
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,640
 because that's what Baal stands for, the god of fertility.

701
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,200
 You don't need to go like that either

702
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,000
 because you're following me and my ways.

703
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,800
 In other words, Israel was to be Yahweh-like,

704
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,160
 just like we use the word Christ-like.

705
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:44,120
 They were to be Yahweh-like rather than like the nations.

706
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,840
 And the tragedy was that later on,

707
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,960
 they would want to be precisely like the other nations

708
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,840
 when they demanded a king.

709
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:54,680
 So they were to do as Yahweh does,

710
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,480
 not as the other nations do.

711
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,800
 So holiness then, you see, for Israel

712
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:03,320
 was a very practical down-to-earth thing.

713
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:07,920
 It meant, as it were, imitating the transcendent holiness

714
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:11,320
 of Yahweh, their God, but doing it in the practical,

715
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,560
 everyday, down-to-earth things of life.

716
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,440
 Now, of course, at one level,

717
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:19,400
 there were ritual or symbolic ways

718
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,840
 in which this holiness, this distinctiveness was expressed.

719
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:26,640
 We know about the laws of clean and unclean food and so on.

720
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,000
 And that clean-unclean distinction

721
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 is explicitly rationalized in Leviticus 20,

722
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,760
 verses 25 and 26,

723
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,000
 to symbolize Israel's separation from the nations.

724
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,640
 God says, "You must respect what's clean

725
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,040
 "and what's unclean

726
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:46,000
 "because I have set you apart from the nations."

727
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,120
 So the clean-unclean distinction was symbolic

728
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,120
 in the Old Testament of the distinction

729
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,280
 between Jews and Gentiles,

730
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,160
 which, of course, is why in the New Testament,

731
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:59,960
 when that distinction is dissolved in Christ,

732
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,120
 that in Christ there is no Jew or Gentile.

733
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,800
 We become one in him, that at that point,

734
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,840
 that clean-unclean law distinction

735
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,040
 then disappears for those who are in Christ.

736
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,560
 There's no need to observe that.

737
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,120
 That's a theological reason.

738
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:18,080
 But alongside that ritual or symbolic kind of holiness,

739
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:21,200
 the most comprehensive list of holiness that we have

740
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,560
 is in Leviticus 19, which is why that text is there.

741
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,120
 It's a passage, a chapter, of course, which begins,

742
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:32,000
 "You shall be holy as I, the Lord your God, am holy,"

743
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,680
 which colloquially means

744
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,240
 you've got to be a different kind of people

745
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,200
 'cause I'm a different kind of God.

746
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,840
 You've got to be like me, not like the other nations

747
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,960
 there in Leviticus chapter 19.

748
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,920
 And here's something I used to do

749
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,800
 when I used to teach the Old Testament in India.

750
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,880
 I used to, we'd get to this chapter

751
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,720
 in my course on the Pentateuch.

752
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,600
 I used to have 50 lectures on the Pentateuch.

753
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:58,560
 Can you imagine that in India at the time,

754
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,080
 back in the 1980s?

755
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,680
 And we'd get to Leviticus,

756
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:04,720
 and I would ask the class to read this chapter,

757
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,640
 quietly in the class, and then say,

758
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,240
 "How many of the laws in this chapter

759
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,400
 "are about, quote, religion?"

760
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,520
 And there are a few, you know,

761
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,680
 about the kind of sacrifices you offer,

762
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,240
 one or two things about, you know,

763
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,200
 distinctions in meat and stuff like that.

764
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,600
 So there's a few which you could say

765
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,600
 are ritual or religious.

766
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:29,040
 And so, "So what is most of the rest of the chapter about?"

767
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,000
 And the obvious answer is that it's about every day,

768
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,320
 down to earth, practical life on the farm,

769
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,680
 in the marketplace, in the neighborhood,

770
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,360
 in the market stall, and so on.

771
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,800
 And then I would ask the class,

772
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,040
 "So if these laws in Leviticus 19

773
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,880
 "were to become statute law in India today,

774
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,040
 "what difference might they make?"

775
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,360
 And they would look at the chapter again,

776
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,360
 and then they would start to sort of giggle a bit,

777
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:57,200
 and laugh, and realize that actually,

778
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:01,200
 some of these laws are very profoundly related

779
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,160
 to social and economic issues,

780
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,600
 which we find all around us today.

781
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,520
 So, for example, there are laws here

782
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,320
 which have to do with respect for the family

783
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,480
 and the community, the treatment of the elderly,

784
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,200
 and the treatment of your children.

785
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,360
 There are laws which to do with economic generosity

786
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:20,040
 in agriculture, how you run your farm,

787
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,560
 and how you provide for the needy.

788
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,680
 There are commandments about economic justice

789
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,480
 in employment rights, how you treat your workers

790
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,560
 and pay them, in verse 13.

791
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,320
 Do not hold back the wages of a hired worker overnight.

792
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:36,520
 There are laws about judicial integrity,

793
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,600
 in verses 12 and 15.

794
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:42,680
 Don't swear falsely, don't pervert the course of justice,

795
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:45,000
 in verse 15, don't show partiality

796
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,160
 to the poor or the rich.

797
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,920
 There are laws about sexual integrity.

798
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,880
 There are laws about the treatment of ethnic minorities

799
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,800
 in the society, so that the foreigner who lives among you

800
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,080
 must be treated as the native born.

801
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,520
 We haven't got there yet,

802
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,600
 in even any modern society, have we?

803
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,840
 But in Israel, whatever it is,

804
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,520
 1300 years before Christ, they were being told,

805
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,160
 treat foreigners the way you treat yourselves.

806
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,080
 Very interesting.

807
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,160
 And then there's the law about commercial honesty,

808
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,320
 also at the end of the chapter, verses 35 and 36.

809
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:20,040
 Don't have separate weights for when you're buying

810
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:23,040
 or selling, so that you can sort of, you know,

811
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,600
 sell expensively and buy cheaply.

812
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,560
 Don't cheat in business.

813
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,760
 So here are laws which are then echoed in Exodus,

814
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:34,840
 Deuteronomy, and elsewhere, and reflected in the prophets,

815
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,440
 and in the Psalms, and in the wisdom literature,

816
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,120
 and indeed, you'll find some of these laws

817
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,960
 that are deeply impactful on Jesus

818
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,400
 in the Sermon on the Mount,

819
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,160
 and the apostle Peter in his first letter,

820
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,760
 and the book of James.

821
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,680
 This is one of the most influential chapters in the Bible,

822
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,800
 Leviticus 19.

823
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,560
 When I get to the new creation,

824
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,320
 I look forward to asking Moses,

825
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,400
 you know, why did you leave it to that chapter

826
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,480
 before you said all this?

827
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,760
 Because, you know, didn't you know nobody's ever gonna get

828
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,760
 to chapter 19 with Leviticus?

829
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,680
 They all give up after about chapter two.

830
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,960
 It's a very important chapter, Leviticus 19.

831
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,560
 And you see, the point I'm trying to make here

832
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:17,160
 is this is not some kind of socialist charter.

833
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:22,760
 This is biblical holiness, according to Leviticus.

834
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:26,360
 This is where that famous verse that Jesus called

835
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,360
 the second greatest commandment of the law comes,

836
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,280
 love your neighbor as yourself.

837
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,040
 It's from Leviticus chapter 19.

838
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:36,480
 So in all of these ways, then, I need to keep moving along.

839
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,680
 Down to earth, practical social ethics.

840
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:42,440
 Israel was summoned to respond to their redemption.

841
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,400
 You are the people whom God has redeemed out of Egypt.

842
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,920
 Now you must live in a way which reflects the character

843
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,000
 of the God who has redeemed you.

844
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,760
 If Israel were to be God's priesthood

845
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,120
 in the midst of the nations,

846
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,800
 that is, Yahweh's representatives,

847
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,600
 then they have to be ethically different from the nations,

848
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,120
 not just religiously different.

849
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,960
 It wasn't just that they would say to the Canaanites,

850
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,640
 oh, you worship Baal, that's very interesting.

851
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,480
 We worship Yahweh, let's have a conversation.

852
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:10,140
 No, their whole lives would be different

853
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:12,880
 as a result of the worship of Yahweh,

854
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,040
 which is illustrated, by the way,

855
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,920
 in the story of Naboth, isn't it?

856
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,040
 Because when Ahab wanted to buy some land off Naboth,

857
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,320
 Naboth said, oh, I can't do that

858
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,840
 because the law doesn't allow it.

859
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,960
 And Ahab knew that he couldn't

860
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:27,440
 'cause he was an Israelite king, and the law prohibited it.

861
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,280
 But his wife was Jezebel, and his wife wasn't Israelite.

862
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,160
 She was Canaanite.

863
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,640
 She came from up Tyre and Sidon.

864
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:37,640
 And where she lived, under the rule of Baal,

865
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,920
 kings and queens could have whatever they want.

866
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,200
 And so she says to Ahab,

867
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,160
 is that the way you behave as a king in Israel?

868
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,520
 Ahab said, well, actually, yes,

869
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,800
 because that's what the law says.

870
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,760
 She said, well, let me do it then.

871
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,640
 She gets the land, and she uses Israel's law

872
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,240
 to get rid of Naboth so that the land could be stolen.

873
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,200
 So you see this contrast between people

874
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,440
 who live under the reign of Yahweh

875
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,080
 will live with the security of economic viability

876
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,420
 for themselves and their families into the future

877
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:06,160
 because God has given them an economic system

878
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,720
 which will support them.

879
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,420
 But if you live under the reign of Baal,

880
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,440
 then it's just whoever takes whatever they want

881
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,240
 if they've got the power to do so.

882
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,920
 Very different ethical system altogether.

883
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:20,600
 So Exodus 19 then, with the expansion in Leviticus 19,

884
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:24,760
 makes this basic insistence that if God's people

885
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,400
 are going to fulfill their God-given mission,

886
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,920
 then they need to be what they are,

887
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:34,340
 that is, the holy people of the holy God.

888
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:38,500
 Israel's identity as a priestly kingdom

889
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,860
 generates a mission to the nations,

890
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,620
 and that mission to the nations

891
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:47,500
 demands an ethic to be a holy nation.

892
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:50,780
 So that's the first two, Genesis, election and ethics,

893
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:53,300
 Exodus, redemption and ethics,

894
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:56,300
 and that leads, therefore, lastly, to Deuteronomy

895
00:39:56,300 --> 00:40:00,640
 and the covenantal community built around this covenant

896
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,640
 and how that then affects the way they should live.

897
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,100
 So what have we seen so far?

898
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,380
 We saw in Genesis 18, verse 19,

899
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:11,180
 that the ethical response of God required of his people

900
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:15,060
 was integral to the very purpose of election,

901
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:18,400
 and in Exodus chapter 19 and Leviticus 19,

902
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,140
 we've seen that obedience to God's covenant law

903
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:24,820
 was the essential response of God's people to grace,

904
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:27,560
 the grace of redemption in the Exodus.

905
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:30,200
 When we arrive in the book of Deuteronomy,

906
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:34,900
 Israel is just across the Jordan from the promised land.

907
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,680
 The book of Deuteronomy, as I'm sure you know,

908
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:40,340
 presents itself to us, the way it's framed and shaped,

909
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:43,280
 presents itself to us as the speeches of Moses

910
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,140
 to the Israelites as they consider their future life

911
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:52,060
 in the land, the next phase of the canonical journey.

912
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:55,820
 And there in the land, they would be summoned to live

913
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:58,900
 as this covenantal community,

914
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:02,340
 demonstrating their loyalty to the living God, Yahweh,

915
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:06,660
 and doing so in a context where they would be surrounded

916
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,980
 by other nations, by other peoples.

917
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:11,940
 Initially, the Canaanites, although they would be driven out

918
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:15,980
 but those would remain, and then the other nations as well.

919
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:18,540
 And the passage that I want us to look at here,

920
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:19,700
 as you can see on the screen,

921
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:22,700
 is Deuteronomy chapter four, verses six to eight.

922
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:25,660
 But Deuteronomy four, just to give you

923
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:27,620
 a little bit of context,

924
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:30,180
 chapter four of Deuteronomy is almost like a kind

925
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:32,980
 of microcosm of the whole book.

926
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:35,940
 It's a sort of summarizing prologue

927
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:37,800
 of all that's going to follow.

928
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:41,820
 It's summoning Israel basically to covenant loyalty

929
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:45,720
 and exclusive worship of Yahweh alone.

930
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:48,860
 That's what really is the heart of the chapter.

931
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:52,060
 And the warning in the chapter is that Israel must

932
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:57,060
 at all costs avoid idolatry, going after other gods.

933
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,580
 That's repeated again and again.

934
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:04,500
 But that religious exclusivism, Yahweh alone,

935
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:07,700
 and the worship of Yahweh alone, needs to be seen,

936
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:10,820
 especially in this chapter, the beginning and the end,

937
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:13,100
 of Israel's role in relation

938
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:15,400
 to the nations that surround them.

939
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,620
 Let me read just towards the close of the chapter,

940
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:23,300
 verses 32 to 34, where Israel is told by God

941
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:26,520
 that they have a unique experience of the living God,

942
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:29,060
 which no other nation has.

943
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:32,100
 Ask now about the former days long before your time,

944
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:34,620
 from the day God created man, sorry,

945
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,500
 created human beings on the earth.

946
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,660
 Ask from one end of the heavens to the other.

947
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:42,140
 In other words, the beginning of time and the whole of space.

948
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:45,220
 That's a pretty big research project if you're doing a PhD.

949
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:48,260
 So wherever you look, look wherever you like.

950
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:50,500
 Has anything as great as this ever happened?

951
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,620
 Has anything like it ever been heard of?

952
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:56,340
 Has any other nation heard the voice of God

953
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:59,280
 speaking out of the fire as you have and lived?

954
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,360
 Meaning, of course, Mount Sinai.

955
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,680
 Has any other God ever tried to take for himself

956
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,560
 one nation out of another nation by testing signs,

957
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,600
 wonders, war, mighty hand, and so on?

958
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,480
 Like all the things the Lord, your God,

959
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,320
 did for you in Egypt before your eyes?

960
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,640
 That's the Exodus.

961
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:16,000
 And the answer to the rhetorical questions are, of course,

962
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,200
 no, the Mount Sinai experience

963
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,560
 and the Exodus experience are unique.

964
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:24,000
 They're unprecedented.

965
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,920
 They'd not been done before, and they're unparalleled.

966
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,960
 They've not been done for any other nation.

967
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:33,960
 So you, Israel, you have a knowledge and experience

968
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:38,320
 of the living God, which at this moment in history is unique.

969
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,540
 No other nation has this.

970
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:42,960
 You were shown these things, verse 35,

971
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,840
 so that you might know what the other nations

972
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:49,720
 do not yet know, that the Lord Yahweh is God,

973
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:52,280
 and beside him there is no other.

974
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:55,680
 And he then repeats all of that from verses 36 to 39,

975
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,360
 says it all over again, in order to make absolutely sure

976
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:59,600
 that that is seen.

977
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:03,760
 So you see, given that unique status and privilege

978
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,600
 that Israel has, that of all the nations on the planet

979
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:10,720
 at that time, they are the one nation

980
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:14,880
 who have experienced God's redemption in Exodus

981
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,320
 and have experienced and enjoyed God's revelation

982
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:23,040
 in Mount Sinai, given that that is their unique status,

983
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,920
 then they must steward that, they must hold that,

984
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,800
 in a sense, on trust for the nations,

985
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,680
 and therefore they must live in such a way

986
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,160
 that the nations will start asking questions

987
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,920
 about this God and this way of life.

988
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:39,960
 And that's what we read in chapter four, verses six to eight.

989
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:43,200
 Now, as you probably know, again,

990
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,120
 if you've done any biblical studies,

991
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:48,480
 the book of Deuteronomy is a very motivational book.

992
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:52,920
 It takes many of the laws of Exodus and Leviticus

993
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:56,040
 and repeats many of them, but it repeats them often

994
00:44:56,040 --> 00:45:00,200
 with some motive clauses, why should you obey these laws,

995
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:03,080
 in order for this or that, or whatever it might be.

996
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:07,600
 It's a kind of preached law, as I think Ponrat once said.

997
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:11,400
 So here in verses six to eight, we read a motivation,

998
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,520
 why should you observe these laws?

999
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,000
 Verse six, observe these laws carefully,

1000
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,660
 for this will show your wisdom and understanding

1001
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:23,360
 to the nations, there they are, all of a sudden,

1002
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,800
 who will hear about all these decrees and will say,

1003
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:29,800
 surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people,

1004
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,640
 because what other nation is so great

1005
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,480
 as to have their gods near them,

1006
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:37,600
 the way Yahweh, our God, is near us whenever we pray to him,

1007
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,320
 and what other nation is so great

1008
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,800
 as to have such righteous decrees and laws

1009
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:44,700
 as this body of laws that I'm setting before you today?

1010
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,920
 Now these verses then, you see, six to eight,

1011
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,800
 they said Israel's ethical obedience to God

1012
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,520
 and to God's law in the land, when they would get there,

1013
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:56,960
 within the covenant, they set all of that

1014
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,540
 in the context of the watching nations.

1015
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:04,400
 Obedience to the law was not for Israel's benefit alone.

1016
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,880
 In fact, it's a marked feature of the Old Testament,

1017
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,720
 isn't it, that Israel lived in a very public stage.

1018
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,440
 I mean, the history of Israel all through the books,

1019
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,160
 right through Samuel, Kings, and so on, right on through,

1020
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,520
 the other nations are always there,

1021
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:21,560
 most often fighting against Israel, but they're there.

1022
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:25,420
 Israel is not in some vacuum-sealed isolation

1023
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:26,780
 from the world.

1024
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:29,120
 They live on a very open stage

1025
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,580
 in the international ancient Near East.

1026
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:35,680
 But what God is saying here is that that visibility

1027
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:39,660
 of Israel has a theological purpose,

1028
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:43,560
 that God wants the nations to see his people

1029
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,320
 and to ask questions.

1030
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:48,400
 And indeed, the nations in this passage

1031
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:52,000
 and in a number of other places in the Torah and elsewhere,

1032
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,520
 the nations are presented almost like spectators

1033
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,920
 in a drama, almost like the audience

1034
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,340
 of what's happening on stage.

1035
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:04,480
 They're witnesses to what God is doing in Israel,

1036
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,360
 which may be positive or negative.

1037
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:09,400
 In these verses, the hope is that the nations

1038
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:12,680
 might be impressed with the wisdom of Israel,

1039
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:15,700
 but more likely, as we read later in the book,

1040
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,960
 the nations are gonna be shocked

1041
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:22,020
 by the severity of God's judgment on Israel

1042
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:23,200
 when they abandon God.

1043
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,280
 That comes at the end of Deuteronomy,

1044
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,360
 when the judgments and the curses will fall on God's people

1045
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:29,800
 and the nations are, "Why is this happening?

1046
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:32,280
 "Why are these people being so badly judged?"

1047
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,680
 And God will say, "Because they disobeyed me."

1048
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:38,500
 So either way, whether faithfully obeying God

1049
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:41,000
 or unfaithfully disobeying God,

1050
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,360
 the people of God are an open book.

1051
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,880
 They can be seen by the world around.

1052
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:50,080
 And let's be honest, that's as true for the church

1053
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,240
 as it is for Israel,

1054
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:55,160
 and that's part of the challenge of Christian ethics.

1055
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:57,080
 So the nations then, in this verse,

1056
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:59,360
 they will take notice, they will take an interest

1057
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:03,220
 in this phenomenon of Israel as a society.

1058
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:06,920
 And the rhetorical questions that are asked in the passage

1059
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:11,920
 sharpen the point by speaking about Israel's greatness.

1060
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,760
 What are the nations so great?

1061
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,860
 Now, Israel was never a great nation

1062
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:20,540
 in any way we would use that word today.

1063
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:23,540
 They were never a very big nation or a powerful nation

1064
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:26,460
 or a military nation or anything, really.

1065
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:27,740
 I mean, to the most extent,

1066
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:29,740
 was perhaps under the empire of Solomon,

1067
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,580
 and that didn't last very long.

1068
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:33,080
 But according to this text,

1069
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:34,940
 the greatness of Israel will be based

1070
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:37,120
 on the nearness of God.

1071
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,280
 Our God is nearest.

1072
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:41,640
 They have a God with an intimacy of prayer and worship.

1073
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:45,200
 And secondly, the righteousness of the Torah,

1074
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,180
 the quality of their social justice,

1075
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:49,740
 which would be greater than any of the other nations.

1076
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:51,780
 And these would be the factors

1077
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:55,280
 that would lie behind this external reputation

1078
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,020
 and curiosity.

1079
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:59,160
 As far as the nations could see,

1080
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,020
 the thing that was different about Israel

1081
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:05,440
 was to be seen as a matter of wisdom and understanding.

1082
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,040
 And it would have to do with the presence of God

1083
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:11,320
 and the justice of God being exercised in their midst.

1084
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:15,400
 So from the point of view of our concern here

1085
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:18,440
 of bringing mission and ethics together,

1086
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:22,720
 these verses articulate a motivation for obedience to God,

1087
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,980
 which is easily overlooked.

1088
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:26,720
 Because what God is saying here is,

1089
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:30,260
 if only God's people would live as God intended,

1090
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:32,700
 if you would obey these laws,

1091
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:35,420
 then the nations would notice.

1092
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:38,180
 But then we remind ourselves that Israel, in any case,

1093
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:40,100
 only existed for the ultimate purpose

1094
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:41,580
 of being a blessing to the nations.

1095
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:42,880
 That's the reason for their election,

1096
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,780
 as we've been saying all through.

1097
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:47,620
 And so here we find that one aspect

1098
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:50,780
 of being a blessing to the nations

1099
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:55,460
 is by providing a model of national social justice

1100
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:58,760
 that the nations could observe and ask questions about.

1101
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:01,280
 And so the missional challenge of these verses

1102
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:05,480
 is that the ethical quality of the life of God's people,

1103
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:08,400
 their obedience to God's law and his constitution

1104
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,280
 and the whole economic political system he was giving them,

1105
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:15,000
 would be a vital factor in the attraction

1106
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,840
 of the nations to the living God.

1107
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:21,720
 In the book of Isaiah, this is described as their light.

1108
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:24,160
 Nations will come to your light.

1109
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,820
 But when Isaiah talks about the light of God's people

1110
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:29,260
 in chapter 58, he says it has to do

1111
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:31,020
 with removing the yoke of oppression,

1112
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:33,180
 feeding the poor, caring for the needy,

1113
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:35,460
 then your light will break forth

1114
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:37,180
 and your righteousness like the dawn.

1115
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:38,900
 That's Isaiah 58.

1116
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:41,900
 And so the light of God's people

1117
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:44,180
 is not just in a sense the light of the gospel

1118
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:45,740
 that we know the living God,

1119
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:48,860
 it's also the attractional light of living in a way

1120
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:50,360
 which draws people to God.

1121
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:53,140
 And that was an Old Testament principle

1122
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:56,200
 which Jesus picks up when he says to his disciples,

1123
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,740
 perhaps a bit surprised, he says,

1124
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:00,700
 "You know, you guys, you are the light of the world.

1125
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:02,220
 "So let your good deeds shine

1126
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:05,020
 "so that people may be drawn to God."

1127
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:08,260
 Because after all, when you think about this verse again,

1128
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:13,260
 what would the nations actually see in Israel?

1129
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:16,820
 They wouldn't see the nearness of God

1130
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:20,380
 because the nearness of God in a sense by definition

1131
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:21,380
 is invisible.

1132
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:26,020
 God is not even there as a statue in the temple.

1133
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:28,620
 This was part of the scandal of Israel's faith

1134
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:32,380
 that they didn't have an image of their God.

1135
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:33,940
 So when the nations look at Israel,

1136
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:34,780
 "Where are your gods?

1137
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:36,060
 "You really haven't got one."

1138
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:39,160
 They know our God is in heaven doing what he wants.

1139
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:41,620
 And these other gods that you've got

1140
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:43,740
 are powerless and useless.

1141
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:47,660
 So the nations would not see the nearness of God.

1142
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:51,300
 There is a vital link then between the invisible claims

1143
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,260
 that Israel would make about their God

1144
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:55,420
 as they pray to him would be modeled

1145
00:51:55,420 --> 00:52:00,420
 in the very visible practical way in which they would live.

1146
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:03,020
 And the world will only be interested

1147
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:05,740
 in the God we say we worship

1148
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:08,260
 when they see the way we live

1149
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:10,680
 according to the way we worship.

1150
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:12,860
 And if people don't see any difference

1151
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:16,540
 in the lives of those who make claims about their God,

1152
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:18,100
 they're not going to be particularly interested

1153
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:19,780
 in the God they say they worship.

1154
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:23,780
 So there's a very missional point at stake here,

1155
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:26,100
 which certainly hits us as Christians as well.

1156
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:30,540
 Well, that leads me just to a few concluding echoes

1157
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:31,800
 then in the New Testament.

1158
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:34,180
 I haven't picked all of this up into the New Testament,

1159
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:36,640
 but I think we need to be doing it in one or two ways.

1160
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,620
 Because as I've said all the way through,

1161
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:42,660
 it's this narrative framework of Old Testament Israel,

1162
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:45,760
 which was the framework within which Christ

1163
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:48,500
 and his apostles understood the gospel.

1164
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:51,760
 They understood that it's the God of Israel

1165
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:54,120
 who has kept his promise to the world

1166
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:56,660
 by sending his son Jesus as Messiah,

1167
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:58,620
 as the savior of the world.

1168
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:02,740
 And so what's very clear is that when these Old Testament,

1169
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:04,900
 these New Testament apostles thought

1170
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:08,160
 about living as Christians in the world,

1171
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:12,780
 they used these themes of election, redemption, and covenant

1172
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:16,260
 and drew from them the kind of ethical implications

1173
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:18,260
 that we've been seeing in the Old Testament.

1174
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:19,900
 And I just wanted to give two examples,

1175
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:23,460
 one from Ephesians and the other from 1 Peter.

1176
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:28,400
 In Ephesians, Paul links our election,

1177
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:31,660
 which he speaks about right up front in chapter one,

1178
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:33,700
 both to its ethical purpose

1179
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:36,260
 that we are to be holy and blameless

1180
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:38,220
 and to live to the praise of God's glory.

1181
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:40,100
 That's what he says we've been chosen for,

1182
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:42,460
 to praise his glorious grace.

1183
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:46,140
 We are chosen in him to be holy and blameless in his sight.

1184
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:48,000
 That's very Old Testament language.

1185
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,260
 So there's the ethical purpose,

1186
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:54,740
 but also he links that to God's great missional purpose

1187
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:56,460
 for the cosmos.

1188
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:59,700
 Same chapter, Ephesians chapter one, verses nine and 10,

1189
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:02,800
 God's purpose is to bring unity to all things

1190
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,620
 in heaven and earth under Christ.

1191
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:07,420
 So in one, 'cause it's all one sentence in the Greek,

1192
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:11,000
 Paul binds together God's election of his people

1193
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,780
 with the way his people live

1194
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:15,740
 with what God's plan is for the whole universe.

1195
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:19,680
 So cosmic unification in chapter one,

1196
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,940
 that's the oneness of creation,

1197
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:24,200
 to bind it all together in Christ,

1198
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:29,200
 flows into ethnic reconciliation in chapters two and three

1199
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,300
 where Paul builds the whole gospel

1200
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:35,120
 around how God has created one new humanity

1201
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:37,620
 for this one new creation,

1202
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:40,360
 a new humanity which is there in Jew and Gentile,

1203
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,860
 where God has made them one new man,

1204
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:45,060
 kainos anthropos, as he said.

1205
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:48,660
 And that indeed, he said, is to be proclaimed

1206
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:52,980
 to the powers, the wickedness, the wisdom and glory of God.

1207
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:55,500
 They will see the wisdom and glory of God

1208
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,540
 when it's manifested in the church,

1209
00:54:57,540 --> 00:55:00,860
 which is the people of God who've been united in one

1210
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:03,140
 from the dividedness of before.

1211
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:07,700
 So cosmic unification becomes ethnic reconciliation,

1212
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:11,760
 and that then leads in chapter four into ecclesial unity.

1213
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:16,000
 We are to live together in harmony with one another

1214
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,240
 and with ethical integrity,

1215
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:22,240
 so that we are to live out that one new man.

1216
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:25,960
 It's interesting that many of our English translations

1217
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:30,960
 miss the way Paul repeats that God has made Jew and Gentile

1218
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,840
 one new humanity, one new man,

1219
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:35,560
 and then says in chapter four

1220
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:38,480
 that we are to put off the old humanity

1221
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:40,040
 and put on that new man.

1222
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:42,760
 We are to live out the newness of humanity

1223
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,400
 that God has created.

1224
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,320
 So what I'm trying to say here is that

1225
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:51,320
 Ephesians is often portrayed as a kind of two-part book

1226
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:55,320
 in which you get gospel doctrine in the first half

1227
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:58,280
 and ethical implications in the second half.

1228
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:00,520
 And in some ways, that does seem,

1229
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:02,040
 but actually I want to say

1230
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:04,600
 it's all woven together throughout.

1231
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:08,520
 Paul is expounding election and redemption

1232
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:10,560
 and living as the people of God

1233
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:14,600
 in a way which has ethical dimensions all the way through

1234
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,040
 in terms of what we are

1235
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:18,320
 to live to the praise of glory in God.

1236
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:21,880
 So the ethical life of God's people as the new humanity,

1237
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:24,120
 the new way of being human,

1238
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:26,560
 is in itself part of the gospel.

1239
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:29,960
 It's part of the very reason why God brought us together.

1240
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:32,680
 And then finally, when we look at 1 Peter,

1241
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:36,000
 1 Peter binds the same things together

1242
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,880
 right from the start in chapter one.

1243
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:40,480
 He binds election, redemption, and sanctification

1244
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,000
 in his opening verses,

1245
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,440
 that we have been chosen,

1246
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,680
 according to the foreknowledge of God the Father,

1247
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:47,880
 through the sanctifying work of the Spirit

1248
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:52,080
 to be obedient to Jesus Christ and sprinkled with his blood.

1249
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:56,360
 So there's election and holiness and redemption

1250
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:58,000
 all within that passage.

1251
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,400
 And then later on in the same chapter,

1252
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:05,400
 he says in, I just fire away, in verses 13 to 16,

1253
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:09,280
 he says that as obedient children do not conform

1254
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:12,200
 to the evil desires you had when you lived in ignorance,

1255
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:14,600
 but just as he called you as holy,

1256
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:16,160
 so be holy in all you do.

1257
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:19,400
 For as it is written, be holy for I am holy.

1258
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:23,640
 Quotes Exodus, Leviticus 19, and applies it to Christians.

1259
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,000
 And then he brings in redemption.

1260
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,960
 He says, because you know that it was not

1261
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,080
 with perishable things like silver and gold

1262
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:31,640
 that you were redeemed from the empty way

1263
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:33,680
 of the life handed down to you from your ancestors,

1264
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:36,000
 but with the precious blood of Christ,

1265
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,080
 a lamb without blemish or defect,

1266
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:40,240
 who was chosen before the creation of the world.

1267
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,360
 And through him, you've been redeemed

1268
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:45,920
 by the blood of Christ, therefore purify yourself

1269
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,400
 and live in the way that he describes.

1270
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:51,400
 And so election, redemption, and living

1271
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:54,080
 are all put together there in that first chapter.

1272
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:55,880
 And in chapter two, as we have seen,

1273
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:59,400
 he brings that identity and mission of Israel

1274
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:02,920
 in Exodus 19 and applies it to Christian believers.

1275
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:05,960
 You are that chosen people, a royal priesthood,

1276
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:08,360
 a holy nation, God's special possession,

1277
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,480
 so that you may declare the praises of him

1278
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:13,960
 who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.

1279
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:17,080
 Once you were not a people, now you are the people of God.

1280
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:20,280
 That's all Exodus, redemption, election language.

1281
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:24,680
 Therefore, he says, live such good lives among the nations

1282
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:26,800
 that though they accuse you of doing wrong,

1283
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:29,520
 they may see your good deeds and glorify God

1284
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:31,360
 on the day he visits us.

1285
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:33,680
 And when you then move on from that chapter

1286
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,840
 into the rest of 1 Peter,

1287
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:39,080
 he shows that that then can be exemplified

1288
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:41,400
 in everyday ordinary life.

1289
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:44,120
 For example, that a believing wife,

1290
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:47,400
 through her behavior, through the way she lives,

1291
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:50,720
 can be instrumental in winning her husband to faith

1292
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,260
 in chapter three, verse one.

1293
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:56,740
 That to go on doing good, which he repeats again and again,

1294
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:59,520
 even in the midst of suffering and opposition,

1295
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:02,700
 doing good will lead to opportunities

1296
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:04,480
 to speak in defense of our faith,

1297
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,680
 to give a reason for the hope that was in us.

1298
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:09,720
 So the ethical quality of the life of Christians

1299
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:13,720
 will have an evangelistic and a missional implication.

1300
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:16,520
 So let me then draw this all to a conclusion.

1301
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:18,440
 Point we're making here is this,

1302
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:21,120
 that when we think about the ethical teaching

1303
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:24,320
 of the Old Testament and whether and how it relates

1304
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:26,680
 in the new, it's not enough.

1305
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:29,280
 It's not enough just to ask, well,

1306
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,240
 what applies to me and what doesn't?

1307
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:33,920
 That's usually a fairly fruitless kind of question.

1308
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:36,380
 It's not enough to ask, well,

1309
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:39,120
 what's the place of the Old Testament law now

1310
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:39,960
 in the Christian life?

1311
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:41,240
 Because again, that can lead

1312
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:43,480
 in all sorts of wrong directions.

1313
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:46,140
 We have to ask the first question, which is,

1314
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:49,680
 what was the purpose of the law in the life of Israel

1315
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,840
 to shape them to be God's people?

1316
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:54,160
 And before that, we need to ask,

1317
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:56,080
 and what was the purpose of Israel existing

1318
00:59:56,080 --> 01:00:00,520
 in the first place, which was to be a blessing to the world,

1319
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:02,720
 to be God's people in the midst of the world?

1320
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:05,440
 In other words, there is a missional answer

1321
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:08,320
 which has to be applied to the ethical teaching

1322
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:10,940
 of the Old Testament, and then consider

1323
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:12,720
 what that means for us.

1324
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:15,160
 The New Testament writers clearly believed

1325
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:17,800
 that God had kept his promise to Israel

1326
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:21,000
 in the life and death and resurrection of the Messiah,

1327
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,280
 and then in the ingathering of the nations

1328
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:25,440
 through the Gentile mission, and that those

1329
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:29,240
 who have now entered into this multinational people of God

1330
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:31,740
 by repentance and faith in Christ,

1331
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:34,360
 that means us, the global Christian church,

1332
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:38,480
 that we are called to the life of obedience and holiness

1333
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:41,440
 in order to participate in the mission of God,

1334
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:44,680
 based upon our redemption, based on the grace of God,

1335
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:46,720
 not in order to earn our salvation,

1336
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:50,560
 but we are called to the obedience of faith.

1337
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:52,480
 And so let me conclude with the words

1338
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:54,280
 of the Cape Town Commitment.

1339
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:57,320
 I referred to this earlier, the Lausanne Commitment,

1340
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:59,480
 because it tries to bind this all together

1341
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:00,800
 in one paragraph.

1342
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,960
 It's paragraph 110a.

1343
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,880
 It says this, and I'll just quote it.

1344
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:07,240
 I haven't got it on the screen.

1345
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:11,160
 "God calls his people to share God's mission.

1346
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:15,680
 The church from all nations stands in continuity organically

1347
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:18,800
 through the Messiah Jesus with God's people

1348
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:19,760
 in the Old Testament.

1349
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:23,120
 With them, we have been called through Abraham

1350
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:25,120
 and commissioned to be a blessing and a light

1351
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:26,360
 to the nations.

1352
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:29,440
 With them, we are to be shaped and taught

1353
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:32,280
 through the law and the prophets, all the scriptures,

1354
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:35,620
 to be a community of holiness, compassion, and justice

1355
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:37,740
 in a world of sin and suffering.

1356
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:41,080
 We have been redeemed through the cross and resurrection

1357
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:44,460
 of Jesus Christ and empowered by the Holy Spirit

1358
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:48,000
 to bear witness to what God has done in Christ.

1359
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,760
 The church exists to worship and glorify God

1360
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:56,040
 for all eternity and to participate

1361
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:59,440
 in the transforming mission of God within history.

1362
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:04,320
 Our mission is wholly derived from God's mission,

1363
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:07,200
 addresses the whole of God's creation,

1364
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,480
 and is grounded at its center

1365
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:12,000
 in the redeeming victory of the cross.

1366
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,000
 This is the people to whom we belong,

1367
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:19,560
 whose faith we confess, and whose mission we share."

1368
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:22,480
 Amen.

1369
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:23,320
 Thank you.

1370
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:24,140
 Thank you, Grace.
