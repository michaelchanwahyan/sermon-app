1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,680
 Brothers and sisters in Christ, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to tonight's public lecture

2
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:21,440
 jointly organized by the China Graduate School of Theology and the Langham Foundation Hong

3
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:29,400
 Kong, featuring our distinguished guest speaker tonight, Reverend Dr. Munta Isaac.

4
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,960
 My name is Simon Cheung, a member of the Old Testament Faculty of Teaching at this school.

5
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,000
 It's my honor tonight to introduce our speaker to you.

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:48,040
 Dr. Isaac is currently the academic dean at Bethlehem Bible College, an evangelical seminary

7
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:53,280
 founded by Palestinian Christians in 1979.

8
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,800
 As the seminary, he is also the director of the seminary choir, and over the dinner, he

9
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:06,380
 told us that he used to compose music for the choir to sing, so he is richly talented

10
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,440
 in music as well.

11
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:14,600
 He's also the current director of the conference called Christ at the Checkpoint.

12
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:21,240
 May I quote from Paul Alexander, who edited a volume of the essays presented at this conference

13
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,440
 in 2010, to see how he described this event.

14
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:32,800
 He begins to quote, "The Palestinian Christians who organized the conference are motivated

15
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:40,480
 by their love for God, their love for Israelis, and their love for fellow Palestinians."

16
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:48,640
 The conference is described as a labor of love of those who prayerfully seek justice

17
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:56,440
 and reconciliation done among the Palestinian and Israeli communities in the land of constant

18
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,320
 conflicts.

19
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:05,560
 The ministry of Musalaha, so it is called, and Dr. Isaac is actively involved in this

20
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,560
 work.

21
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:14,040
 Dr. Isaac did his first theological training at Westminster Theological Seminary, and later

22
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:20,220
 on continued with his doctorate studies at Oxford Center of Mission Studies.

23
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:27,200
 He wrote his thesis under two supervisors, one from Oxford and one from Cambridge, and

24
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:35,640
 completed his studies in 2014, and with remarkable and admirable efficiency, published it in

25
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:43,720
 2015 under the title, "From Land to Lands, from Eden to the Renewed Earth, a Price Center

26
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,920
 for Biblical Theology and the Promised Land."

27
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:52,040
 A sample of it I'm holding in my hand, and there are only a few copies left downstairs

28
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:57,960
 at the bookstore, so be quick to grab one after the lecture.

29
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:05,000
 May I quote again from another of Dr. Isaac's essay, which begins with this observation.

30
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:12,520
 He says, "Palestinian Christians have struggled for many years with the Old Testament in general,

31
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:17,400
 and with the theology of the land in particular."

32
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:23,880
 Clearly enough, Dr. Isaac's work tackles right at the heart of the most difficult problem

33
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:28,400
 of Christian faith faced by his Palestinian people.

34
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:35,240
 Tonight, he'll share with us his insights gleaned from his studies and his ministry

35
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:41,520
 under the topic, "Towards a Shared Land Theology, a Palestinian Christian Reading of the Land

36
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,520
 Promises."

37
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:49,400
 His talk will be followed by a Q&A section immediately afterward.

38
00:03:49,400 --> 00:04:01,120
 Without further ado, shall we welcome Reverend Dr. Muntir Isaac with our warmest applause?

39
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,640
 [applause]

40
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:08,760
 Thank you very much for this introduction.

41
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,160
 For a while, I didn't recognize myself.

42
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:20,920
 I really appreciate that kind introduction, and thank you for coming this evening to listen

43
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,240
 to my presentation on the theology of the land.

44
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:30,960
 I've been in Hong Kong for a week, and really we've been overwhelmed with your kindness,

45
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,200
 your generosity, and hospitality.

46
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:39,240
 And I want to thank you again from the bottom of my heart for all the support you've shown

47
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,880
 me personally and my family, and also the church in Palestine as well.

48
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:54,240
 Yes, the title of my talk is "Towards a Shared Land Theology," and clearly the theology of

49
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:02,080
 the land is something we have struggled with as Palestinian Christians for many, many years.

50
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:09,000
 The creation of the State of Israel created a dilemma for Palestinian Christians.

51
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:19,040
 Today we live in a reality that is pretty much characterized by division, by separation,

52
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,640
 and by a dispute over land.

53
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:29,680
 More than often that dispute was violent and resulted in clashes, attacks.

54
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,920
 And in my very young life, I've witnessed so many uprisings and demonstrations and fights

55
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,880
 over that land.

56
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:42,280
 Today if you come to Palestine and Israel, you will be struck by the separation wall

57
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:50,080
 that divides the two people, a physical wall that reflects a more deeper reality of spiritual

58
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,960
 and psychological separation between two peoples.

59
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:02,160
 And just to give you an idea why this topic, the theology of the land, was or has been

60
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:08,720
 a challenging one for Palestinian Christians, as you quoted, I always like to begin my talk

61
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,960
 with referencing to the story of a friend of mine, a church member, who owns land that

62
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:21,400
 inherited, he inherited and his family from their grandparents, a Palestinian Christian.

63
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:27,480
 This land is under threat of being confiscated by Jewish settlers, supported by the Israeli

64
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,120
 military.

65
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,280
 And in their effort to keep their land, they fight in court and they maintain papers that

66
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:39,640
 all prove their possession of the land for centuries, papers that date back all the way

67
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,040
 to the days of the Ottoman Empire.

68
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:48,880
 And one day when the Jewish settlers arrived to their land, trying to uproot some trees

69
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:54,440
 and bulldoze their way, my friend stopped them and said, "Wait a minute, this is our

70
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,800
 land, we have papers."

71
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,920
 Jewish settlers responded, one of them by holding a Bible from his pocket and saying,

72
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:06,720
 "This is our land, we have papers as well."

73
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,760
 And this tells you how the Bible is used today in Palestine and Israel, but try at the same

74
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:17,880
 time to imagine what does that make to my Palestinian Christian friend and to the Palestinian

75
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,880
 Christian community.

76
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,640
 This is the Bible we worship from, this is the Bible we meet God in, this is the source

77
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,360
 of our faith.

78
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,660
 And all of a sudden that Bible became a threat to us.

79
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:33,800
 And that's why many Palestinian Christians today struggle with the Old Testament, with

80
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,940
 the promises, with the story of Israel.

81
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:43,720
 And that's why someone like me decided to spend my PhD time working on that theme, the

82
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,880
 theology of the land.

83
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:54,160
 The theme continues to be disputed today, even many Muslims claim that the land belongs

84
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,760
 to them by divine claim.

85
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:05,360
 Not all, and of course not all Jews do what these Jewish settlers do, so don't understand

86
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:11,040
 from what I'm saying that all Jews are like this or all Muslims like this, but this reflects

87
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:17,400
 ideologies that exist today and many times these are the loudest voices that we hear

88
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:23,720
 and most certainly the most violent voices that we hear.

89
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:31,640
 Yet what interests us most today is the fact that many Christians hold strong beliefs of

90
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,520
 the land.

91
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:38,960
 And as I often say, with very little knowledge of what is happening on the ground and very

92
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,800
 little knowledge of the consequences of those beliefs.

93
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:48,840
 A very general theme is applied on these Christians, Christian Zionism, and basically Christian

94
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:57,120
 Zionism is the belief that any strand among Christianity that supports Israel for theological

95
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,040
 reasons.

96
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:05,280
 Christian Zionism is the default position of many Christians today and of most evangelical

97
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,280
 Christians.

98
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:12,680
 And to give you an idea of some of the presuppositions of Christian Zionism, many believe that if

99
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:19,560
 you bless Israel, God will bless you, and that if you stand against Israel, God will

100
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,080
 curse you.

101
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:29,120
 This is based on one interpretation to Genesis 12, 1 to 3, and of course I will present in

102
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,440
 my talk an alternative interpretation to that verse, which actually speaks about Abraham,

103
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,960
 the people of Israel, or their seed, but that's a different issue.

104
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:43,600
 They also assume that God gave the land to the Jewish people as an eternal possession.

105
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:49,360
 And as such, the Jews have a divine right to the land today.

106
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,440
 And notice with me the language of divine right, the language of eternal possession,

107
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,240
 which is very common used.

108
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:03,720
 And again, try to understand or try to put yourself in the place of a Palestinian or

109
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,880
 a Palestinian Christian when we hear claims like that.

110
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,720
 When we hear that someone else have a divine right to our land, what does that make us?

111
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:20,640
 It immediately puts us in this strange position of standing in opposition to God.

112
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:26,760
 And so today we continue to see debates among Christians such as that, do Jews have a divine

113
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,400
 right to Israel's land?

114
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:34,160
 And commonly the answer is yes, because they are the descendants of biblical Israel, and

115
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:40,960
 many people just draw a straight line from biblical Israel to the modern state of Israel

116
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:46,880
 with sometimes very tragic consequences on the Palestinian community.

117
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:53,760
 And again, this puts us in a crisis as Palestinian Christians.

118
00:10:53,760 --> 00:11:00,240
 Christian Zionism is more than just a theological belief, because it's also a political movement,

119
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,040
 a political movement that lobbies on behalf of the state of Israel and funds the state

120
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,800
 of Israel with hundreds of millions of dollars every year.

121
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:15,640
 Some of it goes to the building of settlements that are illegal to international law, and

122
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:22,480
 many of them even are not willing to support mission among the Jewish people, but are willing

123
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:28,640
 to invest millions of dollars to the state of Israel.

124
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,320
 Of course, as I said, that theology, theology of Christian Zionism is a theology that is

125
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:38,400
 very problematic to Palestinian Christians, because it is a theology that marginalized

126
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,800
 us, often ignored us.

127
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:46,040
 You know, when you speak that Jews have a divine right to Israel's land, I always ask,

128
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,360
 so what about the Palestinian?

129
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,080
 What about the Palestinian population?

130
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:55,880
 And that question is never or seldom addressed by Christian Zionists.

131
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,960
 They always pretend as if we don't exist.

132
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:05,480
 A very old slogan that was promoted by the Zionist movement and by Christian Zionists

133
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:10,280
 is a land without a people for a people without a land.

134
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,160
 Talking about our land as a land without a people.

135
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:19,960
 And in that sense, we are pretty much invisible to them or nonexistent.

136
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:28,680
 And in that I always say we have been dehumanized as Palestinians simply by that tradition.

137
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:33,880
 And so what I would like to present with you today is a summary of my book.

138
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,360
 It's 400 pages.

139
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:41,840
 It's very ambitious to try to do so in the next 40 minutes or so.

140
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:47,120
 In what I called a shared land, a place in which we read the Bible and ask the question,

141
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,860
 is there a place for both people on the land?

142
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:56,400
 What is the place of land in the biblical story of salvation?

143
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:03,280
 I decided to study that theme and look carefully to scripture, and not simply ignore the Bible

144
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:07,240
 and say justice matters or human rights is more important.

145
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:13,920
 But to see really, is it true that our God, the God of the good news of salvation, the

146
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,720
 God who sent Jesus to die on the cross, is it true that he has promised our land to someone

147
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,520
 else and that we have no right in it today?

148
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:27,320
 And so I wanted to be faithful to our Christian heritage and study the Old Testament and the

149
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,720
 New Testament and look at the question on the land.

150
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:39,800
 And with that, I want to begin by looking at the Old Testament and asking some questions

151
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,560
 in dialogue with Christian Zionism.

152
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:50,040
 But really, these questions should guide us, as you will see, to understand the whole picture

153
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:57,160
 of salvation, the biblical story of redemption as we encounter it in scripture.

154
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:02,320
 These questions are whose land is it to begin with?

155
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,000
 What were the boundaries of the promised land?

156
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,760
 What is Israel or who is Israel in the Old Testament?

157
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:16,720
 Were the promises of the land unconditional or was it different?

158
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,760
 And the question that I feel very few people ask, and I try to address this in my book,

159
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,780
 why a land to begin with?

160
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:27,280
 Why did God promise Abraham a land?

161
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,640
 What's the purpose behind that promise?

162
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:35,320
 So now we go in with a journey trying to answer these questions from scripture.

163
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,320
 The first one is easy.

164
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,640
 I always tell my student, you don't need a PhD to answer the first question.

165
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,440
 The land belongs to God.

166
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:46,680
 It's God's land, okay?

167
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,120
 God created the earth and he owns it.

168
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,920
 It's his, okay?

169
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,240
 The earth is the Lord's, as the psalmist declared.

170
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,760
 To him belongs the heaven and heaven and heavens.

171
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,900
 The earth with all that is in it.

172
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,300
 We all belong to God.

173
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,840
 Our lands belong to God.

174
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,160
 The whole earth belongs to God.

175
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:09,480
 And in particular, what really matters here is the promised land in particular in the

176
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,360
 story of Israel.

177
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:17,840
 God declared in Leviticus 25 that the land shall not be sold in perpetuity, for the land

178
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,840
 is mine.

179
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:22,880
 In other words, Israel, when I give you the land, it is not yours to do with it whatever

180
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,880
 you want.

181
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,200
 It remains my land.

182
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:31,040
 It's a very crucial basic point that we should start with.

183
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,400
 The land that God gives never becomes our possession.

184
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:41,680
 And if you know Leviticus 25, you know that this verse, "the land is mine," came in the

185
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,400
 context of the Jubilee.

186
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:49,320
 And the Jubilee is basically a reminder to Israel that the land is given to you for the

187
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,440
 benefit of the community.

188
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,920
 You should distribute it equally among you.

189
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,760
 Every seven years, you let the land to rest, and that's a biblical mandate.

190
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:06,800
 Not only that, in the year, in the 50th year, after 50 years, if some of you became rich,

191
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,640
 some of you became poor, some of you had more land than the others, some of you became slave

192
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:16,320
 to others, you press the restart button and start from zero again.

193
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:21,040
 Redistribute the land equally so that we make sure no one is poor, no one is rich, so that

194
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:26,800
 we make sure no one owns the whole land and very few people own little land.

195
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:33,120
 And God reminds Israel here that even if you become rich and own land, it's not yours.

196
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,760
 The land belongs ultimately to God.

197
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:42,600
 This is a reminder to Israel that she does not own the land, for the land, as I said,

198
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,680
 belongs ultimately to God.

199
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:50,560
 Israel is not free to do with the land whatever she wants or to claim eternal possession of

200
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,300
 it.

201
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:57,640
 These land Sabbath laws remind Israel that the land is not from Israel but is a gift

202
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:04,760
 to Israel and that the land is not fully given over for Israel's self-indulgence.

203
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:09,320
 This is a crucial point to begin with.

204
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:16,240
 My second point, what are the boundaries of the promised land and why?

205
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:22,800
 Interestingly, in scripture we find different descriptions of the borders of the land.

206
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,880
 It's never fixed.

207
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:30,640
 And the first promise to Abraham is actually much more than what is known today as Palestine

208
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,340
 and Israel.

209
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,120
 That is very often ignored.

210
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,880
 We assume that the promised land is modern day Palestine and Israel, whereas it's much

211
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,800
 more than that.

212
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:46,840
 The promised land, as you see from the picture to Abraham, is from the river, from the Nile

213
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,000
 to the Euphrates.

214
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,520
 And so sometimes jokingly I tell Christian Zionists, if you want to use scripture, at

215
00:17:54,520 --> 00:18:00,200
 least be consistent and argue that Israel today should wage war with Jordan, Lebanon,

216
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:05,600
 Syria, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt to claim the promised land.

217
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,480
 Otherwise don't use scripture.

218
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:14,000
 But not only that, even in history, in the Old Testament when Israel actually entered

219
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,120
 the land during the days of Joshua, two and a half tribes stayed in the east of Jordan,

220
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,680
 what is today Jordan and even parts of Lebanon.

221
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:28,560
 And during Solomon's reign the land extended way up in the north.

222
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:35,520
 We've always had these fluid boundaries and we need to ask why.

223
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:43,680
 And it is here that I rely most on actually Jewish scholars who argued from ancient Near

224
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:50,920
 East traditions and texts that in the old days when people wanted to describe boundaries

225
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:56,120
 and describe boundaries from water boundaries to other water boundaries, they were actually

226
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:01,000
 describing the whole universe, the whole world as they knew it.

227
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:08,720
 A Jewish scholar by the name of Neelie Vazana says that the promised reflected spatial merisms

228
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,160
 and is not to be understood literally, nor should it be translated and transformed into

229
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:21,520
 borderlines or maps, but the promised land to Abraham is a promise of world dominion.

230
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,440
 They are referring to universal rule.

231
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,720
 And actually it makes sense because if you think of it, that is the world as Abraham

232
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,400
 knew it.

233
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:38,560
 In fact, second temple Jewish traditions also believe that the promise to Abraham was a

234
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,160
 promise of the universe.

235
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,880
 I would show you later that even Paul believed that the promise to Abraham wasn't a promise

236
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:53,600
 of one particular land, but a promise that he would inherit the cosmos, the universe.

237
00:19:53,600 --> 00:20:01,520
 And actually we should see it because when God called Abraham in Genesis 12, 1 to 3,

238
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:06,440
 the climax of that calling to Abraham was the statement that through him, through Abraham,

239
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:11,880
 if you know the Bible, Genesis 12, 3, through you, Abraham, all the families of the earth

240
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,000
 shall find blessing.

241
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,520
 And so the promise that Abraham will become a great nation implies both numerous seed

242
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:27,680
 and land expansion, and it must be understood as being subservient to God's principle desire

243
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:31,640
 to bless all the families of the earth.

244
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:36,480
 Palestinian theologian Yohanna Ketanashu puts it this way, "It seems that the land of Abraham

245
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,660
 is not going to have fixed borders.

246
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:47,360
 It will continue to expand, thus increasing in size both territorially and demographically.

247
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:53,840
 The land of Abraham will continue to extend until it is equal to the whole earth."

248
00:20:53,840 --> 00:21:02,040
 And so if we see it this way, Canaan or modern day Palestine of Israel becomes only the first

249
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,440
 phase, the beginning.

250
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:08,600
 Jerusalem is only the beginning of that expansion.

251
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:14,440
 For the God we believe in is the God of the whole earth, not only the God of one particular

252
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,560
 land.

253
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:21,360
 This is not something that is exclusive to the Abrahamic tradition.

254
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:27,680
 When we consider the messianic prophecies, the land of the Messiah, for example in Psalm

255
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:33,080
 2, 8, one of the most important verses in the theology of the land, a strategic verse

256
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:41,760
 in my study, there God says to the king of Israel, "I will give you the nations as your

257
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:48,360
 inheritance and the ends of the earth as your possession."

258
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,600
 That's the land of the Messiah, not just one piece of land.

259
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,320
 We see this in other Psalms.

260
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:58,020
 We see it in many other prophecies like in Daniel and Micah where the Messiah shall rule

261
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:03,200
 until his rule will extend to the ends of the earth.

262
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,240
 See it's never limited to one piece of land.

263
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:13,920
 That's why my book, I argue that our right understanding of the theology of the land

264
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:19,520
 should be not about the promised land, but the promised earth.

265
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,280
 And I hope that by the end of my lecture you begin to see even Hong Kong as a promised

266
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:32,000
 earth, as part of the promised land, if we abide by God's covenant, as I will argue.

267
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,800
 The theology of the land has a universal thrust.

268
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:42,800
 Through God's servant, Israel, Adam, later the Messiah, the land should expand until

269
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,880
 it reaches the ends of the earth.

270
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:50,320
 And actually what's interesting is that in the Hebrew language, the word for land and

271
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,320
 earth is the same, haaretz.

272
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,720
 Okay?

273
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,800
 And I wonder if that is intentional.

274
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:06,160
 So the theology of the land is ultimately the theology of the earth.

275
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,480
 Are you with me so far?

276
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,860
 Very good.

277
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:13,000
 So we asked whose land and we asked what are the boundaries of the land.

278
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,520
 We're still in the Old Testament.

279
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:20,160
 My next point is about the covenanted land.

280
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:26,400
 Were the promises really unconditional as some argue?

281
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,600
 Were the land given as a possession, meaning it is yours once and for all and this can

282
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,400
 never change?

283
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:40,480
 The word forever, eternal, does it apply here on the theology of the land?

284
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:46,440
 Chris Wright reminds us, the head of Langham, that it is insufficient simply to say that

285
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:54,040
 the Lord gave the land to Israel without taking into consideration the context of the gift,

286
00:23:54,040 --> 00:24:00,560
 which was the covenant relationship and its reciprocal commitments.

287
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:06,680
 The land was an integral part not only of the Lord's faithfulness to Israel, but also

288
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:12,520
 of Israel's covenantal obligation to the Lord.

289
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:18,960
 We cannot understand the land without understanding the covenant.

290
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:26,480
 And when you read the story of Israel, many, many times, and I can actually spend the next

291
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:32,600
 30 minutes reading to you verses from the Old Testament that sets conditions to maintaining

292
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,600
 the land.

293
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,720
 I will just choose a few.

294
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:42,440
 Leviticus 18 is a very clear one and has a special meaning, actually.

295
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:46,400
 The whole chapter is thinking about the sins of the people who were living in the land

296
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:51,440
 before of Israel and then God tells Israel, remember now Israel is getting ready to enter

297
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:57,160
 the land, "Do not make yourselves unclean by any of these things.

298
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:02,880
 For by all these, the nations I am driving out before you have become unclean.

299
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:09,600
 And the land became unclean so that I punish its iniquity and the land vomited out its

300
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,600
 inhabitants.

301
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:16,480
 But you shall keep my status and my rules and do none of these abominations, either

302
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:21,560
 the native or the stranger who sojourns among you."

303
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,160
 Very important statement.

304
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,960
 For the people of the land who were before you did all of these abominations so that

305
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:33,960
 the land became unclean, lest the land vomit you out when you make it unclean, as it vomited

306
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:38,440
 out the nation that was before you.

307
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:46,080
 Strong warnings, not just to Israel, but to anybody who lives in the land.

308
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,840
 The land does not tolerate unholiness.

309
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,600
 The land does not tolerate sin.

310
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:58,560
 And notice how here this text equals Israel with the nations that were before her in the

311
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,560
 land.

312
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,960
 Did you notice that?

313
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:08,160
 And not only that, gives the same commandments to the Israelites and to the strangers who

314
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,160
 live in the land.

315
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:13,600
 In other words, the land does not discriminate.

316
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:18,280
 The land treats all of its inhabitants equally.

317
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:22,080
 And you need to pay attention to these verses because later I will argue that what applied

318
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,600
 to the promised land actually should apply to any land.

319
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,280
 The land does not tolerate ungodliness.

320
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,920
 And this is a very key point for the theology of the land.

321
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:41,400
 In Deuteronomy 16, 20, the condition that is set before the Israelites for keeping the

322
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,480
 land is nothing but justice.

323
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:51,920
 Justice and only justice you shall follow that you may live and inherit the land that

324
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:55,160
 the Lord your God is giving you.

325
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,960
 Cannot be said more explicit or more clear.

326
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:03,360
 A clear condition to inheriting the land is justice.

327
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:09,680
 If there is no justice, you have no right to live in the land.

328
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,600
 That's what the covenant is about.

329
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,800
 There are no free gifts here.

330
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:19,040
 There are no gifts with no conditions or no strings attached.

331
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,040
 God holds us accountable.

332
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:25,640
 And I wish I have time to go through the whole doctrine of election because oftentimes we

333
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:32,200
 confuse election with privilege, whereas election is in fact about responsibility and duty.

334
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:37,640
 If you are elected, that means you are a servant to the others.

335
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,680
 That's the real meaning of election.

336
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:46,960
 And we have turned it over and over as the people of God into some sort of a privilege,

337
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,280
 whereas it's about serving.

338
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:57,480
 Think of Jesus, the servant, the chosen servant.

339
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:03,120
 Now of course if you know the history of Israel in the Bible, they lost the land in exile

340
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:10,440
 because of disobedience, because they broke the covenant often and often.

341
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:15,640
 And after the exile, we have a very interesting verse in Ezekiel 33 which reminds Israel that

342
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:21,760
 they are still obligated to obey God if they wish to have any chance of returning to the

343
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,160
 land.

344
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:30,240
 And in that incident, the people of Israel actually try to depend on ethnicity.

345
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,760
 They say, "Abraham is our father.

346
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,760
 He was one.

347
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,760
 He inherited the land.

348
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,760
 We are many.

349
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,960
 We too shall inherit the land."

350
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,120
 They think it's this simple.

351
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,840
 And it's amazing what God says.

352
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:45,480
 "Therefore say to them, 'Thus says the Lord God, 'You eat flesh with the blood and lift

353
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:49,040
 up your eyes to your idols and shed blood.

354
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:52,200
 Shall you then possess the land?

355
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,280
 You rely on the sword.

356
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:59,400
 You commit abominations, and each of you defiles his neighbor's wife.

357
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:03,040
 Shall you then possess the land?'"

358
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:06,600
 Strong, clear warnings.

359
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:11,040
 And it's here where I want to emphasize that no other sin in the Old Testament was tied

360
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:19,720
 more directly with being expelled from the land than the sin of socioeconomic injustice.

361
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:24,640
 Chris Wright puts it this way, "The prophets simply would not allow Israel to get away

362
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:30,720
 with claiming the blessing and protection of the covenant relationship for their society

363
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:37,160
 while trampling on the socioeconomic demands of that relationship."

364
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:43,240
 The most emphasized sin in terms of quantity of verses, if you want to put it this way,

365
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:48,200
 we find in the warnings what leads to losing the land, nothing more in Scripture, believe

366
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:55,160
 me, I studied all these verses, than the sin of socioeconomic injustice.

367
00:29:55,160 --> 00:30:01,520
 And that leads me, and I spend a lot of time in the book talking about this, to discuss

368
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:08,280
 some technical terms that we used and continue to use in our theological traditions, sometimes

369
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,040
 without reflecting on their meanings.

370
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:15,840
 One of them is the word in Hebrew, "la'olam," in English translated "forever," because

371
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:22,680
 oftentimes we think it's forever and ending, whereas if you study the word in the Old Testament,

372
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:26,760
 many many times things are declared that they will last forever, whereas they actually don't

373
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,240
 last forever.

374
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:35,480
 The Aaron was supposed to be a priest forever and his descendants, the temple was supposed

375
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:40,720
 to stand forever, David as a king forever, and so on.

376
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:47,040
 And one of the most striking examples about that word forever, though not related to the

377
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:52,680
 theology of the land directly but actually gives us a very clear indication of that term,

378
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:58,720
 is in 1 Samuel 2 30, talking about Eli, the priest back then.

379
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:04,600
 "Therefore the Lord, the God of Israel, declares to Eli, 'I promise that your house and the

380
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:10,040
 house of your father should go in and out before me forever.'"

381
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:15,960
 Clear, no dispute.

382
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:23,600
 Yet the next sentence, "But now the Lord declares, 'Far be it from me, for those who honor me

383
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:30,080
 I will honor, and those who despise me shall be lightly esteemed.'"

384
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:36,000
 And it seems that even the word forever is here conditioned to obedience to God and honoring

385
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,480
 God.

386
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:44,640
 Another word that we're discussing is the word "nachalai" in Hebrew, which is often translated

387
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:50,640
 "inheritance," because many times people confuse it with possession.

388
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:56,560
 Whereas I would argue that the right interpretation of that verse is that it is a mandate, never

389
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,560
 a possession.

390
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:04,640
 Brueggemann puts it this way, the renowned Old Testament scholar, "Land with God brings

391
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,200
 responsibility.

392
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:12,800
 The same land that is gift freely given is tasked sharply put.

393
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,160
 Landed Israel is under mandate."

394
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:21,280
 Chris Wright puts it, "Like all tenants, therefore, Israelites were accountable to

395
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:29,800
 their divine landlord for proper treatment of what was ultimately his property."

396
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,400
 That is the right meaning of land.

397
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:35,120
 It's never our possession, as I argued in my first point.

398
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:40,640
 It's always a mandate, and that's why how we treat the land, what we do in the land,

399
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,400
 how we treat our neighbors in the land matters to God.

400
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:51,440
 And because it's his land, he is free to take it from us whenever he wants.

401
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:56,640
 The Old Testament introduces us to this conflict, to this concept of a land that comes with

402
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,560
 conditions.

403
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:04,080
 On the one hand, it wants to underscore the sovereignty of God and his gracious nature,

404
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,480
 evident by his giving of the land.

405
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:11,280
 And on the other, it wants at the same time to underscore the ethical and moral nature

406
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:22,440
 of God and to show how this demands nothing but total allegiance from the people of God.

407
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:26,160
 My next point, I hope you're with me.

408
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,960
 This is interesting.

409
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,960
 Very good.

410
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,200
 Who is Israel?

411
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:37,280
 Sometimes, you know, again, we take these things for granted, but we fail to ask, "Was

412
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,960
 Abraham an Israelite?"

413
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,760
 Was Ruth an Israelite?

414
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,760
 Think of that.

415
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,760
 She was a Moabite.

416
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:50,400
 Ruth is actually a very interesting figure because throughout the book of Ruth, every

417
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,920
 time she is mentioned, she is Ruth the Moabite.

418
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,920
 Every time.

419
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,800
 It wants to remind us she's a stranger.

420
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:01,840
 And at the beginning of the book, she declares to her mother-in-law, "Your people are my

421
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:06,480
 people and your God is my God."

422
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,520
 And she becomes part of the people of God.

423
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,960
 Interesting.

424
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,280
 Was Solomon an Israelite?

425
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:20,240
 Remember, the mother of Solomon wasn't a Jew, wasn't part of the people of God.

426
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:24,080
 David married Beth Sheba.

427
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:28,720
 And when we study scripture, we realize that it's full of intermarriages.

428
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,480
 Judah married a Canaanite.

429
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,480
 Joseph an Egyptian.

430
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,480
 Moses a Midianite.

431
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:38,160
 And Solomon, well, we know.

432
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,880
 The Bible is full of intermarriages.

433
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,880
 That's my point.

434
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:46,520
 Judges 3 says that the people of Israel lived among these nations, and it names them, and

435
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:51,360
 their daughters they took to themselves for wives, and their own daughters they gave to

436
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:55,800
 their sons, and they served their gods.

437
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:02,440
 And think sometimes we assume this clear ethnicity thing that runs through scripture.

438
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:09,840
 But only that, in the book of Esther, it declares at the end of the book, after God rescues

439
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:16,840
 the people of Israel, "And many from the peoples of the country declared themselves Jews, for

440
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:21,300
 fear of Jews had fallen on them."

441
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:26,240
 In scripture, people could become Jews.

442
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,320
 In other words, it's a matter of faith.

443
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:36,760
 Becoming part of Israel in the Old Testament wasn't exclusively dependent on ethnicity.

444
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,400
 And please try to understand what I'm saying.

445
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:44,760
 I am not denying that Jews existed over the centuries as a distinct people or religion.

446
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:50,840
 Nor am I negating Jews' right to define themselves as a people as they understand their tradition.

447
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:59,780
 I am simply looking at the Old Testament and asking, is it by ethnicity alone?

448
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,940
 Is it by DNA alone?

449
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:07,680
 And can anybody really claim a clear DNA from Abraham to today, given all the intermarriages

450
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:13,160
 that I explained, and then claim possession of the land?

451
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:17,320
 And if it's really about faith, as I am arguing here, and as I will argue strongly in the

452
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:25,400
 New Testament, don't we all believe in the God of Israel when we believe in Jesus, the

453
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,400
 Jewish Messiah?

454
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:33,640
 Hold that point in mind, because we will definitely come back to it.

455
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:38,520
 My final question in the Old Testament section, before moving to the New Testament, is why

456
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,520
 a land?

457
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:44,000
 And it's here I want to refer again to my book, where I began my study of the land not

458
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,440
 in Genesis 12 with the promise of the land to Abraham, but rather with Genesis 1, 2,

459
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:53,920
 and 3, the creation narrative and the giving of the Garden of Eden.

460
00:36:53,920 --> 00:37:00,080
 And there I believe we have a picture of the first promised land, the Garden of Eden.

461
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:03,080
 It was the first land.

462
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:10,320
 And the sin resulted in death, and that death actually was expulsion from the Garden of

463
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,760
 Eden.

464
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,760
 That's the first exile.

465
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:20,440
 If we learn anything from Eden, we learn that we are accountable before God for our actions,

466
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:25,280
 and that the beautiful gift of Eden could be taken from us.

467
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:33,800
 Yet not only that, Eden was supposed to be a blessing to the rest of the creation, because

468
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:40,640
 in Genesis 1, God tells Adam and Eve, "Be fruitful," I think I have it, "and multiply

469
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,200
 and fill the earth and subdue it."

470
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,200
 It's the notion of the kingdom.

471
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:50,840
 And have dominion over the fish and the birds and the heavens and everything on earth.

472
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:57,000
 And if that is supposed to happen, that's what Adam and Eve are supposed to do, and

473
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:05,360
 they were located in Eden, then this gives us an idea about Eden as a center of the universe

474
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:10,960
 that is supposed to bless the rest of creation.

475
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,920
 That is the paradigm we have in scripture.

476
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:19,660
 And as such, we see Eden as the first promised land.

477
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:28,280
 We also see Adam as the first Israel, or Israel as the second Adam.

478
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:33,000
 All part of a process to restore what was lost in Eden.

479
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:40,160
 And so I argue in my book that the whole idea of Abraham being chosen and given a land is

480
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:48,080
 to restore what was lost in Eden, the first land, with the goal of redeeming all of creation,

481
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:55,040
 with the goal of redeeming the creation of God, redeeming all of the earth.

482
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,480
 And that's really the goal from the verse to Abraham.

483
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:03,720
 In the midst of Genesis 12, 1 to 3, God tells Abraham, "You be a blessing."

484
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:04,720
 It's a commandment.

485
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,400
 Actually, some translation has it, "You shall be a blessing."

486
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:11,400
 I don't know what it is in Chinese, but really it is a commandment.

487
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,680
 Be a blessing.

488
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:21,680
 God wanted to use Abraham to fix, to restore what was lost in Eden.

489
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,600
 The goal was not Abraham and his family.

490
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,600
 The goal was not Canaan.

491
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,680
 But really, God placed Abraham in one land.

492
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,880
 God chose one man and his family and placed them in one particular land with that goal

493
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:39,260
 in mind, so that in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed.

494
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:44,240
 And that's why Abraham's name was chosen from the father of one nation to the father of

495
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,820
 many nations.

496
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:53,800
 From the beginning, there is this universal dimension in the calling of Abraham.

497
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,600
 We see it also in the calling of Israel.

498
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,160
 Exodus 12, 19, 5 to 6.

499
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:04,840
 When God chose Israel, he reminded her that, "You are my treasured possession among all

500
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:09,040
 peoples for all the earth is mine."

501
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,560
 Not just one piece of land.

502
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:16,680
 "All the earth is mine and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and holy nation."

503
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:22,200
 The whole idea of priests is mediators, so we always ask, "Priests among whom?"

504
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:27,760
 So Israel was clearly the mediator between God and the rest of humanity and between humanity

505
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,120
 and God.

506
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:33,920
 Again, from the beginning, there is this universal scope.

507
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:38,600
 And so the story of Israel is supposed to be a paradigm for all the nations on the earth.

508
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:44,680
 And Israel was supposed to be the means towards the restoration and redemption of the rest

509
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,640
 of God's creation.

510
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:55,320
 I believe that through Israel, God wanted to create an ideal society and model to other

511
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:59,480
 nations ideal kingdom values.

512
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:05,640
 And that's why God gave Israel the law, the Ten Commandments, the laws about the Jubilee

513
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:06,640
 I mentioned.

514
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:12,920
 Israel was supposed to be this ideal society and Israel was supposed to be the means by

515
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:18,400
 which the whole universe is redeemed.

516
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:24,960
 And again, that points us to the universal elements of the promised land, promised earth.

517
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:32,160
 And really, when we read the prophecies in particular, we see this universal and inclusive

518
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:37,840
 nature of restoration.

519
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:44,960
 One of the very clear elements in biblical prophecy is how inclusive it is and how universal

520
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,320
 it is.

521
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:55,760
 For example, Psalm 87 envisions a Zion which is multi-ethnic, where people from all nations

522
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:01,720
 are born in it and are registers in it and are citizens of Zion.

523
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:06,680
 It is the city of God and not simply a city of one nation.

524
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:12,600
 Ezekiel 47 has one of the most striking statements in the theology of the land and again, one

525
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,200
 of the most ignored statements about the theology of the land.

526
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:20,760
 When God tells Israel in the restoration, "You shall allot it as an inheritance for

527
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:27,640
 yourself about the land and for the sojourners who reside among you.

528
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:33,320
 They shall be to you as native-born children of Israel."

529
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:38,720
 This is the equality here between Israelites and non-Israelites.

530
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:42,320
 Everyone inherits in the new creation.

531
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:45,440
 Everyone inherits in the restoration.

532
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:53,880
 The same in Isaiah 56, when it speaks about the temple, that my house shall be called

533
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:58,080
 a house of prayer for all peoples.

534
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:06,760
 A scripture that Jesus quoted when he entered the temple, when he saw the separation between

535
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:12,600
 Jews and Gentiles in the temple, that angered him and argued, "My house shall be called

536
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:15,880
 a house of prayer for all peoples."

537
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:21,560
 Isaiah 49 is another example about the Messiah who is a light, not just for Israel, but a

538
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:28,280
 light for the nations, that the salvation of the servant of God might reach to the end

539
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,280
 of the earth.

540
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,660
 A very important element.

541
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:36,680
 And so in conclusion to the Old Testament part, the giving of a land as part of the

542
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:42,920
 project of redemption highlights that God is committed to his created order and to the

543
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:47,640
 redemption of human society.

544
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:54,320
 Redemption in the Old Testament is not merely about individuals, personal piety, or spiritual

545
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:57,420
 existential experiences.

546
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:03,960
 It is about redeeming whole societies on earth, and ultimately the whole of humanity.

547
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:07,040
 It is an earthly phenomenon.

548
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:14,360
 That's a very important thing that the theology of the land in the Old Testament teaches us.

549
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,960
 So you survived the first part.

550
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,880
 I hope you're still awake.

551
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:21,120
 I'm glad you're still awake.

552
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:27,640
 And I will devote the next few minutes to talking about the land in the New Testament.

553
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:33,720
 And I spent half of my book talking about the land in the New Testament.

554
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:38,800
 Very few people actually find the theme of the land in the New Testament, and I beg to

555
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:44,600
 differ and I hope I was able to show that actually Jesus and Paul spoke a lot about

556
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:45,920
 the land.

557
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:51,680
 The problem is that we miss it because we have preconceived ideas about the land as

558
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:56,160
 exclusively to one people and not as the earth to all peoples.

559
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:00,760
 And you see, once we see those themes that I establish in the Old Testament clearly,

560
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:09,280
 understand them, we see it, we see them come over and over in the New Testament.

561
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:13,960
 Yet I begin with the question and observation.

562
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:20,320
 Is the New Testament reading of the Old Testament matter?

563
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:27,160
 And I ask this because so many times I encounter Christians who read the prophecies of the

564
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:31,720
 land, read the prophecies to Israel in the Old Testament as if the New Testament was

565
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:37,160
 not written, as if the coming of Jesus did not alter things.

566
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:42,960
 I just, what I call the Jesus event, his life, death, and resurrection didn't change the

567
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,960
 course of history.

568
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:45,960
 We cannot do that.

569
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:51,600
 And I want to quote from a famous New Testament scholar, James Dunn, who says that unless

570
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:59,600
 a New Testament theology both recognizes and brings out the degree to which the New Testament

571
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:07,640
 writers saw themselves as in continuity with the revelation of the Old Testament and as

572
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:15,800
 at least in some measure continuing or completing that revelation, it can hardly provide a faithful

573
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:20,200
 presentation of what they understood themselves to be about.

574
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:26,400
 New Testament authors, when they wrote, they understood themselves as completing the revelation

575
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,400
 of the Old Testament.

576
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:33,360
 This is a very, very important observation, and I always challenge my students.

577
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:36,920
 How does the New Testament begin and why?

578
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:41,960
 Is it by coincidence or just, you know, telling us address of someone or who is he that tells

579
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:47,580
 us the, you know, the gospel of Jesus, son of David, son of Abraham?

580
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:51,240
 This is a theologically loaded statement.

581
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:57,340
 Matthew is telling us this Jesus is the seed of Abraham and the seed of David.

582
00:46:57,340 --> 00:47:02,280
 He is the continuation of the story of Israel.

583
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:07,360
 Where Israel begins, Abraham, he has two children, Isaac, Ishmael.

584
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:11,080
 Isaac is the chosen seed, the holy seed, I call it.

585
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:14,120
 Isaac had two children, Jacob, Esau.

586
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:17,200
 Jacob is the holy seed, and so on in the Old Testament.

587
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,280
 Now Matthew comes with this clear statement.

588
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:23,480
 That line now reach a pivotal point.

589
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:30,120
 Jesus, the Jew, the son of Abraham, the son of David.

590
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:34,360
 We should not miss that when we read the Old Testament.

591
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:40,440
 Jesus himself spoke about the land at least twice, more than that, in my book.

592
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:46,400
 But the most two explicit ones are in Matthew 5, 5 when he says, "The meek shall inherit

593
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:52,360
 the earth or the land," again, depending on our translation of the Greek word "ge" which

594
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:55,760
 could mean land and earth.

595
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:59,040
 And he quotes Psalm 37.

596
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:05,000
 Psalm 37 is a psalm about the land and about the qualities of those who have the right

597
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:11,380
 to inherit the land, reminding us again that you cannot take the land promises for granted.

598
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:13,520
 But you have to obey God in the covenant.

599
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:19,640
 Among these qualifications, justice, care of the poor, and here Jesus quotes the meekness

600
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:20,640
 verse.

601
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:27,480
 Let us not forget the context in which Jesus said these statements, a context that was

602
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:33,800
 politically charged, a context in which people were disputing how to redeem the land from

603
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,000
 the hands of the Romans.

604
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:42,000
 And Jesus comes with this radical idea about the kingdom of God and about the meek who

605
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,320
 inherit that kingdom.

606
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:49,920
 Yet probably one of the most important verses in the New Testament about the promises of

607
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,160
 the land is in Matthew 28, 18.

608
00:48:53,160 --> 00:49:06,560
 After Jesus is risen and after he was vindicated as the Son of God through his resurrection,

609
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:13,800
 before he ascends to heaven, he says, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been

610
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,800
 given to me."

611
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:23,920
 And I see this as a statement by Jesus, the new Israelite, the faithful Israelite saying,

612
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:30,640
 "I have received the land as my inheritance again on behalf of Israel.

613
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:37,020
 The land was restored to me as a result of my obedience on the cross and as a result

614
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:39,820
 of my resurrection."

615
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:44,440
 And it's interesting, it doesn't simply say, "Jesus, I am going to heaven to sit on the

616
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:54,160
 right hand of my Father," but he declares, "I am king today in heaven and on earth."

617
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:59,040
 The kingdom of God was established not just in heaven but also on earth.

618
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:05,320
 That is why we pray, "Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven."

619
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:09,960
 Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.

620
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:16,200
 Jesus here receives the land as his inheritance.

621
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:22,680
 Jesus talked a lot about the issue of who is the child of Abraham.

622
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:25,720
 Remember that question that I asked.

623
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:29,200
 And it seems that Jesus here enters that discussion.

624
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:34,920
 One time during his discussion with the Jewish leaders, the Pharisees, the discussion got

625
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:40,720
 heated and they answered him by saying, "Abraham is our father."

626
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:47,560
 Jesus said to them, "If you were Abraham's children, you would be doing the works Abraham

627
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:49,520
 did."

628
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:55,000
 Jesus here opens it to who could be a child of Abraham.

629
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:00,660
 If you have the faith of Abraham, you too could be a child of Abraham.

630
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:06,360
 And again we ask, being a child of Abraham, is it by ethnicity?

631
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,920
 Not to Jesus, it seems.

632
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:12,480
 Being a child of Abraham, is it about entitlement?

633
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:13,480
 Again not to Jesus.

634
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:17,480
 It's more about our accountability.

635
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:23,320
 And so the New Testament presents Jesus with this new Israelite.

636
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:30,200
 In short, the history of Israel narrows down and focuses on one person, an Israelite and

637
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:33,680
 a descendant of Abraham by the name of Jesus.

638
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:40,520
 This new Israelite reenacts the story of Israel and in his personality, in his person, he

639
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:44,760
 encapsulates what it means to be Israel.

640
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:51,040
 In addition, Jesus is also portrayed as the obedient and thus ideal Israelite, the one

641
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:55,080
 with whom God is well pleased.

642
00:51:55,080 --> 00:52:00,200
 Israel's story now narrows down and becomes Jesus' story.

643
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:05,000
 And remember, he is an Israelite.

644
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:11,040
 He earned it by his obedience and he is at the same time a child of Abraham.

645
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,560
 And it couldn't have been any other way.

646
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:17,440
 And I'm sorry to tell you, Jesus couldn't have been a Chinese.

647
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,880
 He couldn't have been born in Hong Kong.

648
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:25,120
 He had to be born as a Jew in Bethlehem to continue that story of Israel.

649
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:31,040
 That shows God's commitment to salvation through the line of Abraham.

650
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:37,000
 We should be thankful to that because through that commitment, the good news of God's reign

651
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:43,700
 on earth through his Messiah reached today to the ends of the earth.

652
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:53,680
 We move to Paul, who enters a discussion about Abraham, the land, the covenant, the inheritance.

653
00:52:53,680 --> 00:53:00,080
 And in Galatians 3.16, we have one of the most important verses about the theology of

654
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:04,240
 the land in Pauline writings.

655
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:05,720
 We all know John 3.16.

656
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:10,400
 I always say that for me personally and for many Palestinian Christians, we have Galatians

657
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,480
 3.16.

658
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,440
 You might wonder what is Galatians 3.16.

659
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:21,960
 Galatians 3.16 is the verse we have which speaks about who is the offspring of Abraham.

660
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:26,920
 And if we take that verse seriously, many answers, many questions will be answered.

661
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:34,380
 Paul declares, "Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring."

662
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:40,360
 It does not say, "and to offsprings," with a plural, of course, referring to many, but

663
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:48,460
 referring to one and to your offspring, who is Christ.

664
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:51,680
 This is a massive statement.

665
00:53:51,680 --> 00:54:01,140
 Paul here effectively affirms that Jesus is the only legitimate recipient of the Abrahamic

666
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:04,120
 promises.

667
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:10,560
 And he denies, in essence, any other claims by any people, any person or people group

668
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:14,280
 to the benefits of this covenant.

669
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:17,480
 Paul doesn't say Jesus was one of the people of God.

670
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:21,320
 Paul doesn't say Jesus was one of the offsprings in many.

671
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:24,560
 Paul actually says there are no other offsprings to Abraham.

672
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:29,800
 There is only one, and that is Jesus.

673
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:30,800
 That is Jesus.

674
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:36,880
 And as I said, the story of Abraham narrows down in Paul's thinking until it is summed

675
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:39,920
 up in one person, Jesus.

676
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:47,560
 Remember, can anybody today, based on the New Testament, okay, we're talking here in

677
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:51,280
 a Christian discussion, come and say, "I am a child of Abraham.

678
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:54,800
 I receive the promises."

679
00:54:54,800 --> 00:55:00,200
 Within a Christian discussion, according to Paul, the answer is no.

680
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:03,760
 Only Jesus has that right.

681
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:10,280
 Jesus inherits the land because he is the legitimate recipient of the Abrahamic promises

682
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:12,280
 as the son of Abraham.

683
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:15,440
 And the land that Jesus inherits is, of course, the whole earth.

684
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,400
 This was our argument.

685
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:23,160
 For Matthew claims, as we read, that Jesus has been given all authority on heaven and

686
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,160
 on earth.

687
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:30,600
 Jesus here receives all the lands of the earth as his inheritance, and this clearly echoes

688
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:34,960
 Psalm 2, 8, when we said, "Ask of me, the Messiah, and I will give you the ends of the

689
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,520
 earth as your possession."

690
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:46,320
 And so any theological claims that replace Christ's ownership to the land with Israel's

691
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:53,040
 must deal with the difficulties of defining Israel and with the New Testament claims that

692
00:55:53,040 --> 00:56:00,760
 Christ receives the Abrahamic inheritance of the land.

693
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:06,520
 Not only that, so if we argue that the story of Israel narrowed down until it reached Jesus,

694
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:16,040
 at the end of Galatians 3, those promises or that story expands again.

695
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:25,600
 But this time, clearly not based on ethnicity or biological claims, but on faith and unity

696
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,360
 in Christ.

697
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:29,040
 Unity in Christ.

698
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:36,560
 Galatians 3, 27, 29, "For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.

699
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:39,360
 There is neither Jew nor Greek.

700
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:41,800
 There is neither slave nor free.

701
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:44,360
 There is no male and female.

702
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:52,840
 For you are all one in Christ Jesus, and if you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's offspring,

703
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:56,760
 heirs according to the promise."

704
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:03,920
 Through our unity in Jesus, we become part of the Abrahamic line.

705
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:10,440
 We too are Abraham's children, you too are Abraham's children, and we are heirs according

706
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:11,440
 to the promise.

707
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:16,600
 And of course I ask here, heirs to what?

708
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:19,920
 What do we inherit?

709
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:25,000
 For of course, here we see that the people of God have been redefined.

710
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:31,520
 Membership in the people of God today is through faith in Jesus, according to Paul.

711
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:35,600
 And when we ask, when we say heirs according to the promise, heirs to what?

712
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:41,560
 Here we say that the Abraham imagery, apart from the land promise, is really an empty

713
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:42,680
 form.

714
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:45,840
 And remember what we talked about the meaning of inheritance.

715
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:51,200
 When I say heirs according to the promise, again, this is not about privilege.

716
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,840
 This is about responsibility.

717
00:57:53,840 --> 00:58:00,080
 The Abrahamic promises, that responsibility of being a blessing to the nations, a blessing

718
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:06,720
 to those who are around us, has been transferred now to those of us who believe in Jesus and

719
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:12,640
 who are united into Jesus.

720
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:19,320
 And notice how here we can clearly say, you know, Paul says there is no Greek or Gentile,

721
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:21,220
 male or female.

722
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:27,520
 And whenever I have been discussion with Messianic Jews, Christians from a Jewish believer, sometimes

723
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:33,920
 we do dialogue or debates, and I usually open to Galatians 3 and I say, according to Galatians

724
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:37,200
 3, what you inherit, I inherit.

725
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:39,520
 There is no distinction in our inheritance.

726
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:43,840
 We inherit the same thing because we both believe in the same Jesus.

727
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:51,320
 There is no separate plan for some people and a spiritual plan for some people.

728
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:54,600
 This is not the only place in which Paul emphasizes this.

729
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:58,780
 In Ephesians 2, 19, he speaks to Gentile believers.

730
00:58:58,780 --> 00:59:07,640
 Now you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints

731
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:11,760
 and members of the households of God.

732
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:17,880
 And when we are members of the household of God, all that was belonging to the original

733
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:24,200
 people of that household belongs now to us as well.

734
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:31,480
 Ephesians 3, 16, Paul says this mystery is that the Gentiles are fellow heirs.

735
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:35,640
 Fellow heirs meaning we inherit together.

736
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:39,440
 It's not like now Gentiles, you know, we come and kick out the Jews and now we take their

737
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:40,440
 place.

738
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:41,440
 It's not that.

739
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,840
 It's that now we became with them fellow heirs.

740
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:48,640
 In fact, I always say for Paul it could not have been any other way.

741
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:51,400
 The people of God had to be Jews and Gentiles together.

742
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:57,360
 That is the mystery for Paul and that is the reconciliation work of Christ.

743
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:03,640
 So we are fellow heirs, members of the same body and partakers of the promise in Christ

744
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:07,480
 Jesus through the gospel.

745
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:13,920
 Clear statement that now in Christ we become part of the story of Abraham, part of the

746
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:16,880
 story of Abraham of Israel.

747
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:23,160
 This is what 1 Peter 2, 9 clearly says and echoes when it says to the believers in Christ,

748
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:28,840
 you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood.

749
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:34,440
 Here Peter applies what was said about the people of God Israel in Exodus 19 to those

750
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:37,440
 who believe in Christ today.

751
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:46,720
 Not that we replaced biblical Israel, but it's that we are now part of biblical Israel.

752
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:49,920
 This is what Paul actually says in Romans 11.

753
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:58,460
 And I want to emphasize, you know, the olive tree example that Paul brings.

754
01:00:58,460 --> 01:01:03,500
 Notice how Paul doesn't say the tree was uprooted, nor does he say all the original branches

755
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:07,560
 were uprooted, but some of the branches were broken off.

756
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:08,560
 We need to remember that.

757
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:14,360
 And when it says some, that reminds us that the first believers in Christ were actually

758
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:17,000
 Jewish believers.

759
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:22,280
 Yes Israel in general rejected the Messiah, but not every Israelite.

760
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:28,760
 So some of the branches were broken off and you, although a wild olive shoot, were grafted

761
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:35,560
 in among the others and now together at the same tree, at the same time, share in the

762
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:37,760
 nourishing fruit of the olive tree.

763
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:43,000
 There are no two olive trees, no plant for one branch and one plant for the other branch.

764
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:48,040
 We are together in the same tree at the same time and Jesus is the center.

765
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:53,160
 I have the privilege of seeing this actually happen in history.

766
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:58,560
 You know, my mother loves farming and I've seen her bring branches from another tree

767
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:00,040
 and graft them into one tree.

768
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:02,000
 It's a beautiful thing.

769
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,840
 And after a while, after a few months, when you look at that branch, you would not be

770
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:10,040
 able to tell which one is original and which one is not.

771
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:13,240
 And that's the beauty of this paradigm.

772
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:19,080
 But I've actually seen it take place in reality through worship meetings between Palestinian

773
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:23,360
 Christians and Messianic Jews where people from two different backgrounds are at the

774
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:29,120
 same olive tree at the same time worshiping the same God.

775
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:34,120
 And as such I emphasize what Paul wanted to emphasize in Romans 11.

776
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:42,040
 We should not be arrogant towards the Jews because just as some of them have fallen because

777
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:47,900
 of unbelief, we too could fall because of our unbelief and our pride.

778
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:54,200
 And he reminds us that we did not replace Israel, we are not the origin, but rather

779
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:56,080
 we joined Israel.

780
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:57,240
 And I want to emphasize that.

781
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:59,280
 We did not replace the Jewish people.

782
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:03,680
 Rather, we joined biblical Israel.

783
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:09,960
 Or put it more, we were incorporated into biblical Israel.

784
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:15,960
 I want to quote James Dunn who says, "God has not uprooted the olive tree of Israel

785
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:18,680
 and replaced it with another.

786
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:26,040
 On the contrary, uncultivated branches of wild olives, Gentiles, have been grafted into

787
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:30,400
 the olive tree of Israel, the same original planting."

788
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:35,680
 It's not replacement, it's incorporation.

789
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:39,220
 We did not replace, we joined.

790
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:42,600
 And this is not a new thing only in the time of Christ.

791
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:46,900
 Paul says, "You should have seen this coming."

792
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:53,280
 He goes to Abraham and he reminds us that God has always been not only the God of Jews,

793
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:55,080
 he is the God of Gentiles also.

794
01:03:55,080 --> 01:04:00,600
 Yes, of Gentiles also in Romans 3, 29.

795
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:02,120
 So is this a paradigm shift in Paul?

796
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:06,040
 No, he is being faithful to his Jewish heritage.

797
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:14,520
 He went back to base his theology on Old Testament texts, especially on the person of Abraham.

798
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:19,240
 That's why for Paul, when he wanted to argue for the inclusion of Gentiles into the people

799
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:22,240
 of God, he had to go to Abraham.

800
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:27,960
 He didn't just invent this out of nothing.

801
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:33,320
 And so here we want to ask, because this is something I am always asked, so I will anticipate

802
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:38,080
 this question and try to respond.

803
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:41,200
 Does this mean that the Jews were rejected?

804
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:46,280
 Paul clearly says, emphatically says, "By no means."

805
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:50,760
 God has not rejected his people, yet we need to continue the verse.

806
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:53,440
 What does it mean that God has not rejected his people?

807
01:04:53,440 --> 01:05:01,560
 Paul says, "For I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of all of

808
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:03,140
 the tribe of Benjamin.

809
01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:06,880
 God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew."

810
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:12,920
 You see, for Paul, when he says God has not rejected his people, he says, "Look at me.

811
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:16,360
 I am a clear example that God has not rejected his people.

812
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:22,900
 I am a Jew, a son of Abraham, an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, and a tribe of Benjamin.

813
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:28,480
 When I came to faith in Christ, he did not reject me, but he accepted me."

814
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:33,280
 And so when Paul says God has not rejected his people, he doesn't mean for 2,000 years

815
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:35,560
 later he will bring them back to the land.

816
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:37,940
 That's not his point.

817
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:45,120
 His point is they are and can still be part of the people of God if they believe in Christ.

818
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:46,960
 And that's his whole point in Romans.

819
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:53,080
 It was actually a missiological point, trying to warn Gentile believers in Rome, "Don't

820
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:55,000
 be arrogant to the Jews.

821
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,720
 Be humble and witness to them.

822
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:59,320
 They have not rejected.

823
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:07,480
 If they believe in Christ, it's very natural to them to return to the original olive tree."

824
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:14,480
 The salvation of Israel for Paul, whether in Roman 11 or anywhere in his writing, is

825
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:16,640
 their faith in Jesus.

826
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:17,840
 It is not a political reality.

827
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:23,680
 It has nothing to do with restoration to the land.

828
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:29,640
 His statement, Paul's statement that all Israel will one day be saved, of course has drawn

829
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:35,360
 a lot of controversy and questions and debates and interpretations, and I can spend the next

830
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:40,880
 hour just summarizing to you all the different point views about what it means that all Israel

831
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:41,880
 shall be saved.

832
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:43,600
 I will not do that.

833
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:45,160
 Don't worry.

834
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:48,400
 But I want to emphasize this.

835
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:51,920
 What does it mean for Paul that the people of Israel shall be saved?

836
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:55,280
 What does the word "saved" mean for Paul?

837
01:06:55,280 --> 01:07:01,680
 And again, here I remind you, saved for Paul could only mean faith in Christ, not a political

838
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:02,680
 state.

839
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:08,000
 So I always say, if Paul is saying in Romans 11 that one day every single Jew will become

840
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
 a Christian, amen.

841
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,760
 All right?

842
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:15,000
 There are, of course, different interpretations.

843
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,320
 Some say only the elect among the Jewish people.

844
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:19,200
 Some say it's actually an ongoing process.

845
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,120
 It's not about the future.

846
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:24,480
 Some say all Israel is Jews and Gentiles.

847
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:29,280
 Regardless of how you interpret that, what is all Israel, or when they shall be saved,

848
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:34,320
 one thing we cannot dispute is that saved for Paul could only mean faith in Christ,

849
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:37,440
 not a political state 2,000 years later.

850
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:43,320
 And that's why I always say you cannot use Romans 11 to justify or say that the state

851
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:48,120
 of Israel is a fulfillment of prophecy.

852
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:54,040
 And so to conclude the New Testament part, what the New Testament actually claims is

853
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:56,640
 nothing but the fulfillment of the Old Testament story.

854
01:07:56,640 --> 01:08:00,840
 Jesus continues the story of Israel and brings it to realization.

855
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:03,680
 Eden is redeemed and restored.

856
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:08,440
 The earth is redeemed and restored right now through the ministry of Jesus, and as I will

857
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:12,520
 argue now, through the ministry of the church.

858
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:14,760
 Jesus didn't start something new.

859
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:17,600
 Remember, he was a Jew.

860
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,200
 And that the first believers were Jews.

861
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:23,880
 And so the church is both Jews and Gentiles together.

862
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:26,880
 And here I come back and back again to the same point.

863
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:31,040
 Has it been by DNA anyway to begin with?

864
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:35,120
 The inclusivity of Gentiles into the people of God has been anticipated.

865
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:41,080
 In fact, Paul argues this has been the goal when the calling of Abraham said, "You shall

866
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:44,440
 be a blessing to all the people."

867
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:49,320
 And now the blessing has been made to all the universe.

868
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:55,040
 And that's why the land now is the whole universe.

869
01:08:55,040 --> 01:09:00,960
 I'm going to skip some slides and move because we're almost out of time.

870
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:04,680
 That's why the land has been, as I said, universalized.

871
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:05,680
 How much time we have?

872
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:06,680
 Okay, that's good.

873
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:10,040
 I'm almost done, don't worry.

874
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:14,400
 How much, what happened to the land now?

875
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:18,880
 Remember I argued that Jesus said, "All authority has been given to me on earth and in heaven

876
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:20,360
 that the land has been universal."

877
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:22,520
 All the lands of the earth has been given.

878
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:25,160
 And I mentioned in the Old Testament part the promises to Abraham.

879
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:27,560
 This is the verse I talked about.

880
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:32,720
 Paul in Romans 4.13 says, "For the promise to Abraham and his offspring that he would

881
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:38,400
 be heir of the world did not come through the law, but through the righteousness of

882
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:39,800
 faith."

883
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:45,120
 And notice how he doesn't say that he would be heir of the land or heir of Canaan.

884
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:47,880
 Rather, that he would be heir of the world.

885
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:50,920
 As I said, the Greek word is the cosmos.

886
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:59,800
 Elsewhere, in Ephesians 16, Paul applies the commandment to honor your parents so that

887
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:03,680
 you shall live long and the land that the Lord is giving you in the original context

888
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:09,280
 in Exodus becomes now so that you should live long, full stop.

889
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:14,720
 Which means it applies today in Ephesus and it applies in Hong Kong.

890
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:21,800
 What applied to the promised land in Israel's time applies today to us, people of God who

891
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:27,560
 are in covenant with God through Jesus, the Israelites.

892
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:34,640
 And so we read in Scripture that when redemption took place, after Jesus and only after Jesus

893
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:35,640
 was resurrected.

894
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:38,840
 You see, it doesn't work before restoration.

895
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:44,320
 The resurrection of Jesus is the point in which in salvation history restoration and

896
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:46,720
 redemption began.

897
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:50,760
 After that, Jesus tells the disciple, "You will receive power when the Holy Spirit has

898
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:59,680
 come upon you and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, in all Judea, Samaria, and the

899
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:01,160
 end of the earth."

900
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:03,040
 Psalm 2 is repeated again.

901
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:06,880
 In fact, that is the table of context of the book of Acts.

902
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:11,920
 It begins in Jerusalem, then moves into the ministry of the church in Judea, then Samaria,

903
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:17,660
 and concludes with Paul in Rome declaring the kingdom of God.

904
01:11:17,660 --> 01:11:24,400
 Now the kingdom of God is a universal reality, no longer confined to one particular land

905
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:27,320
 or to one particular people.

906
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:30,320
 Sisters and brothers, this is the good news of the gospel.

907
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:32,720
 This is the gospel that was accomplished by Jesus.

908
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:38,560
 This is the salvation that was accomplished by Jesus in Jerusalem and expanded to the

909
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,040
 ends of the earth.

910
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:48,240
 Jesus is king on earth today and now through the embodiment, through his people, the church.

911
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:49,640
 We declare his kingship.

912
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:50,640
 We declare his rulership.

913
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:53,640
 Actually, how is the land universalized?

914
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:58,000
 We saw it in Acts 1a, through the ministry of the church, through evangelism.

915
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:02,640
 Not through might, not through power, but through the good news of the gospel, through

916
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:09,240
 the preaching of the word, and through actions of service and love and ministry to people.

917
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:15,560
 That is how we go to new lands and declare them as belonging to King Jesus.

918
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:16,900
 This is the gospel.

919
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:19,100
 This is the theology of the land.

920
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:22,760
 This is what we should continue to preach.

921
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:27,760
 The land, I argue, has been universalized.

922
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:32,320
 I am not spiritualizing the promises, nor heavenizing them, saying we're going to heaven.

923
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:38,440
 On the contrary, I am saying that the promised land expanded from Jerusalem to the ends of

924
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:39,840
 the earth.

925
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:45,320
 And it's here that I want to bring the theology of the land as a challenge to you.

926
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:53,200
 That the land has been, we should reproduce new Israelites community in new locations.

927
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:59,680
 And so you today should become in your community of God that embody justice, embody holiness,

928
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:03,720
 embody the presence of God in your midst, in your lands.

929
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:09,240
 And this is how even Hong Kong today, the place where you worship, where you embody

930
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:15,160
 God through the presence of Jesus in your midst, could become a holy land.

931
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:21,480
 And if you live in covenant with God, obey God, that land could function as a holy land,

932
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:27,160
 as a promised land, where people encounter God in you, where people learn about justice

933
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:30,520
 through your actions and through your ministry.

934
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:34,200
 This is what I call a missional theology of the land.

935
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:37,240
 Scripture reminds us that land matters.

936
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:40,720
 Israel and her land can function as a paradigm.

937
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:49,920
 And so a missional theology of the land replicates a Christian version of Israel in you lands.

938
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:55,680
 That's why if you were wondering what is the strange title of your book, From Land to Lands,

939
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:59,880
 From Eden to the Renewed Earth, this is exactly what I mean.

940
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:05,640
 Let's take the community model of salvation, the embodiment of the presence of God model

941
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:10,680
 of salvation and replicate it in you locations.

942
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:16,080
 Community society matter, territory matter, ecological issues matter.

943
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:22,880
 For the Bible in both testaments has a vision of an inclusive and redeemed land.

944
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:27,560
 Remember where I began my presentation with the scenes in the Middle East?

945
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:33,160
 And here I want to say the Middle East has enough of exclusive ideologies.

946
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:41,800
 The last thing we need is for Christians to come with more exclusive ideologies.

947
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:47,840
 We need to emphasize a more inclusive one, an approach in which land could be shared.

948
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:52,360
 And so before I move to modern interpretation, please understand what I'm saying.

949
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:57,480
 I am not saying that I reject Israel's right to exist today or that I'm calling for Israel's

950
01:14:57,480 --> 01:15:00,280
 destruction.

951
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:05,880
 I am saying that as a Palestinian, and I should argue that all Christians, should relate to

952
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:13,720
 the state of Israel based on international law, okay, based on human rights, not based

953
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:19,960
 on their divine right or that Israel is a fulfillment of prophecy or that Israel is

954
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:25,440
 a blessing to the nations today that we should accept that as Palestinians and simply stand

955
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:27,800
 out of the land and so on.

956
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:31,340
 And because of that, we cannot be silenced over justice.

957
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:34,160
 My argument is simple.

958
01:15:34,160 --> 01:15:36,640
 Let us relate to Israel based on international law.

959
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:41,080
 People, by the way, often ask me, "What is your theology of the Jewish people?"

960
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:45,200
 If you don't believe in this or that, you know, and I simply say, it's very simple.

961
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:46,600
 Love your neighbor as yourself.

962
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:49,760
 That's my theology of the Jewish people.

963
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:53,880
 They are created in the image of God, loved by God, and so we should do the same.

964
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:59,600
 We should love them, we should serve them, and if they are unjust, we should challenge

965
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:00,600
 them.

966
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:03,000
 If they are just, we should commend them.

967
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:07,160
 That is my theology of the Jewish people and simple.

968
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:13,800
 Remember that today in Palestine, and I wish I have the time to explain what I mean by

969
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:19,880
 just, there is a lot of injustices in the land in all aspects of life.

970
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:23,960
 There is an oppressed and an occupied and an occupier.

971
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:26,240
 There is inequality.

972
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:32,080
 And let us remember that justice matters to God and that the theology of the land is about

973
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:37,160
 a community that embodies justice and calls for justice.

974
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:42,460
 We always say that if your theology is against or trumps the biblical and ethical teachings

975
01:16:42,460 --> 01:16:50,500
 of Jesus, of love, equality, and justice, then you must rethink your theology.

976
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:53,740
 If our theology discriminates, there's a problem with it.

977
01:16:53,740 --> 01:17:00,240
 If our theology is ethnically based, if our theology is tribal, there is a problem with

978
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:01,240
 it.

979
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:06,520
 Remember Deuteronomy 16, "Justice and only justice you shall follow, that you may live

980
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:09,360
 and inherit the land that the Lord your God is sharing with you."

981
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:18,640
 And so I conclude with my hope and vision that one day the two peoples will be able

982
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:25,560
 to share the land, Palestinians and Israelis, and the two peoples will have equality and

983
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:33,320
 that justice will take place, even if that is a challenging reality.

984
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:36,860
 A shared land, I argue, is not simply one option forward.

985
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:40,320
 It is the only option forward, especially, by the way, in Palestine and Israel.

986
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:42,440
 It's such a small land.

987
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:44,000
 You cannot divide it.

988
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,900
 It's impossible.

989
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:50,000
 The only way forward is for Palestinians and Israelis to live together and to cooperate.

990
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,680
 We must find ways.

991
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:55,080
 And it's here that I argue, does our theology promote that?

992
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:57,720
 Do our prayers promote that?

993
01:17:57,720 --> 01:18:04,520
 And do our action promote that concept of a shared land, a land in which all people

994
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:07,600
 are treated equally?

995
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:14,760
 I will finish my presentation with a quote from a document called Kairos, Palestine,

996
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:19,960
 written by Palestinian Christian theologians from all theological backgrounds.

997
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:25,600
 It's a beautiful quote about a vision for the land.

998
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:32,560
 In it, Palestinians say, Palestinian Christians, "Our land is God's land, as is the case

999
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:35,840
 with all countries in the world.

1000
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:42,880
 It is holy inasmuch as God is present in it, for God alone is holy and sanctifier.

1001
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:49,080
 It is the duty of those of us who live here to respect the will of God for this land.

1002
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:54,080
 It is our duty to liberate it from the evil of injustice and war.

1003
01:18:54,080 --> 01:19:00,720
 It is God's land, and therefore it must be a land of reconciliation, peace, and love.

1004
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:03,560
 This is indeed possible.

1005
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:10,440
 God has put us here as two peoples, and God gives us the capacity, if we have the will,

1006
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:18,160
 to live together and establish in it justice and peace, making it in reality God's land."

1007
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:25,360
 As Psalm 24 says, "The earth is the Lord's, and all that is in it, the world and those

1008
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:28,080
 who live in it."

1009
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:29,080
 Thank you very much for listening.

1010
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:30,080
 God bless you.
