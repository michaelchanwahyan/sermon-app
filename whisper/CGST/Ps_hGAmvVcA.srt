1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,920
 (soft piano music)

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:21,080
 - Ladies and gentlemen,

3
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,600
 Christian brothers and sisters,

4
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,040
 warmest greetings in our Lord Jesus Christ to you,

5
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,120
 no matter where you are now geographically located.

6
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,080
 Welcome to join us

7
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,240
 at our China Graduate School of Theology,

8
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,400
 Josephine So Culture and Ethics Lecture Week.

9
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,480
 My name is Simon Cheung, your host this morning.

10
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:48,240
 Let me first say a few words about this lecture series.

11
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,080
 Instituted in 1985,

12
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,160
 this biannual lecture series

13
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,120
 is for commemorating Josephine So,

14
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,000
 the pioneering Christian thinker and leader here in Hong Kong

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,640
 after her untimely death in 1982.

16
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,300
 In the past, this lecture series has covered

17
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,520
 a broad swath of topics,

18
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,600
 ranging from a contemporary reading

19
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,860
 of Augustine's "The City of God"

20
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:20,900
 to pressing cultural and ethical issues

21
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:24,920
 concerning creation care, marketplace theology,

22
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,400
 or contextualizing Christian faith

23
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,820
 in the current Chinese context.

24
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:35,960
 This year, our lecture series is set to take a look,

25
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:40,640
 and I may add, a scrutinizing and critical look

26
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,780
 into the American white evangelicalism

27
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,280
 and the crisis it faces today.

28
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:53,460
 And our distinguished speaker is Reverend Dr. Mark Levitin,

29
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:59,960
 the president of Fuller Theological Seminary in the US.

30
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:04,680
 Dr. Levitin, it's great to have you here virtually with us.

31
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,840
 Would you like to say hi to our audience here?

32
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,400
 - Thank you so much for this invitation.

33
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,660
 - Thank you, Dr. Levitin.

34
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,880
 And before we hear your first lecture today,

35
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,240
 may I first say a few words to introduce you

36
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,880
 to our general audience?

37
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:27,700
 Dr. Levitin is a prolific writer,

38
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:32,360
 and his work appears in various kinds of platforms,

39
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,080
 with the Lord Jesus Christ as a center of passion,

40
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,080
 as Dr. Levitin once expressed in an interview.

41
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,600
 His work is aimed to wake people up

42
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,400
 as to what kind of life and practice

43
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,680
 they are called into by their Savior and by the Lord.

44
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,640
 Just by reading the evocative titles of his books

45
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,080
 like "The Dangerous Act of Worship"

46
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,740
 and "The Dangerous Act of Loving Your Neighbor,"

47
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:06,880
 his readers will immediately get the feel

48
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,320
 that the complacent and insipid understanding

49
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:16,320
 of our faith falls far short of the true calling

50
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,480
 to be the followers of Jesus.

51
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:25,300
 Out of a deep conviction in the practice of genuine dialogue,

52
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:30,100
 Dr. Levitin has been hosting as the president of FOLA,

53
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,020
 a forum called Conversing,

54
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:37,180
 in which he will speak with a wide spectrum of leaders,

55
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:40,340
 I quote, "on issues at the intersection

56
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:43,500
 of theology and culture," end quote.

57
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,840
 This dialogue is meant, I quote again,

58
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,680
 "to evoke both the power of conversation

59
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,900
 and the turbulence of our times," end quote.

60
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,640
 So one of his latest additions features his interview

61
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,640
 with a Christian writer and activist

62
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,000
 who champions racial justice

63
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,040
 and seeks to expose the Christian,

64
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,560
 especially white Christians' complicity

65
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,180
 in racism in the US.

66
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,120
 Today, Dr. Levitin will begin his reflection

67
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,540
 of the issue at hand with the title,

68
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:28,540
 "The Start, the Complicity, the Tsunami, and Today,

69
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:33,980
 the Birth, Original Scene, Development, Growth,

70
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,300
 Consumption, and Betrayal

71
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,700
 of American White Evangelicalism."

72
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:45,100
 Without further ado, let's welcome Dr. Levitin.

73
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:49,180
 - Thank you very, very much.

74
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,240
 It's a great joy and privilege to be here.

75
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,300
 Presently distinguished faculty, students, and guests,

76
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,540
 it's a great honor for me to be participating

77
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,780
 in these lectures in 2021.

78
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:08,440
 We had, of course, all hoped that the lectures

79
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,980
 would be delivered in person,

80
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,540
 but 2020 and the COVID pandemic

81
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,580
 regrettably made that impossible.

82
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:21,260
 I hope that the Canadian philosopher, Marshall McLuhan,

83
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:25,780
 is wrong, that this medium will not be the message,

84
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,460
 and that you will remember far more

85
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,900
 about what I'm trying to say

86
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,580
 than the medium by which I will be saying it.

87
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:36,560
 I bring all of you very warm greetings

88
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,700
 from Fuller Theological Seminary,

89
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:43,700
 especially from our board of trustees and faculty,

90
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:47,860
 and pray for you, for the church,

91
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,440
 and for the world of which we are a part

92
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,100
 and for which we serve as we do.

93
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:59,620
 Before formally starting, let's let first things be first.

94
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:05,340
 In Romans 8, the Apostle Paul traces

95
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:10,340
 the pervasive, unfinished, and agonizing groans of God,

96
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,820
 the church, and creation itself.

97
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:17,020
 In these lectures, there will be cause for joy,

98
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:21,240
 but there will also be evidences of groaning,

99
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,380
 reasons for arguing, causes for crying,

100
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,180
 repenting, and lamenting.

101
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:32,500
 Yet in the face of all that is wrong and incomplete,

102
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,160
 let us first hear the Apostle Paul's words

103
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,420
 toward the end of that well-known chapter.

104
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:45,180
 He writes, "What then are we to say to these things?

105
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:49,220
 "If God is for us, who can be against us?

106
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,020
 "He who did not spare his own son,

107
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,180
 "but gave him up for us all,

108
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,560
 "how will he not also with him

109
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,980
 "graciously give us all things?

110
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,280
 "In all these things, we are more than conquerors

111
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,800
 "through him who loved us.

112
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,980
 "For I am sure that neither death, nor life,

113
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,780
 "nor angels, nor rulers,

114
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,560
 "nor things present, nor things to come,

115
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,080
 "nor power, nor height, nor depth,

116
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,040
 "nor anything else in all creation

117
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,400
 "will be able to separate us

118
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,380
 "from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord."

119
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:31,260
 I offer these lectures as those with hope,

120
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:34,500
 a hope that is gratefully far beyond ourselves

121
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,220
 for these days.

122
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,740
 In the name of the Father, and the Son,

123
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,860
 and the Holy Spirit, amen.

124
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,420
 Shall we pray together?

125
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:48,300
 Oh God, how thankful we are for the privilege and gift

126
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,980
 of gathering in this way.

127
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:55,380
 We are in places throughout parts of Asia,

128
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,860
 and perhaps around the world,

129
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,420
 aware of your presence and faithfulness,

130
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:04,540
 which is our only hope, the only hope of the church,

131
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,980
 and the only and final hope of the world.

132
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:10,500
 May our days together this week

133
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,060
 be ones that you will bless,

134
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,940
 that our conversation and my reflections

135
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,900
 will combine in useful ways,

136
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,500
 that our understanding of your will

137
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,260
 and the future of our nation

138
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:27,500
 and the future to which you call us

139
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,200
 will be clearer and that our faithfulness will grow.

140
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:36,340
 We ask it to your glory in the name of Jesus, amen.

141
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:44,060
 To speak about the crisis of American white evangelicalism

142
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:48,100
 is to speak about a crisis within just part

143
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,300
 of the body of Christ and its mission in the world.

144
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:56,020
 As I hope and know you will see,

145
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,940
 I have no difficulty trying to honestly describe

146
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:02,100
 my understanding of the situation,

147
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,500
 but in doing so, I want to remind myself and you

148
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,180
 that I am after all talking about part

149
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,660
 of our Lord's beloved bride.

150
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:16,500
 The journey of God with God's people from Abraham to today

151
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,300
 has been endlessly fraught with crises,

152
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:24,060
 and still our ever loving and persisting good shepherd

153
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,820
 does not let us go.

154
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:29,780
 I believe in the legitimacy and in fact,

155
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:33,220
 the necessity of self critique,

156
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:36,980
 while conscious that that can easily and glibly fall prey

157
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,180
 to its own arrogance and presumption.

158
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:44,420
 So I want genuinely to repent even in advance

159
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,100
 and commit to you that I will try to be both candid

160
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,340
 and loving, honest and fair.

161
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:55,020
 The topic is large enough and complex enough

162
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:58,620
 to necessarily state that I'm not addressing

163
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,460
 all dimensions of evangelicalism of course,

164
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,460
 and certainly not addressing the related

165
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:06,580
 but very different realities of global evangelicalism.

166
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:10,340
 Nor would I pretend to adequately trace therefore

167
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:14,540
 the impact and importance of American white evangelicalism

168
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:17,460
 on the China Graduate School of Theology

169
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,860
 or the Chinese church.

170
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,140
 Instead, I will offer you my thoughts

171
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,100
 about American white evangelicalism

172
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,860
 and ask during our question and answer sessions

173
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:32,180
 for your partnership as brothers and sisters in Christ,

174
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,580
 with whom the scriptures call us to both rejoice

175
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:37,740
 with those who rejoice and weep with those who weep.

176
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:43,700
 Your reflections, critiques and perhaps even weeping

177
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,420
 are truly valuable to me.

178
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,260
 And I look forward to hearing your voices

179
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,020
 and perspectives as well.

180
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:52,660
 We are in one communion in Christ.

181
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:56,940
 Presently encouraged me to deliver lectures

182
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,780
 in a way that would include my own personal experience

183
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:02,980
 and not only to offer them through the lens

184
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:07,420
 of a merely academic set of categories or ideas.

185
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:11,340
 I was grateful for this and pleased

186
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,020
 since it allows me to do in public

187
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,740
 what we all know to be true in private,

188
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:18,580
 namely that almost all scholarship

189
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:21,940
 is also narrative or narratival.

190
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,820
 That is our commitments and interests

191
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,100
 are inevitably oriented by

192
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,380
 and reflective of our own stories.

193
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,620
 A few examples.

194
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:34,380
 I point to Dr. Francis Collins,

195
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,620
 the director in the United States

196
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:40,540
 of the National Institutes of Health in Washington, DC

197
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:43,220
 and the leader of the Human Genome Project,

198
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:48,220
 which worked out the first complete sequencing of human DNA

199
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:52,740
 forever changing the way human biological science

200
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:57,100
 would proceed and affecting the lives of people everywhere.

201
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:02,060
 It was he who said that the underlying conviction

202
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:05,580
 of God's creative and recreative love

203
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:09,060
 and salvation in Jesus Christ is the daily rock

204
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,540
 on which he seeks to do the very best science

205
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:14,260
 and public health that he can provide.

206
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:19,020
 Dr. Collins can distinguish science from faith,

207
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:22,380
 but his commitment to science and to the evangel

208
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:27,260
 are together part and parcel of one life and one project.

209
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:30,220
 Dr. Martin Luther King,

210
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,660
 the great American civil rights leader

211
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,500
 was not incidentally black.

212
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,700
 It was his blackness that informed his experience

213
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:42,140
 and his theology and also motivated his rhetoric

214
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,340
 and his analysis of the past and present.

215
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:49,300
 His personal story made him more capable, not less,

216
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,020
 of perceiving reality clearly

217
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,300
 in his study of American racial history.

218
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,780
 His embeddedness in his story

219
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:00,220
 and in the larger black narrative in the United States,

220
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,780
 including his demonstrations

221
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:05,260
 in some of the great marches and movements of the '60s

222
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,580
 gave him clearer vision, not less,

223
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,900
 that in a multiracial nation,

224
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:13,420
 race is never a neutral factor.

225
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:16,060
 Any claim of neutrality about race in America

226
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:20,020
 is a warning sign that misunderstanding is already at hand.

227
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:27,660
 Jesus was not incidentally a first century Jewish man.

228
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,700
 The very character of his divine revelation

229
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:33,420
 and of the love and healing, teaching and sacrifice,

230
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:37,060
 death and resurrection are simultaneously objective

231
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:42,060
 and subjective realities for him and for us.

232
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:45,660
 This is what we affirm about the incarnation,

233
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,420
 the universal particularity of God.

234
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:52,300
 Postmodernism has succeeded in driving us

235
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:56,100
 to face the inescapable particularity of life.

236
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,020
 In the case of Christian faith,

237
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:03,700
 the particular, however, is the lens by which we can see,

238
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:07,900
 know and encounter the God of the universe.

239
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,660
 This is what we hold together.

240
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:16,420
 Just a moment.

241
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:32,300
 Excuse me.

242
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:35,420
 (pages rustling)

243
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:42,300
 All of this is to say that when President Lee

244
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,180
 invited me to speak personally

245
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:48,140
 on the subject of American white evangelicalism,

246
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:51,820
 he was allowing me to express in public

247
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:56,820
 what otherwise is privately and inescapably present.

248
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:00,700
 I'm being allowed through his invitation

249
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:05,540
 to pixelate the story with an acknowledgement

250
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:08,980
 of the ways my own experience has ordered the arrangement

251
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,940
 and colors and shades of my telling

252
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,900
 of the American evangelical story.

253
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:18,340
 On a personal level, I come to you to this topic

254
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:21,100
 first and foremost, simply as a brother in Christ,

255
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:25,620
 seeking as you do to hear and respond

256
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,540
 to what the Holy Spirit may want to say to us

257
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,020
 in these sessions together.

258
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,660
 The primary context out of which I speak

259
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:38,340
 is what we hold in common, our life in Christ.

260
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:41,700
 This defining context of God's loving redemption

261
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:46,700
 holds any and all details about me, my gifts and weaknesses,

262
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:51,740
 my sins and sorrows, my hopes and longings,

263
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:56,700
 my social location, my birth and my new social location

264
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,940
 as part of God's one new humanity.

265
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:02,660
 The same of course is true for you.

266
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:06,060
 We find our life's principal location together

267
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:11,060
 in this one new communion, made possible and active

268
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:14,340
 as we are held in the love of the Father, Son and Spirit.

269
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:18,940
 In this common life, we also bring

270
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:21,540
 our distinct similarities and differences.

271
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:25,420
 I am a tall, white, educated American

272
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,820
 born and raised on the West Coast of the United States.

273
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,740
 And I am 67 years old.

274
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:34,420
 I've been married for nearly 37 years.

275
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:37,940
 And my wife and I have two adult sons.

276
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:41,980
 My family of origin had a low or moderate income

277
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:44,780
 and lived in an agricultural community

278
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:48,540
 adjacent to a nearby Native American community

279
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:52,540
 and in a place known as the Yakama Nation,

280
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:55,700
 a designation of a Native American tribe,

281
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,220
 namely the Yakama Nation.

282
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:01,140
 And in a community served by itinerant farm workers

283
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:04,140
 who traveled each season to labor

284
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,220
 in the agricultural harvest around us.

285
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:12,140
 My life as a white American was not their life.

286
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:15,420
 We lived in proximate, parallel,

287
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,220
 but utterly different worlds.

288
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:20,540
 I grew up in a tight knit family

289
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:24,180
 in which my father saw religion and religious devotion

290
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,460
 as one of the most dangerous influences

291
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:29,300
 in the world, one that he wanted his two sons

292
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,740
 to avoid if at all possible.

293
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:36,740
 So my Christian journey began as I started college

294
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:40,060
 where I became a Christian through reading the gospels.

295
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:43,980
 I simply had an intellectual and social curiosity

296
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:47,140
 about the Bible and felt that since I was on the road

297
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:50,380
 to becoming, I hoped, an educated person,

298
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,180
 I should read the Bible.

299
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,220
 And I began with the Gospel of Matthew.

300
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,100
 My father had committed to do all he could

301
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,780
 to keep his two sons from religion

302
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,900
 and especially from religious devotion.

303
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:06,020
 His argument from history and experience

304
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,900
 was that religious people,

305
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,980
 particularly Christian people in his assessment,

306
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,860
 by the influence of their faith,

307
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:16,300
 take great things, the universe,

308
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,660
 the mystery of being human,

309
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,380
 and turn them into something that's actually very small.

310
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:24,020
 My father is a Christian.

311
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:27,780
 My father illustrated this through the history of science

312
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:30,660
 and Christianity, but also through social

313
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,140
 and political history,

314
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,340
 as well as moral philosophy and practice.

315
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:38,620
 To my great shock, what I discovered

316
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,220
 in the New Testament was first

317
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:44,540
 that Jesus shared this same concern as my father.

318
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:48,540
 Many of his expressions address that very concern.

319
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:52,380
 And yet Jesus' antidote to small-making

320
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,620
 is what he announced and displayed

321
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,700
 to be the kingdom of God,

322
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:03,620
 the reality that cracks the whole universe wide open.

323
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:07,700
 This was the gift that I was being offered

324
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,580
 through the New Testament,

325
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,180
 the gift that shocked me

326
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:14,380
 and ultimately has come to change my whole life.

327
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:17,980
 My life as a disciple to this day

328
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:21,260
 has been constantly shaped by the dialogue

329
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,780
 between my father's anxiety about Christian faith,

330
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,580
 which I believe was accurate and fair,

331
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:32,660
 and how it has been constructively shaped now

332
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,820
 by the dialogue between that anxiety

333
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,660
 and the comprehensive and personal character

334
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:42,660
 of God's loving reign in Jesus Christ by the Holy Spirit

335
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:48,180
 through one new humanity that we call the church

336
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,700
 for the sake of the whole created order.

337
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:55,060
 The first Christians I came to know were and are

338
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:58,660
 some of the most positive spiritual influences in my life.

339
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:02,700
 They referred to themselves as evangelical

340
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:07,740
 and the rest is, well, history.

341
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:11,100
 I stepped into a biblical story I had not known

342
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:15,420
 and into a community that became home to me.

343
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:19,660
 My spiritual life and journey has been full of God

344
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:23,220
 and full of a ministry of resisting smallness.

345
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:28,620
 Let's go back to the beginning

346
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,820
 and all of these sections of this lecture

347
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:33,540
 will be very, very introductory.

348
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:36,260
 And I apologize if they seem repetitive

349
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,780
 to what you may already know.

350
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:42,020
 By the 17th and 18th centuries,

351
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:45,020
 the so-called birth of America was already by that time

352
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,980
 long since underway.

353
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:50,380
 Only in the last quarter of the 18th century

354
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:54,180
 would it become a formally united project.

355
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,740
 But for two centuries before that,

356
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:01,020
 Europeans and European colonies had established

357
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,940
 what became the United States.

358
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:07,260
 Evangelicalism was a spiritual

359
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:10,140
 and theological renewal movement.

360
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,940
 Some would say one that emerged

361
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:15,340
 from the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century.

362
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:19,380
 Evangelicalism was both a spiritual movement

363
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:22,060
 and a way of conceiving of the Christian life.

364
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:26,340
 It was by no means then a party,

365
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:29,420
 let alone an organization or an institution.

366
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:33,380
 It was instead a fresh experience or movement

367
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:37,940
 of the Holy Spirit that cut across denominational lines,

368
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:41,340
 that spoke out into town squares,

369
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,420
 that brought influence,

370
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:48,380
 and uncontrolled by formal Christian structures or histories

371
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,820
 while declaring and nurturing people

372
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:54,220
 in what they saw as the first order matters of faith.

373
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:59,500
 By the last quarter of the 17th century,

374
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:05,460
 the 18th century,

375
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,260
 when the Declaration of Independence

376
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,940
 and the War of Independence occurred,

377
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:14,140
 the colonies were clearly hungry for change,

378
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:17,100
 expansion, freedom, and hope.

379
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:20,140
 This, along with various Christian awakenings in Europe

380
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:24,740
 and in America in the 1730s and the 1740s

381
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:28,340
 by groups such as Anglicans and Methodists,

382
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,540
 Reformed and Puritan,

383
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:33,820
 meant that institutional religious teaching and authority

384
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:36,980
 were being modified and challenged in various ways.

385
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,660
 Together, it created a readiness

386
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:41,020
 for a kind of spiritual awakening

387
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,620
 that was motivated by a readiness

388
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:45,140
 to receive the spiritual identity and life

389
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:48,540
 that could freshly ground them in this new context,

390
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,020
 in this new land.

391
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,780
 The great awakenings in Europe came to

392
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:55,300
 and triumphed in American soil.

393
00:22:55,300 --> 00:23:00,260
 In retrospect, a British historian, David Bebbington,

394
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,580
 in his defining work in 1989,

395
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:05,620
 entitled "Evangelicalism in Modern Britain,

396
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:09,980
 "A History of the 1730s to the 1980s,"

397
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:12,020
 set forth that evangelicalism

398
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:15,300
 was centered on a quadrilateral set of traits,

399
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:18,220
 that it was Bible-centered,

400
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,980
 that it was cross-centered,

401
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,820
 that it was conversion-expecting,

402
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,940
 and that it was activist-oriented.

403
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:33,260
 This movement unfolded with undulations

404
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:35,220
 that responded to external changes,

405
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:38,620
 to the presence and practice of slavery, for example,

406
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:41,780
 to the critical study of the scriptures,

407
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:46,780
 to the anxieties spawned during the Enlightenment by science,

408
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:50,260
 to the realities of world wars,

409
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,940
 to the impact of pandemics,

410
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:56,620
 to the growing impact of higher education.

411
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:59,180
 It claimed a spiritual, theological,

412
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:02,340
 and experiential legitimacy

413
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,900
 more than an intellectual, denominational,

414
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,500
 or formal identity.

415
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,060
 It was a movement

416
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:11,220
 more than it was an institution or an organization.

417
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:15,500
 And therefore, it was adaptable to the East Coast,

418
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,940
 but it was highly flexible enough

419
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:21,140
 as the westward expansion in the United States occurred.

420
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:24,260
 In the 1920s,

421
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,900
 the fundamentalist modernist controversy

422
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,260
 drew and debated lines

423
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,540
 that were the fruit of this long history

424
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:34,540
 that had already been developed over that period of time.

425
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:37,140
 By the middle of the 20th century,

426
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,940
 when Fuller Theological Seminary

427
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,700
 and many other evangelical organizations

428
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,060
 and institutions were founded,

429
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,380
 evangelicalism had become a word

430
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:50,780
 that could serve as a pathway between two extremes.

431
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,140
 In the case of Fuller Theological Seminary,

432
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:56,140
 it was a way between fundamentalism

433
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:58,820
 and a wooden understanding of the Bible

434
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:01,140
 and its interpretation.

435
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,340
 And modernism,

436
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:07,620
 namely, potentially at least an adaptation,

437
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:10,980
 if not an abandonment of orthodoxy at times

438
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,380
 for the sake of being quote, "modern."

439
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:18,020
 Evangelicalism, as Fuller saw it,

440
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:21,020
 was an embrace of Christian orthodoxy

441
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:26,020
 that was open to more critical study of the scriptures

442
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:31,260
 and more open to engagement with realities around us

443
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:34,220
 in context and in culture

444
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:36,620
 than was typically true of fundamentalists

445
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:40,780
 or wholeheartedly true of modernists.

446
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:44,540
 So evangelicalism quietly and broadly

447
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:48,420
 remained in this position until the late 1970s,

448
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:51,860
 to which we will comment to the 2000s,

449
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,980
 including the last four years

450
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:56,900
 in the national and political life of the United States.

451
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:00,500
 Please note, again, several things.

452
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:04,340
 The lack of institutional or organizational center,

453
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:08,780
 the lack of a defining or controlling role

454
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:13,780
 or set of voices for what was in fact

455
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:18,820
 a diffuse and multiply defined and growing movement.

456
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:23,540
 The claim to knowledge that can and must define

457
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:28,540
 what is true and good was clarified by evangelicalism,

458
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:33,380
 but not with the emphatic certainty of fundamentalism.

459
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:36,380
 It had an orientation towards who is in

460
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:39,220
 and who is out in fundamentalism,

461
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:42,100
 whereas in growing evangelicalism,

462
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,420
 it was a sense that it was the center that was primary

463
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,060
 and not the boundaries.

464
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,940
 We'll return to this as well.

465
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,700
 We turn next to the complicity.

466
00:26:54,700 --> 00:27:00,180
 Here is complicity in a number of social realities,

467
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:03,380
 which create a major problem for evangelicalism in America.

468
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:08,620
 From the earliest days in North America,

469
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:11,300
 Native American tribes were being displaced

470
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,420
 by formal and informal versions

471
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,900
 of the so-called doctrine of discovery,

472
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,500
 in which lands and peoples could be claimed

473
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,260
 under the authority of various European countries.

474
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:26,780
 The majority of this was theologically justified

475
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:29,180
 as part of a sense of the mission of God

476
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,620
 that reigned over all.

477
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:35,340
 The presumption was that this was legitimate legally,

478
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,460
 that it was morally right,

479
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,780
 that it was socially beneficial,

480
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:43,380
 and that it was most importantly, spiritually redemptive

481
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:46,780
 for those whose lives were now held inside

482
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:50,580
 and under Christian and European authority.

483
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:55,020
 The Christian church was manifest in a European defined

484
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,860
 and embodied set of terms.

485
00:27:56,860 --> 00:28:00,060
 This meant that there were Roman Catholics

486
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,180
 and various Protestant churches as well,

487
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,060
 Anglican and Puritan in particular,

488
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:07,620
 that were involved in these matters.

489
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:11,780
 The church in America imitated the church in Europe,

490
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,700
 while it also opened the way for many

491
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:16,460
 who were defining religious persecution in Europe

492
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:19,820
 to be a motivation for immigrants to the colonies.

493
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,900
 Regional plots along the East Coast

494
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,180
 tagged with different primary European

495
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,660
 and Christian identities.

496
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:28,300
 From this intertwined connection

497
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:32,380
 between the doctrine of discovery and Native Americans,

498
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:36,620
 that is the readiness to dominate Native peoples,

499
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:39,500
 there developed an abominable extension.

500
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,500
 An intertwined connection between white Christians

501
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:46,460
 and African slavery was early and well-established

502
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,300
 in the United States.

503
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:53,300
 The doctrine of discovery established by the Pope in 1493

504
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:56,700
 created the legal, political and religious claim

505
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,940
 of land and people that were not Christian.

506
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:02,820
 This plain and historic doctrine

507
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:06,620
 became the driving theological and missiological force

508
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:10,580
 underpinning colonialism and its mutating motives

509
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,700
 and expressions to this very day.

510
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:15,540
 What was fundamentally a political

511
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:19,060
 and economic vision initially was justified

512
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:24,060
 and defended even more passionately as a theological one,

513
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:29,300
 trumping and masking the political and economic benefits.

514
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:33,820
 The doctrine of discovery provided the theological cover

515
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:38,060
 and the unlimited possibilities for economic expansion

516
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,260
 that were simply too much to resist.

517
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:44,820
 Colonialist condescension and rationalization

518
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:47,700
 looked away from and denied the horror

519
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,980
 of the transatlantic slave trade

520
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:53,420
 and the practice that denigrated and dehumanized

521
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:57,300
 African men, women and children by the millions,

522
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:00,620
 all to satisfy the greed of colonial

523
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:05,260
 and post-colonial families in the name of the gospel.

524
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:08,740
 The unpaid labor of black Africans

525
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:13,100
 was the workforce that built America.

526
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:16,460
 Christians saw the expansion of agricultural

527
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:20,380
 and manufacturing capacity as it was neutrally called

528
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,140
 as the blessing of God.

529
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:27,060
 There are reports, as you probably know, in West Africa

530
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:30,060
 where kidnapped Africans were imprisoned

531
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:33,060
 after being taken in horrific conditions,

532
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:35,900
 before rather being taken in horrific conditions

533
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:39,020
 across the Atlantic Ocean, the Middle Passage,

534
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:42,860
 for sale in the Caribbean and in the colonies.

535
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:46,740
 In those ports, Christian worship happened

536
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,820
 to ask for God's blessing

537
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,620
 in the so-called Middle Passageway.

538
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:54,900
 One such chapel in Ghana, for example,

539
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,740
 was built across the bridge,

540
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:02,060
 upon which manacled slaves would later walk

541
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:05,340
 to the place where they would be tied and bound

542
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,820
 for the cross-Atlantic trip.

543
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:10,980
 In the chapel, above this gangplank,

544
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:13,620
 taking slaves on board the ship,

545
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:17,100
 would be the captors, the slave masters,

546
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,780
 the ship's captains and crew,

547
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:23,380
 singing hymns still familiar today.

548
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:26,900
 They would read the scriptures.

549
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:30,020
 They would pray for safety for all the crew

550
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,900
 and for the trip to be successful

551
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:35,700
 in the eventual sale of fellow human beings.

552
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:39,220
 For the servitude that would define them

553
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:41,140
 for the rest of their lives

554
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:44,300
 and the lives of generations and generations

555
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:47,420
 of slaves and slave families to come.

556
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:51,820
 All this being done in the name of Jesus Christ,

557
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:56,100
 as they would say, the Lord and Savior of the world.

558
00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:00,740
 Among the perpetrators on both sides of the Atlantic

559
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:04,260
 were American white evangelicals.

560
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,700
 The convergence of the psychological

561
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,220
 and spiritual readiness of colonials

562
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,700
 in relation to this narrative

563
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:16,620
 of America's original sin is hard to trace.

564
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:19,340
 The ability to claim to love God

565
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:22,020
 while so obviously hating their neighbors

566
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:27,420
 was of course not invented in the Atlantic slave trade,

567
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:31,460
 but it was destructively and politically practiced

568
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:33,620
 for over 250 years.

569
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:37,500
 This practice involved the death of 2 million lives

570
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,580
 in the Atlantic crossing,

571
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:43,820
 the deaths of millions en route to their plantations

572
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:47,260
 and the sale of 12 to 14 million human lives.

573
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:51,100
 These are the ones who carried out the nation building

574
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,900
 that was the growing, emerging, uniting

575
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:57,380
 and Christian reality that became the United States.

576
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:01,220
 In the constitution of the United States,

577
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:06,220
 the phrase, we the people meant white land owning men.

578
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:12,540
 We the people are the people that are referred to

579
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:16,180
 in our constitution, not the slaves.

580
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:20,740
 African slaves were in fact classed by our constitution

581
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,500
 as three fifths human.

582
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:26,940
 All this brought the United States to war

583
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,100
 in the mid 19th century

584
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:32,540
 and the death of more than 650,000 lives

585
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,780
 during that civil war period.

586
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:38,740
 The war divided families and friends

587
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:41,980
 and congregations and denominations

588
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:45,860
 and continues to this very week to define

589
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,140
 and explain the American church

590
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,820
 and political rallies realities.

591
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:54,100
 The interwovenness for many evangelicals of faith

592
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,940
 and slavery now seems like an unbelievable aberration

593
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:01,060
 and yet it reveals the ways that culture

594
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:05,860
 and economics speak more loudly than our theology and faith

595
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:08,700
 and that we are more capable than we might imagine

596
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:13,700
 of wrapping desire with faith and calling it God's gift.

597
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:16,900
 The economic labor engine that built the United States

598
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:21,900
 was unpaid labor, unpaid labor for 250 years of slavery.

599
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:28,340
 It was claimed to be God's blessing for the owner

600
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:32,300
 and God's blessing for the uncivilized slave and family

601
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,300
 who because of having been taken captive

602
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:38,900
 and now "employed" as a slave,

603
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:41,060
 giving them the opportunity and privilege

604
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:44,420
 to live in a "Christian nation."

605
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:48,180
 The cruelty and sin that was right in front of them

606
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,860
 was apparently invisible.

607
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:56,100
 In other words, many, by no means all, white evangelicals

608
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:59,620
 were seamlessly in the church community

609
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:03,580
 and fully complicit in 250 years of slavery

610
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:07,220
 followed by 100 more years of extended slavery

611
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:09,700
 and depression into the assumptions of culture,

612
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:12,820
 economics, and evangelical faith.

613
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,140
 Debates continue to this day

614
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:19,140
 about the cause of the American Civil War from 1861 to '65.

615
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:22,020
 As a central matter, the main point of concern

616
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,300
 was however slavery.

617
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:27,980
 In Romans 1, Paul talks about our human capacity

618
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:32,580
 to hold down or to suppress the truth in unrighteousness.

619
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,980
 We do this in our own lives

620
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:37,620
 and the culture of Christian churches and congregations

621
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:42,380
 and institutions reflects this in various ways.

622
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:45,300
 But for a very large and focal part

623
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,420
 of white evangelical church in America,

624
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:52,420
 this habit became deep, multi-generationally ingrained

625
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:56,380
 and the white evangelical movement has at times challenged

626
00:35:56,380 --> 00:36:00,100
 and at some times completely conceded

627
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:03,940
 to this kind of vision.

628
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:07,020
 There were of course in the 18th and 19th century

629
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:09,380
 white evangelical public leaders

630
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:14,380
 who spoke and acted loudly and sustainably against slavery.

631
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:18,020
 But the lowest baseline associated with

632
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:23,020
 and defended in Christian terms was the defense of slavery.

633
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:26,300
 Evangelical complicity with slavery,

634
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:29,180
 with reconstruction following the Civil War,

635
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:33,660
 with imprisoned and indentured labor, with Jim Crow,

636
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:36,700
 with bank control of real estate and money

637
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:39,460
 erupted in periodic riots and protests.

638
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:43,620
 As an example, 100 years ago this very year

639
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:48,620
 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in the heart of Southern America

640
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:53,180
 and South, Southern American white evangelicalism,

641
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:57,460
 the most thriving black community in the whole country

642
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:01,540
 was decimated and 300 black lives were slaughtered

643
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:05,100
 because a black man was alleged to try

644
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,980
 and kiss a white Christian woman.

645
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:10,740
 The most economically thriving black community

646
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:13,380
 was burned to the ground.

647
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,580
 Wiping out an entire community

648
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:17,980
 who confessed that Jesus Christ is Lord.

649
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:22,580
 Only this year will this be fully faced,

650
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:25,420
 lamented and recognized.

651
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:28,580
 In different but parallel ways,

652
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:31,860
 this black narrative is not only the Native American story,

653
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:35,780
 but also in the United States, the Latin American story

654
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:39,240
 and the Asian story as well.

655
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,980
 In all these instances and many others besides,

656
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:47,660
 many in the evangelical church confessing Christ

657
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:51,060
 were also participating supportive or passive

658
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,820
 about these abuses, cruelties and injustices.

659
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:58,780
 Being perpetrated by those our Bible calls

660
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:01,180
 are made in the image of God,

661
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:03,380
 knit together in their mother's wounds,

662
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:07,340
 fearfully and wonderfully made.

663
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:11,740
 Complicity is too mild a word.

664
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:14,420
 It showed that many evangelical Christians

665
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:18,380
 had enslaved themselves to the injustice and abuse

666
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:21,580
 of fellow human beings for centuries.

667
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:25,980
 People ask, where was the church in Nazi Germany?

668
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,900
 The answer is the same place

669
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,620
 that many white evangelical Christians in North America

670
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:35,220
 have been during the past 400 years, right here,

671
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:38,340
 right in the midst of mainstream culture.

672
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,700
 This needs to be kept in mind, I might add as a footnote

673
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,980
 in understanding the events of the United States

674
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,020
 in the last week.

675
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:50,140
 We move next to the tsunami.

676
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:52,500
 The civil rights movement in America

677
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:56,020
 was primarily led by the black church in America.

678
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:59,500
 It has evangelical theology and doctrine,

679
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,300
 but did not choose for the most part

680
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:05,020
 to identify as evangelical because they were not white.

681
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,300
 And because the white evangelical narrative

682
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:10,660
 excluded black and brown people.

683
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:13,220
 The narrative the black church knew

684
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:16,260
 was the God who knew how to set his people free.

685
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:20,460
 And that narrative led by exceptional black Christian leaders

686
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,340
 and pastors was the narrative

687
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:25,260
 to which their civil rights movement was committed.

688
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:27,580
 Enormous and positive changes occurred.

689
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:31,660
 But in symbol and in reality,

690
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,820
 the murder of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

691
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:36,860
 slowed and diverted the narrative,

692
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:40,900
 along with the sacrifice of many others as well.

693
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:44,900
 For evangelicals, King was too liberal.

694
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:49,140
 And only very gradually as the black Christian critique

695
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,980
 of the white story of America became domesticated enough

696
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:55,020
 to accept Dr. King into some white Christian

697
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,940
 evangelical narratives,

698
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:02,380
 but only some and only relatively recently.

699
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:06,660
 By the late 1960s, the election of Jimmy Carter

700
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,900
 as a quote, born again, Christian,

701
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:12,500
 evangelicalism began to quickly step into the public light

702
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,900
 in a different way than before.

703
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:18,100
 By the 1980s, we have the birth of a movement

704
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,220
 called the moral majority

705
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:21,860
 and the rise of various media ministries

706
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:24,660
 that can propagate arguments of faith

707
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,900
 in continuous feeds of ideas.

708
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:30,820
 Simultaneously cable television news channels

709
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:34,100
 are developing and growing in passive popularity.

710
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,860
 And this development mixes together

711
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:39,460
 in a thick media presence of culture and religion.

712
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:41,060
 It's all presented as real,

713
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:44,140
 but what emerges is closer to reality TV.

714
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:47,420
 That is not so much an expression of Christian faith,

715
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:50,860
 as much as a combination of entertainment and production.

716
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:54,740
 Audience ratings are the most important measure of success.

717
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:59,300
 This becomes a globally spreading reality and infection.

718
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:03,260
 The experience of popular cable religious programs,

719
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,900
 most of them fundamentalist and Pentecostal,

720
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:08,500
 hosted by many different TV evangelists,

721
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,140
 turned to the political sphere in the '80s

722
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:15,500
 and unleashed a tsunami that flooded the religious airwaves.

723
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:18,820
 This went on for some time during the '80s and early '90s

724
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:21,260
 and increasingly addressed politics,

725
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:24,980
 especially related to abortion and sexuality debates

726
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:29,060
 and claimed an enormous, both American and global audience.

727
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:33,580
 In 1996, Fox News was established by Robert Murdoch,

728
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:37,500
 Rupert Murdoch, and further amplified the voices

729
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:41,220
 of popular fundamentalist, conservative pastors,

730
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:43,940
 TV evangelists, organizations, churches,

731
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:45,700
 and political groups.

732
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,660
 Along the way, these became known

733
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:50,260
 as the evangelicals by the media.

734
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:53,780
 It was a title claimed by those that the media amplified

735
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:56,460
 and made more culturally acceptable

736
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:59,940
 than the tag that had been used as fundamentalist

737
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:03,780
 or Pentecostals, who were seen more to be

738
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,500
 at the margins of culture,

739
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:09,180
 whereas evangelicals became a more acceptable

740
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:11,220
 mainstream term.

741
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:14,460
 This was the tsunami that took over the term evangelical

742
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:17,140
 in the United States, and it remained so

743
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:20,100
 through the late '90s and certainly

744
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:23,420
 during the first two decades of the 2000s.

745
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:26,020
 This all happened as the growth of megachurches

746
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:29,820
 in the United States also expanded from a few hundred

747
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:32,540
 to thousands of such congregations.

748
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:35,620
 The pervasive lack or minimalization

749
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:39,020
 of theological education in most of these movements

750
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:40,900
 was quite appalling.

751
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:44,500
 It created a large collection of communicators

752
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:49,340
 who were not marked by careful thought or by accountability.

753
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:51,900
 It became a tribe of its own with its own regard

754
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:53,500
 and disregard for boundaries.

755
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:58,620
 Effect, popularity, emotion all dominated

756
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:02,020
 with a popular unselfcritical frame and attitude.

757
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:05,700
 Typically a single personality and voice

758
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:08,460
 dominated the message.

759
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:12,900
 But all this is too simplistic.

760
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:15,220
 Two parallel narratives or realities

761
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:16,540
 also need to be acknowledged.

762
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:20,100
 First, the media prominence of white evangelicalism

763
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:23,900
 was similar, but always distinct from the rise

764
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:26,700
 and growth and development of the black church.

765
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:29,420
 Some, if not all of the same theological markers

766
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,500
 describe the rise of the black church,

767
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,700
 but the social associations do not,

768
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:35,700
 quite the opposite in fact.

769
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:38,540
 The white evangelical church and the black church

770
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:40,300
 were distinct, separate,

771
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:42,900
 and had very different characteristics.

772
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:45,820
 The most important one might be assumed

773
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:49,060
 to be integration of faith and context of the love of God

774
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:52,100
 and the justice of God in Jesus Christ.

775
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:55,860
 And the suffering of blacks, including black Christians,

776
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:58,020
 who suffered from the brutal racism

777
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:00,500
 and the white supremacy and normativity

778
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,860
 that pervaded the American landscape.

779
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:04,660
 More on this in our next lecture.

780
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:07,260
 The second layer that needs to be acknowledged

781
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:10,860
 is a smaller reactive movement of neo-evangelicals

782
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:13,380
 who specifically and stridently rejected

783
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:15,860
 the sociology, policy, and politics

784
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:19,820
 of conservative Republican white American evangelicals.

785
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:22,020
 This cross current is essential

786
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:24,900
 to understand the state of affairs today

787
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:26,980
 in the US evangelical landscape.

788
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:31,380
 The rabid condemning response of conservative evangelicals

789
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:34,540
 to the HIV/AIDS crisis in the 80s and 90s

790
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:36,980
 added another layer of judgmentalism

791
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:39,660
 and cultural division and separation,

792
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:43,020
 all justified by quote, "The good news of the gospel."

793
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:44,180
 Unquote.

794
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:48,060
 The crisis of today has a long development that precedes it.

795
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:50,500
 So finally, today.

796
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:53,420
 Today, American white evangelicalism

797
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:57,980
 is publicly and privately in a shambles and in confusion.

798
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:01,180
 Publicly and broadly,

799
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:04,340
 the identification of evangelicalism with Trumpism

800
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:06,900
 and the loss of the 2020 election

801
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:09,100
 was a resounding repudiation

802
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:10,940
 of American white evangelicalism

803
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:13,140
 by the broad American public.

804
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:18,020
 Not least by African-Americans, but also by many whites.

805
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:20,940
 Many up to this point,

806
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:24,980
 evangelicals were silent or deflective of the racial issues

807
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:27,900
 and associated with the appointment under Trump

808
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,100
 of conservative judges at all levels

809
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:33,260
 and the dismantling of various social safeguards.

810
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:37,020
 The aggressive politics and policies of America first.

811
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:40,140
 The anti-immigration and anti-LGBT,

812
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:42,820
 anti-abortion, anti-racial justice,

813
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:44,740
 and anti-science stances

814
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:47,940
 that have all been part of the Trump administration.

815
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:52,820
 And then the post-election unwillingness since November

816
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:57,100
 to acknowledge Biden's defeat of Trump.

817
00:45:57,100 --> 00:46:00,100
 Over 73 million Americans who voted for Trump

818
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:01,900
 in this last election

819
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:06,900
 included still 80% white evangelical voters.

820
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:12,500
 The summer of 2020, before the election,

821
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,420
 will go down as one of the most prominent

822
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:17,660
 and provocative seasons of racial demonstrations

823
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:19,820
 in the United States to date.

824
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:22,260
 Triggered most directly by the murder

825
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:26,620
 and a string of murders of unarmed African-Americans,

826
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:30,060
 and especially the killing of George Floyd

827
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:31,820
 by white policemen.

828
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:35,300
 Somewhere between 15 and 25 million people

829
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:38,500
 were active in demonstrations over this past summer

830
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:41,100
 in cities and towns across the country.

831
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:44,660
 People of all races and ages and political affiliations.

832
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:47,060
 Virtually nothing was said or done

833
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:49,340
 by many that the press turned to

834
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:51,980
 and called evangelical leaders.

835
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:54,460
 The height of offense to evangelicals

836
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:55,420
 should have been taken

837
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:58,460
 when Trump aggressively dismissed protesters

838
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:00,620
 for a photo opportunity in front of a church

839
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:02,220
 in Washington, DC,

840
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:06,340
 in order to hold up there an upside down Bible.

841
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:09,060
 But instead, Trump's actions were heralded

842
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:11,900
 by prominent white evangelical voices.

843
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:15,140
 The political and public rejection of science

844
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:17,860
 in response to the coronavirus pandemic

845
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:21,260
 added a third layer to the problems of this moment.

846
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:23,580
 More fuel yet to the fire

847
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:25,420
 that put the voices of political

848
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:28,220
 and evangelical forces on the side of being,

849
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:30,060
 frankly, reality denying.

850
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:33,740
 Denial of racism and white supremacy,

851
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:37,500
 denial of the coronavirus and trust in science,

852
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:40,340
 denial of the election and its outcome,

853
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:44,780
 all has many evangelical supporters in common.

854
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:47,380
 Typically, when these denials are offered

855
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:49,620
 as an expression of Christian faith,

856
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:52,100
 then it appears to the wider American culture

857
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:55,980
 and to many Christians and non-Christians

858
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:58,100
 inside the United States,

859
00:47:58,100 --> 00:47:59,820
 that it appears that evangelicalism

860
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:03,540
 has less and less to do with ordinary reality,

861
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:06,460
 the reality that everyone else lives full time.

862
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:09,620
 The tradition that has elevated the possibilities

863
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:13,620
 of spiritual and theological knowing in Jesus Christ

864
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:17,860
 appears to have abandoned the possibility of knowledge.

865
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:21,820
 This historic theological and cultural stew

866
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:24,540
 is the crisis of American white evangelicalism.

867
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:27,740
 For me personally, it is a crushing,

868
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:30,460
 maddening and tragic story,

869
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:34,180
 but far more importantly, and I hope that I am wrong,

870
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:36,300
 this highly public narrative

871
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:40,780
 holds every sign of driving a multi-generational,

872
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:44,300
 decimating disaffection with many people,

873
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:47,500
 not least many young adults in the United States.

874
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:50,420
 For if this, this that has been demonstrated

875
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:53,340
 in the last four years and in the last months

876
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:54,820
 and in the last weeks,

877
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:58,940
 if this is the fruit of white American evangelicalism,

878
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:00,940
 how could it ever be claimed

879
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:04,180
 that its gospel could be received as good news?

880
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:08,460
 So in light of all of that, what is the hope?

881
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:13,300
 Jesus said, "I am the way, the truth and the light."

882
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:17,900
 This is the word that defines and holds all other words.

883
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:20,460
 This is the plum line, the true vine,

884
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:21,980
 the rock that is our origin,

885
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:23,820
 our redeemer and our sustainer.

886
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:27,660
 "Behold, all things are being made new,"

887
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:31,340
 the apostle says, even white evangelicalism

888
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:33,700
 that promotes that hope for others,

889
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:35,940
 that hope for others when it is a time

890
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:38,980
 when we who are white evangelicals in America

891
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:41,020
 need it more than ever.

892
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:42,580
 On many levels,

893
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:45,580
 the white American evangelical population

894
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:49,220
 does not want to live out its theological identity

895
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:51,860
 as much as it wants to justify its social

896
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:53,740
 and racial identity.

897
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:55,740
 And more on this in the next lecture.

898
00:49:55,740 --> 00:50:00,220
 There's no joy in sharing what I have said in this lecture.

899
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:02,500
 Story could be told in the positive light

900
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:05,100
 of God's true and faithful bounty.

901
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:07,500
 In truth, it is a both and story.

902
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:11,380
 God is faithful to white American evangelical church.

903
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:13,700
 The white American evangelical church

904
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:17,140
 is a deep and painful crisis.

905
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:20,020
 In this lecture, I've tried to show the scope of the problem.

906
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:23,660
 Tomorrow, I will turn to some of the more underlying reasons.

907
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:30,580
 Let me stop there and see if there's comment or questions

908
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:32,500
 as we engage together.

909
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:35,100
 - Thank you, Dr. Labbaton

910
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:40,740
 for walking us through the past three centuries,

911
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:44,860
 giving us a quick but succinct historical survey

912
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:48,820
 of how the present evangelical crisis came to be.

913
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:53,980
 So in what follows, two members of our faculty

914
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:58,220
 will give their response to Dr. Labbaton's speech.

915
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:00,180
 Before introducing them,

916
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:02,180
 I'd like to remind the audience

917
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:04,900
 that a question and answer session

918
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:09,220
 will immediately follow the responses.

919
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:13,180
 All the questions can be posted on our website

920
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:15,580
 in the live streaming page.

921
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:17,700
 And you may scroll down the webpage.

922
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:20,180
 After the live streaming in Mandarin,

923
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:22,540
 there is a Q&A session,

924
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:27,340
 and you're most welcome and strongly encouraged

925
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:31,220
 to input your questions there after inputting your name.

926
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:35,660
 Your questions or comments can be either

927
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:37,700
 in Chinese or English.

928
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:43,980
 Now, our two responses, our two response speakers today,

929
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:47,700
 they are Dr. Chen Wing-Yen,

930
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:51,580
 our visiting professor in practical studies,

931
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:55,220
 and Reverend Dr. Song Jun,

932
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:58,180
 our Philip Teng Associate Professor

933
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:00,860
 in theological studies.

934
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:02,940
 Their responses will be given

935
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:06,700
 in English and Putonghua, respectively.

936
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:09,580
 Let's welcome them with our applause.

937
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:22,940
 - Thank you, Dr. Labbaton,

938
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:24,500
 for your wonderful lecture,

939
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:27,660
 and I feel so honored to give my personal response here.

940
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:31,460
 I was drawn to the Fuller School of Theology

941
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:34,660
 long before I entered the CGST.

942
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:39,460
 I think most of the Hong Kong churches know Fuller

943
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:41,860
 not only as a seminary and a training ground

944
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:44,860
 for counselors and theologians,

945
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:49,140
 but also as the school for training intercultural workers

946
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:50,980
 and teachers in mission.

947
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:56,460
 The two CGST mission faculty members prior to me

948
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:59,700
 both got their DEMITS degrees

949
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:02,940
 from Fuller's School of World Mission,

950
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:04,620
 which has now changed her name

951
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:08,460
 to the Fuller School of Intercultural Studies.

952
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:13,180
 To me, Fuller's intercultural studies

953
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:16,100
 excel on issues like gospel and culture,

954
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:18,300
 intercultural communication,

955
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:22,020
 cultural anthropology, and so on and so forth.

956
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:24,100
 And we have all benefited

957
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:26,500
 from the easy-to-grasp concepts

958
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:29,180
 like 10/40 window,

959
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:31,740
 unreached people groups,

960
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:34,860
 people movement in church growth, et cetera,

961
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:37,300
 developed by the Fuller faculty.

962
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:40,420
 We are also on the receiving end

963
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:42,860
 from a lot of American missionaries

964
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:44,860
 coming to this part of the world.

965
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:48,460
 Personally, I had great friends

966
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:51,860
 among the American Southern Baptist missionaries

967
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:54,940
 when my family was in Sri Lanka three decades ago.

968
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:59,540
 I had very mixed feeling experience with them

969
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:02,500
 who worked closely with me in that country.

970
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:05,180
 We were great friends,

971
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:10,180
 so much so that we had asked an elderly couple

972
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:13,820
 to be the godparents of our infant son.

973
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:19,780
 But at the same time, we avoided too close a connection

974
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:23,420
 because of the way they carry themselves.

975
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:27,460
 Coming in with obvious financial power and human resources,

976
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:31,980
 locals commented that they lived like kings.

977
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:37,220
 Another difficulty between us was our differences

978
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:39,900
 in seeing the meaning of the gospel

979
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:42,260
 in a world war-torn land.

980
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:46,100
 To our American colleagues,

981
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:49,420
 their job was to get the message of the gospel across

982
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:52,780
 without ever touching on the problems

983
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:57,780
 of inequity and injustice that were rampant in the country.

984
00:54:57,780 --> 00:55:03,060
 A lot of their mission theories and conceptual framework

985
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:06,380
 were generated from social sciences,

986
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:07,820
 which were excellent tools

987
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:10,660
 for reaching people outside the church.

988
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:15,380
 But unfortunately, such techniques did not touch

989
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:19,340
 on the socioeconomic political aspects of the gospel.

990
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:24,100
 And the good news of God's mercy and justice

991
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:26,780
 to a broken world has been missed out.

992
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:32,820
 What is the gospel to a world plagued by systemic oppression

993
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:36,860
 against the minority and the disadvantaged,

994
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:41,260
 especially when privileged middle-class Christians

995
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:45,660
 were being implicated as part of the unjust process?

996
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:52,100
 After reading Dr. Levitin's lecture script,

997
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:55,820
 I could suddenly solve the puzzle I have

998
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:59,140
 regarding the focal areas of American missiology.

999
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:04,980
 Now I understand why the packaged Kairos Mission Course

1000
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:06,700
 did not mention the special needs

1001
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:09,340
 of the poor and the marginalized,

1002
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:13,780
 and why in another classic package called Perspectives,

1003
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:18,780
 out of 169 articles, only six, that is 3.5%,

1004
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:25,100
 directly talk about the issues of poverty and social ills.

1005
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:29,900
 Now I understand why there's no mentioning of liberation,

1006
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:34,660
 of ethnic equality, and of suffering and persecution,

1007
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:36,980
 because the majority of authors belong

1008
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:39,740
 to a majority of white evangelicals

1009
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:42,780
 that have actually turned a blind eye on these issues

1010
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:44,180
 on their own doorsteps.

1011
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:48,500
 Then the problem is getting serious

1012
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:52,660
 because we have imported the whole paradigm

1013
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:56,620
 and repeated the same patterns of missionary engagement

1014
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:59,780
 in our Hong Kong and Mainland churches.

1015
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:06,340
 These days, we talk a lot about the Silk Road initiatives

1016
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:08,300
 that have enabled Chinese missionaries

1017
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:12,220
 to venture far beyond the country border,

1018
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:14,060
 going to countries that badly need

1019
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:16,580
 Chinese input in their businesses.

1020
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:22,580
 But in all these Asian and African countries,

1021
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:26,580
 do we have to ask if our political supremacy

1022
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:29,780
 and economic advantage reflect a God

1023
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:33,300
 that care for sins generated from power imbalance?

1024
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:37,580
 How much are we implicated

1025
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:41,220
 in some of the irregular Chinese trading methods

1026
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:44,820
 and exploitation of people and the land?

1027
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:48,500
 The way we carry our presence speaks volumes

1028
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:51,380
 about the gospel we preach.

1029
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:53,980
 The contemporary Chinese mission movements

1030
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:58,820
 like Back to Jerusalem, the Homecoming Chinese Gathering,

1031
00:57:58,820 --> 00:58:01,980
 or Mission China 2030,

1032
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:05,260
 have gathered momentum in recent years

1033
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:09,180
 to mobilize Chinese Christians to serve the global church,

1034
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:10,940
 which is very good indeed.

1035
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:15,340
 However, despite all their good intentions,

1036
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:19,660
 they all carry certain air of conquest and entitlement,

1037
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:23,620
 painting the Chinese church as the country

1038
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:26,540
 used by God at the end to finish the task

1039
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:29,260
 to preach the gospel to the ends of the earth.

1040
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:33,820
 Such stance does energize and motivate people

1041
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:35,460
 in positive ways,

1042
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:39,420
 but are we going out as conquerors and saviors

1043
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:42,900
 or as fellow sinners needing redemption?

1044
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:48,540
 Do we dare to mention that we are also being sinned against

1045
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:49,700
 by the social system?

1046
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:55,780
 The same holds true within the Chinese soil

1047
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:59,020
 when a sizable group of Chinese Han Christians

1048
00:58:59,020 --> 00:59:02,740
 enter minority groups without any attempt

1049
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:05,060
 to embrace a world of weakness,

1050
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:07,660
 vulnerability, and marginality.

1051
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:11,220
 Han Christians often fail to identify

1052
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:13,380
 with the struggles of being minorities,

1053
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:17,580
 refuse to learn minority languages and cultures,

1054
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:20,580
 and expect ethnic Christians to merge

1055
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:24,100
 into the majority Han churches.

1056
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:28,260
 Thus, they have inadvertently adopted a mindset

1057
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:31,140
 and lifestyle that support inequality.

1058
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:35,660
 Critical self-reflection is truly needed

1059
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:38,660
 for missionaries and their sending bodies.

1060
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:44,660
 Another problem coming out from this superiority mentality

1061
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:48,020
 is the lack of partnership with the weak

1062
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:49,900
 in the advancement of the gospel.

1063
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:55,020
 We pride ourselves when we play the savior mode,

1064
00:59:55,020 --> 00:59:57,380
 sending out workers to places where the church

1065
00:59:57,380 --> 00:59:59,140
 is poor and depleted,

1066
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:02,020
 and sometimes even persecuted.

1067
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:07,020
 But we are not ready to encounter truth in those contexts

1068
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:11,340
 which may change and challenge our current position

1069
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:12,460
 in our theology.

1070
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:15,620
 Are we ready to engage with cultures

1071
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:18,060
 that may be superior to ours,

1072
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:22,580
 not in the modern-day economic technical sense,

1073
01:00:22,580 --> 01:00:26,340
 but in the sense of classic moral standards

1074
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:29,540
 that sometimes have even worked on the archaic,

1075
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:33,460
 like caring for the elderly, communal sharing,

1076
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:37,260
 the demand to uphold family name and honor,

1077
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:39,860
 the emphasis on resilience in suffering

1078
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:42,740
 instead of success, et cetera, et cetera?

1079
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:44,820
 Are we repeating the failures

1080
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:47,220
 of American white evangelicalism?

1081
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:52,380
 Coming back to lecture today,

1082
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:57,340
 we might not be able to feel the kind of pain and anguish

1083
01:00:57,340 --> 01:01:02,340
 Dr. Leberton has on American white Christians

1084
01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:05,860
 because the whole scenario seems so distant.

1085
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:09,220
 But we know we are all bundled together

1086
01:01:09,220 --> 01:01:11,060
 in this global village,

1087
01:01:11,060 --> 01:01:14,780
 and it's time for us to confront the whole array

1088
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:17,460
 of misrepresentation of the gospel

1089
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:19,740
 and the darker side of human nature

1090
01:01:19,740 --> 01:01:23,140
 being dressed under the cloak of evangelicalism.

1091
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:27,260
 I pray that together we might be able

1092
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:29,180
 to find a way out of this mire.

1093
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:30,900
 Thank you.

1094
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:33,220
 (footsteps)

1095
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:43,740
 (speaking in foreign language)

1096
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:45,060
 - Dr. Leberton,

1097
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:47,420
 President Lee, distinguished guests,

1098
01:01:47,420 --> 01:01:48,700
 colleagues, and students,

1099
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:51,940
 I'm most honored to be given the opportunity

1100
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:54,700
 to respond to Professor Leberton's great speech today.

1101
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:57,140
 I'd like to talk about the stories

1102
01:01:57,140 --> 01:01:59,580
 of American mission workers in modern China

1103
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:03,900
 but it would be a totally impossible task

1104
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:06,300
 to do justice to this rich legacy

1105
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:07,620
 within seven minutes' time.

1106
01:02:07,620 --> 01:02:11,180
 However, I'm much encouraged by the example

1107
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:13,620
 of the late Reverend Dr. Cheng Chengyi,

1108
01:02:13,620 --> 01:02:15,780
 one of the representatives of Chinese churches

1109
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:19,660
 at the World Missionary Conference in Edinburgh in 1920.

1110
01:02:19,660 --> 01:02:22,060
 Reverend Cheng was able to clearly articulate

1111
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:24,020
 the voices of the Chinese church

1112
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:26,540
 within a short span of just seven minutes.

1113
01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:30,660
 (speaking in foreign language)

1114
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:34,900
 Tracing the footprints of the many American mission workers

1115
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:38,460
 in China, from Elijah Coleman Bridgman,

1116
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:41,740
 the first one to arrive in China in 1830,

1117
01:02:41,740 --> 01:02:43,820
 through to Loyal Holding Bartow,

1118
01:02:43,820 --> 01:02:46,500
 who finally died in prison in China,

1119
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:50,780
 we can clearly see the dedication and contribution

1120
01:02:50,780 --> 01:02:53,260
 of the American church in China

1121
01:02:53,260 --> 01:02:55,500
 in those one and a half centuries.

1122
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:58,340
 (speaking in foreign language)

1123
01:02:58,340 --> 01:03:01,940
 The impact made was enormous and imperishable,

1124
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:06,060
 so much so that even after over 70 years,

1125
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:10,540
 the new China could not totally remove

1126
01:03:10,540 --> 01:03:12,900
 all the marks and traces they left.

1127
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:21,220
 If we push the clock back another 30 years from 1949,

1128
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:29,620
 we will find that the Chinese Communist Party

1129
01:03:29,620 --> 01:03:33,940
 had been a competition to Christianity

1130
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:37,020
 since the party's inception in 1921.

1131
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:43,500
 The competition was vigorous on many, many fronts.

1132
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:46,740
 Both sides had wins and losses at different times.

1133
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:53,220
 In respect of a number of resources and operations

1134
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:58,220
 and other things, in the first 30 years of the 20th century,

1135
01:03:58,220 --> 01:04:03,420
 Christianity seemed to gain the upper hand,

1136
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:06,860
 except that it didn't have a military presence.

1137
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:13,860
 But by the end of the second 30 years,

1138
01:04:13,860 --> 01:04:19,620
 Christianity had lost almost everything.

1139
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:25,540
 And during the third 30-year period,

1140
01:04:25,540 --> 01:04:27,500
 the competition ended in a draw

1141
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:29,580
 if we look at numbers alone.

1142
01:04:29,580 --> 01:04:35,620
 There is so much that I want to tell about this period.

1143
01:04:35,620 --> 01:04:41,700
 So in the remaining five minutes,

1144
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:43,940
 I should be very, very focused.

1145
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:52,620
 In mid-20th century,

1146
01:04:52,620 --> 01:04:57,900
 the China Committee of the Division of Foreign Missions

1147
01:04:57,900 --> 01:05:02,300
 of the National Council of Churches of Christ in the USA,

1148
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:07,180
 they conducted a study on the 150-odd American

1149
01:05:07,180 --> 01:05:11,580
 mission workers from 22 sending organizations

1150
01:05:11,580 --> 01:05:13,980
 who withdrew from mainland China.

1151
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:20,820
 The report entitled "Lessons to be Learned

1152
01:05:20,820 --> 01:05:25,700
 from the Experiences of Christian Missions in China"

1153
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:29,740
 was published in 1951.

1154
01:05:29,740 --> 01:05:35,180
 It represented the common reflections

1155
01:05:35,180 --> 01:05:38,340
 of that group of American missionaries in China.

1156
01:05:38,340 --> 01:05:42,740
 Now, one of the issues raised in the report

1157
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:44,420
 caught my special attention.

1158
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:51,980
 Whilst almost all missionary respondents agreed

1159
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:56,140
 that services in the urban and rural areas,

1160
01:05:56,140 --> 01:05:57,660
 common education,

1161
01:05:57,660 --> 01:06:01,940
 improvements in agriculture, and so on,

1162
01:06:01,940 --> 01:06:06,100
 were all needed to meet the needs of the people of China.

1163
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:12,300
 But 86% of the respondents pointed out

1164
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:16,180
 that the Church had done very little

1165
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:18,540
 in helping workers and farmers.

1166
01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:26,180
 And 31% agreed that

1167
01:06:26,180 --> 01:06:36,380
 the Church's action would build up a community

1168
01:06:36,380 --> 01:06:39,700
 that is totally detached from the poor people.

1169
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:44,700
 And 31% agreed that missionaries tended to associate

1170
01:06:45,060 --> 01:06:47,860
 much more closely with government officials,

1171
01:06:47,860 --> 01:06:49,660
 intellectuals, and rich people.

1172
01:06:49,660 --> 01:06:55,500
 Since the mid-19th century,

1173
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:59,100
 the most urgent priority for China

1174
01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:01,260
 and the most desperate dream of her people

1175
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:05,300
 had been survival and rebuilding the country.

1176
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:11,020
 For this, different organizations and individuals

1177
01:07:11,020 --> 01:07:14,180
 had put forward various proposals and solutions.

1178
01:07:15,180 --> 01:07:18,660
 At the same time, they were fighting for their share

1179
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:21,340
 of influence and power,

1180
01:07:21,340 --> 01:07:23,300
 which was needed to change the country.

1181
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:30,820
 That the Communist Party finally won this power struggle

1182
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:33,740
 might be attributable to many reasons,

1183
01:07:33,740 --> 01:07:37,300
 one of which was the ability to hone in precisely

1184
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:41,660
 to the crux, which was the farmers and the land.

1185
01:07:41,660 --> 01:07:45,580
 (speaking in foreign language)

1186
01:07:45,580 --> 01:07:50,580
 So the communists penetrated into farming communities,

1187
01:07:50,580 --> 01:07:54,500
 enticing them with fair distribution of land,

1188
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:59,260
 and tireless fought on their behalf,

1189
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:02,820
 thus winning over their support.

1190
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:06,820
 Let me clarify here

1191
01:08:10,740 --> 01:08:13,620
 that I'm only pointing out the aims of endeavors

1192
01:08:13,620 --> 01:08:17,500
 of Communist Party without commenting on the legitimacy

1193
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:19,180
 of their tactics and actions.

1194
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:26,060
 By contrast, many American mission workers

1195
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:28,380
 tried to showcase the Chinese version

1196
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:33,380
 of America's success story in becoming a strong nation,

1197
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:37,180
 extending the American westward expansion

1198
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:39,060
 all the way to China.

1199
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:41,660
 (speaking in foreign language)

1200
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:46,100
 With a promise that this gospel from across the Atlantic

1201
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:51,660
 would bring about democratic political system

1202
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:56,860
 in the American style, free market economy,

1203
01:08:56,860 --> 01:09:01,140
 and the Christian ethos embedded

1204
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:03,100
 in the founding of the United States.

1205
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:08,780
 I must admit that this is still the dreams

1206
01:09:08,780 --> 01:09:11,020
 of many Chinese Christians today.

1207
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:17,780
 But as an agricultural country like China,

1208
01:09:17,780 --> 01:09:20,580
 what about the most pressing social issue,

1209
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:23,100
 namely the farming people and the land?

1210
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:30,900
 Indeed, during the 1920s to '30s,

1211
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:33,300
 some American mission organizations

1212
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:37,260
 did send some agricultural mission workers to China,

1213
01:09:38,260 --> 01:09:41,860
 and in some Christian universities in China,

1214
01:09:41,860 --> 01:09:43,740
 agricultural departments were set up.

1215
01:09:43,740 --> 01:09:47,580
 And some Chinese Christian leaders

1216
01:09:47,580 --> 01:09:51,540
 had championed some rural development movements

1217
01:09:51,540 --> 01:09:56,820
 and managed to get some financial and policy support

1218
01:09:56,820 --> 01:09:59,540
 from the then Kuomintang government.

1219
01:09:59,540 --> 01:10:05,660
 But their contribution was limited

1220
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:07,540
 to symptomatic measures.

1221
01:10:07,540 --> 01:10:14,300
 These are like starting education in the rural areas,

1222
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:18,100
 improving hygiene and farming technologies,

1223
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:21,740
 but without tackling the roots of the problem,

1224
01:10:21,740 --> 01:10:23,260
 which was the land issue.

1225
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:31,300
 But these efforts were not embraced

1226
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:34,260
 by mainline Chinese churches.

1227
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:40,260
 And indeed, just like a glasshouse flower,

1228
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:44,820
 which bloomed only for a short while

1229
01:10:44,820 --> 01:10:47,700
 and soon to be destroyed by the Sino-Japanese War.

1230
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:56,340
 Just as advocates for rural development

1231
01:10:56,340 --> 01:11:00,580
 were trying hard to persuade the mainline Chinese churches

1232
01:11:00,580 --> 01:11:02,260
 to change their focus,

1233
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:05,220
 some mission workers in the tertiary education sector

1234
01:11:05,220 --> 01:11:07,100
 cried out in alarm

1235
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:10,580
 that the communists had stolen from Christian thoughts.

1236
01:11:10,580 --> 01:11:14,340
 The communists had already put into practice

1237
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:17,220
 the very concept of fighting for social justice

1238
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:18,540
 for grassroots people.

1239
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:23,980
 Pastors at that time also found that

1240
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:26,860
 they were losing the young people

1241
01:11:26,860 --> 01:11:28,620
 to the communist movements.

1242
01:11:29,620 --> 01:11:32,100
 In the summer of 1933,

1243
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:34,980
 special meetings were held among mission workers

1244
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:39,980
 to discuss how Christianity could be as influential

1245
01:11:39,980 --> 01:11:43,140
 among young people as communism.

1246
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:51,620
 The issue that I wish to bring up today

1247
01:11:51,620 --> 01:11:56,220
 is not whether Christianity could win the war,

1248
01:11:56,220 --> 01:12:00,460
 is not whether Christianity could win in this competition,

1249
01:12:00,460 --> 01:12:04,940
 but rather whether the church

1250
01:12:04,940 --> 01:12:09,940
 is following the path of life after Christ and His cross.

1251
01:12:09,940 --> 01:12:15,020
 Then Jesus said to His disciples,

1252
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:19,500
 "Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves

1253
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:21,780
 and take up their cross and follow me."

1254
01:12:26,140 --> 01:12:29,740
 The young official in the Gospels had great wealth.

1255
01:12:29,740 --> 01:12:33,900
 So the meaning of the cross

1256
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:36,740
 points directly at his wealth,

1257
01:12:36,740 --> 01:12:39,260
 his status,

1258
01:12:39,260 --> 01:12:43,140
 and challenging the social order on which he was established.

1259
01:12:43,140 --> 01:12:49,780
 Jesus answered,

1260
01:12:49,780 --> 01:12:52,860
 "If you want to be perfect,

1261
01:12:52,860 --> 01:12:55,740
 go sell your possessions

1262
01:12:55,740 --> 01:12:58,020
 and give to the poor,

1263
01:12:58,020 --> 01:13:00,500
 and you will have treasure in heaven.

1264
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:04,820
 Then come, follow me."

1265
01:13:04,820 --> 01:13:11,100
 Christ has called His followers

1266
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:13,660
 to tread on a downward path.

1267
01:13:13,660 --> 01:13:19,100
 The issue is not whether the church is in the middle class,

1268
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:25,020
 but rather whether she is living out a different life.

1269
01:13:25,740 --> 01:13:27,580
 Separate from the world trends,

1270
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:32,380
 and in accordance with Christ's commands.

1271
01:13:32,380 --> 01:13:38,020
 We can list four or more characteristics of evangelicalism,

1272
01:13:38,020 --> 01:13:40,700
 but each one may have the peril

1273
01:13:40,700 --> 01:13:43,300
 of becoming just a deceiving packaging.

1274
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:48,220
 The crux is whether we are determined

1275
01:13:48,220 --> 01:13:51,260
 to internalize it as our inner value,

1276
01:13:52,100 --> 01:13:56,140
 and to be recognized as such through our earnest practice.

1277
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:57,140
 Thank you.

1278
01:13:57,140 --> 01:14:21,980
 Thank you, Dr. Chen and Dr. Song, for your responses.

1279
01:14:21,980 --> 01:14:23,980
 And now, in the rest of the,

1280
01:14:23,980 --> 01:14:29,100
 we'll have about 45 minutes of questions and answers.

1281
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:33,300
 And in fact, there have been several questions

1282
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:34,860
 being sent in.

1283
01:14:34,860 --> 01:14:37,820
 And Dr. Levitin,

1284
01:14:37,820 --> 01:14:41,100
 can we start with a question,

1285
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:45,660
 perhaps most directly related to your presentation?

1286
01:14:45,660 --> 01:14:51,780
 So, I think the first question is,

1287
01:14:51,780 --> 01:14:56,780
 what factors made evangelical Christians so blind

1288
01:14:56,780 --> 01:15:00,340
 to be unable to live out the truth of gospel?

1289
01:15:00,340 --> 01:15:02,220
 What can be done to change?

1290
01:15:02,220 --> 01:15:03,500
 What suggestions do you have

1291
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:07,460
 for Chinese churches in America,

1292
01:15:07,460 --> 01:15:11,460
 which tends to so blindly follow the white churches

1293
01:15:11,460 --> 01:15:13,260
 in many or in all ways?

1294
01:15:13,260 --> 01:15:18,300
 Thank you very much for that good question.

1295
01:15:19,860 --> 01:15:23,300
 Let me start simply by also saying thank you

1296
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:25,620
 to the two respondents.

1297
01:15:25,620 --> 01:15:27,740
 I appreciated very much their comments,

1298
01:15:27,740 --> 01:15:30,860
 and I hope I'll have a chance to interact

1299
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:32,180
 with them at some stage.

1300
01:15:32,180 --> 01:15:35,060
 The question is penetrating,

1301
01:15:35,060 --> 01:15:38,220
 and I think maybe one way of summarizing it

1302
01:15:38,220 --> 01:15:43,220
 is that we are all aware that the gospel

1303
01:15:43,220 --> 01:15:47,060
 is far more radical than the church

1304
01:15:47,060 --> 01:15:51,780
 that names that gospel as usually ever wanting to be.

1305
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:55,780
 What Jesus did and what he said and how he taught

1306
01:15:55,780 --> 01:16:02,220
 and what he called us to is just much more difficult

1307
01:16:02,220 --> 01:16:07,460
 and uncomfortable than we are usually willing

1308
01:16:07,460 --> 01:16:11,420
 to actually accept or even acknowledge.

1309
01:16:11,420 --> 01:16:14,100
 I think Christian history has shown

1310
01:16:15,020 --> 01:16:17,500
 that there is a great tendency,

1311
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:22,500
 a common tendency to accommodate the gospel

1312
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:26,540
 to something that we find more acceptable

1313
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:29,860
 than to live in the radical way

1314
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:32,180
 that Jesus exemplified and taught.

1315
01:16:32,180 --> 01:16:38,340
 So in talking about American white evangelicalism,

1316
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:41,540
 I'm talking about one way that the church

1317
01:16:41,540 --> 01:16:44,900
 throughout history has simply accommodated

1318
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:48,420
 the good news to the life that we wanna go ahead

1319
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:50,940
 and live apart from the gospel.

1320
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:55,460
 And we want to use the gospel as a framework

1321
01:16:55,460 --> 01:17:01,020
 for various purposes, for eternal life,

1322
01:17:01,020 --> 01:17:06,020
 for moral clarity, for social relationships,

1323
01:17:06,020 --> 01:17:14,140
 for hope, for love, for peace.

1324
01:17:14,780 --> 01:17:15,980
 For forgiveness.

1325
01:17:15,980 --> 01:17:19,380
 But the radical call to take up our cross

1326
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:23,740
 and follow Christ has never been a popular part

1327
01:17:23,740 --> 01:17:25,260
 of the life of the church.

1328
01:17:25,260 --> 01:17:30,180
 And throughout church history,

1329
01:17:30,180 --> 01:17:32,940
 the number of people, as Jesus said,

1330
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:35,620
 that are willing to do that are few.

1331
01:17:35,620 --> 01:17:41,900
 So let me begin first with saying that.

1332
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:45,060
 So we're talking about the broadness of the church

1333
01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:49,300
 in its unwillingness to actually be radical followers

1334
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:50,980
 of Jesus.

1335
01:17:50,980 --> 01:17:54,820
 And in many ways, the white evangelical church in America

1336
01:17:54,820 --> 01:17:59,580
 becomes a case study in what for different reasons

1337
01:17:59,580 --> 01:18:02,500
 could be said perhaps as the two respondents

1338
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:05,620
 have indicated in some ways of the Chinese church,

1339
01:18:05,620 --> 01:18:08,340
 but it certainly could be true of countries

1340
01:18:08,340 --> 01:18:10,620
 all around the world,

1341
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:14,180
 each in their own particular context and culture.

1342
01:18:14,180 --> 01:18:17,180
 But in the American setting,

1343
01:18:17,180 --> 01:18:20,660
 I would commend a book that I'm going to refer to again

1344
01:18:20,660 --> 01:18:25,660
 tomorrow called "The Democratization of Christianity

1345
01:18:25,660 --> 01:18:27,660
 in America."

1346
01:18:27,660 --> 01:18:31,900
 "The Democratization of Christianity in America."

1347
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:36,140
 It's an exceptionally good book,

1348
01:18:36,140 --> 01:18:40,980
 which is an expression of the way

1349
01:18:40,980 --> 01:18:44,580
 that American Christianity changed as it moved

1350
01:18:44,580 --> 01:18:47,900
 from the East Coast to the West Coast of the United States

1351
01:18:47,900 --> 01:18:52,180
 and further and further into the South as well.

1352
01:18:52,180 --> 01:18:53,940
 And a great deal of the theme of the book

1353
01:18:53,940 --> 01:18:57,540
 has to do with the way that Christianity became

1354
01:18:57,540 --> 01:19:00,980
 something which people made up for themselves.

1355
01:19:00,980 --> 01:19:02,740
 So they had the Bible,

1356
01:19:02,740 --> 01:19:05,140
 but they often didn't have any educated leaders.

1357
01:19:05,140 --> 01:19:08,300
 They didn't have any kind of Christian community

1358
01:19:08,300 --> 01:19:09,580
 around them necessarily.

1359
01:19:09,580 --> 01:19:13,180
 They didn't have any educational institutions

1360
01:19:13,180 --> 01:19:16,980
 that were helping to guide and form their leadership.

1361
01:19:16,980 --> 01:19:20,300
 They just instead took the gospel

1362
01:19:20,300 --> 01:19:23,660
 or whatever it is that they thought they knew of the gospel

1363
01:19:23,660 --> 01:19:27,180
 and put it to work for their own designs,

1364
01:19:27,180 --> 01:19:29,740
 I'm sure humbly and earnestly,

1365
01:19:29,740 --> 01:19:34,140
 but often very, very specifically and personally

1366
01:19:34,140 --> 01:19:37,980
 rather than as a response to the Lordship of Christ

1367
01:19:37,980 --> 01:19:39,460
 over all things.

1368
01:19:39,460 --> 01:19:43,300
 And out of that came what now we would recognize,

1369
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:47,780
 for example, as consumer Christianity.

1370
01:19:47,780 --> 01:19:51,620
 That is, I'm going to take from the gospel what I want

1371
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:56,620
 and I'm going to keep the parts that I like that serve me

1372
01:19:56,620 --> 01:19:59,700
 and I'm going to more or less ignore

1373
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:04,460
 or reject the parts that I don't like.

1374
01:20:04,460 --> 01:20:08,860
 And that pattern, which is one that emerges early

1375
01:20:08,860 --> 01:20:13,540
 in American history, is one that continues to this day.

1376
01:20:13,540 --> 01:20:15,660
 So the antidote to that,

1377
01:20:15,660 --> 01:20:20,060
 coming to the question asker's point,

1378
01:20:20,060 --> 01:20:21,940
 what is the antidote to that?

1379
01:20:21,940 --> 01:20:24,220
 I think the antidote to that has to do

1380
01:20:24,220 --> 01:20:27,900
 with how we form genuine disciples,

1381
01:20:28,900 --> 01:20:33,020
 not people who are part of denomination and a movement

1382
01:20:33,020 --> 01:20:36,020
 or an organization or a structure,

1383
01:20:36,020 --> 01:20:39,580
 but people who are truly devoted

1384
01:20:39,580 --> 01:20:42,460
 to being followers of Jesus.

1385
01:20:42,460 --> 01:20:44,420
 And then do it in community,

1386
01:20:44,420 --> 01:20:46,940
 because of course we're not meant to live this kind of life.

1387
01:20:46,940 --> 01:20:50,620
 We can't live this kind of life individualistically

1388
01:20:50,620 --> 01:20:52,540
 as Americans also try to do.

1389
01:20:52,540 --> 01:20:54,820
 We'll come to that more tomorrow.

1390
01:20:54,820 --> 01:20:56,900
 We have to do it in community.

1391
01:20:56,900 --> 01:20:58,820
 And in doing it in community,

1392
01:20:58,820 --> 01:21:02,860
 then we have the check and balance of other people around us.

1393
01:21:02,860 --> 01:21:07,140
 And the difficulty is that so often what we gather around us

1394
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:09,620
 is a community that looks like us.

1395
01:21:09,620 --> 01:21:13,340
 So then the church starts looking like the social setting

1396
01:21:13,340 --> 01:21:15,260
 into which we were born,

1397
01:21:15,260 --> 01:21:19,700
 rather than a community like the apostle Paul,

1398
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:21,140
 I would want to argue,

1399
01:21:21,140 --> 01:21:25,100
 suggests is meant to be an entirely new humanity.

1400
01:21:27,340 --> 01:21:31,220
 One humanity, a new humanity that reflects

1401
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:33,260
 the death and resurrection of Jesus

1402
01:21:33,260 --> 01:21:36,140
 by the death and resurrection of ourselves

1403
01:21:36,140 --> 01:21:39,180
 in community of unlike people.

1404
01:21:39,180 --> 01:21:43,420
 That's the place that the church has often broken down.

1405
01:21:43,420 --> 01:21:46,780
 And that's exactly what happened in American church culture

1406
01:21:46,780 --> 01:21:51,780
 in historical terms, but it is largely still the case.

1407
01:21:51,780 --> 01:21:56,900
 So when a poll was done by the Pew Foundation

1408
01:21:56,900 --> 01:22:00,780
 two years ago about how many white Americans

1409
01:22:00,780 --> 01:22:05,700
 have close relationships with a person of another race,

1410
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:11,020
 nearly 85% of white Americans said

1411
01:22:11,020 --> 01:22:14,220
 they did not have any close relationships

1412
01:22:14,220 --> 01:22:16,620
 with people that were not of their race.

1413
01:22:16,620 --> 01:22:20,060
 Now that's true of society in general,

1414
01:22:20,060 --> 01:22:22,020
 but if that's true of society in general,

1415
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:26,380
 then it is tragically certainly true of churches

1416
01:22:26,380 --> 01:22:29,460
 who have a white normativity

1417
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:32,700
 that often excludes people of color

1418
01:22:32,700 --> 01:22:35,580
 and does so in cultural and church terms.

1419
01:22:35,580 --> 01:22:39,620
 And then we just become a mirror, a hall of mirrors

1420
01:22:39,620 --> 01:22:43,060
 that we all look alike and act alike and talk alike.

1421
01:22:43,060 --> 01:22:45,420
 And therefore we think that's the gospel

1422
01:22:45,420 --> 01:22:48,540
 instead of letting the gospel radically redefine us.

1423
01:22:48,540 --> 01:22:53,180
 - Thank you, Dr. Levitan.

1424
01:22:53,180 --> 01:22:55,900
 I think you have raised several themes

1425
01:22:55,900 --> 01:22:59,380
 like taming the radical nature of the gospel,

1426
01:22:59,380 --> 01:23:02,740
 the consumerism, and also bringing together

1427
01:23:02,740 --> 01:23:06,860
 unlike people in the new created community in Christ.

1428
01:23:06,860 --> 01:23:09,860
 So these themes sound also familiar

1429
01:23:09,860 --> 01:23:13,340
 here in actually in the Chinese churches

1430
01:23:13,340 --> 01:23:16,380
 and the churches around here in Hong Kong as well.

1431
01:23:16,380 --> 01:23:21,020
 So I think this lead very naturally to a second question.

1432
01:23:21,020 --> 01:23:25,260
 Actually, it's a small agenda in nature.

1433
01:23:25,260 --> 01:23:27,500
 It says maybe our two response speakers

1434
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:29,740
 have to fill in some of the gaps as well.

1435
01:23:29,740 --> 01:23:35,820
 It asks, "In what way does American white evangelicalism

1436
01:23:35,820 --> 01:23:40,020
 "affect churches in Hong Kong now?"

1437
01:23:40,020 --> 01:23:43,100
 So yes, I think we need wisdoms

1438
01:23:43,100 --> 01:23:46,420
 from across the Atlantic, Pacific.

1439
01:23:46,420 --> 01:23:48,340
 - The respondent should speak first.

1440
01:23:48,340 --> 01:23:49,580
 - Okay.

1441
01:23:49,580 --> 01:23:53,660
 So perhaps I translate the question

1442
01:23:53,660 --> 01:23:55,780
 for Dr. Sung-Jun first, okay.

1443
01:23:55,780 --> 01:24:01,140
 (speaking in foreign language)

1444
01:24:01,140 --> 01:24:08,540
 Maybe we may start with a born Chinese,

1445
01:24:08,540 --> 01:24:09,580
 Hong Kong, sorry.

1446
01:24:09,580 --> 01:24:15,020
 - Well, I noticed that there are quite a few

1447
01:24:15,020 --> 01:24:17,060
 faculty members now on the floor.

1448
01:24:17,060 --> 01:24:20,700
 So I'm expecting some of your response as well, okay.

1449
01:24:20,700 --> 01:24:21,980
 We need your input.

1450
01:24:21,980 --> 01:24:27,460
 And yeah, because of my location,

1451
01:24:27,460 --> 01:24:30,380
 I mean, I feel more and more distant

1452
01:24:30,380 --> 01:24:33,860
 from the Hong Kong current scene to be sure, yeah.

1453
01:24:33,860 --> 01:24:36,260
 But I'm just thinking that

1454
01:24:36,260 --> 01:24:41,500
 just following up on Dr. Leberton's remark,

1455
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:45,380
 I think we need to be aware of our inclination

1456
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:48,180
 or this kind of

1457
01:24:48,180 --> 01:24:53,740
 tendency to group together with people

1458
01:24:53,740 --> 01:24:56,860
 who are alike with us, okay.

1459
01:24:56,860 --> 01:24:59,780
 So I mean, this is something very natural

1460
01:24:59,780 --> 01:25:01,900
 because you feel so comfortable.

1461
01:25:01,900 --> 01:25:04,220
 We will stay in our comfort zone.

1462
01:25:04,220 --> 01:25:08,060
 But right now, because of the divisions,

1463
01:25:08,060 --> 01:25:11,660
 the divisiveness among the churches in Hong Kong,

1464
01:25:11,660 --> 01:25:15,420
 I think we need to sort of alter our mentality.

1465
01:25:15,420 --> 01:25:19,980
 We need to keep reminding us that we have to keep

1466
01:25:19,980 --> 01:25:21,740
 reading from the other side

1467
01:25:21,740 --> 01:25:26,700
 and then to listen from opposing angles and views.

1468
01:25:26,700 --> 01:25:28,660
 So I think this is kind of a discipline.

1469
01:25:28,660 --> 01:25:31,420
 I call this even spiritual discipline for us

1470
01:25:31,420 --> 01:25:35,820
 that we need to constantly keep

1471
01:25:38,660 --> 01:25:43,660
 learning, learning and trying to see

1472
01:25:43,660 --> 01:25:49,020
 what we have missed in our own framework, okay.

1473
01:25:49,020 --> 01:25:52,660
 So this is something that I think should be done.

1474
01:25:52,660 --> 01:25:56,820
 But if talking about this whole concept of,

1475
01:25:56,820 --> 01:26:00,340
 whole tendency of white evangelicalism

1476
01:26:00,340 --> 01:26:03,140
 and their influence on the Hong Kong church,

1477
01:26:03,140 --> 01:26:07,980
 I'm feeling that whatever American is doing now,

1478
01:26:07,980 --> 01:26:11,700
 would have global effects, like it or not, okay.

1479
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:13,540
 So we have to acknowledge that

1480
01:26:13,540 --> 01:26:16,860
 because of all this online information

1481
01:26:16,860 --> 01:26:19,260
 and all because of all the,

1482
01:26:19,260 --> 01:26:23,580
 the most of the theological material we study,

1483
01:26:23,580 --> 01:26:28,220
 imported from the West and because of the majority

1484
01:26:28,220 --> 01:26:32,220
 of written material from the States,

1485
01:26:32,220 --> 01:26:37,220
 I mean, we are really affected by the whole concept

1486
01:26:37,700 --> 01:26:40,500
 of, the whole concept of

1487
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:48,620
 theology that would underplay the,

1488
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:55,140
 the emphasis or the look on the weak and the marginalized.

1489
01:26:55,140 --> 01:27:00,460
 This is what I'm talking in my response

1490
01:27:00,460 --> 01:27:02,900
 because of this whole idea of success

1491
01:27:02,900 --> 01:27:07,060
 that you can do it, freedom and all this idea

1492
01:27:07,060 --> 01:27:11,100
 that is very positive thinking and it's really good for us.

1493
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:14,260
 But on the other hand, I think we really lack

1494
01:27:14,260 --> 01:27:17,220
 this whole concept of suffering and persecution

1495
01:27:17,220 --> 01:27:19,700
 in American theology.

1496
01:27:19,700 --> 01:27:26,540
 And we import them and then we tend to talk about,

1497
01:27:26,540 --> 01:27:29,380
 say when we talk about suffering,

1498
01:27:29,380 --> 01:27:32,540
 we talk about personal suffering as such

1499
01:27:32,540 --> 01:27:34,260
 instead of social suffering.

1500
01:27:35,180 --> 01:27:39,260
 We talk about this whole concept of suffering

1501
01:27:39,260 --> 01:27:42,540
 because of illness, of age, but we know that

1502
01:27:42,540 --> 01:27:49,140
 in the end, actually, most of the suffering

1503
01:27:49,140 --> 01:27:52,580
 actually comes from a social setting.

1504
01:27:52,580 --> 01:27:57,940
 But because Hong Kong churches are in general

1505
01:27:57,940 --> 01:27:59,780
 also very middle class.

1506
01:27:59,780 --> 01:28:05,060
 And so we can hide in our small niche

1507
01:28:05,060 --> 01:28:07,460
 and then we can feel comfortable.

1508
01:28:07,460 --> 01:28:12,100
 And again, we can sort of explain our whole being

1509
01:28:12,100 --> 01:28:15,260
 with a very limited kind of framework.

1510
01:28:15,260 --> 01:28:19,780
 And so I'm feeling that if we look broader

1511
01:28:19,780 --> 01:28:23,820
 into the whole global world and read more about

1512
01:28:23,820 --> 01:28:26,540
 the kind of experiences and narratives

1513
01:28:26,540 --> 01:28:28,780
 from more of the third world countries,

1514
01:28:28,780 --> 01:28:31,060
 from Africa, from Latin America,

1515
01:28:31,060 --> 01:28:34,020
 and from say South Asia, et cetera,

1516
01:28:34,020 --> 01:28:37,620
 I think we'll really try to wean ourselves

1517
01:28:37,620 --> 01:28:39,500
 from American evangelicalism.

1518
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:45,380
 >> Thank you very much.

1519
01:28:45,380 --> 01:28:52,420
 >> Thank you for the question and the response from Wenyan.

1520
01:28:52,420 --> 01:28:56,140
 I just want to respond to one point.

1521
01:29:00,140 --> 01:29:05,140
 From what Dr. Levitin talked about American evangelicalism

1522
01:29:05,140 --> 01:29:11,380
 true to the critical and put into action.

1523
01:29:11,380 --> 01:29:19,860
 I think the churches in Hong Kong do have the DNA

1524
01:29:19,860 --> 01:29:21,220
 of evangelicalism.

1525
01:29:21,220 --> 01:29:29,100
 But there are three things which are also pointed out

1526
01:29:29,860 --> 01:29:30,700
 in the question.

1527
01:29:30,700 --> 01:29:35,380
 And as someone coming from mainland China,

1528
01:29:35,380 --> 01:29:36,860
 I have such observation.

1529
01:29:36,860 --> 01:29:41,860
 The first one, from 1980s onwards,

1530
01:29:41,860 --> 01:29:44,220
 churches in Hong Kong,

1531
01:29:44,220 --> 01:29:51,220
 more and more members of them are becoming more concerned

1532
01:29:51,220 --> 01:29:55,940
 about social issues, especially among young Christians.

1533
01:29:55,940 --> 01:29:59,540
 And this is a very clear sign.

1534
01:29:59,540 --> 01:30:00,820
 The second point is,

1535
01:30:00,820 --> 01:30:14,220
 in Hong Kong there are also many ethnic problems.

1536
01:30:14,220 --> 01:30:18,540
 But among Christians in Hong Kong,

1537
01:30:18,540 --> 01:30:21,020
 very few of them would voice out their response.

1538
01:30:21,020 --> 01:30:27,100
 Most of them do not admit that there is an ethnic problem.

1539
01:30:28,020 --> 01:30:31,660
 But as a very international and open community here,

1540
01:30:31,660 --> 01:30:35,660
 with many, many people from many different

1541
01:30:35,660 --> 01:30:37,740
 ethnic backgrounds living here,

1542
01:30:37,740 --> 01:30:43,900
 their conditions and their problems, their livelihood,

1543
01:30:43,900 --> 01:30:50,380
 is not something that is a concern of Church of Hong Kong.

1544
01:30:50,380 --> 01:30:52,780
 The third point is,

1545
01:30:55,660 --> 01:30:59,060
 many churches in Hong Kong are middle class,

1546
01:30:59,060 --> 01:31:03,980
 neglecting concern about the grassroot people.

1547
01:31:03,980 --> 01:31:08,180
 But admittedly, there are many organizations,

1548
01:31:08,180 --> 01:31:13,180
 Christian NGOs, who are helping the underprivileged.

1549
01:31:13,180 --> 01:31:19,540
 But they also have characteristics

1550
01:31:19,540 --> 01:31:21,420
 of the middle class church.

1551
01:31:21,420 --> 01:31:22,260
 Thank you.

1552
01:31:23,260 --> 01:31:26,980
 - Dr. Levitton, any further comments after hearing the two?

1553
01:31:26,980 --> 01:31:34,860
 - Augustine was convinced that sin is disordered love.

1554
01:31:34,860 --> 01:31:42,060
 And every culture has an order of loves that it prioritizes.

1555
01:31:42,060 --> 01:31:48,620
 And in American culture, loves that tend to get prioritized

1556
01:31:49,860 --> 01:31:54,860
 are loves like the love of personal happiness,

1557
01:31:54,860 --> 01:32:01,700
 the love of pleasure, the love of success,

1558
01:32:01,700 --> 01:32:05,500
 which can be monetary, but it can be other things as well.

1559
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:11,620
 The love of power, the love of beauty.

1560
01:32:11,620 --> 01:32:17,100
 These are all things that are part of our loves.

1561
01:32:17,100 --> 01:32:20,380
 And we live in a world of disordered loves,

1562
01:32:20,380 --> 01:32:23,540
 where we're meant to live and sustain ourselves,

1563
01:32:23,540 --> 01:32:26,660
 first and foremost, out of the love of God,

1564
01:32:26,660 --> 01:32:31,660
 and in response, showing our love to God as our first love.

1565
01:32:31,660 --> 01:32:35,460
 But of course, the nature of the human story

1566
01:32:35,460 --> 01:32:38,540
 and the nature of the American white evangelical story

1567
01:32:38,540 --> 01:32:43,260
 is the story of us attaching our lives to other loves,

1568
01:32:43,260 --> 01:32:46,420
 and then trying to make peace

1569
01:32:46,420 --> 01:32:50,020
 with the way that they do and don't fit

1570
01:32:50,020 --> 01:32:52,340
 the call of a disciple.

1571
01:32:52,340 --> 01:32:57,340
 And part of what we're called to is to reorder our loves.

1572
01:32:57,340 --> 01:33:01,060
 And I think this is where Christian worship

1573
01:33:01,060 --> 01:33:05,340
 reveals both our sin and the places that American culture

1574
01:33:05,340 --> 01:33:08,340
 has influenced many places around the world,

1575
01:33:08,340 --> 01:33:13,340
 and the ways that we are meant to be redeemed.

1576
01:33:13,580 --> 01:33:17,580
 So ideally, we could say public worship

1577
01:33:17,580 --> 01:33:22,580
 is meant to be an experience of reordering love,

1578
01:33:22,580 --> 01:33:29,260
 to be regrounded again in our love for God

1579
01:33:29,260 --> 01:33:34,260
 and our love for our neighbors and our love for ourselves.

1580
01:33:34,260 --> 01:33:38,220
 And within the ordering of loving our neighbors,

1581
01:33:38,220 --> 01:33:40,620
 it doesn't mean the neighbors that are like us

1582
01:33:40,620 --> 01:33:45,100
 or who like us, but as Jesus says in the Sermon on the Mount

1583
01:33:45,100 --> 01:33:48,100
 it even can include those who are our enemies.

1584
01:33:48,100 --> 01:33:52,820
 So to live into that kind of reordered love

1585
01:33:52,820 --> 01:33:57,820
 means that our public worship has to feed those appetites,

1586
01:33:57,820 --> 01:34:02,020
 nurture that desire that we would be those kinds of people.

1587
01:34:02,020 --> 01:34:06,180
 But instead, the American worship that we've exported

1588
01:34:06,180 --> 01:34:10,580
 is often a worship of entertainment.

1589
01:34:10,580 --> 01:34:14,900
 It's about celebrity, it's about money,

1590
01:34:14,900 --> 01:34:19,140
 it's about beauty, it's about fame, et cetera, et cetera.

1591
01:34:19,140 --> 01:34:22,860
 And not as Dr. Chan said so beautifully,

1592
01:34:22,860 --> 01:34:26,020
 it's not about the first love of God,

1593
01:34:26,020 --> 01:34:30,460
 particularly for the poor and for the neediest.

1594
01:34:30,460 --> 01:34:35,460
 So we are not cultivated to love what God most loves.

1595
01:34:36,260 --> 01:34:39,420
 And instead we're recultivated in the church

1596
01:34:39,420 --> 01:34:41,620
 to love what we already love.

1597
01:34:41,620 --> 01:34:44,740
 And then to just go on loving it even more

1598
01:34:44,740 --> 01:34:47,740
 rather than actually reflecting the love of God

1599
01:34:47,740 --> 01:34:49,260
 for the world.

1600
01:34:49,260 --> 01:34:51,700
 So I fear that we've exported that

1601
01:34:51,700 --> 01:34:54,860
 and it is its own musical

1602
01:34:54,860 --> 01:35:00,340
 and worship entertainment industry

1603
01:35:00,340 --> 01:35:02,500
 that has often been exported.

1604
01:35:02,500 --> 01:35:07,260
 And tragically that forms people to love the wrong things.

1605
01:35:07,260 --> 01:35:11,540
 - Thank you for your comment.

1606
01:35:11,540 --> 01:35:14,020
 So your comment has encouraged me

1607
01:35:14,020 --> 01:35:18,140
 to study more closely your two books,

1608
01:35:18,140 --> 01:35:19,700
 The Dangerous Acts of Worship

1609
01:35:19,700 --> 01:35:22,300
 and The Dangerous Acts of Loving Your Neighbor.

1610
01:35:22,300 --> 01:35:26,620
 I think I will take out more answers from your two works.

1611
01:35:26,620 --> 01:35:28,780
 Well, actually bring that to,

1612
01:35:28,780 --> 01:35:31,980
 I think your mentioning of loving your neighbor,

1613
01:35:31,980 --> 01:35:35,740
 actually it has quite some impact

1614
01:35:35,740 --> 01:35:40,740
 on our present Hong Kong churches as well.

1615
01:35:40,740 --> 01:35:44,860
 So there are two questions a bit related,

1616
01:35:44,860 --> 01:35:46,900
 but actually there are some details there.

1617
01:35:46,900 --> 01:35:50,220
 So maybe it can help Dr. Levitin

1618
01:35:50,220 --> 01:35:55,220
 to help giving your wisdom about what we may do,

1619
01:35:55,220 --> 01:36:00,260
 how we may react in the certain situation.

1620
01:36:00,260 --> 01:36:03,780
 One question is from a pastor and he says,

1621
01:36:03,780 --> 01:36:05,900
 Dr. Levitin, your views on complicity

1622
01:36:05,900 --> 01:36:08,900
 is something we can relate to greatly in Hong Kong.

1623
01:36:08,900 --> 01:36:12,980
 Given the recent circumstances as experienced by Hong Kong,

1624
01:36:12,980 --> 01:36:15,620
 most churches are very divided.

1625
01:36:15,620 --> 01:36:18,580
 It is those who feel we should speak out

1626
01:36:18,580 --> 01:36:21,540
 against present happenings, against authority,

1627
01:36:21,540 --> 01:36:24,100
 and those who do not wish to at all.

1628
01:36:24,100 --> 01:36:26,980
 As a pastor, I can say that we struggle greatly

1629
01:36:26,980 --> 01:36:30,020
 with the balancing act of wishing to speak,

1630
01:36:30,020 --> 01:36:33,060
 wishing to speak against that which we feel is evil,

1631
01:36:33,060 --> 01:36:36,260
 and of not wishing to offend those members of the church

1632
01:36:36,260 --> 01:36:39,020
 who are strong supporters of authority.

1633
01:36:39,020 --> 01:36:41,700
 But you seem to present the view that we are either

1634
01:36:41,700 --> 01:36:46,340
 complicit and condone evil acts like slavery,

1635
01:36:46,340 --> 01:36:49,740
 or we speak out against it, which at least to war,

1636
01:36:49,740 --> 01:36:52,500
 and there's highly frowned upon in the Chinese community,

1637
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:54,860
 which is all about harmony.

1638
01:36:54,860 --> 01:36:57,380
 So how should we juggle this balancing act,

1639
01:36:57,380 --> 01:37:00,460
 speaking or not speaking, and not to be complicit?

1640
01:37:00,460 --> 01:37:03,860
 So that is the very particular question.

1641
01:37:03,860 --> 01:37:08,620
 And in the more general nature is about how to communicate

1642
01:37:08,620 --> 01:37:12,020
 effectively and in a loving way to those

1643
01:37:12,020 --> 01:37:14,980
 who hold opposite opinions from you.

1644
01:37:14,980 --> 01:37:18,620
 So these are, I think, two very related questions.

1645
01:37:18,620 --> 01:37:20,660
 And can we hear your wisdom on that?

1646
01:37:20,660 --> 01:37:23,620
 - Yes, I'll offer what I have.

1647
01:37:23,620 --> 01:37:26,740
 Whether you consider it wisdom, I'll leave you to decide.

1648
01:37:27,700 --> 01:37:30,540
 Let me say first that what you've just described

1649
01:37:30,540 --> 01:37:34,020
 by that example is precisely what has been going on

1650
01:37:34,020 --> 01:37:35,980
 in the American white evangelical church,

1651
01:37:35,980 --> 01:37:39,620
 where you end up having some members of a church

1652
01:37:39,620 --> 01:37:43,740
 believe that, for example, that America and its government

1653
01:37:43,740 --> 01:37:48,060
 is not in any way an expression of God's will or desire.

1654
01:37:48,060 --> 01:37:51,460
 And in the same congregation, you have people who look

1655
01:37:51,460 --> 01:37:54,260
 at what's going on and say this at last is the best

1656
01:37:54,260 --> 01:37:57,420
 and most supportive government for Christians

1657
01:37:57,420 --> 01:37:59,940
 that the United States has ever had.

1658
01:37:59,940 --> 01:38:03,540
 So how do they share in the same congregational life?

1659
01:38:03,540 --> 01:38:07,940
 So this problem that we're all describing manifests

1660
01:38:07,940 --> 01:38:09,380
 under different issues perhaps,

1661
01:38:09,380 --> 01:38:11,940
 but the dynamic is really the same.

1662
01:38:11,940 --> 01:38:13,780
 So when I think about, first of all,

1663
01:38:13,780 --> 01:38:16,860
 how Jesus responds to this dilemma,

1664
01:38:16,860 --> 01:38:21,260
 he moves toward the stranger, toward the other,

1665
01:38:21,260 --> 01:38:24,660
 and also actually toward the so-called enemy.

1666
01:38:24,660 --> 01:38:28,820
 These are such dramatic examples,

1667
01:38:28,820 --> 01:38:31,460
 but one of them, for example, would be at the end

1668
01:38:31,460 --> 01:38:33,820
 of the Sermon on the Mount, when Jesus says

1669
01:38:33,820 --> 01:38:36,820
 that we build our house on rock or on sand,

1670
01:38:36,820 --> 01:38:39,220
 he's clearly saying that we build our house on rock

1671
01:38:39,220 --> 01:38:43,140
 by actually doing the truth, not by just affirming it

1672
01:38:43,140 --> 01:38:44,500
 or confessing the truth.

1673
01:38:44,500 --> 01:38:45,900
 We live the truth.

1674
01:38:45,900 --> 01:38:48,140
 That's how we build our house on rock.

1675
01:38:48,140 --> 01:38:50,100
 And what's interesting is that right after that,

1676
01:38:50,100 --> 01:38:54,420
 he encounters a person with epilepsy.

1677
01:38:54,420 --> 01:38:58,660
 Sorry, not with, yes, with epilepsy.

1678
01:38:58,660 --> 01:39:02,980
 No, sorry, excuse me, with leprosy, excuse me.

1679
01:39:02,980 --> 01:39:09,940
 And in that moment, he's invited to heal the person,

1680
01:39:09,940 --> 01:39:12,620
 and Jesus moves toward this person

1681
01:39:12,620 --> 01:39:16,260
 that was considered unclean, touches them, and heals them.

1682
01:39:16,260 --> 01:39:19,740
 And then if that's not enough of a shock,

1683
01:39:19,740 --> 01:39:24,420
 then the very next part of this is that a Roman centurion

1684
01:39:24,420 --> 01:39:29,420
 comes toward Jesus and says that a servant of his

1685
01:39:29,420 --> 01:39:31,940
 is in great need, could Jesus come and heal him?

1686
01:39:31,940 --> 01:39:34,540
 And Jesus says he's happily willing to do so,

1687
01:39:34,540 --> 01:39:37,620
 and the man says, "No, no, you don't need to come and do so

1688
01:39:37,620 --> 01:39:41,140
 "because you just say the word and it will be done."

1689
01:39:41,140 --> 01:39:45,180
 And then he pauses everyone around and said,

1690
01:39:45,180 --> 01:39:47,940
 "Did you just hear what this man said?

1691
01:39:47,940 --> 01:39:50,380
 "I have not heard," these are the critical words,

1692
01:39:50,380 --> 01:39:55,380
 "I've not heard faithfulness like this in all of Israel.

1693
01:39:55,380 --> 01:39:58,540
 "There are some people outside the kingdom of God

1694
01:39:58,540 --> 01:40:02,620
 "who will be in, and some who you presume to be in

1695
01:40:02,620 --> 01:40:04,700
 "who will be on the outside."

1696
01:40:04,700 --> 01:40:06,940
 Now, I share those stories because for me,

1697
01:40:06,940 --> 01:40:09,860
 they are examples of at least some of the things

1698
01:40:09,860 --> 01:40:12,460
 to consider in answering the question.

1699
01:40:12,460 --> 01:40:14,900
 I want to first of all move toward people

1700
01:40:14,900 --> 01:40:18,540
 that I might consider to be uncomfortable.

1701
01:40:18,540 --> 01:40:21,220
 They might not be, quote, "unclean,"

1702
01:40:21,220 --> 01:40:24,500
 but they're not like me or they are not easy

1703
01:40:24,500 --> 01:40:28,160
 for me to be with, or they are a problem,

1704
01:40:28,160 --> 01:40:30,200
 in quotes, in some way or another.

1705
01:40:30,200 --> 01:40:32,460
 And Jesus gives an example in this case

1706
01:40:32,460 --> 01:40:34,940
 and in so many other cases as we know

1707
01:40:34,940 --> 01:40:36,780
 about what it means to move toward people

1708
01:40:36,780 --> 01:40:41,780
 who are difficult, marginalized, awkward, needy,

1709
01:40:43,340 --> 01:40:44,860
 potentially unclean.

1710
01:40:44,860 --> 01:40:47,660
 I think there's a lot of tendency

1711
01:40:47,660 --> 01:40:49,940
 in contemporary culture around the world

1712
01:40:49,940 --> 01:40:52,100
 to label people clean and unclean,

1713
01:40:52,100 --> 01:40:56,780
 to be mindful that some are should be included

1714
01:40:56,780 --> 01:40:59,940
 and others don't deserve to be included.

1715
01:40:59,940 --> 01:41:02,040
 What's amazing about these texts

1716
01:41:02,040 --> 01:41:06,120
 in the early part of chapter eight of Matthew's gospel

1717
01:41:06,120 --> 01:41:11,120
 is that Jesus moves toward the man with leprosy,

1718
01:41:11,620 --> 01:41:16,620
 touches him, calls him a name of attachment,

1719
01:41:16,620 --> 01:41:24,140
 heals him, and does this completely counter

1720
01:41:24,140 --> 01:41:28,180
 to the pressure of the moment, the social pressure.

1721
01:41:28,180 --> 01:41:31,940
 But then more radically, when the centurion appears,

1722
01:41:31,940 --> 01:41:35,000
 the representative of dominating Roman authority,

1723
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:39,560
 he receives the man's witness, hears it for what it is,

1724
01:41:40,680 --> 01:41:43,060
 acknowledges it and lifts it up,

1725
01:41:43,060 --> 01:41:47,620
 and then goes forward to actually heal the man's servant.

1726
01:41:47,620 --> 01:41:50,940
 Now, in both cases, I think we learn lessons

1727
01:41:50,940 --> 01:41:53,120
 about what it means to try to live together

1728
01:41:53,120 --> 01:41:53,960
 in a different way.

1729
01:41:53,960 --> 01:41:57,500
 In the first case, how do I learn to lean toward people

1730
01:41:57,500 --> 01:42:02,380
 that I might marginalize because of different opinions

1731
01:42:02,380 --> 01:42:06,020
 in churches over these very issues that you've just raised?

1732
01:42:06,020 --> 01:42:09,220
 That has to take practice to develop that ability.

1733
01:42:09,220 --> 01:42:14,080
 And I think often churches have small groups that meet

1734
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:15,760
 or prayer groups that meet.

1735
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:17,460
 Our ability to pray for one another,

1736
01:42:17,460 --> 01:42:19,660
 to grow in our capacity to love people

1737
01:42:19,660 --> 01:42:24,320
 inside the body of Christ is one of the kinds of prayers

1738
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:26,420
 and the sort of work that we need

1739
01:42:26,420 --> 01:42:28,720
 to hold one another accountable to doing,

1740
01:42:28,720 --> 01:42:32,680
 not just becoming our own little small tribe within a tribe,

1741
01:42:32,680 --> 01:42:35,400
 but to actually learn to love one another,

1742
01:42:35,400 --> 01:42:38,200
 to see each other, to value each other,

1743
01:42:38,200 --> 01:42:40,840
 to honor in whatever way we can.

1744
01:42:40,840 --> 01:42:45,480
 And then the gold standard of Jesus

1745
01:42:45,480 --> 01:42:48,960
 is not whether we love those who love us,

1746
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:51,280
 but whether we love those who don't love us

1747
01:42:51,280 --> 01:42:55,120
 or don't like us and who may even be our enemies.

1748
01:42:55,120 --> 01:42:58,880
 How do we also learn to practice loving people like that?

1749
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:03,680
 And I think that happens in that case in Matthew 8,

1750
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:05,360
 it happens first of all by Jesus

1751
01:43:05,360 --> 01:43:09,480
 just very carefully listening to what the man said.

1752
01:43:09,480 --> 01:43:12,040
 The most amazing part of that text

1753
01:43:12,040 --> 01:43:16,360
 is the way that Jesus hears his actual declaration of faith

1754
01:43:16,360 --> 01:43:19,360
 and then focuses on that,

1755
01:43:19,360 --> 01:43:23,320
 letting it fully be absorbed into his own heart and mind,

1756
01:43:23,320 --> 01:43:28,320
 and then responds back to that affirmingly.

1757
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:30,960
 That is deep and profound faith,

1758
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:33,840
 unlike anything I've heard in all of Israel.

1759
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:36,720
 Well, that was scandalous, of course, to Jews.

1760
01:43:36,720 --> 01:43:39,480
 It was crazy to think that Jesus would do that.

1761
01:43:39,480 --> 01:43:42,680
 And yet Jesus listened very carefully

1762
01:43:42,680 --> 01:43:44,400
 and affirmed what he could affirm.

1763
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:49,280
 Now, I think often in divided churches,

1764
01:43:49,280 --> 01:43:52,200
 like the ones that we're talking about tonight,

1765
01:43:52,200 --> 01:43:55,280
 we have to learn to really listen much more carefully.

1766
01:43:55,280 --> 01:43:59,340
 And often, not always, but often within the differences

1767
01:43:59,340 --> 01:44:02,320
 is a failure of really hearing the other person,

1768
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:04,600
 really understanding why they're motivated,

1769
01:44:04,600 --> 01:44:07,880
 what it is that drives them, what their fears are,

1770
01:44:07,880 --> 01:44:10,400
 what controls their anxiety.

1771
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:13,120
 Why are some people so insistent on holding on

1772
01:44:13,120 --> 01:44:15,000
 to certain forms of authority?

1773
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:19,440
 And why do other people find it necessary,

1774
01:44:19,440 --> 01:44:21,480
 almost required for them

1775
01:44:21,480 --> 01:44:23,680
 to reject certain kinds of authority?

1776
01:44:23,680 --> 01:44:27,080
 Those are conversations that ultimately

1777
01:44:27,080 --> 01:44:29,000
 the body of Christ has to have,

1778
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:32,640
 but we have to first be able to simply carry it out

1779
01:44:32,640 --> 01:44:34,880
 in a very respectful, mutual way.

1780
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:37,640
 And that's gonna require that our hearts be remade.

1781
01:44:37,640 --> 01:44:40,000
 It's going to require, in Paul's language,

1782
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,540
 that we be transformed by the renewing of our minds,

1783
01:44:42,540 --> 01:44:44,920
 that we have the heart of Christ

1784
01:44:44,920 --> 01:44:47,960
 and that we do not regard equality with God,

1785
01:44:47,960 --> 01:44:52,080
 that is taking our own prerogative and views as first order,

1786
01:44:52,080 --> 01:44:56,360
 but actually lay them down for the sake of loving

1787
01:44:56,360 --> 01:44:59,400
 and in some bizarre way,

1788
01:44:59,400 --> 01:45:02,840
 identifying with the person that we most disagree with.

1789
01:45:02,840 --> 01:45:06,460
 Those are just some small initial thoughts,

1790
01:45:06,460 --> 01:45:09,020
 but I think it's in that kind of direction

1791
01:45:09,020 --> 01:45:11,520
 that some of this work can be sustained.

1792
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:13,080
 But as a pastor, we have to decide,

1793
01:45:13,080 --> 01:45:15,760
 and I was a pastor for 35 years

1794
01:45:15,760 --> 01:45:19,400
 before I became involved in formal theological education

1795
01:45:19,400 --> 01:45:20,580
 as I am now.

1796
01:45:20,580 --> 01:45:25,440
 And I was very, very aware every day as a pastor

1797
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:28,840
 that it was about restoring community and communion.

1798
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:30,880
 The word communion for me

1799
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:33,840
 is one of the most valuable Christian words

1800
01:45:33,840 --> 01:45:35,680
 in the whole Christian vocabulary.

1801
01:45:35,680 --> 01:45:38,340
 And it's through that lens,

1802
01:45:38,340 --> 01:45:40,280
 communion with God, communion with one another,

1803
01:45:40,280 --> 01:45:44,800
 communion across the economic, social, political divides,

1804
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:49,120
 that communion in Christ is meant to give us

1805
01:45:49,120 --> 01:45:54,120
 our ground on which to stand and build our lives.

1806
01:45:54,600 --> 01:45:58,160
 >> I think I do have something to add along this line

1807
01:45:58,160 --> 01:46:03,160
 from my experience with the mainline churches,

1808
01:46:03,160 --> 01:46:07,640
 because it's divided into the institutional

1809
01:46:07,640 --> 01:46:10,360
 and non-institutional churches.

1810
01:46:10,360 --> 01:46:11,200
 >> Yes.

1811
01:46:11,200 --> 01:46:15,240
 >> And I'm finding that this one major attitude

1812
01:46:15,240 --> 01:46:18,080
 that we need to have is to be humble

1813
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:21,320
 and to know that in spite of all my conviction

1814
01:46:21,320 --> 01:46:25,560
 and understanding of truth, I don't have all the truth,

1815
01:46:25,560 --> 01:46:28,520
 that God is bigger and higher.

1816
01:46:28,520 --> 01:46:29,840
 >> Yes, yes.

1817
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:34,840
 >> And I mean, if I know I have certain conviction

1818
01:46:34,840 --> 01:46:40,360
 that I'm following the right way in my choice,

1819
01:46:40,360 --> 01:46:44,560
 either it's institutional or non-institutional,

1820
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:48,200
 but it's okay because I see the other party,

1821
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:51,440
 the other churches as brothers and sisters

1822
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:53,600
 and not as satanic work.

1823
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:54,440
 >> Right, yes.

1824
01:46:54,440 --> 01:46:56,840
 >> So this is important.

1825
01:46:56,840 --> 01:47:01,840
 And another way, another solution is for me

1826
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:05,640
 to be engaged together in some joint projects.

1827
01:47:05,640 --> 01:47:09,280
 Usually I find that some social projects is good,

1828
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:13,880
 like some community work projects like that,

1829
01:47:14,160 --> 01:47:18,720
 together with people from different groups

1830
01:47:18,720 --> 01:47:22,080
 and denominations, they don't have denominations,

1831
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:26,280
 but institutions, outside institutions.

1832
01:47:26,280 --> 01:47:29,400
 And if we work together, through living together,

1833
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:31,560
 we come to appreciate what they have

1834
01:47:31,560 --> 01:47:33,800
 and what I don't have, okay?

1835
01:47:33,800 --> 01:47:34,640
 >> Right.

1836
01:47:34,640 --> 01:47:37,160
 >> And then by communing together,

1837
01:47:37,160 --> 01:47:41,160
 I think this is a way for us to soften our divide.

1838
01:47:41,160 --> 01:47:42,000
 >> Yes.

1839
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,080
 >> And then I have to acknowledge that

1840
01:47:44,080 --> 01:47:45,560
 the divide is always there.

1841
01:47:45,560 --> 01:47:48,240
 I mean, I have no way to sort of--

1842
01:47:48,240 --> 01:47:49,720
 >> Right.

1843
01:47:49,720 --> 01:47:50,560
 You can't pretend.

1844
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:55,520
 >> Yeah, I can't, I can't dissolve that, okay?

1845
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:59,040
 But I can, to a certain extent,

1846
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:04,040
 hold one another's arms and then we say

1847
01:48:04,040 --> 01:48:05,480
 that we can work together.

1848
01:48:05,480 --> 01:48:10,480
 And I always tell my friends that our enemies are outside,

1849
01:48:10,760 --> 01:48:12,160
 not inside this circle.

1850
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:14,000
 >> Yes, right, thank you.

1851
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,920
 >> So even though you mentioned,

1852
01:48:16,920 --> 01:48:20,400
 it's only your small initial thoughts,

1853
01:48:20,400 --> 01:48:23,400
 it takes a heart which is big

1854
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:27,360
 and that can generate a large amount of courage

1855
01:48:27,360 --> 01:48:30,880
 and also so as to overcome a barrier

1856
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:33,160
 which is as high as a mountain, actually.

1857
01:48:33,160 --> 01:48:35,040
 >> Right, right, that's the stuff.

1858
01:48:35,040 --> 01:48:38,520
 >> But we really appreciate that.

1859
01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:43,160
 And well, actually, this related,

1860
01:48:43,160 --> 01:48:46,800
 but not that political or maybe political,

1861
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:50,000
 sexuality has become a political issue as well.

1862
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,960
 So one of our faculty members raised this question.

1863
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:57,160
 Suppose, so you are talking to

1864
01:48:57,160 --> 01:48:59,280
 the conservative white Christians

1865
01:48:59,280 --> 01:49:03,240
 who feel threatened by the LGBTQ movement,

1866
01:49:03,240 --> 01:49:04,440
 who feel that they are losing

1867
01:49:04,440 --> 01:49:06,680
 their once dominant social influence.

1868
01:49:06,680 --> 01:49:09,600
 So how would you encourage them to change?

1869
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:14,480
 >> Well, I think it's along the very same lines

1870
01:49:14,480 --> 01:49:15,680
 that we were just discussing.

1871
01:49:15,680 --> 01:49:18,200
 I think it has to do with beginning first,

1872
01:49:18,200 --> 01:49:20,560
 not with theological assessments,

1873
01:49:20,560 --> 01:49:25,560
 but with interpersonal relationship building,

1874
01:49:25,560 --> 01:49:30,200
 letting people actually tell you their story.

1875
01:49:30,200 --> 01:49:33,000
 Often I find in settings like that,

1876
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
 this is less and less true by the way,

1877
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:36,720
 but it has been true,

1878
01:49:36,720 --> 01:49:38,960
 that people didn't believe that they knew anyone

1879
01:49:38,960 --> 01:49:41,760
 who was LGBTQIA.

1880
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:46,880
 They didn't have any idea where those people were,

1881
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:48,160
 but they were not in their life.

1882
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:50,760
 Well, it turns out, as more and more people

1883
01:49:50,760 --> 01:49:54,200
 have been willing to explain and declare who they are

1884
01:49:54,200 --> 01:49:57,600
 and how they approach the world,

1885
01:49:57,600 --> 01:50:00,240
 they are discovering that their children,

1886
01:50:00,240 --> 01:50:02,800
 their grandchildren, their neighbors,

1887
01:50:02,800 --> 01:50:07,800
 their friends, their colleagues may either be LGBTQ

1888
01:50:07,800 --> 01:50:12,640
 or they may be related to people who are.

1889
01:50:12,640 --> 01:50:14,960
 And when that occurs,

1890
01:50:14,960 --> 01:50:18,440
 it's a privilege to actually welcome the knowledge

1891
01:50:18,440 --> 01:50:22,080
 of who someone actually understands themselves to be.

1892
01:50:22,080 --> 01:50:26,600
 So even though I maintain myself a traditional view

1893
01:50:26,600 --> 01:50:30,720
 of the theological and moral understandings

1894
01:50:30,720 --> 01:50:35,120
 of human sexuality that have been classic in Christianity,

1895
01:50:35,120 --> 01:50:39,920
 I don't do so as a wall against LGBT people

1896
01:50:39,920 --> 01:50:43,440
 or as a battering ram to defeat them.

1897
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:44,920
 I want to hear them.

1898
01:50:44,920 --> 01:50:46,120
 I want to know them.

1899
01:50:46,120 --> 01:50:47,440
 I want to love them.

1900
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:51,080
 I want to invite them into communion with me

1901
01:50:51,080 --> 01:50:52,280
 and with other people.

1902
01:50:52,280 --> 01:50:54,520
 I want them to not be isolated.

1903
01:50:54,520 --> 01:50:57,480
 I want them to not be self-loathing.

1904
01:50:57,480 --> 01:51:00,680
 I want them to feel as much welcome

1905
01:51:00,680 --> 01:51:03,760
 as I can extend to them.

1906
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:08,760
 And so I would encourage such a community, for example,

1907
01:51:08,760 --> 01:51:11,920
 to think carefully about who they really know

1908
01:51:11,920 --> 01:51:14,680
 and how they are going to love people.

1909
01:51:14,680 --> 01:51:17,520
 And I think every pastor has to work out

1910
01:51:17,520 --> 01:51:19,080
 in their own particular setting

1911
01:51:19,080 --> 01:51:22,880
 how they're going to help people

1912
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:27,160
 do this kind of self-formational work.

1913
01:51:27,160 --> 01:51:28,560
 But it really has to begin

1914
01:51:28,560 --> 01:51:30,600
 by the same things we've just talked about,

1915
01:51:30,600 --> 01:51:33,600
 laying down power, laying down certainty,

1916
01:51:33,600 --> 01:51:35,280
 laying down self-righteousness,

1917
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:38,040
 not righteousness, but self-righteousness,

1918
01:51:38,040 --> 01:51:42,720
 laying down a presumption of a theological exam

1919
01:51:42,720 --> 01:51:44,920
 at the very beginning or a moral exam

1920
01:51:44,920 --> 01:51:46,960
 at the beginning of every relationship,

1921
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:49,320
 which is not the way that any of us, in fact,

1922
01:51:49,320 --> 01:51:53,720
 actually live, nor would we want to live that way.

1923
01:51:53,720 --> 01:51:55,160
 So we want to know one another.

1924
01:51:55,160 --> 01:51:57,360
 We want to love one another.

1925
01:51:57,360 --> 01:51:59,200
 And there may be differences, of course.

1926
01:51:59,200 --> 01:52:02,040
 There are differences in how we see the world

1927
01:52:02,040 --> 01:52:04,200
 and relate to one another.

1928
01:52:04,200 --> 01:52:08,360
 But I want to start with, as Dr. Chan said,

1929
01:52:08,360 --> 01:52:11,000
 I want to start with an attitude of humility

1930
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:12,640
 and of deference.

1931
01:52:12,640 --> 01:52:14,800
 I want to listen very, very carefully.

1932
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:17,080
 I want to hear their story.

1933
01:52:17,080 --> 01:52:20,200
 I want to understand and empathize

1934
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:23,960
 with the way that their story has unfolded.

1935
01:52:23,960 --> 01:52:26,160
 Now, I believe that all of our stories

1936
01:52:26,160 --> 01:52:29,400
 are held by a larger story that's God's story.

1937
01:52:29,400 --> 01:52:34,240
 So eventually, in some way, verbal and nonverbal both,

1938
01:52:34,240 --> 01:52:39,480
 I want to help people who are LGBTQ2,

1939
01:52:39,480 --> 01:52:42,560
 if they don't already,

1940
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:44,200
 understand how to hold their story

1941
01:52:44,200 --> 01:52:47,440
 in light of the greater story of God.

1942
01:52:47,440 --> 01:52:49,480
 That's a longer and more theological question,

1943
01:52:49,480 --> 01:52:51,320
 but on the pastoral level,

1944
01:52:51,320 --> 01:52:53,520
 I think it has to do with inviting people

1945
01:52:53,520 --> 01:52:57,160
 into honesty, into their own vulnerability,

1946
01:52:57,160 --> 01:53:00,200
 into their places of pain and shame,

1947
01:53:00,200 --> 01:53:02,960
 and say, "Can you imagine what it's like

1948
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:07,000
 to live in a community in which those realities

1949
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
 are reinforced by the church?"

1950
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,360
 People feel worse about themselves.

1951
01:53:11,360 --> 01:53:14,520
 People feel more marginalized about themselves

1952
01:53:14,520 --> 01:53:18,160
 by the way the church has related to LGBT people.

1953
01:53:18,160 --> 01:53:21,400
 And frequently, the church has been a failure

1954
01:53:21,400 --> 01:53:24,160
 in loving people who don't live up

1955
01:53:24,160 --> 01:53:29,400
 to what we believe are biblical standards, perhaps.

1956
01:53:29,400 --> 01:53:31,240
 -I'm deeply struck by your comment

1957
01:53:31,240 --> 01:53:35,720
 that it is a matter about loving and respecting your neighbors

1958
01:53:35,720 --> 01:53:38,880
 as creating an image of God.

1959
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:41,720
 It's not about warring or battling

1960
01:53:41,720 --> 01:53:45,280
 for theological or ideological correctness.

1961
01:53:45,280 --> 01:53:49,320
 So this is a very important thing to remember, actually.

1962
01:53:49,320 --> 01:53:52,360
 And maybe another question,

1963
01:53:52,360 --> 01:53:56,080
 or perhaps that will be the one last question.

1964
01:53:56,080 --> 01:53:58,240
 Dr. Levitin, you talked about the influence

1965
01:53:58,240 --> 01:54:01,040
 from the media in the 1990s.

1966
01:54:01,040 --> 01:54:04,560
 So could you comment on the impacts on the social media

1967
01:54:04,560 --> 01:54:07,720
 in white evangelicals?

1968
01:54:07,720 --> 01:54:10,920
 -Yes. Well, it's, of course, a problem,

1969
01:54:10,920 --> 01:54:13,680
 as I would say it, at least all around the world,

1970
01:54:13,680 --> 01:54:17,600
 or at least in places where social media dominance

1971
01:54:17,600 --> 01:54:20,840
 controls things, as social media does dominate things

1972
01:54:20,840 --> 01:54:22,440
 in the United States.

1973
01:54:22,440 --> 01:54:25,120
 So you have public media of various kinds,

1974
01:54:25,120 --> 01:54:26,920
 but then you have just the social media

1975
01:54:26,920 --> 01:54:30,640
 and all the networks and communication of messages,

1976
01:54:30,640 --> 01:54:33,480
 which can be used as battering rams.

1977
01:54:33,480 --> 01:54:36,320
 And this is why it has been such a big deal

1978
01:54:36,320 --> 01:54:38,920
 in the last few days,

1979
01:54:38,920 --> 01:54:42,880
 since Twitter no longer allowed President Trump

1980
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:48,040
 to be able to post his declarations of various kinds,

1981
01:54:48,040 --> 01:54:51,760
 as you've probably pleasantly experienced

1982
01:54:51,760 --> 01:54:53,360
 or seen or heard about.

1983
01:54:53,360 --> 01:54:57,000
 And he has a following on Twitter

1984
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,480
 of something like 84 million people.

1985
01:54:59,480 --> 01:55:06,280
 So he would typically tweet,

1986
01:55:06,280 --> 01:55:08,560
 you know, usually several dozen messages

1987
01:55:08,560 --> 01:55:12,880
 over the course of a day, to 84 million people.

1988
01:55:12,880 --> 01:55:15,520
 So let's just imagine he was the only person

1989
01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:18,320
 that was engaging in social media.

1990
01:55:18,320 --> 01:55:19,640
 It would be a dominant voice.

1991
01:55:19,640 --> 01:55:21,800
 But because of how it's picked up and distributed

1992
01:55:21,800 --> 01:55:25,080
 and spread throughout network upon network

1993
01:55:25,080 --> 01:55:28,880
 upon network upon network, it just pervades our lives.

1994
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:32,880
 And it is one of the major, I would say,

1995
01:55:32,880 --> 01:55:37,080
 toxicities that now influences the life of the church,

1996
01:55:37,080 --> 01:55:44,320
 which can't possibly compete with the overwhelming amount

1997
01:55:44,320 --> 01:55:46,560
 of social media presence and power

1998
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:48,400
 that's influencing people's lives.

1999
01:55:48,400 --> 01:55:50,520
 We used to say it was television.

2000
01:55:50,520 --> 01:55:52,560
 It's less television, of course, now.

2001
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:54,680
 And it's really the Internet

2002
01:55:54,680 --> 01:55:57,120
 and it's really social media in particular.

2003
01:55:57,120 --> 01:56:00,600
 And that makes Christian discipleship that much harder.

2004
01:56:00,600 --> 01:56:05,160
 So, yeah, I think it's an example of the fact

2005
01:56:05,160 --> 01:56:08,160
 that the American church has come to be dominated

2006
01:56:08,160 --> 01:56:10,360
 more by social media voices

2007
01:56:10,360 --> 01:56:15,680
 than by the faithful word of God preached on Sunday,

2008
01:56:15,680 --> 01:56:17,240
 encouraged in home,

2009
01:56:17,240 --> 01:56:19,560
 nurtured by individual discipleship,

2010
01:56:19,560 --> 01:56:21,440
 shared in small groups, right?

2011
01:56:21,440 --> 01:56:23,560
 These are things that can't compete

2012
01:56:23,560 --> 01:56:27,240
 against the ocean of social media.

2013
01:56:27,240 --> 01:56:28,960
 So I think it's a huge challenge

2014
01:56:28,960 --> 01:56:32,920
 and an example of the white evangelical church's willingness

2015
01:56:32,920 --> 01:56:36,400
 to just give that ground and to believe that all of that

2016
01:56:36,400 --> 01:56:39,680
 is one thing and then the church

2017
01:56:39,680 --> 01:56:43,800
 and its pleasant message is on another.

2018
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:45,480
 And the two don't meet,

2019
01:56:45,480 --> 01:56:48,840
 and the radical Jesus of transformation

2020
01:56:48,840 --> 01:56:51,040
 and redemption is lost.

2021
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:56,680
 - I hope today we are redeeming the social media

2022
01:56:56,680 --> 01:57:00,600
 by broadcasting something of positive value.

2023
01:57:00,600 --> 01:57:05,360
 And also, yeah, we hope that all those

2024
01:57:05,360 --> 01:57:09,000
 who are listening to Dr. Leperton's

2025
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:13,560
 and our two response speakers' speeches will be enlightened.

2026
01:57:13,560 --> 01:57:16,720
 And we wholeheartedly look forward

2027
01:57:16,720 --> 01:57:18,520
 to the coming three lectures,

2028
01:57:18,520 --> 01:57:22,240
 which Dr. Leperton will be giving in the coming three days.

2029
01:57:22,240 --> 01:57:25,560
 And once again, a big round of applause

2030
01:57:25,560 --> 01:57:27,160
 for our three speakers today.

2031
01:57:27,160 --> 01:57:29,560
 - Thank you.

2032
01:57:30,320 --> 01:57:32,560
 (audience applauding)

2033
01:57:32,560 --> 01:57:34,040
 - And today- - Can I say one thing?

2034
01:57:34,040 --> 01:57:35,320
 - Yes, yeah, sure.

2035
01:57:35,320 --> 01:57:39,000
 - The difficulty of speaking on this subject

2036
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:42,840
 is that I arrive in your presence with this terrible news.

2037
01:57:42,840 --> 01:57:47,840
 It feels like I've arrived with a very dark cloud.

2038
01:57:47,840 --> 01:57:51,280
 And I just wanna assure you,

2039
01:57:51,280 --> 01:57:53,560
 A, that that's not all that I think about,

2040
01:57:53,560 --> 01:57:56,160
 but B, there's all kinds of reasons

2041
01:57:56,160 --> 01:57:57,720
 for celebration and gladness

2042
01:57:57,720 --> 01:57:59,520
 in both the life of the church,

2043
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:02,400
 including even the white evangelical church.

2044
01:58:02,400 --> 01:58:05,080
 But there are, this is a critical moment.

2045
01:58:05,080 --> 01:58:07,160
 I can't overstate that.

2046
01:58:07,160 --> 01:58:08,760
 And I am grateful for the chance

2047
01:58:08,760 --> 01:58:10,480
 to be able to talk with you.

2048
01:58:10,480 --> 01:58:12,360
 But I also want to encourage you,

2049
01:58:12,360 --> 01:58:14,280
 as I wanna encourage myself,

2050
01:58:14,280 --> 01:58:16,640
 to always remember the greater story

2051
01:58:16,640 --> 01:58:20,520
 of God's grace and love and mercy for us,

2052
01:58:20,520 --> 01:58:22,320
 the white evangelical church in America,

2053
01:58:22,320 --> 01:58:24,440
 for the church in Hong Kong and in China,

2054
01:58:24,440 --> 01:58:27,240
 and around the world.

2055
01:58:27,240 --> 01:58:30,600
 And so I feel like I'm giving you

2056
01:58:30,600 --> 01:58:35,120
 a very strange impression by speaking so critically.

2057
01:58:35,120 --> 01:58:37,680
 But because it's such an unusual moment,

2058
01:58:37,680 --> 01:58:41,720
 I am also grateful to be able to speak this honestly,

2059
01:58:41,720 --> 01:58:45,760
 and I hope it can be heard in that way.

2060
01:58:45,760 --> 01:58:47,360
 So thank you again.

2061
01:58:47,360 --> 01:58:49,560
 - Don't worry, Dr. Labusin.

2062
01:58:49,560 --> 01:58:51,200
 You have brought us a dark cloud,

2063
01:58:51,200 --> 01:58:54,960
 but actually we are under a massive thunderstorm,

2064
01:58:54,960 --> 01:58:57,080
 actually, here in Hong Kong as well.

2065
01:58:57,080 --> 01:59:01,080
 So, but I think taking an honest look

2066
01:59:01,080 --> 01:59:03,840
 at what the church and also the faith,

2067
01:59:03,840 --> 01:59:05,720
 our faith responses,

2068
01:59:05,720 --> 01:59:07,480
 actually you have given us hope

2069
01:59:07,480 --> 01:59:11,920
 that the gleam of light, of hope is coming,

2070
01:59:11,920 --> 01:59:14,080
 is on the way, is still always there.

2071
01:59:14,080 --> 01:59:15,480
 Thank you very much again.

2072
01:59:15,480 --> 01:59:17,480
 And thank you for joining us today.

2073
01:59:17,480 --> 01:59:21,720
 Okay, and I will see you, many of you, tomorrow again.

2074
01:59:21,720 --> 01:59:22,560
 Bye-bye.

2075
01:59:22,560 --> 01:59:23,400
 - Thank you.

2076
01:59:23,400 --> 01:59:26,480
 (gentle piano music)

2077
01:59:26,480 --> 01:59:29,560
 (gentle piano music)

2078
01:59:29,560 --> 01:59:32,640
 (gentle piano music)

2079
01:59:32,640 --> 01:59:35,720
 (gentle piano music)

2080
01:59:35,720 --> 01:59:38,800
 (gentle piano music)

2081
01:59:38,800 --> 01:59:41,880
 (gentle piano music)

2082
01:59:41,880 --> 01:59:44,460
 (gentle music)
