00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,000
(國語)

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Ladies and gentlemen,

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,500
Christian brothers and sisters,

4
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,000
warmest greetings in our Lord Jesus Christ to you,

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,500
no matter where you are now geographically located.

6
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,000
Welcome to join us

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
at our China Graduate School of Theology

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Josephine So Culture and Ethics Lecture Week.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
My name is Simon Cheung,

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
your host this morning.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Let me first say a few words about this lecture series.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Instituted in 1985,

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
this biannual lecture series

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
is for commemorating Josephine So,

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
the pioneering Christian thinker and leader

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
here in Hong Kong

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
after her untimely death in 1982.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
In the past,

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
this lecture series has covered

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
a broad swath of topics,

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
ranging from a contemporary reading of

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Augustine's "The City of God"

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
to pressing cultural and ethical issues

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
concerning creation care,

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
marketplace theology,

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
or contextualizing Christian faith

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
in the current Chinese context.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
This year,

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
our lecture series is set to take a look,

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
and I may add,

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
a scrutinizing and critical look

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
into the American white evangelicalism

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
and the crisis it faces today.

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And our distinguished speaker is

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Reverend Dr. Mark Levitin,

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
the President of Fuller Theological Seminary

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
in the U.S.

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Dr. Levitin,

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
it's great to have you here virtually with us.

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Would you like to say hi to our audience here?

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Thank you so much for this invitation.

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Thank you, Dr. Levitin.

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And before we hear your first lecture today,

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
may I first say a few words

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
to introduce you to our general audience?

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Dr. Levitin is a prolific writer,

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
and his work appears in various kinds of platforms,

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
with the Lord Jesus Christ as a center of passion,

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
as Dr. Levitin once expressed in an interview.

50
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
His work is aimed to wake people up

51
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
as to what kind of life and practice

52
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
they are called into by their Savior and by their Lord.

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Just by reading the evocative titles of his books like

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
"The Dangerous Act of Worship"

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
and "The Dangerous Act of Loving Your Neighbor,"

56
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
his readers will immediately get the feel that

57
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
the complacent and insipid understanding of our faith

58
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
falls far short of the true calling

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
to be the followers of Jesus.

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Out of a deep conviction in the practice of genuine dialogue,

61
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Dr. Levitin has been hosting,

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
as the president of FOLA,

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
a forum called "Conversing,"

64
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
in which he will speak with a wide spectrum of leaders,

65
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I quote,

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
on issues at the intersection of theology and culture,

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
end quote.

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
This dialogue is meant,I quote again,

69
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
to evoke both the power of conversation

70
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
and the turbulence of our times,end quote.

71
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So one of his latest additions features his interview

72
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
with a Christian writer and activist

73
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
who champions racial justice

74
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
and seeks to expose the Christian,

75
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
especially white Christians' complicity

76
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
in racism in the U.S.

77
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Today,Dr. Levitin will begin his reflection

78
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
of the issue at hand with the title

79
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
"The Start, the Complicity, the Tsunami and Today,

80
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
the Birth, Original Scene, Development, Growth,

81
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Consumption and Betrayal

82
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
of American White Evangelicalism."

83
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Without further ado,let's welcome Dr. Levitin.

84
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Thank you very, very much.

85
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's a great joy and privilege to be here.

86
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Presently, distinguished faculty, students and guests,

87
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
it's a great honor for me to be participating

88
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
in these lectures in 2021.

89
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
We had, of course, all hoped that the lectures

90
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
would be delivered in person,

91
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
but 2020 and the COVID pandemic

92
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
regrettably made that impossible.

93
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I hope that the Canadian philosopher

94
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Marshall McLuhan is wrong,

95
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
that this medium will not be the message

96
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
and that you will remember far more

97
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
about what I'm trying to say

98
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
than the medium by which I will be saying it.

99
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I bring all of you very warm greetings

100
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
from Fuller Theological Seminary,

101
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
especially from our board of trustees and faculty,

102
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
and pray for you, for the church

103
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
and for the world of which we are a part

104
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
and for which we serve as we do.

105
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Before formally starting,

106
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
let's let first things be first.

107
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
In Romans 8, the Apostle Paul traces

108
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
the pervasive, unfinished and agonizing groans of God,

109
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
the church and creation itself.

110
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
In these lectures, there will be cause for joy,

111
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
but there will also be evidences of groaning,

112
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
reasons for arguing, causes for crying,

113
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
repenting and lamenting.

114
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Yet in the face of all that is wrong and incomplete,

115
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
let us first hear the Apostle Paul's words

116
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
toward the end of that well-known chapter.

117
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
He writes, "What then are we to say to these things?

118
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
If God is for us, who can be against us?

119
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
He who did not spare his own Son

120
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
but gave him up for us all,

121
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
how will he not also with him

122
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
graciously give us all things?

123
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
In all these things,

124
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
we are more than conquerors

125
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
through him who loved us.

126
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
For I am sure that neither death nor life

127
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
nor angels nor rulers,

128
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
nor things present nor things to come,

129
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
nor power nor height nor depth

130
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
nor anything else in all creation

131
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
will be able to separate us

132
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord."

133
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I offer these lectures as those with hope,

134
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
a hope that is gratefully far beyond ourselves

135
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
or these days.

136
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
In the name of the Father and the Son

137
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

138
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Shall we pray together?

139
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Oh God, how thankful we are

140
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
for the privilege and gift of gathering in this way.

141
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
We are in places throughout parts of Asia

142
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
and perhaps around the world,

143
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
aware of your presence and faithfulness,

144
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
which is our only hope,

145
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
the only hope of the Church

146
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
and the only and final hope of the world.

147
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
May our days together this week

148
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
be ones that you will bless,

149
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
that our conversation and my reflections

150
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
will combine in useful ways,

151
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
that our understanding of your will

152
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
and the future to which you call us

153
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
will be clearer and that our faithfulness will grow.

154
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I ask it to your glory in the name of Jesus.

155
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Amen.

156
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
To speak about the crisis

157
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
of American white evangelicalism

158
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
is to speak about a crisis

159
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
within just part of the body of Christ

160
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
and its mission in the world.

161
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
As I hope and know you will see,

162
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I have no difficulty trying to honestly describe

163
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
my understanding of the situation,

164
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
but in doing so,

165
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I want to remind myself and you

166
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
that I am after all talking about

167
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
part of our Lord's beloved bride.

168
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
The journey of God with God's people

169
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
from Abraham to today

170
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
has been endlessly fraught with crises

171
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
and still our ever-loving

172
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
and persisting Good Shepherd

173
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
does not let us go.

174
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I believe in the legitimacy

175
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
and in fact the necessity of self-critique,

176
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
while conscious that that can easily

177
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
and glibly fall prey

178
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
to its own arrogance and presumption.

179
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
So I want genuinely to repent even in advance

180
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
and commit to you that I will try

181
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
to be both candid and loving,

182
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
honest and fair.

183
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
The topic is large enoughand complex enough

184
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
to necessarily state that I'm not addressing

185
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
all dimensions of evangelicalism,of course,

186
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
and certainly not addressing the related

187
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
but very different realities

188
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
of global evangelicalism.

189
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Nor would I pretend to adequately trace

190
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
therefore the impact and importance

191
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
of American white evangelicalism

192
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
on the China Graduate School of Theology

193
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
or the Chinese Church.

194
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Instead,I will offer you my thoughts

195
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
about American white evangelicalism

196
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
and ask during our question and answer sessions

197
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
for your partnership

198
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
as brothers and sisters in Christ,

199
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
with whom the Scriptures call us

200
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
to both rejoice with those who rejoice

201
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
and weep with those who weep.

202
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Your reflections,critiques,

203
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
and perhaps even weeping

204
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
are truly valuable to me,

205
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
and I look forward to hearing

206
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
your voices and perspectives as well.

207
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
We are in one communion in Christ.

208
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Presently,encourage me to deliver lectures

209
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
in a way that would include

210
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
my own personal experience

211
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
and not only to offer them

212
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
through the lens of a merely academic

213
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
set of categories or ideas.

214
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I was grateful for this and pleased

215
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
since it allows me to do in public

216
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
what we all know to be true in private,

217
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
namely that almost all scholarship

218
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
is also narrative or narratival.

219
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
That is,our commitments and interests

220
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
are inevitably oriented by

221
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
and reflective of our own stories.

222
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
A few examples.

223
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I point to Dr.Francis Collins,

224
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
the director in the United States

225
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
of the National Institutes of Health

226
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
in Washington, D.C.,

227
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
and the leader of the Human Genome Project,

228
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
which worked out the first

229
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
complete sequencing of human DNA,

230
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
forever changing the way

231
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
human biological science would proceed

232
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
and affecting the lives of people everywhere.

233
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It was he who said

234
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
that the underlying conviction

235
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
of God's creative and recreative love

236
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
and salvation in Jesus Christ

237
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
is the daily rock on which he seeks

238
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
to do the very best science

239
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
and public health that he can provide.

240
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Dr.Collins can distinguish science from faith,

241
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
but his commitment to science

242
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
and to the evangel

243
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
are together part and parcel

244
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
of one life and one project.

245
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Dr.Martin Luther King,

246
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
the great American civil rights leader,

247
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
was not incidentally black.

248
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It was his blackness

249
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
that informed his experience and his theology

250
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
and also motivated his rhetoric

251
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
and his analysis of the past and present.

252
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
His personal story made him more capable,

253
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
not less,of perceiving reality clearly

254
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
in his study of American racial history.

255
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
His embeddedness in his story

256
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
and in the larger black narrative

257
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
in the United States,

258
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
including his demonstrations

259
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
in some of the great marches

260
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
and movements of the '60s,

261
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
gave him clearer vision, not less.

262
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
In a multiracial nation,

263
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
race is never a neutral factor.

264
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Any claim of neutrality about race in America

265
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
is a warning sign

266
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,000
that misunderstanding is already at hand.

267
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Jesus was not incidentally

268
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
a first-century Jewish man.

269
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
The very character of his divine revelation

270
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
and of the love and healing,

271
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
teaching and sacrifice,

272
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
death and resurrection

273
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
are simultaneously objective

274
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
and subjective realities.

275
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
This is what we affirm about the incarnation,

276
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
the universal particularity of God.

277
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Postmodernism has succeeded

278
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
in driving us to face

279
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
the inescapable particularity of life.

280
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
In the case of Christian faith,

281
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
the particular, however,

282
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
is the lens by which we can see,

283
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
know and encounter the God of the universe.

284
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
This is what we hold dear.

285
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:15,000
This is what we hold together.

286
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Just a moment.

287
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Excuse me.

288
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
All of this is to say

289
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
that when President Lee

290
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
invited me to speak personally

291
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
on the subject of

292
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
American white evangelicalism,

293
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
he was allowing me to express in public

294
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
what otherwise is privately

295
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
and inescapably present.

296
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I am allowing,

297
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I am being allowed through his invitation

298
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
to pixelate the story

299
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
with an acknowledgment of the ways

300
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
my own experience

301
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
has ordered the arrangement

302
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
and colors and shades

303
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
of my telling

304
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
of the American evangelical story.

305
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
On a personal level,

306
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I come to you to this topic

307
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
first and foremost,

308
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
simply as a brother in Christ,

309
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
seeking, as you do,

310
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
to hear and respond

311
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
to what the Holy Spirit

312
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
may want to say to us

313
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
in these sessions together.

314
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
The primary context

315
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
out of which I speak

316
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
is what we hold in common,

317
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
our life in Christ.

318
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
This defining context

319
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
of God's loving redemption

320
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
holds any and all details

321
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
about me,

322
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
my gifts and weaknesses,

323
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
my sins and sorrows,

324
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
my hopes and longings,

325
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
my social location,

326
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
my birth and my new social location

327
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
as part of God's one new humanity.

328
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
The same, of course, is true for you.

329
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
We find our life's principal location

330
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
together in this one new communion,

331
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
made possible and active

332
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
as we are held in the love

333
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
of the Father, Son and Spirit.

334
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
In this common life,

335
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
we also bring our distinct similarities

336
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
and differences.

337
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I am a tall, white,

338
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
educated American

339
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
born and raised

340
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
on the west coast

341
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
of the United States,

342
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
and I am 67 years old.

343
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I've been married

344
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
for nearly 37 years,

345
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
and my wife and I

346
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
have two adult sons.

347
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
My family of origin

348
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
had a low or moderate income

349
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
and lived in

350
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
an agricultural community

351
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
adjacent to a nearby

352
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Native American community

353
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
and in a place known

354
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
as the Yakama Nation,

355
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
a designation of a

356
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Native American tribe,

357
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
namely the Yakamas,

358
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
and in a community

359
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
served by itinerant farm workers

360
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
who traveled each season

361
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
to labor in the agricultural harvest

362
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
around us.

363
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
My life as a white American

364
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
was not their life.

365
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
We lived in proximate, parallel,

366
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
but utterly different worlds.

367
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I grew up in a tight-knit family

368
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
in which my father saw religion

369
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
and religious devotion

370
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
as one of the most dangerous

371
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
influences in the world,

372
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
one that he wanted his two sons

373
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
to avoid if at all possible.

374
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
So my Christian journey

375
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
began as I started college,

376
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
where I became a Christian

377
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
through reading the Gospels.

378
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I simply had an intellectual

379
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
and social curiosity

380
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
about the Bible

381
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
and felt that since I was

382
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
on the road to becoming

383
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I hoped an educated person,

384
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I should read the Bible,

385
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
and I began with

386
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
the Gospel of Matthew.

387
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
My father had committed

388
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
to do all he could

389
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
to keep his two sons from religion

390
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
and especially from religious devotion.

391
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
His argument from history

392
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
and experience

393
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
was that religious people,

394
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
particularly Christian people

395
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
in his assessment,

396
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
by the influence of their faith,

397
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
take great things,

398
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
the universe,

399
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
the mystery of being human,

400
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
and turn them into something

401
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
that's actually very small.

402
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
My father illustrated this

403
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
through the history of science

404
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
and Christianity,

405
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
but also through social

406
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
and political history,

407
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
as well as moral philosophy

408
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
and practice.

409
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
To my great shock,

410
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
what I discovered

411
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
in the New Testament

412
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
was first that Jesus

413
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
shared this same concern

414
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
as my father.

415
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Many of his expressions

416
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
address that very concern,

417
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
and yet Jesus' antidote

418
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
to small-making

419
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
is what he announced

420
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
and displayed to be

421
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
the kingdom of God,

422
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
the reality that cracks

423
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
the whole universe wide open.

424
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
This was the gift

425
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
that I was being offered

426
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
through the New Testament,

427
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
the gift that shocked me

428
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
and ultimately has come

429
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
to change my whole life.

430
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
My life as a disciple

431
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
to this day

432
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
has been constantly shaped

433
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
by the dialogue

434
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
between my father's anxiety

435
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
about Christian faith,

436
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
which I believe

437
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
was accurate and fair,

438
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
and how it has been

439
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
constructively shaped now

440
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
by the dialogue

441
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
between that anxiety

442
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
and the comprehensive

443
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
and personal character

444
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
of God's loving reign

445
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
in Jesus Christ

446
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
by the Holy Spirit

447
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
through one new humanity

448
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
that we call the church

449
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
for the sake of the whole

450
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
created order.

451
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
The first Christians

452
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I came to know were and are

453
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
some of the most positive

454
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
spiritual influences in my life.

455
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
They referred to themselves

456
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
as evangelical,

457
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
and the rest is, well, history.

458
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I stepped into a biblical story

459
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I had not known

460
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
and into a community

461
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
that became home to me.

462
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
My spiritual life and journey

463
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
has been full of God

464
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
and full of a ministry

465
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
of resisting smallness.

466
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Let's go back to the beginning

467
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
and all of these sections

468
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
of this lecture

469
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
will be very, very introductory,

470
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
and I apologize

471
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
if they seem repetitive

472
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
to what you may already know.

473
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
By the 17th and 18th centuries,

474
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
the so-called birth of America

475
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
was already by that time

476
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
long since underway.

477
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Only in the last quarter

478
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
of the 18th century

479
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
would it become

480
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
a formally united project,

481
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
but for two centuries before that,

482
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Europeans and European colonies

483
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
had established

484
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
what became the United States.

485
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Evangelicalism was a spiritual

486
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
and theological renewal movement.

487
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Some would say one

488
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
that emerged from

489
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
the Protestant Reformation

490
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
of the 16th century.

491
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Evangelicalism was both

492
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
a spiritual movement

493
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
and a way of conceiving

494
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
of the Christian life.

495
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
It was by no means then a party,

496
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
let alone an organization

497
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
or an institution.

498
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
It was instead

499
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
a fresh experience or movement

500
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
of the Holy Spirit

501
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
that cut across denominational lines,

502
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
that spoke out into town squares,

503
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
that brought influence

504
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
uncontrolled by formal

505
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Christian structures or histories,

506
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
while declaring and nurturing people

507
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
in what they saw as the first order

508
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
matters of faith.

509
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
By the last quarter

510
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,000
of the 17th century,

511
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
the 18th century,

512
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
when the declaration of independence

513
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
and the War of Independence occurred,

514
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
the colonies were clearly hungry

515
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
for change, expansion, freedom and hope.

516
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
This, along with various

517
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Christian awakenings in Europe

518
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
and in America in the 1730s

519
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
and the 1740s

520
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
by groups such as Anglicans

521
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
and Methodists, Reformed and Puritan,

522
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
meant that institutional religious teaching

523
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
and authority were being modified

524
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
and challenged in various ways.

525
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Together it created a readiness

526
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
for a kind of spiritual awakening

527
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
that was motivated by a readiness

528
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
to receive the spiritual identity

529
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
and life that could freshly ground them

530
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
in this new context, in this new land.

531
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
The great awakenings in Europe

532
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
came to and triumphed in American soil.

533
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
In retrospect,

534
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
a British historian, David Bebbington,

535
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
in his defining work in 1989,

536
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
entitled Evangelicalism in Modern Britain,

537
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
a History of the 1730s to the 1980s,

538
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
set forth that evangelicalism

539
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
was centered on a quadrilateral set of traits,

540
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
that it was Bible-centered,

541
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
that it was cross-centered,

542
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
that it was conversion-expecting

543
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
and that it was activist-oriented.

544
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,000
This movement unfolded with undulations

545
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
that responded to external changes,

546
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
to the presence and practice of slavery,

547
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
for example,

548
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
to the critical study of the scriptures,

549
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
to the anxieties spawned

550
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
during the Enlightenment by science,

551
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
to the realities of world wars,

552
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
to the impact of pandemics,

553
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
to the growing impact of higher education.

554
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
It claimed a spiritual, theological

555
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
and experiential legitimacy

556
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
more than an intellectual,

557
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
denominational or formal identity.

558
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
It was a movement

559
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
more than it was an institution

560
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
or an organization.

561
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
And therefore,

562
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
it was adaptable to the East Coast,

563
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
but it was highly flexible enough

564
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
as the westward expansion

565
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
in the United States occurred.

566
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
In the 1920s,

567
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
the fundamentalist-modernist controversy

568
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
drew and debated lines

569
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
that were the fruit of this long history

570
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
that had already been developed

571
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
over that period of time.

572
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
By the middle of the 20th century,

573
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
when Fuller Theological Seminary

574
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
and many other evangelical organizations

575
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
and institutions were founded,

576
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
evangelicalism had become a word

577
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
that could serve as a pathway

578
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
between two extremes.

579
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
In the case of Fuller Theological Seminary,

580
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
it was a way between fundamentalism

581
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
and a wooden understanding of the Bible

582
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
and its interpretation

583
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
and modernism,

584
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
namely,potentially at least

585
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
an adaptation, if not an abandonment,

586
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
of orthodoxy at times

587
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
for the sake of being "modern."

588
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Evangelicalism, as Fuller saw it,

589
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
was an embrace of Christian orthodoxy

590
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
that was open to more critical study

591
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
of the scriptures

592
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
and more open to engagement

593
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
with realities around us

594
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
in context and in culture

595
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
than was typically true of fundamentalists

596
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
or wholeheartedly true of modernists.

597
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
So evangelicalism quietly and broadly

598
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
remained in this position

599
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
until the late 1970s,

600
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
to which we will comment to the 2000s,

601
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
including the last four years

602
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
in the national and political life

603
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
of the United States.

604
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Please note, again, several things.

605
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
The lack of an institutional

606
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
or organizational center,

607
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
the lack of a defining

608
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
or controlling role

609
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
or set of voices

610
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
for what was in fact

611
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
a diffuse and multiply defined

612
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
and growing movement.

613
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
The claim to knowledge

614
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
that can and must

615
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
define what is true and good

616
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
was clarified by evangelicalism,

617
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
but not with the emphatic certainty

618
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
of fundamentalism.

619
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
It had an orientation

620
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
towards who is in

621
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
and who is out in fundamentalism,

622
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
whereas in growing evangelicalism,

623
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
it was a sense that it was the center

624
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
that was primary

625
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
and not the boundaries.

626
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
We'll return to this as well.

627
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
We turn next to the complicity.

628
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Here is complicity

629
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
in a number of social realities

630
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
which create a major problem

631
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
for evangelicalism in America.

632
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
From the earliest days in North America,

633
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Native American tribes were being displaced

634
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
by formal and informal versions

635
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
of the so-called doctrine of discovery

636
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
in which lands and peoples

637
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
could be claimed under the authority

638
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
of various European countries.

639
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
The majority of this

640
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
was theologically justified

641
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
as part of a sense of the mission of God

642
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
that reigned over all.

643
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
The presumption was

644
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
that this was legitimate legally,

645
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
that it was morally right,

646
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
that it was socially beneficial,

647
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
and that it was, most importantly,

648
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
spiritually redemptive

649
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
for those whose lives

650
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
were now held inside

651
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
and under Christian

652
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
and European authority.

653
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
The Christian church was manifest

654
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
in a European-defined

655
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
and embodied set of terms.

656
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
This meant that there were Roman Catholics

657
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
and various Protestant churches as well,

658
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Anglican and Puritan in particular,

659
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
that were involved in these matters.

660
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
The church in America

661
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
imitated the church in Europe,

662
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
while it also opened the way

663
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
for many who were defining

664
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
religious persecution in Europe

665
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
to be a motivation for immigrants

666
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
to the colonies.

667
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Regional plots along the East Coast

668
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
tagged with different primary European

669
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
and Christian identities.

670
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
From this intertwined connection

671
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
between the doctrine of discovery

672
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
and Native Americans,

673
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
that is, the readiness

674
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
to dominate Native peoples,

675
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
there developed an abominable extension.

676
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
An intertwined connection

677
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
between white Christians

678
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
and African slavery

679
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
was early and well established

680
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
in the United States.

681
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
The doctrine of discovery

682
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
established by the Pope in 1493

683
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
created the legal, political

684
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
and religious claim of land

685
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
and people that were not Christian.

686
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
This plain and historic doctrine

687
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
became the driving theological

688
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
and missiological force

689
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
underpinning colonialism

690
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
and its mutating motives

691
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
and expressions to this very day.

692
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
What was fundamentally

693
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
a political and economic vision initially

694
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
was justified and defended

695
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
even more passionately

696
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
as a theological one,

697
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
trumping and masking

698
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
the political and economic benefits.

699
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
The doctrine of discovery

700
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
provided the theological cover

701
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
and the unlimited possibilities

702
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
for economic expansion

703
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
that were simply too much to resist.

704
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Colonialist condescension

705
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
and rationalization

706
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
looked away from

707
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
and denied the horror

708
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
of the transatlantic slave trade

709
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
and the practice

710
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
that denigrated and dehumanized

711
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
African men, women and children

712
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
by the millions,

713
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
all to satisfy the greed

714
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
of colonial and post-colonial families

715
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
in the name of the gospel.

716
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
The unpaid labor of black Africans

717
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
was the workforce

718
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
that built America.

719
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Christians saw the expansion

720
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
of agricultural and manufacturing capacity

721
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
as it was neutrally called

722
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
as the blessing of God.

723
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
The reports, as you probably know,

724
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
in West Africa,

725
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
where kidnapped Africans

726
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
were imprisoned

727
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
after being taken in horrific conditions

728
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
before rather being taken

729
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
in horrific conditions

730
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
across the Atlantic Ocean,

731
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
the Middle Passage,

732
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
for sale in the Caribbean

733
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
and in the colonies.

734
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
In those ports,

735
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Christian worship happened

736
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
to ask for God's blessing

737
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
in the so-called Middle Passageway.

738
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
One such chapel in Ghana, for example,

739
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
was built across the bridge

740
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
upon which manacled slaves

741
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
would later walk to the place

742
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
where they would be tied and bound

743
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
for the cross-Atlantic trip.

744
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
The chapel above this gangplank

745
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
taking slaves on board the ship

746
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
would be the captors,

747
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
the slave masters,

748
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
the ship's captains and crew

749
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,000
singing hymns still familiar today.

750
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
They would read the scriptures.

751
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
They would pray for safety

752
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
for all the crew

753
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
and for the trip to be successful

754
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
in the eventual sale

755
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
of fellow human beings.

756
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
The church would be the place

757
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
of the servitude

758
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
that would define them

759
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
for the rest of their lives

760
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
and the lives of generations

761
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
and generations of slaves

762
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
and slave families to come.

763
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
All this being done

764
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
in the name of Jesus Christ,

765
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
as they would say,

766
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
the Lord and Savior of the world.

767
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Among the perpetrators

768
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
on both sides of the Atlantic

769
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
were white evangelicals.

770
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
The convergence of the psychological

771
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
and spiritual readiness of colonials

772
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
in relation to this narrative

773
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
of America's original sin

774
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
is hard to trace.

775
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
The ability to claim to love God

776
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
while so obviously hating their neighbors

777
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
was of course not invented

778
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
in the Atlantic slave trade,

779
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
but it was destructively

780
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
and politically practiced

781
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
for over 250 years.

782
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
This practice involved

783
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
the death of 2 million lives

784
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
in the Atlantic crossing,

785
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
the deaths of millions

786
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
en route to their plantations,

787
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
and the sale of 12 to 14 million human lives.

788
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
These are the ones

789
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
who carried out the nation building.

790
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
That was the growing, emerging,

791
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
uniting, and Christian reality

792
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
that became the United States.

793
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
In the Constitution of the United States,

794
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
the phrase "we the people"

795
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,000
meant white, land-owning men.

796
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
We the people

797
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
are the people that are referred to

798
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
in our Constitution,

799
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
not the slaves.

800
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
African slaves were in fact classed

801
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
by our Constitution

802
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
as three-fifths human.

803
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
All this brought the United States

804
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
to war in the mid-19th century,

805
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
and the death of more than 650,000 lives

806
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
during that Civil War period.

807
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
The war divided families and friends

808
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
and congregations and denominations,

809
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
and continues to this very week

810
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
to define and explain

811
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
the American church

812
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
and political rallies and realities.

813
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
The interwovenness for many evangelicals

814
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
of faith and slavery

815
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
now seems like an unbelievable aberration,

816
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
and yet it reveals the ways

817
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
that culture and economics

818
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
speak more loudly

819
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
than our theology and faith,

820
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
and that we are more capable

821
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
than we might imagine

822
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
of wrapping desire with faith

823
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
and calling it God's gift.

824
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
The economic labor engine

825
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
that built the United States

826
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
was unpaid labor,

827
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,000
unpaid labor for 250 years of slavery.

828
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
It was claimed to be God's blessing

829
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
for the owner and God's blessing

830
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
for the uncivilized slave and family

831
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
who, because of having been taken captive

832
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
and now "employed" as a slave,

833
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
giving them the opportunity and privilege

834
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,000
to live in a "Christian nation."

835
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
The cruelty and sin

836
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
that was right in front of them

837
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
was apparently invisible.

838
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,000
In other words, many, by no means all,

839
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
white evangelicals

840
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
were seamlessly in the church community

841
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,000
and fully complicit in 250 years of slavery,

842
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
followed by 100 more years

843
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
of extended slavery and oppression

844
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
into the assumptions of culture,

845
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
economics, and evangelical faith.

846
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Debates continue to this day

847
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
about the cause of the American Civil War

848
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
from 1861 to '65.

849
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
The central matter,

850
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
the main point of concern,

851
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
was, however, slavery.

852
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
In Romans 1, Paul talks about

853
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
our human capacity to hold down

854
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
or to suppress the truth

855
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
in unrighteousness.

856
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
We do this in our own lives.

857
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
And the culture of Christian churches

858
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
and congregations and institutions

859
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
reflects this in various ways.

860
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
But for a very large and focal part

861
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
of white evangelical church in America,

862
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
this habit became deep,

863
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
multigenerationally ingrained.

864
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
And the white evangelical movement

865
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
has at times challenged

866
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,000
and at some times completely conceded

867
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
to this kind of vision.

868
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
There were, of course,

869
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
in the 18th and 19th century,

870
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
white evangelical public leaders

871
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
who spoke and acted loudly

872
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,000
and sustainably against slavery.

873
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
But the lowest baseline

874
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
associated with and defended

875
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
in Christian terms

876
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
was the defense of slavery.

877
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Evangelical complicity

878
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
with slavery,

879
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
with reconstruction

880
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
following the Civil War,

881
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
with imprisoned and indentured labor,

882
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
with Jim Crow,

883
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
with bank control of real estate and money

884
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
erupted in periodic riots and protests.

885
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
As an example,

886
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
100 years ago this very year

887
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
in Tulsa, Oklahoma,

888
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
in the heart of southern America

889
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
and south, southern American

890
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
white evangelicalism,

891
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
the most thriving black community

892
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
in the whole country

893
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
was decimated

894
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
and 300 black lives were slaughtered

895
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
because a black man was alleged

896
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,000
to try and kiss a white Christian woman.

897
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
The most economically thriving black community

898
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
was burned to the ground,

899
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
wiping out an entire community

900
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
who confessed that Jesus Christ is Lord

901
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Only this year will this be fully faced,

902
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,000
lamented and recognized.

903
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
In different but parallel ways,

904
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
this black narrative

905
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
is not only the Native American story,

906
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
but also in the United States,

907
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
the Latin American story

908
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
and the Asian story as well.

909
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
In all these instances

910
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
and many others besides,

911
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
many in the evangelical church,

912
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
confessing Christ

913
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
were also participating,

914
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
supportive or passive

915
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
about these abuses,

916
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
cruelties and injustices.

917
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Being perpetrated by those

918
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
our Bible calls

919
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
are made in the image of God,

920
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
knit together in their mother's womb,

921
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
wounds, wounds,

922
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
fearfully and wonderfully made.

923
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Complicity is too mild a word.

924
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
It showed that many evangelical Christians

925
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
had enslaved themselves

926
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
to the injustice and abuse

927
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
of fellow human beings for centuries.

928
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
People ask,

929
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
where was the church in Nazi Germany?

930
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
The answer is the same place

931
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
that many white evangelical Christians

932
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
in North America have been

933
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
during the past 400 years,

934
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
right here,

935
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:40,000
right in the midst of mainstream culture.

936
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
This needs to be kept in mind,

937
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I might add as a footnote,

938
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
in understanding the events

939
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,000
of the United States in the last week.

940
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
We move next to the tsunami.

941
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
The civil rights movement in America

942
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
was primarily led by

943
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
the black church in America.

944
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
It has evangelical theology and doctrine,

945
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
but did not choose for the most part

946
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
to identify as evangelical

947
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
because they were not white,

948
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
and because the white evangelical narrative

949
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
excluded black and brown people.

950
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
The narrative the black church knew

951
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
was the God who knew

952
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
how to set his people free,

953
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
and that narrative,

954
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
led by exceptional black Christian leaders

955
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
and pastors,

956
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
was the narrative

957
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
to which their civil rights movement

958
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
was committed.

959
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Enormous and positive changes occurred.

960
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
But in symbol and in reality,

961
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
the murder of the Reverend

962
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

963
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
slowed and diverted the narrative,

964
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
along with the sacrifice

965
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
of many others as well.

966
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
For evangelicals,

967
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
King was too liberal,

968
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
and only very gradually,

969
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
as the black Christian critique

970
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
of the white story of America

971
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
became domesticated enough

972
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
to accept Dr. King

973
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
into some white Christian

974
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
evangelical narratives,

975
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
but only some,

976
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
and only relatively recently.

977
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
By the late 1960s,

978
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
the election of Jimmy Carter

979
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
as a "born-again" Christian,

980
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
evangelicalism began to quickly

981
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
step into the public light

982
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
in a different way than before.

983
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
By the 1980s,

984
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
we have the birth of a movement

985
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
called the Moral Majority

986
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
and the rise of various media ministries

987
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
that can propagate arguments of faith

988
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
in continuous feeds of ideas.

989
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Simultaneously,

990
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
cable television news channels

991
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
are developing and growing

992
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
in passive popularity,

993
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
and this development mixes together

994
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
in a thick media presence

995
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
of culture and religion.

996
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
It's all presented as real,

997
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
but what emerges is closer to reality TV,

998
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
that is,

999
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
not so much an expression of Christian faith

1000
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
as much as a combination

1001
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
of entertainment and production.

1002
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Audience ratings

1003
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
are the most important measure of success.

1004
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
This becomes a globally spreading

1005
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
reality and infection.

1006
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
The experience of popular

1007
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
cable religious programs,

1008
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
most of them fundamentalist

1009
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
and Pentecostal,

1010
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
hosted by many different TV evangelists,

1011
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
turned to the political sphere in the '80s

1012
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
and unleashed a tsunami

1013
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
that flooded the religious airwaves.

1014
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
This went on for some time

1015
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
during the '80s and early '90s

1016
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
and increasingly addressed politics,

1017
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
especially related to abortion

1018
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
and sexuality debates

1019
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
and claimed an enormous

1020
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
both American and global audience.

1021
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
In 1996,

1022
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Fox News was established

1023
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
by Robert Murdoch,Rupert Murdoch,

1024
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
and further amplified the voices

1025
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
of popular fundamentalist

1026
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
conservative pastors,

1027
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
TV evangelists,

1028
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
organizations,

1029
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
churches and political groups.

1030
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Along the way,

1031
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
these became known

1032
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
as the evangelicals by the media.

1033
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
It was a title claimed by those

1034
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
that the media amplified

1035
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
and made more culturally acceptable

1036
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
than the tag that had been used

1037
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
as fundamentalist or Pentecostals

1038
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
who were seen more to be

1039
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
at the margins of culture,

1040
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
whereas evangelicals

1041
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
became a more acceptable

1042
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
mainstream term.

1043
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
This was the tsunami

1044
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
that took over the term

1045
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
evangelical in the United States,

1046
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
and it remained so

1047
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
through the late '90s

1048
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
and certainly during the first

1049
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
two decades of the 2000s.

1050
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
This all happened

1051
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
as the growth of megachurches

1052
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
in the United States also expanded

1053
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
from a few hundred

1054
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
to thousands of such congregations.

1055
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
The pervasive

1056
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
lack or minimalization

1057
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
of theological education

1058
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
in most of these movements

1059
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
was quite appalling.

1060
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
It created a large collection

1061
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
of communicators

1062
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
who were not marked

1063
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
by careful thought

1064
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
or by accountability.

1065
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
It became a tribe of its own

1066
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
with its own regard

1067
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
and disregard for boundaries.

1068
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Effect, popularity, emotion

1069
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
all dominated

1070
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
with a popular,

1071
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
unselfcritical frame and attitude.

1072
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Typically, a single personality

1073
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
in the four ways

1074
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,000
dominated the message.

1075
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
All this is too simplistic.

1076
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Two parallel narratives

1077
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
or realities also need to be acknowledged.

1078
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
First, the media prominence

1079
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
of white evangelicalism

1080
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
was similar,

1081
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
but always distinct

1082
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
from the rise and growth

1083
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
and development of the black church.

1084
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Some, if not all,

1085
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
of the same theological markers

1086
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
describe the rise of the black church,

1087
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
but the social associations

1088
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
do not, quite the opposite, in fact.

1089
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
The white evangelical church

1090
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
and the black church

1091
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
were distinct, separate

1092
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
and had very different characteristics.

1093
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
The most important one

1094
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
might be assumed

1095
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
to be integration of faith

1096
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
and context

1097
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
of the love of God

1098
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
and the justice of God

1099
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
in Jesus Christ

1100
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
and the suffering of blacks,

1101
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
including black Christians,

1102
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
who suffered from the brutal racism

1103
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
and the white supremacy

1104
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
and normativity

1105
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
of the American landscape.

1106
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
More on this in our next lecture.

1107
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
The second layer

1108
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
that needs to be acknowledged

1109
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
is a smaller reactive movement

1110
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
of neo-evangelicals

1111
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
who specifically and stridently

1112
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
rejected the sociology, policy

1113
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,000
and politics

1114
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
of conservative, republican, white

1115
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
American evangelicals.

1116
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
This cross-current is essential

1117
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
to understand the state of affairs

1118
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,000
today in the U.S. evangelical landscape.

1119
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
The rabid, condemning response

1120
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
of conservative evangelicals

1121
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
to the HIV/AIDS crisis

1122
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
in the '80s and '90s

1123
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
added another layer of judgmentalism

1124
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
and cultural division and separation,

1125
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
all justified by, quote,

1126
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
the good news of the gospel, unquote.

1127
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
The crisis of today

1128
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
has a long development

1129
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
that precedes it.

1130
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
So finally, today.

1131
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Today, American white evangelicalism

1132
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
is publicly and privately

1133
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
in a shambles and in confusion.

1134
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Publicly and broadly,

1135
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
the identification of evangelicalism

1136
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
with Trumpism

1137
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
and the loss of the 2020 election

1138
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
was a resounding repudiation

1139
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
of American white evangelicalism

1140
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
by the broad American public,

1141
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
not least by African Americans,

1142
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
but also by many whites.

1143
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Many up to this point,

1144
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
evangelicals were silent

1145
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
or deflective of the racial issues

1146
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
and associated with the appointment

1147
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
under Trump of conservative judges

1148
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
at all levels

1149
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
and the dismantling

1150
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
of various social safeguards,

1151
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
the aggressive politics

1152
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
and policies of America First,

1153
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
the anti-immigration and anti-LGBT,

1154
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
anti-abortion, anti-racial justice

1155
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
and anti-science stances

1156
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
that have all been part

1157
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
of the Trump administration.

1158
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
And then the post-election unwillingness

1159
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
since November to acknowledge

1160
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Biden's defeat of Trump.

1161
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Over 73 million Americans

1162
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
who voted for Trump

1163
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
in this last election

1164
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
included still 80%

1165
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,000
white evangelical voters.

1166
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
The summer of 2020

1167
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
before the election

1168
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
will go down as one of the most prominent

1169
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
and provocative seasons

1170
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
of racial demonstrations

1171
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
in the United States to date,

1172
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
triggered most directly

1173
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
by the murder of a string of

1174
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
and a string of murders

1175
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
of unarmed African Americans

1176
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
and especially the killing

1177
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
of George Floyd by white policemen.

1178
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Somewhere between 15 and 25 million people

1179
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
were active in demonstrations

1180
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
over this past summer

1181
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
in cities and towns across the country,

1182
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
people of all races and ages

1183
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
and political affiliations.

1184
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Virtually nothing was said or done

1185
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
by many that the press turned to

1186
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
and called evangelical leaders.

1187
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
The height of offense to evangelicals

1188
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
should have been taken

1189
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
when Trump aggressively dismissed

1190
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
protesters for a photo opportunity

1191
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
in front of a church in Washington, D.C.

1192
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
in order to hold up there

1193
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
an upside-down Bible.

1194
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
But instead, Trump's actions

1195
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
were heralded by prominent

1196
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
white evangelical voices.

1197
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
The political and public rejection

1198
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
of science in response

1199
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
to the coronavirus pandemic

1200
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
added a third layer

1201
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
to the problems of this moment,

1202
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
more fuel yet to the fire

1203
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
that put the voices of political

1204
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
and evangelical forces

1205
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
on the side of being,

1206
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
frankly, reality-denying.

1207
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Denial of racism and white supremacy,

1208
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
denial of the coronavirus

1209
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
and trust in science,

1210
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
denial of the election

1211
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
and its outcome,

1212
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
all has many evangelical supporters

1213
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
in common.

1214
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Typically when these denials

1215
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,000
are offered as an expression

1216
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
of Christian faith,

1217
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
then it appears to the wider

1218
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
American culture

1219
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
and to many Christians

1220
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
and non-Christians

1221
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
inside the United States

1222
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
that it appears that evangelicalism

1223
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
has less and less to do

1224
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
with ordinary reality,

1225
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
the reality that everyone else

1226
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
lives full time.

1227
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
The tradition that has elevated

1228
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
the possibilities of spiritual

1229
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
and theological knowing

1230
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
in Jesus Christ

1231
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
appears to have abandoned

1232
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
the possibility of knowledge.

1233
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
This historic theological

1234
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
and cultural stew

1235
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
is the crisis of American

1236
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
white evangelicalism.

1237
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
For me personally,

1238
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
it is a crushing,

1239
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
maddening and tragic story.

1240
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
But far more importantly,

1241
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
and I hope that I am wrong,

1242
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
this highly public narrative

1243
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
holds every sign

1244
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
of driving a multigenerational

1245
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
decimating disaffection

1246
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
with many people,

1247
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
not least many young adults

1248
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
in the United States.

1249
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
For if this,

1250
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
this that has been demonstrated

1251
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
in the last four years

1252
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
and in the last months

1253
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
and in the last weeks,

1254
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
if this is the fruit

1255
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
of white American evangelicalism,

1256
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
how could it ever be claimed

1257
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
that its gospel

1258
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
could be received as good news?

1259
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
So in light of all of that,

1260
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
what is the hope?

1261
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Jesus said,

1262
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
"I am the way,

1263
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
the truth and the light."

1264
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
This is the word

1265
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
that defines and holds

1266
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
all other words.

1267
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
This is the plum line,

1268
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
the true vine,

1269
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
the rock that is our origin,

1270
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
our redeemer and our sustainer.

1271
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Behold,

1272
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
all things are being made new,

1273
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
the apostle says,

1274
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
even white evangelicalism

1275
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
that promotes that hope for others,

1276
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
that hope for others

1277
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
when it is a time

1278
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
when we who are white evangelicals

1279
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
in America

1280
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
need it more than ever.

1281
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
On many levels,

1282
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
the white American evangelical population

1283
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
does not want to live out

1284
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
its theological identity

1285
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
as much as it wants to justify

1286
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
its social and racial identity.

1287
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
And more on this

1288
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
in the next lecture.

1289
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
There is no joy in sharing

1290
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
what I have said in this lecture.

1291
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
The story could be told

1292
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,000
in the positive light

1293
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
of God's true and faithful bounty.

1294
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
In truth,

1295
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
it is a both/and story.

1296
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
God is faithful

1297
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
to white American evangelical church

1298
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
and the white American evangelical church

1299
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,000
is a deep and painful crisis.

1300
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
In this lecture,

1301
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
I have tried to show the scope of the problem.

1302
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Tomorrow,

1303
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
I will turn to some

1304
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,000
of the more underlying reasons.

1305
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Let me stop there

1306
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,000
and see if there is comment or questions

1307
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
as we engage together.

1308
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Thank you, Dr. Labberton,

1309
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
for walking us through

1310
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
the past three centuries,

1311
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
giving us a quick

1312
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
but succinct historical survey

1313
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
of how the present evangelical crisis

1314
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
came to be.

1315
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
So in what follows,

1316
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
two members of our faculty

1317
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
will give their response

1318
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
to Dr. Labberton's speech.

1319
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Before introducing them,

1320
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
I would like to remind the audience

1321
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
that a question and answer session

1322
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,000
will immediately follow the responses.

1323
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
All the questions can be posted

1324
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,000
on our website in the live streaming page.

1325
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
And you may scroll down the webpage.

1326
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
After the live streaming in Mandarin,

1327
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
there is a Q&A session,

1328
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,000
and you are most welcome

1329
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
and strongly encouraged

1330
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
to input your questions there

1331
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
after inputting your name.

1332
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Your questions or comments

1333
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
can be either in Chinese or English.

1334
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Now, our two responses...

1335
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
our two response speakers today,

1336
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:47,000
they are Dr. Chen Wenyan,

1337
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
our visiting professor in practical studies,

1338
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,000
and Reverend Dr. Song Jun,

1339
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
our Philip Tan associate professor

1340
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
in theological studies.

1341
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Their responses will be given

1342
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,000
in English and Putonghua, respectively.

1343
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Let's welcome them with our applause.

1344
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Thank you, Dr. Labberton,

1345
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
for your wonderful lecture,

1346
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
and I feel so honored

1347
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
to give my personal response here.

1348
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,000
I was drawn to the Fowler School of Theology

1349
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
long before I entered the CGST.

1350
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,000
I think most of the Hong Kong churches

1351
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
know Fowler not only as a seminary

1352
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
and a training ground

1353
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
for counselors and theologians,

1354
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
but also as the school

1355
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
for training intercultural workers

1356
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
and teachers in mission.

1357
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
The two CGST mission faculty members

1358
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:59,000
prior to me both got their D.MITS degrees

1359
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,000
from Fowler School of World Mission,

1360
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
which has now changed her name

1361
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:09,000
to the Fowler School of Intercultural Studies.

1362
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,000
To me, Fowler's intercultural studies

1363
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,000
excel on issues like gospel and culture,

1364
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
intercultural communication,

1365
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
cultural anthropology,

1366
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
and so on and so forth.

1367
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
And we have all benefited

1368
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
from the easy-to-grasp concepts

1369
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
like 10/40 window,

1370
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,000
unreached people groups,

1371
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
people movement in church growth,

1372
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,000
et cetera,

1373
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,000
developed by the Fowler faculty.

1374
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,000
We are also on the receiving end

1375
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
from a lot of American missionaries

1376
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
coming to this part of the world.

1377
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Personally, I had great friends

1378
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,000
among the American Southern Baptist missionaries

1379
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
when my family was in Sri Lanka

1380
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
three decades ago.

1381
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
I had very mixed feeling,

1382
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
experience with them

1383
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
who worked closely with me

1384
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
in that country.

1385
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
We were great friends,

1386
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,000
so much so that we had asked

1387
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
an elderly couple

1388
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:14,000
to be the godparents of our infant son.

1389
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
But at the same time,

1390
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
we avoided too close a connection

1391
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,000
because of the way they carry themselves.

1392
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Coming in with obvious financial power

1393
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
and human resources,

1394
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,000
locals commented that they lived like kings.

1395
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Another difficulty between us

1396
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
was our differences

1397
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
in seeing the meaning of the gospel

1398
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:43,000
in a world more torn land.

1399
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
To our American colleagues,

1400
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
their job was to get the message

1401
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
of the gospel across

1402
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
without ever touching

1403
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:56,000
on the problems of inequity and injustice

1404
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,000
that were rampant in the country.

1405
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
A lot of the mission theories

1406
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
and conceptual framework

1407
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,000
were generated from social sciences

1408
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
which were excellent tools

1409
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,000
for reaching people outside the church.

1410
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
But unfortunately,

1411
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
such techniques did not touch

1412
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,000
on the socioeconomic political aspects

1413
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
of the gospel.

1414
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,000
And the good news of God's mercy and justice

1415
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,000
to a broken world has been missed out.

1416
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,000
What is the gospel to a world

1417
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
plagued by systemic oppression

1418
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,000
against the minority and the disadvantaged,

1419
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:41,000
especially when privileged middle-class Christians

1420
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
were being implicated

1421
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:48,000
as part of the unjust process?

1422
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,000
After reading Dr.Leviton's lecture script,

1423
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,000
I could suddenly solve the puzzle I have

1424
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:59,000
regarding the focal areas of American missiology.

1425
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Now I understand

1426
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,000
why the packaged Kairos mission course

1427
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
did not mention the special needs

1428
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
of the poor and the marginalized

1429
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,000
and why in another classic package

1430
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
called Perspectives,

1431
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
out of 169 articles,

1432
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:19,000
only 6, that is 3.5%,

1433
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:23,000
directly talk about the issues of poverty

1434
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
and social ills.

1435
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Now I understand

1436
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
why there is no mentioning of liberation,

1437
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
of ethnic equality,

1438
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,000
and of suffering and persecution,

1439
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
because the majority of authors

1440
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,000
belong to a majority of white evangelicals

1441
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
that have actually turned a blind eye

1442
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:45,000
on these issues on their own doorsteps.

1443
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Then the problem is getting serious

1444
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,000
because we have imported the whole paradigm

1445
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,000
and repeated the same patterns

1446
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
of missionary engagement

1447
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:01,000
in our Hong Kong and Mainland churches.

1448
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
These days,

1449
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,000
we talk a lot about the Silk Road initiatives

1450
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
that have enabled Chinese missionaries

1451
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,000
to venture far beyond the country border,

1452
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
going to countries

1453
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:17,000
that badly need Chinese input in their businesses.

1454
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:22,000
But in all these Asian and African countries,

1455
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
do we have to ask

1456
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
if our political supremacy

1457
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
and economic advantage

1458
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
reflect a God that care for sins

1459
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,000
generated from power imbalance?

1460
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,000
How much are we implicated

1461
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:41,000
in some of the irregular Chinese trading methods

1462
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:45,000
and exploitation of people and the land?

1463
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
The way we carry our presence

1464
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:51,000
speaks volumes about the gospel we preach.

1465
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
The contemporary Chinese mission movements

1466
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
like Back to Jerusalem,

1467
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,000
the Homecoming Chinese Gathering,

1468
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,000
or Mission China 2030,

1469
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:05,000
have gathered momentum in recent years

1470
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
to mobilize Chinese Christians

1471
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
to serve the global church,

1472
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
which is very good indeed.

1473
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,000
However,

1474
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,000
despite all their good intentions,

1475
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,000
they all carry certain air of conquest and entitlement,

1476
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,000
painting the Chinese church as the country

1477
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
used by God at the end to finish the task

1478
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,000
to preach the gospel to the ends of the earth.

1479
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Such stance does energize

1480
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,000
and motivate people in positive ways,

1481
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:39,000
but are we going out as conquerors and saviors

1482
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:44,000
or as fellow sinners needing redemption?

1483
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Do we dare to mention that

1484
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:51,000
we are also being seen against by the social system?

1485
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,000
The same holds true within the Chinese soil

1486
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,000
when a sizable group of Chinese Han Christians

1487
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:02,000
enter minority groups without any attempt

1488
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
to embrace a world of weakness,

1489
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,000
vulnerability and marginality.

1490
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Han Christians often fail to identify

1491
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,000
with the struggles of being minorities,

1492
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,000
refuse to learn minority languages and cultures,

1493
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
and expect ethnic Christians

1494
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,000
to merge into the majority Han churches.

1495
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Thus,

1496
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
they have inadvertently adopted

1497
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:32,000
a mindset and lifestyle that support inequality.

1498
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Critical self-reflection is truly needed

1499
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:40,000
for missionaries and their sending bodies.

1500
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Another problem coming out

1501
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,000
from this superiority mentality

1502
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
is the lack of partnership

1503
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:51,000
with the weak in the advancement of the gospel.

1504
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,000
We pride ourselves when we play the savior mode,

1505
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
sending out workers to places

1506
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
where the church is poor and depleted

1507
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
and sometimes even persecuted.

1508
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:06,000
But we are not ready to encounter truth

1509
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
in those contexts

1510
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
which may change and challenge

1511
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:13,000
our current position in our theology.

1512
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Are we ready to engage with cultures

1513
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,000
that may be superior to ours,

1514
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,000
not in the modern day economic technical sense,

1515
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:26,000
but in the sense of classic moral standards

1516
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,000
that sometimes have even worked on the archaic,

1517
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
like caring for the elderly,

1518
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
communal sharing,

1519
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:37,000
the demand to uphold family name and honor,

1520
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
the emphasis on resilience in suffering

1521
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,000
instead of success, etc., etc.

1522
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Are we repeating the failures

1523
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:49,000
of American white evangelicalism?

1524
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Coming back to lecture today,

1525
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
we might not be able to feel

1526
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,000
the kind of pain and anguish

1527
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Dr.Leberton has on American white Christians

1528
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,000
because the whole scenario seems so distant.

1529
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:09,000
But we know we are all bundled together

1530
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
in this global village.

1531
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
And it's time for us to confront

1532
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:17,000
the whole array of misrepresentation of the gospel

1533
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
and the darker side of human nature

1534
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:24,000
being dressed under the cloak of evangelicalism.

1535
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
I pray that together

1536
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:30,000
we might be able to find a way out of this mire.

1537
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Thank you.

1538
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:46,000
尊敬的Leberton博士,李思敬院长,各位嘉宾,

1539
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,000
established guests, colleagues and students,

1540
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:52,000
I am most honored to be given the opportunity

1541
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,000
to respond to Professor Leberton's great speech today.

1542
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
I'd like to talk about the stories

1543
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:01,000
of American mission workers in modern China,

1544
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,000
but it would be a totally impossible task

1545
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,000
to do justice to this rich legacy

1546
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
within seven minutes' time.

1547
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,000
However, I am much encouraged by the example

1548
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
of the late Reverend Dr. Cheng Chengyi,

1549
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
one of the representatives of Chinese churches

1550
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
at the World Missionary Conference

1551
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
in Edinburgh in 1920.

1552
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Rev. Cheng was able to clearly articulate

1553
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
the voices of the Chinese Church

1554
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,000
within a short span of just seven minutes.

1555
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Tracing the footprints of the many

1556
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
American mission workers in China,

1557
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,000
from Elijah Coleman Bridgman,

1558
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,000
the first one to arrive in China in 1830,

1559
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
through to Loyal Holding Bartow,

1560
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
who finally died in prison in China,

1561
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,000
we can clearly see the dedication

1562
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,000
and contribution of the American Church in China

1563
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,000
in those one and a half centuries.

1564
01:02:55,000 --> 01:03:01,000
The impact made was enormous and imperishable,

1565
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:05,000
so much so that even after over 70 years,

1566
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:09,000
the new China could not totally remove

1567
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,000
all the marks and traces they left.

1568
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:18,000
If we push the clock back

1569
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,000
another 30 years from 1949,

1570
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:26,000
we will find that the Chinese Communist Party

1571
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:30,000
had been a competition to Christianity

1572
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,000
since the Party's inception in 1921.

1573
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:39,000
The competition was vigorous on many, many fronts.

1574
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Both sides had wins and losses at different times.

1575
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:47,000
In respect of a number of reasons,

1576
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:52,000
in respect of a number of resources and operations

1577
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
and other things,

1578
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:59,000
in the first 30 years of the 20th century,

1579
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Christianity seemed to gain the upper hand,

1580
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:07,000
except that it didn't have a military presence.

1581
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:14,000
But by the end of the second 30 years,

1582
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Christianity had lost almost everything.

1583
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:24,000
And during the third 30-year period,

1584
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,000
the competition ended in a draw

1585
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,000
if we look at numbers alone.

1586
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:35,000
There is so much that I want to tell about this period,

1587
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:41,000
so in the remaining five minutes,

1588
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,000
I should be very, very focused.

1589
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:52,000
In mid-20th century,

1590
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:57,000
the China Committee of the Division of Foreign Missions

1591
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:02,000
of the National Council of Churches of Christ in the USA

1592
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:08,000
conducted a study on the 150-odd American mission workers

1593
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,000
from 22 sending organizations

1594
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,000
who withdrew from mainland China.

1595
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:21,000
The report entitled "Lessons to be Learned

1596
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:25,000
from the Experiences of Christian Missions in China"

1597
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:30,000
was published in 1951.

1598
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:35,000
It represented the common reflections

1599
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:39,000
of that group of American missionaries in China.

1600
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,000
One of the issues raised in the report

1601
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,000
caught my special attention.

1602
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Whilst almost all missionary respondents agreed that

1603
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,000
services in the urban and rural areas,

1604
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,000
common education,

1605
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,000
improvements in agriculture and so on,

1606
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:06,000
were all needed to meet the needs of the people of China,

1607
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:12,000
86% of the respondents pointed out that

1608
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:18,000
the Church had done very little in helping workers and farmers,

1609
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:26,000
and 31% agreed that

1610
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:31,000
the Church's action would build up a community

1611
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:35,000
that is totally detached from the poor people,

1612
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:39,000
and 31% agreed that

1613
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:43,000
missionaries tended to associate much more closely

1614
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:47,000
with government officials, intellectuals and rich people.

1615
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Since the mid-19th century,

1616
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:56,000
the most urgent priority for China

1617
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,000
and the most desperate dream of her people

1618
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:03,000
had been survival and rebuilding the country.

1619
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:07,000
For this, different organizations and individuals

1620
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:11,000
had put forward various proposals and solutions.

1621
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
At the same time,

1622
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:17,000
they were fighting for their share of influence and power

1623
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:21,000
which was needed to change the country.

1624
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:25,000
That the Communist Party finally won this power struggle

1625
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:28,000
might be attributable to many reasons,

1626
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:32,000
one of which was the ability to hone in precisely

1627
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:38,000
to the crux which was the farmers and the land.

1628
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,000
So the Communist Party's

1629
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:45,000
penetrated into farming communities,

1630
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:49,000
enticing them with fair distribution of land,

1631
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:54,000
and tirelessly fought on their behalf,

1632
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:58,000
thus winning over their support.

1633
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Let me clarify here

1634
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:06,000
that I'm not trying to say that

1635
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:11,000
the Chinese Communist Party's goal and efforts

1636
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:15,000
are not related to the Communist Party's endeavors

1637
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:19,000
without commenting on the legitimacy of their tactics and actions.

1638
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,000
By contrast,

1639
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,000
many American mission workers

1640
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:30,000
tried to showcase the Chinese version of America's success story

1641
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,000
in becoming a strong nation,

1642
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:37,000
extending the American westward expansion

1643
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:40,000
all the way to China,

1644
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,000
with the promise that

1645
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,000
this gospel from across the Atlantic

1646
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:52,000
would bring about democratic political system

1647
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,000
in the American style,

1648
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:58,000
free market economy,

1649
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,000
and the Christian ethos

1650
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:05,000
that was rooted in the founding of the United States.

1651
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,000
I must admit that this is still

1652
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:14,000
the dreams of many Chinese Christians today.

1653
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:18,000
But as an agricultural country like China,

1654
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:21,000
what about the most pressing social issue,

1655
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:27,000
namely the farming people and the land?

1656
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:31,000
During the 1920s to 1930s,

1657
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,000
some American mission organizations

1658
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:39,000
did send some agricultural mission workers to China,

1659
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,000
and in some Christian universities in China,

1660
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:46,000
agricultural departments were set up.

1661
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,000
Some Chinese Christian leaders had championed

1662
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:53,000
some rural development movements

1663
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:56,000
and managed to get some financial

1664
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:01,000
and policy support from the then Kuomintang government.

1665
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:09,000
But their contribution was limited to symptomatic measures.

1666
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:14,000
These are like starting education in the rural areas,

1667
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:18,000
improving hygiene and farming technologies,

1668
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:22,000
but without tackling the roots of the problem,

1669
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,000
which was the land issue.

1670
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,000
But these efforts were not embraced

1671
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:32,000
by mainline Chinese churches,

1672
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:37,000
and indeed,just like a glasshouse flower

1673
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:41,000
which bloomed only for a short while

1674
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:46,000
and soon to be destroyed by the Sino-Japanese War.

1675
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Just as advocates for rural development

1676
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:55,000
were trying hard to persuade the mainline Chinese churches

1677
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
to change their focus,

1678
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,000
some mission workers in the tertiary education sector

1679
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
cried out in alarm

1680
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:07,000
that the Communists had stolen from Christian thoughts.

1681
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:10,000
The Communists had already put into practice

1682
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,000
the very concept of fighting for social justice

1683
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:16,000
for grassroots people.

1684
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Pastors at that time also found that

1685
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:23,000
they were losing the young people

1686
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:27,000
to the Communist movements.

1687
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:31,000
In the summer of 1933,

1688
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,000
special meetings were held among mission workers

1689
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:39,000
to discuss how Christianity could be as influential

1690
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:43,000
among young people as Communism.

1691
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:47,000
The issue that I wish to bring up today

1692
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:52,000
is not whether Christianity could win in this competition,

1693
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,000
but rather whether the Church

1694
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,000
is following the path of life

1695
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:02,000
after Christ and His cross.

1696
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Then Jesus said to the disciples,

1697
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:08,000
"If you want to be a Christian,

1698
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,000
you must be a Christian,

1699
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:15,000
and you must follow the way of the Lord."

1700
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Then Jesus said to His disciples,

1701
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,000
"Whoever wants to be My disciple

1702
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,000
must deny themselves

1703
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:28,000
and take up their cross and follow Me."

1704
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:32,000
The young official in the Gospels

1705
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,000
had great wealth,

1706
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:38,000
so the meaning of the cross

1707
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:41,000
was to challenge the status

1708
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,000
and challenging the social order

1709
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,000
on which He was established.

1710
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Jesus answered,

1711
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,000
"If you want to be perfect,

1712
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,000
go, sell your possessions,

1713
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:59,000
and give to the poor,

1714
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,000
and you will have treasure in heaven.

1715
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Then come, follow Me."

1716
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Christ has called His followers

1717
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,000
to tread on a downward path.

1718
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,000
The issue is not whether the Church

1719
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,000
is in the middle class,

1720
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:22,000
but rather whether she is living out

1721
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,000
a different life,

1722
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,000
separate from the world trends

1723
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,000
and in accordance with Christ's commands.

1724
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:34,000
We can list four or more characteristics

1725
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,000
of evangelicalism,

1726
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:40,000
but each one may have the peril

1727
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,000
of becoming just a deceiving packaging.

1728
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:46,000
The crux is whether we are determined

1729
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,000
to internalize it as our inner value

1730
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,000
and to be recognized as such

1731
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:55,000
through our earnest practice.

1732
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Thank you.

1733
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:01,000
(掌聲)

1734
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Thank you.

1735
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Thank you, Dr. Chen and Dr. Sung

1736
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:22,000
for responses.

1737
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,000
And now in the rest of the...

1738
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:29,000
we have about 45 minutes of questions and answers.

1739
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:33,000
And in fact, there have been several questions

1740
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:36,000
being sent in.

1741
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Dr. Levitin, can we start with a question

1742
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:47,000
perhaps most directly related to your presentation?

1743
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:52,000
So I think the first question is

1744
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:56,000
what factors made evangelical Christians

1745
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:00,000
so blind to be unable to live out the truth of gospel?

1746
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,000
What can be done to change?

1747
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:06,000
What suggestions do you have for Chinese churches

1748
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:10,000
in America, which tends to so blindly

1749
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:16,000
follow the white churches in many or in all ways?

1750
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Thank you very much for that good question.

1751
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Let me start simply by also saying thank you

1752
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
to the respondents.

1753
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
I appreciated very much their comments

1754
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
and I hope I'll have a chance

1755
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:33,000
to interact with them at some stage.

1756
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
The question is penetrating

1757
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:38,000
and I think maybe one way of summarizing it

1758
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:43,000
is that we are all aware that the gospel

1759
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:47,000
is far more radical than the church

1760
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:51,000
that names that gospel as usually ever wanting to be.

1761
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:54,000
What Jesus did and what he said

1762
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,000
and how he taught

1763
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:00,000
and what he called us to

1764
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:05,000
is just much more difficult and uncomfortable

1765
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:09,000
than we are usually willing to actually accept

1766
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
or even acknowledge.

1767
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:15,000
I think Christian history has shown

1768
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:20,000
that there is a great tendency, a common tendency

1769
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,000
to accommodate the gospel

1770
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:26,000
to something that we find more acceptable

1771
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:30,000
than to live in the radical way

1772
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,000
that Jesus exemplified and taught.

1773
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:38,000
So in talking about American white evangelicalism,

1774
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:41,000
I'm talking about one way

1775
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
that the church throughout history

1776
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:46,000
has simply accommodated the good news

1777
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
to the life that we want to go ahead

1778
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,000
and live apart from the gospel.

1779
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:54,000
And we want to use the gospel

1780
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:58,000
as a framework for various purposes,

1781
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:05,000
for eternal life, for moral clarity,

1782
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:12,000
for social relationships, for hope,

1783
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:16,000
for love, for forgiveness.

1784
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,000
But the radical call to take up our cross

1785
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:22,000
and follow Christ has never been

1786
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:26,000
a popular part of the life of the church.

1787
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:29,000
And throughout church history,

1788
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:32,000
the number of people, as Jesus said,

1789
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:36,000
that are willing to do that are few.

1790
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:41,000
So let me begin first with saying that.

1791
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:44,000
We're talking about the broadness of the church

1792
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:47,000
and its unwillingness to actually be

1793
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:50,000
radical followers of Jesus.

1794
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,000
And in many ways, the white evangelical church

1795
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:57,000
in America becomes a case study

1796
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
in what for different reasons could be said,

1797
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:03,000
perhaps as the two respondents have indicated,

1798
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
in some ways of the Chinese church,

1799
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
but it certainly could be true

1800
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:10,000
of countries all around the world,

1801
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:14,000
each in their own particular context and culture.

1802
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
But in the American setting,

1803
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
I would commend a book

1804
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,000
that I'm going to refer to again tomorrow

1805
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:27,000
called "The Democratization of Christianity in America."

1806
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:31,000
"The Democratization of Christianity in America."

1807
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:35,000
It's an exceptionally good book,

1808
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:40,000
which is an expression of the way

1809
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
that American Christianity changed

1810
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:45,000
as it moved from the east coast

1811
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
to the west coast of the United States

1812
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:51,000
and further into the south as well.

1813
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
And a great deal of the theme of the book

1814
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
has to do with the way that Christianity

1815
01:18:55,000 --> 01:19:00,000
became something which people made up for themselves.

1816
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
So they had the Bible,

1817
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
but they often didn't have any educated leaders

1818
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:08,000
they didn't have any kind of Christian community

1819
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,000
around them necessarily.

1820
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:12,000
They didn't have any educational institutions

1821
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:16,000
that were helping to guide and form their leadership.

1822
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:20,000
They just instead took the gospel

1823
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,000
or whatever it is that they thought

1824
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
they knew of the gospel

1825
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:26,000
and put it to work for their own designs,

1826
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,000
sure humbly and earnestly,

1827
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:33,000
but often very, very specifically and personally.

1828
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Rather than as a response to

1829
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,000
the lordship of Christ over all things.

1830
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
And out of that came

1831
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:44,000
what now we would recognize, for example,

1832
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,000
as consumer Christianity.

1833
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,000
That is, I'm going to take from the gospel

1834
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,000
what I want,

1835
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:54,000
and I'm going to keep the parts that I like

1836
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
that serve me,

1837
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,000
and I'm going to more or less ignore

1838
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:04,000
or reject the parts that I don't like.

1839
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
And that pattern,

1840
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:10,000
which is one that emerges early in American history,

1841
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:13,000
is one that continues to this day.

1842
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
So the antidote to that,

1843
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:19,000
coming to the question asker's point,

1844
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
what is the antidote to that?

1845
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
I think the antidote to that

1846
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:28,000
has to do with how we form genuine disciples,

1847
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
not people who are part of

1848
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
denomination and a movement

1849
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,000
or an organization or a structure,

1850
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:39,000
but people who are truly devoted

1851
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:42,000
to being followers of Jesus.

1852
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
And then do it in community,

1853
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,000
because of course we're not meant

1854
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,000
to live this kind of life.

1855
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
We can't live this kind of life

1856
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:52,000
individualistically as Americans also try to do.

1857
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
We'll come to that more tomorrow.

1858
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
We have to do it in community.

1859
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
And in doing it in community,

1860
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
then we have to check and balance

1861
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
of other people around us.

1862
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,000
And the difficulty is that so often

1863
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,000
what we gather around us

1864
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:09,000
is a community that looks like us.

1865
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
So then the church starts looking

1866
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
like the social setting

1867
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
into which we were born,

1868
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
rather than a community

1869
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
like the apostle Paul,

1870
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
I would want to argue,

1871
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,000
suggests is meant to be

1872
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:25,000
an entirely new humanity.

1873
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:28,000
One humanity, a new humanity

1874
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
that reflects the death

1875
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,000
and resurrection of Jesus

1876
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
by the death and resurrection

1877
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,000
of ourselves in community

1878
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
of unlike people.

1879
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,000
That's the place that the church

1880
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,000
has often broken down.

1881
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,000
And that's exactly what happened

1882
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
in American church culture

1883
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
in historical terms.

1884
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:50,000
But it is largely still the case.

1885
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:54,000
So when a pull was done by the church

1886
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
a pull was done by the Pew Foundation

1887
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
two years ago,

1888
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
about how many white Americans

1889
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:03,000
have close relationships

1890
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:07,000
with a person of another race,

1891
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:10,000
nearly 85% of white Americans

1892
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,000
said they did not have

1893
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:14,000
any close relationships

1894
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:17,000
with people that were not of their race.

1895
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Now that's true of society in general.

1896
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
But if that's true of society in general,

1897
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:25,000
then it is tragically certainly true

1898
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:29,000
of churches who have a white normativity

1899
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:32,000
that often excludes people of color

1900
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:35,000
and does so in cultural and church terms.

1901
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:38,000
And then we just become a mirror,

1902
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,000
a hall of mirrors

1903
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,000
that we all look alike

1904
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,000
and act alike and talk alike.

1905
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
And therefore we think that's the gospel

1906
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
instead of letting the gospel

1907
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:51,000
radically redefine us.

1908
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Thank you, Dr. Levitin.

1909
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
I think you have raised several themes

1910
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:59,000
like taming the radical nature of the gospel,

1911
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,000
the consumerism,

1912
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
and also bringing together

1913
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:06,000
unlike people in the new created community in Christ.

1914
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:09,000
So these themes sound also familiar

1915
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:13,000
here in actually in the Chinese churches

1916
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:16,000
and the churches around here in Hong Kong as well.

1917
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
So I think this leads very naturally

1918
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
to a second question.

1919
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Actually, it's a small agenda in nature.

1920
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:27,000
It says maybe our two response speakers

1921
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:30,000
have to fill in some of the gaps as well.

1922
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,000
It asks,

1923
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:35,000
"In what way does American white evangelicalism

1924
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:39,000
affect churches in Hong Kong now?"

1925
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,000
So, yes, I think we need wisdom

1926
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:45,000
from across the Atlantic Pacific.

1927
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:48,000
The respondent should speak first.

1928
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
OK.

1929
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:53,000
So perhaps I translate the question

1930
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
for Dr. Sung-Chun first.

1931
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
OK.

1932
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:00,000
蔣元所說的美國白人福音派的信仰

1933
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:05,000
對於現在香港的教會有多大影響?

1934
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Maybe we may start with a born Chinese,

1935
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,000
a Hong Konger.

1936
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Sorry.

1937
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Well, I noticed that there are

1938
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:17,000
quite a few faculty members on the floor.

1939
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:20,000
So I'm expecting some of your response as well.

1940
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,000
OK.

1941
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:24,000
We need your input.

1942
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:27,000
And, yeah, because of my location,

1943
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:30,000
I mean, I feel more and more distant

1944
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:33,000
from the Hong Kong current scene, to be sure.

1945
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:38,000
But I'm just thinking that

1946
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:41,000
just following up on Dr. Lepperton's remark,

1947
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:45,000
I think we need to be aware of our inclination

1948
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:51,000
or this kind of tendency

1949
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:56,000
to group together with people who are like with us.

1950
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:59,000
So I mean, this is something very natural

1951
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
because you feel so comfortable.

1952
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:04,000
We will stay in our comfort zone.

1953
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:08,000
But right now, because of the divisions,

1954
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:11,000
the divisiveness among the churches in Hong Kong,

1955
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:15,000
I think we need to sort of alter our mentality.

1956
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:18,000
We need to keep reminding us

1957
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:21,000
that we have to keep reading from the other side

1958
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:26,000
and then to listen from opposing angles and views.

1959
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
So I think this is kind of a discipline.

1960
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:32,000
I call this even spiritual discipline for us

1961
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:40,000
that we need to constantly keep learning

1962
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:45,000
and trying to see what we have missed

1963
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:49,000
in our own framework.

1964
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:52,000
So this is something that I think should be done.

1965
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:56,000
But if talking about this whole concept of

1966
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:00,000
whole tendency of white evangelicalism

1967
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
and their influence on the Hong Kong church,

1968
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:07,000
I'm feeling that whatever American is doing now

1969
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
would have global effects.

1970
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
Like it or not.

1971
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
So we have to acknowledge that

1972
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:16,000
because of all this online information

1973
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:21,000
and all because of all the most of the theological material

1974
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:25,000
we study, imported from the West

1975
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:29,000
and because of the majority of written material

1976
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:32,000
from the States,

1977
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:35,000
I mean, we are really affected

1978
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:44,000
by the whole concept of

1979
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:52,000
theology that would underplay the

1980
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:56,000
emphasis or the look on the weak and the marginalized.

1981
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:00,000
This is what I'm talking in my response.

1982
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,000
Because of this whole idea of success

1983
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:07,000
that you can do it, freedom and all this idea

1984
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
that is very positive thinking

1985
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
and it's really good for us.

1986
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:14,000
But on the other hand, I think we really lack

1987
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:18,000
this whole concept of suffering and persecution

1988
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:21,000
in American theology.

1989
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
And we import them.

1990
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:27,000
And then we tend to talk about,

1991
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
say when we talk about suffering,

1992
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:32,000
we talk about personal suffering as such.

1993
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Instead of social suffering.

1994
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:38,000
We talk about this whole concept of

1995
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:41,000
suffering because of illness, of age.

1996
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:44,000
But we know that

1997
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:50,000
in the end, actually, most of the suffering

1998
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:54,000
actually comes from a social setting.

1999
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:58,000
But because Hong Kong churches are in general

2000
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:01,000
also very middle class.

2001
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:05,000
And so we can hide in our small niche

2002
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
and then we can feel comfortable.

2003
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:12,000
And again, we can sort of explain our whole being

2004
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:16,000
with a very limited kind of framework.

2005
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:20,000
And so I'm feeling that if we look broader

2006
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
into the whole global world

2007
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:25,000
and read more about the kind of experiences

2008
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:29,000
and narratives from more of the third world countries,

2009
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
from Africa, from Latin America,

2010
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:34,000
and from say South Asia, etc.

2011
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:38,000
I think we'll really try to wean ourselves, okay,

2012
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:44,000
from American evangelicalism.

2013
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Thank you very much.

2014
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Thank you for the question and the response from Wenyan.

2015
01:28:54,000 --> 01:29:00,000
I just want to respond to one point.

2016
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:03,000
From what Dr. Levitin talked about

2017
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:06,000
American evangelicalism

2018
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:17,000
true to the critical and put into action.

2019
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
I think the churches in Hong Kong

2020
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:24,000
do have the DNA of evangelicalism.

2021
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:29,000
But there are three things

2022
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:33,000
which are also pointed out in the question.

2023
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
And as someone coming from mainland China,

2024
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
I have such observation.

2025
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:43,000
The first one, from 1980s onwards,

2026
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:48,000
churches in Hong Kong

2027
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
more and more members of them

2028
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:54,000
are becoming more concerned about social issues,

2029
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:57,000
especially among young Christians.

2030
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
And this is a very clear sign.

2031
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:11,000
The second point is

2032
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:15,000
in Hong Kong there are also many ethnic problems.

2033
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:18,000
But among Christians in Hong Kong,

2034
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:23,000
very few of them would voice out their response.

2035
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:28,000
Most of them do not admit that there is an ethnic problem.

2036
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:31,000
But as a very international and open community here,

2037
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:39,000
with many, many people from many different ethnic backgrounds living here,

2038
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:42,000
their conditions and their problems,

2039
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:46,000
their livelihood is not something

2040
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:50,000
that is a concern of the Church of Hong Kong.

2041
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
The third point is

2042
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:58,000
many churches in Hong Kong are middle class,

2043
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:03,000
neglecting concern about the grassroot people.

2044
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:07,000
But admittedly there are many organizations,

2045
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
Christian NGOs,

2046
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:14,000
who are helping the underprivileged.

2047
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:21,000
But they also have characteristics of the middle class church.

2048
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:22,000
Thank you.

2049
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:27,000
Dr.Levitin, any further comments after hearing the two?

2050
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Augustine was convinced that sin is disordered love,

2051
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:43,000
and every culture has an order of loves that it prioritizes.

2052
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
And in American culture,

2053
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:51,000
loves that tend to get prioritized are loves like

2054
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:55,000
the love of personal happiness,

2055
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:58,000
the love of pleasure,

2056
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:01,000
the love of success,

2057
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
which can be monetary,

2058
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
but it can be other things as well.

2059
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:09,000
The love of power,

2060
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
the love of beauty,

2061
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:16,000
these are all things that are part of our loves.

2062
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:19,000
And we live in a world of disordered loves,

2063
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:23,000
where we're meant to live and sustain ourselves,

2064
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:26,000
first and foremost out of the love of God,

2065
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:32,000
and in response showing our love to God as our first love.

2066
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:35,000
But of course the nature of the human story

2067
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:38,000
and the nature of the American white evangelical story

2068
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:42,000
is the story of us attaching our lives to other loves,

2069
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:47,000
and then trying to make peace with the way that they do

2070
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:51,000
and don't fit the call of a disciple.

2071
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:57,000
And part of what we're called to is to reorder our loves.

2072
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:00,000
And I think this is where Christian worship

2073
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:05,000
reveals both our sin and the places that American culture

2074
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:08,000
has influenced many places around the world,

2075
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:13,000
and the ways that we are meant to be redeemed.

2076
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:17,000
So ideally we could say public worship

2077
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:24,000
is meant to be an experience of reordering love,

2078
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:29,000
to be regrounded again in our love for God

2079
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:32,000
and our love for our neighbors

2080
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:35,000
and our love for ourselves.

2081
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:38,000
And within the ordering of loving our neighbors,

2082
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:42,000
it doesn't mean the neighbors that are like us or who like us,

2083
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:45,000
but as Jesus says in the Sermon on the Mount,

2084
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:49,000
it even can include those who are our enemies.

2085
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:53,000
So to live into that kind of reordered love

2086
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:58,000
means that our public worship has to feed those appetites,

2087
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:02,000
nurture that desire that we would be those kinds of people.

2088
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:06,000
But instead,the American worship that we've exported

2089
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:10,000
is often a worship of entertainment.

2090
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:13,000
It's about celebrity.

2091
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
It's about money.

2092
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:16,000
It's about beauty.

2093
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:19,000
It's about fame,etc.,etc.

2094
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:22,000
And not,as Dr. Chan said so beautifully,

2095
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:25,000
it's not about the first law of God,

2096
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:30,000
particularly for the poor and for the neediest.

2097
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:36,000
So we are not cultivated to love what God most loves,

2098
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:39,000
and instead we're recultivated in the church

2099
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
to love what we already love

2100
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:44,000
and then to just go on loving it even more

2101
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:49,000
rather than actually reflecting the love of God for the world.

2102
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
So I fear that we've exported that,

2103
01:34:51,000 --> 01:35:00,000
and it is its own musical and worship entertainment industry

2104
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
that has often been exported,

2105
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:10,000
and tragically that forms people to love the wrong things.

2106
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:11,000
Thank you for your comment.

2107
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:18,000
So your comment has encouraged me to study more closely your two books,

2108
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:22,000
The Dangerous Acts of Worship and The Dangerous Acts of Loving Your Neighbor.

2109
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:26,000
I think I will take out more answers from your two works.

2110
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
Well,actually,bring that to,

2111
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:32,000
I think your mentioning of loving your neighbor,

2112
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:41,000
actually it has quite some impact on our present Hong Kong churches as well.

2113
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:45,000
So there are two questions a bit related,

2114
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
but actually there are some details there,

2115
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:54,000
so maybe it can help Dr.Leviton to help giving your wisdom

2116
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
about what we may do,

2117
01:35:56,000 --> 01:36:00,000
how we may react in the certain situation.

2118
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
One question is from a pastor,

2119
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,000
and he says,

2120
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:06,000
Dr.Leviton, your views on complicity

2121
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:09,000
is something we can relate to greatly in Hong Kong.

2122
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Given the recent circumstances as experienced by Hong Kong,

2123
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
most churches are very divided.

2124
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:18,000
It is those who feel we should speak out

2125
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
against present happenings,

2126
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,000
against authority,

2127
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:24,000
and those who do not wish to at all.

2128
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:25,000
As a pastor,

2129
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:28,000
I can say that we struggle greatly with the balancing act

2130
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:33,000
of wishing to speak against that which we feel is evil,

2131
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:36,000
and of not wishing to offend those members of the church

2132
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:39,000
who are strong supporters of authority.

2133
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
But you seem to present the view that

2134
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:46,000
we are either complicit and condone evil acts like slavery,

2135
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
or we speak out against it,

2136
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
which at least to war,

2137
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:53,000
and there's highly frowned upon in the Chinese community,

2138
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
which is all about harmony.

2139
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
So how should we juggle this balancing act,

2140
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
speaking or not speaking,

2141
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
and not to be complicit?

2142
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:04,000
So that is the very particular question.

2143
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
And in the more general nature

2144
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:09,000
it's about how to communicate effectively

2145
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
and in a loving way

2146
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:15,000
to those who hold opposite opinions from you.

2147
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:19,000
So these are, I think, two very related questions.

2148
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:22,000
Can we hear your wisdom on that?

2149
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
Yes, I'll offer what I have.

2150
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,000
Whether you consider it wisdom,

2151
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:28,000
I'll leave you to decide.

2152
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:29,000
Let me say first that

2153
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
what you've just described by that example

2154
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:34,000
is precisely what has been going on

2155
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
in the American white evangelical church,

2156
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:39,000
where you end up having some members of a church

2157
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
believe that, for example,

2158
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
that America and its government

2159
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:48,000
is not in any way an expression of God's will or desire.

2160
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,000
And in the same congregation,

2161
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:52,000
you have people who look at what's going on

2162
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
and say this at last is the best

2163
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:57,000
and most supportive government for Christians

2164
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:00,000
that the United States has ever had.

2165
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,000
So how do they share in the same congregational life?

2166
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:06,000
So this problem that we're all describing

2167
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:09,000
manifests under different issues perhaps,

2168
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
but the dynamic is really the same.

2169
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
So when I think about, first of all,

2170
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:16,000
how Jesus responds to this dilemma,

2171
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:20,000
he moves toward the stranger, toward the other,

2172
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:26,000
and also actually toward the so-called enemy.

2173
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
These are such dramatic examples,

2174
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
but one of them, for example,

2175
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
would be at the end of the Sermon on the Mount

2176
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:36,000
when Jesus says that we build our house on rock or on sand.

2177
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:39,000
He's clearly saying that we build our house on rock

2178
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,000
by actually doing the truth,

2179
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:44,000
not by just affirming it or confessing the truth.

2180
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,000
We live the truth.

2181
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
That's how we build our house on rock.

2182
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
And what's interesting is that right after that,

2183
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:54,000
he encounters a person with epilepsy.

2184
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:58,000
Sorry, not with-- yes, with epilepsy.

2185
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:01,000
No, sorry, excuse me, with leprosy.

2186
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Excuse me.

2187
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:09,000
And in that moment, he's invited to heal the person,

2188
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:12,000
and Jesus moves toward this person

2189
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,000
that was considered unclean,

2190
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
touches them and heals them.

2191
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:19,000
And then if that's not enough of a shock,

2192
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
then the very next part of this

2193
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:25,000
is that a Roman centurion comes toward Jesus

2194
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:30,000
and says that a servant of his is in great need.

2195
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:31,000
Could Jesus come and heal him?

2196
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:34,000
And Jesus says he's happily willing to do so.

2197
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,000
And the man says, "No, no,

2198
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
you don't need to come and do so

2199
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:41,000
because you just say the word and it will be done."

2200
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:45,000
And then he pauses everyone around and said,

2201
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
"Did you just hear what this man said?

2202
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:50,000
I have not heard," these are the critical words,

2203
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:55,000
"I've not heard faithfulness like this in all of Israel.

2204
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:58,000
There are some people outside the kingdom of God

2205
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:02,000
who will be in and some who you presume to be in

2206
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
who will be on the outside."

2207
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
Now I share those stories because for me,

2208
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:09,000
they are examples of at least some of the things

2209
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:12,000
to consider in answering the question.

2210
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
I want to first of all move toward people

2211
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:18,000
that I might consider to be uncomfortable.

2212
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
They might not be "unclean,"

2213
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:24,000
but they're not like me or they are not easy

2214
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:27,000
for me to be with or they are a problem

2215
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
in quotes in some way or another.

2216
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
And Jesus gives an example in this case

2217
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:34,000
and in so many other cases as we know

2218
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
about what it means to move toward people

2219
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:42,000
who are difficult, marginalized, awkward, needy,

2220
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
potentially unclean.

2221
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:47,000
I think there's a lot of tendency

2222
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
in contemporary culture around the world

2223
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:52,000
to label people clean and unclean,

2224
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:56,000
to be mindful that summer should be included

2225
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:59,000
and others don't deserve to be included.

2226
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
What's amazing about these texts

2227
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:05,000
in the early part of chapter 8 of Matthew's Gospel

2228
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:10,000
is that Jesus moves toward the man with leprosy,

2229
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:18,000
touches him, calls him a name of attachment,

2230
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:23,000
heals him, and does this completely counter

2231
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
to the pressure of the moment.

2232
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
The social pressure.

2233
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
But then more radically,

2234
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
when the centurion appears,

2235
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:34,000
the representative of dominating Roman authority,

2236
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
he receives the man's witness,

2237
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:39,000
hears it for what it is,

2238
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:42,000
acknowledges it and lifts it up

2239
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:46,000
and then goes forward to actually heal the man's servant.

2240
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:49,000
Now, in both cases,

2241
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
I think we learn lessons about what it means

2242
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
to try to live together in a different way.

2243
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
In the first case,

2244
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
how do I learn to lean toward people

2245
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:00,000
that I might marginalize

2246
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
because of different opinions in churches

2247
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:05,000
over these very issues that you've just raised?

2248
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:08,000
That has to take practice to develop that ability.

2249
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:13,000
And I think often churches have small groups

2250
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
that meet or prayer groups that meet.

2251
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
Our ability to pray for one another

2252
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
to grow in our capacity to love people

2253
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:22,000
inside the body of Christ

2254
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
is one of the kinds of prayers

2255
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,000
and the sort of work

2256
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:28,000
that we need to hold one another accountable to doing,

2257
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:32,000
not just becoming our own little small tribe within a tribe,

2258
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:35,000
but to actually learn to love one another,

2259
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:36,000
to see each other,

2260
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:37,000
to value each other,

2261
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:41,000
to honor in whatever way we can.

2262
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:45,000
And then the gold standard of Jesus

2263
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:48,000
is not whether we love those who love us,

2264
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:51,000
but whether we love those who don't love us

2265
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,000
or don't like us

2266
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:55,000
and who may even be our enemies.

2267
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:56,000
How do we also learn to practice

2268
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
loving people like that?

2269
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:03,000
And I think that happens in that case in Matthew 8.

2270
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
It happens first of all by Jesus

2271
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:09,000
just very carefully listening to what the man said.

2272
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
The most amazing part of that text

2273
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
is the way that Jesus

2274
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:17,000
hears his actual declaration of faith

2275
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
and then focuses on that,

2276
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:23,000
letting it fully be absorbed into his own heart and mind

2277
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:28,000
and then responds back to that affirmingly.

2278
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
That is deep and profound faith

2279
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:33,000
unlike anything I've heard in all of Israel.

2280
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:36,000
Well, that was scandalous, of course, to Jews.

2281
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:39,000
It was crazy to think that Jesus would do that.

2282
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:42,000
And yet Jesus listened very carefully

2283
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:46,000
and affirmed what he could affirm.

2284
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Now, I think often in divided churches

2285
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:52,000
like the ones that we're talking about tonight,

2286
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:55,000
we have to learn to really listen much more carefully.

2287
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
And often, not always,

2288
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
but often within the differences

2289
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:02,000
is a failure of really hearing the other person,

2290
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
really understanding why they're motivated,

2291
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
what it is that drives them,

2292
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:07,000
what their fears are,

2293
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:10,000
what controls their anxiety.

2294
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
Why are some people so insistent

2295
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:15,000
on holding on to certain forms of authority?

2296
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:19,000
And why do other people find it necessary,

2297
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
almost required for them

2298
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:24,000
to reject certain kinds of authority?

2299
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
Those are conversations

2300
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:29,000
that ultimately the body of Christ has to have.

2301
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:32,000
But we have to first be able to simply carry it out

2302
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:35,000
in a very respectful, mutual way.

2303
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
And that's going to require that our hearts be remade.

2304
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
It's going to require, in Paul's language,

2305
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:42,000
that we be transformed by the renewing of our minds,

2306
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
that we have the heart of Christ

2307
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:47,000
and that we do not regard equality with God,

2308
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:51,000
that is, taking our own prerogative and views as first order,

2309
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:55,000
but actually lay them down for the sake of loving

2310
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:58,000
and in some bizarre way,

2311
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:02,000
identifying with the person that we most disagree with.

2312
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:05,000
Those are just some small initial thoughts,

2313
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:08,000
but I think it's in that kind of direction

2314
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
that some of this work can be sustained.

2315
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
But as a pastor, we have to decide,

2316
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:15,000
and I was a pastor for 35 years

2317
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
before I became involved

2318
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:20,000
in formal theological education as I am now.

2319
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:24,000
And I was very, very aware every day as a pastor

2320
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:28,000
that it was about restoring community and communion.

2321
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
The word "communion" for me

2322
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:33,000
is one of the most valuable Christian words

2323
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
in the whole Christian vocabulary.

2324
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
And it's through that lens,

2325
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
communion with God, communion with one another,

2326
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:45,000
communion across the economic, social, political divides,

2327
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:48,000
that communion in Christ is meant to give us

2328
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:54,000
our ground on which to stand and build our lives.

2329
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:59,000
I think I do have something to add along this line.

2330
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:05,000
From my experience with the Mainland churches,

2331
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:09,000
because it's divided into the institutional

2332
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:12,000
and non-institutional churches,

2333
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:17,000
and I'm finding that this one major attitude

2334
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:20,000
that we need to have is to be humble

2335
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:23,000
and to know that in spite of all my conviction

2336
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
and understanding of truth,

2337
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
I don't have all the truth,

2338
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:30,000
that God is bigger and higher.

2339
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:37,000
I know I have certain conviction

2340
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:42,000
that I'm following the right way in my choice,

2341
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:46,000
either it's institutional or non-institutional.

2342
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:47,000
But it's okay,

2343
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
because I see the other party,

2344
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:52,000
the other churches as brothers and sisters

2345
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
and not as satanic work.

2346
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:57,000
So this is important.

2347
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:00,000
And another way,

2348
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:04,000
another solution is for me to be engaged

2349
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
together in some joint projects.

2350
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:10,000
Usually I find that some social projects is good,

2351
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:14,000
like some community work projects like that,

2352
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:18,000
together with people from different groups

2353
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
and denominations.

2354
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
They don't have denominations,

2355
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:25,000
but institutions, outside institutions.

2356
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
And if we work together,

2357
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
through living together,

2358
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
we come to appreciate what they have

2359
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
and what I don't have, okay?

2360
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:37,000
And then by communing together,

2361
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:40,000
I think this is a way for us to soften our divide.

2362
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:43,000
And then I have to acknowledge

2363
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
that the divide is always there.

2364
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:48,000
I mean, I have no way to sort of...

2365
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
You can't pretend.

2366
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
Yeah, I can't.

2367
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:55,000
I can't dissolve that, okay?

2368
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:58,000
But I can, to a certain extent,

2369
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:02,000
hold one another's arms

2370
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:05,000
and then we say that we can work together.

2371
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
And I always tell my friends

2372
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:10,000
that our enemies are outside,

2373
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
not inside this circle.

2374
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
Right. Thank you.

2375
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
So even though you mentioned

2376
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:19,000
it's only your small initial thoughts,

2377
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:23,000
it takes a heart which is big

2378
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
and that can generate

2379
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
a large amount of courage

2380
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:30,000
and also so as to overcome a barrier

2381
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
which is as high as a mountain, actually.

2382
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
Right. That's the stuff.

2383
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:38,000
We really appreciate that.

2384
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
And, well, actually,

2385
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:44,000
this related, but not that political

2386
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
or maybe political,

2387
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:49,000
sexuality has become a political issue as well.

2388
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
So one of our faculty members

2389
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
raised this question.

2390
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:56,000
Suppose you are talking to

2391
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:59,000
the conservative white Christians

2392
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:02,000
who feel threatened by the LGBTQ movement,

2393
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
who feel that they are losing

2394
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
their once-dominant social influence.

2395
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:11,000
So how would you encourage them to change?

2396
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:14,000
Well, I think it's along the very same lines

2397
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:15,000
that we were just discussing.

2398
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
I think it has to do with beginning,

2399
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:20,000
first, not with theological assessments,

2400
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:25,000
but with interpersonal relationship building,

2401
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:29,000
letting people actually tell you their story.

2402
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:32,000
Often I find in settings like that,

2403
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
this is less and less true, by the way,

2404
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
but it has been true,

2405
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:37,000
that people didn't believe

2406
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:41,000
that they knew anyone who was LGBTQIA.

2407
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:45,000
They didn't have any idea

2408
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:46,000
where those people were,

2409
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:47,000
but they were not in their life.

2410
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:48,000
Well, it turns out,

2411
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
as more and more people

2412
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
have been willing to explain

2413
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:53,000
and declare who they are

2414
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:56,000
and how they approach the world,

2415
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:59,000
they are discovering that their children,

2416
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:00,000
their grandchildren,

2417
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
their neighbors, their friends,

2418
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:07,000
their colleagues may either be LGBTQ

2419
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:12,000
or they may be related to people who are.

2420
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
And when that occurs,

2421
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:17,000
it's a privilege to actually welcome

2422
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
the knowledge of who someone

2423
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
actually understands themselves to be.

2424
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:24,000
So even though I maintain myself

2425
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:28,000
a traditional view of the theological

2426
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:31,000
and moral understandings of human sexuality

2427
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:34,000
that have been classic in Christianity,

2428
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:39,000
I don't do so as a wall against LGBT people

2429
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:43,000
or as a battering ram to defeat them.

2430
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:44,000
I want to hear them.

2431
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:45,000
I want to know them.

2432
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
I want to love them.

2433
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
I want to invite them into communion

2434
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:52,000
with me and with other people.

2435
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
I want them to not be isolated.

2436
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:57,000
I want them to not be self-loathing.

2437
01:50:57,000 --> 01:51:00,000
I want them to feel as much welcome

2438
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:03,000
as I can extend to them.

2439
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:06,000
And so I would encourage

2440
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
such a community, for example,

2441
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:11,000
to think carefully about who they really know

2442
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:14,000
and how they are going to love people.

2443
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:17,000
And I think every pastor has to work out

2444
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:20,000
in their own particular setting

2445
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
how they're going to help people

2446
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:26,000
do this kind of self-formational work.

2447
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
But it really has to begin

2448
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
by the same things we've just talked about,

2449
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:31,000
laying down power,

2450
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
laying down certainty,

2451
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
laying down self-righteousness,

2452
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
not righteousness, but self-righteousness,

2453
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:42,000
laying down a presumption of a theological exam

2454
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:43,000
at the very beginning,

2455
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:44,000
or a moral exam

2456
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
at the beginning of every relationship,

2457
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
which is not the way that any of us,

2458
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
in fact, actually live,

2459
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:53,000
nor would we want to live that way.

2460
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
So we want to know one another.

2461
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
We want to love one another.

2462
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:58,000
And there may be differences.

2463
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
Of course, there are differences

2464
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
in how we see the world

2465
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
and relate to one another.

2466
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
But I want to start with,

2467
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
as Dr. Chan said,

2468
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:11,000
I want to start with an attitude of humility

2469
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:12,000
and of deference.

2470
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
I want to listen very, very carefully.

2471
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:17,000
I want to hear their story.

2472
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:20,000
I want to understand and empathize

2473
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:24,000
with the way that their story has unfolded.

2474
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
Now, I believe that all of our stories

2475
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:29,000
are held by a larger story that's God's story.

2476
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:32,000
So eventually, in some way,

2477
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
verbal and nonverbal both,

2478
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:39,000
I want to help people who are LGBTQ2,

2479
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:42,000
if they don't already,

2480
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
understand how to hold their story

2481
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:47,000
in light of the greater story of God.

2482
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
That's a longer and more theological question.

2483
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
But on the pastoral level,

2484
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
I think it has to do with inviting people

2485
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
into honesty,

2486
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
into their own vulnerability,

2487
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:00,000
into their places of pain and shame

2488
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
and say, can you imagine

2489
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:05,000
what it's like to live in a community

2490
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
in which those realities

2491
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
are reinforced by the church.

2492
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
People feel worse about themselves.

2493
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:14,000
People feel more marginalized about themselves

2494
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:18,000
by the way the church has related to LGBT people.

2495
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
And frequently, the church has been

2496
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
a failure in loving people

2497
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:25,000
who don't live up to what we believe

2498
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:28,000
are biblical standards, perhaps.

2499
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:31,000
I'm deeply struck by your comment

2500
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
that it is a matter about

2501
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
loving and respecting your neighbors

2502
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:38,000
as creating the image of God.

2503
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:41,000
It's not about warring or battling

2504
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:45,000
for theological or ideological correctness.

2505
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
So this is a very important thing

2506
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
to remember, actually.

2507
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:52,000
And maybe another question,

2508
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:53,000
or perhaps that will be

2509
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
the one last question.

2510
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
Dr.Levitin, you talked about

2511
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
the influence from the media

2512
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
in the 1990s.

2513
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
So could you comment on the impacts

2514
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:07,000
on the social media in white evangelicals?

2515
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:10,000
Yes. Well, it's of course a problem,

2516
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:11,000
as I would say it,

2517
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
at least all around the world,

2518
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:14,000
or at least in places

2519
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:17,000
where social media dominance

2520
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:18,000
controls things,

2521
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
as social media does dominate things

2522
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
in the United States.

2523
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
So you have public media

2524
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:25,000
of various kinds,

2525
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
but then you have just the social media

2526
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:28,000
and all the networks

2527
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
and communication of messages

2528
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:33,000
which can be used as battering rams.

2529
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:34,000
And this is why

2530
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
it has been such a big deal

2531
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
in the last few days

2532
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:41,000
since Twitter no longer allowed

2533
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:44,000
President Trump to be able to

2534
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:47,000
post his declarations of various kinds,

2535
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:50,000
as you've probably

2536
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
or pleasantly experienced

2537
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
or seen or heard about.

2538
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:57,000
And he has a following on Twitter

2539
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:00,000
of something like 84 million people.

2540
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:06,000
So he would typically tweet

2541
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:09,000
usually several dozen messages

2542
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:10,000
over the course of a day

2543
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:13,000
to 84 million people.

2544
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:14,000
So let's just imagine

2545
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
he was the only person

2546
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
that was engaging in social media.

2547
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
And he would be the only person

2548
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:21,000
who would be able to

2549
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
be able to communicate with people.

2550
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
And he would be the only person

2551
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:26,000
who would be able to

2552
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
be able to communicate with people.

2553
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:29,000
And he would be the only person

2554
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:30,000
who would be able to

2555
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
be able to communicate with people.

2556
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:33,000
And he would be the only person

2557
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:34,000
who would be able to

2558
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
be able to communicate with people.

2559
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:37,000
And he would be the only person

2560
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:38,000
who would be able to

2561
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
be able to communicate with people.

2562
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:41,000
And he would be the only person

2563
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:42,000
who would be able to

2564
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
be able to communicate with people.

2565
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:45,000
And he would be the only person

2566
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:46,000
who would be able to

2567
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:47,000
be able to communicate with people.

2568
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:48,000
And he would be the only person

2569
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:49,000
who would be able to

2570
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:50,000
be able to communicate with people.

2571
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:51,000
And he would be the only person

2572
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:52,000
who would be able to

2573
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:53,000
be able to communicate with people.

2574
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:54,000
And he would be the only person

2575
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:55,000
who would be able to

2576
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:56,000
be able to communicate with people.

2577
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:57,000
And he would be the only person

2578
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:58,000
who would be able to

2579
01:55:58,000 --> 01:55:59,000
be able to communicate with people.

2580
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:00,000
And he would be the only person

2581
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:01,000
who would be able to

2582
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:02,000
be able to communicate with people.

2583
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:03,000
And he would be the only person

2584
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:04,000
who would be able to

2585
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:05,000
be able to communicate with people.

2586
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:06,000
And he would be the only person

2587
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:07,000
who would be able to

2588
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:08,000
be able to communicate with people.

2589
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:09,000
