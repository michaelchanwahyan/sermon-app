1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (gentle music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:15,000
 - I'll have to spend a minute to say that I'm very honored

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,680
 to be invited by Dr. Wong and to be in this occasion

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,160
 with esteemed teachers and scholars.

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,880
 I really don't know what I'm talking about,

6
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,160
 but I'm sure they'll bail me out.

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,000
 So I'll just fly away. (laughs)

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,320
 And I have to admit that Dr. Lepton was my teacher,

9
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,920
 so I have to agree 100% with what he says. (laughs)

10
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,240
 Speaking of that, yeah,

11
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,500
 I'll just share a little bit of my thoughts.

12
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:55,080
 Eugene Peterson, once in his introduction

13
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:59,760
 to the book of James, says, "When Christian believers

14
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,400
 "gathered in churches, everything that can go wrong

15
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,160
 "sooner or later does."

16
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,920
 So when people gathered, whether we call it a church

17
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,320
 or whatever social club, things will go wrong.

18
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,980
 So we have to at least accept that.

19
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:23,960
 And from the sharing of Dr. Lepton and I,

20
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,840
 I'm not in agreeing with him.

21
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,840
 Rather, I'm warmly reminded by him that,

22
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,280
 yes, the first topic we have to talk about

23
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,760
 is not about church relevance, but it's about God.

24
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,000
 God is a sustainer, God is a maker,

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,300
 God is a creator of everything.

26
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:47,760
 So first and foremost, we have to think and rethink

27
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,040
 about God first.

28
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,800
 Other than that, without this foundation,

29
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,440
 we're still talking about earthly establishment

30
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:02,100
 and how to be quote-unquote relevant to the people.

31
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:08,360
 And also, he reminds me that, and I'm part of the problem,

32
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,940
 is the foreign nature of humans,

33
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,940
 the brokenness of our lives, but we are still called

34
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:22,360
 and sent to this broken and sinful world

35
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,800
 and sometimes we do more harmful things

36
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,640
 than beneficial things.

37
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,800
 But still, God sends us as his ambassador

38
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,420
 and witnesses to this world.

39
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:40,360
 So there is a history, I think,

40
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,720
 in the history of Hong Kong churches too.

41
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,040
 That's why there is a period that churches

42
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,080
 will encourage believers to work hard,

43
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,080
 to have upward mobility to the upper levels of the society

44
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,980
 so we will have a bigger influence

45
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,100
 and a wider influence to the society

46
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:09,100
 so we thought there will be a good for the city.

47
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:15,760
 But when looking back of all these past 50 years or so,

48
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:20,880
 we may have a different perspective of that.

49
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,020
 So there's another point that sometimes

50
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:27,500
 we may be just borrowing the methods

51
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,080
 from the world, from business world.

52
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,640
 We want to compete with them.

53
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:35,500
 We want to be like them, to be relevant,

54
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,020
 quote-unquote, to the society,

55
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:43,020
 but end up, we're just like them instead of who we are.

56
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:48,300
 And even though he doesn't have this time to say,

57
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,420
 but from the note that is,

58
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,700
 he is very frankly and harshly to say

59
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,020
 that so much of the US white churches

60
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,820
 reflect the self-interest, individualistic safety

61
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,480
 and security of the culture.

62
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,380
 No wonder Christian nationalism

63
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,700
 are so prominent right now.

64
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:14,220
 Even in this statement, I think somehow

65
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,520
 it can apply to Hong Kong churches too, right?

66
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,500
 Of course, there's much to say.

67
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:24,500
 I'm sure he will speak more about that.

68
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:29,580
 But true, I think we do share a lot of the issues

69
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,660
 that we are facing from the Western churches

70
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,560
 and as well as the Hong Kong churches.

71
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,220
 Dr. Leblon also continues to say

72
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,580
 that the true relevance of the church

73
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,100
 must be on the ground.

74
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:49,100
 Must be in dialogue to the contemporary life,

75
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:53,860
 connects the questions, pains, injustice,

76
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:58,100
 hopes, communion and social transformation,

77
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,800
 stewardship of the earth, spiritual void and more.

78
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,720
 And I am in 100% agree with that.

79
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,020
 But just like students,

80
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,760
 I have more question marks than response.

81
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:21,260
 I think when we are trying to talk about church relevance

82
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:25,420
 to the time and space that the church,

83
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,620
 the local churches that they are in,

84
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:32,620
 I still think besides the theological foundation,

85
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:37,380
 there's also some preliminary steps,

86
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,860
 preliminary issues that we have to face head on

87
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:46,720
 before discussing the topic of church relevance.

88
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:53,660
 Number one, there's an article a few years ago

89
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,780
 from the UK media, The Guardian.

90
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:02,540
 The topic catches my memory to now.

91
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:06,560
 The topic says, now is the age of rage.

92
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,820
 The age of rage.

93
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:13,020
 Of course, there's arguments trying to argue that,

94
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:18,020
 is it that nowadays people are more angrier than before?

95
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,500
 Of course, there are pros and cons,

96
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,620
 there are some studies and some like

97
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,100
 objective observation or whatever.

98
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:31,100
 But yeah, in the sense that the article concludes that

99
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:36,120
 we can say that because we, a generation of angry people,

100
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:41,620
 including believers, but sometimes I feel that

101
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:45,280
 we really do not discuss this topic enough.

102
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,960
 Because we are believers, we just brush this aside.

103
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:54,960
 We want to live above this phenomenon

104
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,420
 because we have more to say to the world,

105
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:01,900
 but actually I think, at least for me, it may be my problem.

106
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:05,740
 So we are as angry as the society.

107
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,220
 When we are reading the news,

108
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,780
 when we are hearing the voice,

109
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:14,780
 we are watching the YouTubes or TikToks or whatever, right?

110
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:19,460
 All the things happening around us,

111
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:22,020
 no matter if it's big news or small news,

112
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:25,380
 or the daily lives, it makes me angry.

113
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:29,240
 Do we admit that?

114
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,420
 If we do not deal with this raw emotions,

115
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:39,080
 at least to me, because not only about the emotion,

116
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:43,080
 but because of the maybe hurt or puzzles

117
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:47,140
 or the whatever reason,

118
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:53,200
 we might not be ready to talk about relevance.

119
00:07:53,200 --> 00:08:00,920
 And ironically, even after this article in The Guardian,

120
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,680
 they have an ad to encourage people

121
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,820
 to write more articles for this media.

122
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:14,500
 It says, "When you have an army of lawyers after you,

123
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,020
 "when you want to say something

124
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,200
 "that some people want to stop you,

125
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,400
 "come to us, we will help you."

126
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:26,640
 See, we are discussing about the age of rage,

127
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,880
 but on the other hand,

128
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:32,080
 we are still promoting a competitive mentality.

129
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,960
 How we move on to the topic of relevance,

130
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,780
 if we are ready to fight.

131
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,800
 That's one thing.

132
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,320
 And the second point I want to raise

133
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,680
 instead of respond is,

134
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,760
 yeah, there was a period of time

135
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,540
 that churches may try to pursue power.

136
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:02,540
 To want to reach out to the greater audience

137
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,180
 because power is influence.

138
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:10,820
 But for the past few years, at least to me personally,

139
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:14,020
 when the people of God actually

140
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:18,820
 are also have some thirst for power too.

141
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,940
 How do I say that?

142
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:27,500
 Because I'm thinking that this thirst for power

143
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,900
 is not just a traditional view

144
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:33,740
 that we try to gain power

145
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,380
 to have a personal gain or something.

146
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,100
 A lot of people, believe us or not,

147
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,140
 have the thirst for power

148
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,840
 because they want to make some changes.

149
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,340
 They want to make some differences.

150
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:52,980
 But without that power, whatever that is,

151
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,420
 we feel powerless.

152
00:09:54,420 --> 00:10:01,380
 So if we do not feel some kind of power,

153
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:07,060
 talking about church relevance is still up there.

154
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:13,800
 Because, yeah, in Hong Kong we have many, many sayings,

155
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,620
 (speaking in foreign language)

156
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,220
 I don't know how to translate it in English.

157
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,020
 People who speak louder will be heard,

158
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,380
 something like that, right?

159
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,220
 (speaking in foreign language)

160
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:28,340
 Yeah, right, right, yeah, something like that.

161
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:32,100
 Without that, yeah, we feel powerless.

162
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,660
 So it leads to the third point.

163
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,300
 This is the age of rage.

164
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:40,640
 We thirst for spiritual power, physical power,

165
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,700
 whatever power.

166
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,380
 And leads to the third point is

167
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:49,740
 this is also a time or culture of indifference.

168
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:54,500
 Meeting all these big issues, right,

169
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,180
 when we are talking about injustice,

170
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:02,180
 about war, about race, about sexual identities,

171
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:06,220
 about whatever public,

172
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:13,300
 I think the powerlessness draw us into indifference.

173
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:17,800
 We don't care.

174
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:22,020
 Because I'm not saying,

175
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:25,220
 I do not agree that we are giving up.

176
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:28,600
 But because of this heavy sense of powerlessness,

177
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:33,180
 we just do not know what to do.

178
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:36,140
 And because of that,

179
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,540
 we are not talking about church relevance,

180
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,600
 we are talking survival.

181
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,380
 With our offices, with all the bullying

182
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,980
 because of the lack of workforce,

183
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:52,100
 we have all the family issues,

184
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,220
 we have the health issues

185
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:57,180
 because the society is getting old.

186
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:04,980
 The financial uncertainties in the future.

187
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:08,420
 We are talking about survival instead of relevance.

188
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:12,380
 Who cares about relevance now?

189
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:16,180
 I just want to live a decent life.

190
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:21,180
 I just want to be a possible believer

191
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,100
 in this days and age.

192
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:29,820
 Before, if we do not deal with these issues head on,

193
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,340
 talking about church relevance,

194
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,900
 just like in the 90s,

195
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,500
 we were talking about church growth.

196
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,740
 Let's do something together, right?

197
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,580
 Let's have some new ministries.

198
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:48,700
 So, from the personal individual faith

199
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:59,500
 to the public expression of our confession,

200
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:05,060
 at least to me, the gap is getting huge.

201
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,620
 It's getting bigger and bigger.

202
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:12,320
 So for a lot of believers nowadays,

203
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:17,940
 yeah, we are just trying to preserve ourselves

204
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,460
 not to fall into temptations

205
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:24,820
 or not doing something really bad.

206
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,220
 And I thank God for that.

207
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,680
 To have a bigger dream,

208
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,740
 to have a more complex discussion,

209
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:37,220
 for a lot of people, we do not have the capacity anymore

210
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:42,000
 because our brain is just so stuck with all these things,

211
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,640
 all these complex things already.

212
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:52,080
 Yeah, so to learn how to live sacrificially

213
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:59,860
 beyond our personal space,

214
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:05,040
 and then in Hong Kong context,

215
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:11,380
 I hope I do not offend a lot of people,

216
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,820
 we do not have much imagination.

217
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:20,320
 Our educational system trains us to,

218
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,920
 how do you say, the examination machine

219
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,200
 or something like that, right?

220
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,020
 Yeah, we just fill in the blanks,

221
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:32,200
 fill in the correct answers, and that's it.

222
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,280
 To have imagination, well, I'm using all the words

223
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,000
 from the topic, right? (laughs)

224
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:45,160
 Yeah, we're talking about, as he, Dr. Levin,

225
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:50,160
 beautifully say that the relevance from God,

226
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,200
 the description of the gospel,

227
00:14:52,200 --> 00:15:00,120
 and a lot of beautiful terminology,

228
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:05,120
 descriptions, words, but to a lot of people in Hong Kong,

229
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,760
 it's just a fussy picture.

230
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,420
 What does it look like?

231
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:15,420
 To be a relevant church to either to American

232
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:18,020
 or to the Hong Kong people, right?

233
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,180
 What does it look like?

234
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:24,240
 We have words only, we have descriptions only.

235
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:32,140
 So, therefore, but I do agree that not only

236
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:37,140
 not just because the difficulties of the points

237
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:47,740
 I presented, we stop talking about it.

238
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:52,500
 One of the reason I really like Fuller is

239
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:58,860
 if they're allowed, they will have courageous conversation

240
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,680
 on a lot of topics to the society,

241
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,940
 not only to theologic schools,

242
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:08,940
 but to different religious communities.

243
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:13,020
 I think in Hong Kong churches, at least,

244
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:19,060
 we should try to have a conversation to the society.

245
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:24,700
 And as I borrow one of the phrases that during the dinner

246
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,140
 that we talked about,

247
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:29,940
 evil in the risk of having aches in our face.

248
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:34,840
 Because we just don't talk about things.

249
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,960
 We just don't talk about a lot of things in Hong Kong churches

250
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:42,600
 therefore the people from the outside just think

251
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,320
 we are living in a different universe, right?

252
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:49,460
 Or maybe if I'm a Marvel fan, like a multiverse, right?

253
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,580
 We are doing different things.

254
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:54,180
 We do not know what is going on outside

255
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,560
 and the outside world doesn't know what's going on inside.

256
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:02,040
 But at least we open the door to have the courage

257
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,740
 at least to start conversation to the society.

258
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:10,120
 But at least in Hong Kong,

259
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:13,800
 just like in America when you're talking,

260
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,160
 like this year is election year, right?

261
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,340
 Who do you vote?

262
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,240
 And they will have a fist fight, right?

263
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,180
 We are talking about politics, at least to me.

264
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:29,100
 If we are talking about having our personal,

265
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:34,100
 individual, private faith to step outside to the public,

266
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,340
 we are touching the topic of politics.

267
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,860
 But in Hong Kong churches,

268
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:43,160
 at what cost?

269
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,140
 Which are beneficial,

270
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:51,800
 which are the red line.

271
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:56,940
 This is still the ongoing underlying tone

272
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:01,680
 of church relevance to us here.

273
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,840
 But I still encourage people to use our brain,

274
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,780
 to think hard, to study hard,

275
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,640
 and learn how to imagine.

276
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,460
 Because if God is not talking about

277
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,760
 an abstract kingdom of God thing,

278
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,980
 we have to do our job,

279
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,580
 use different languages to different people

280
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,220
 so we both can understand

281
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,620
 there is a concrete future in hand.

282
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:32,460
 If we do not give up the world right now,

283
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:37,060
 but to redeem, we have to use all our means,

284
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:40,420
 all our creative ideas, all our imagination

285
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:44,460
 to present to the world, to present to this Hong Kong.

286
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,760
 God is still in hand.

287
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,500
 God is still here.

288
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:53,500
 But we have to find our means and languages

289
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:59,140
 to encourage the imagination to continue.

290
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:02,140
 And I think that for the past few years,

291
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:05,060
 because of border restriction or whatever,

292
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,720
 I see hope too.

293
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,420
 Because Hong Kong people,

294
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:13,900
 no matter how you say (speaking in foreign language)

295
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,100
 the spirit of Man Rock, something like that,

296
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,620
 people are creative.

297
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:21,100
 People are creative.

298
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:26,100
 So keep imagining, keep thinking,

299
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,620
 keep trying things out.

300
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:32,980
 Because we are no in a moral high ground.

301
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,140
 We are not living in a different universe.

302
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:39,180
 We are just the same, just as weak,

303
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:42,580
 just as confused with the people outside.

304
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,700
 With a glass wall or whatever, it doesn't really matter.

305
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,540
 We are together.

306
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:53,820
 That's my humble response.

307
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:58,380
 (audience applauding)

308
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:05,300
 - Okay, thank you, Dr. Lebeden, for your excellent lecture.

309
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,220
 I will try to make it short.

310
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:11,460
 Some of the things, actually, Reverend Dr. Jackie

311
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,440
 has already said some of my points.

312
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,980
 Okay, I'll just concentrate on three words

313
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,980
 that Dr. Lebeden has mentioned

314
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,740
 at the beginning of his talk.

315
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:25,620
 He mentioned that the church should be embodied,

316
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:29,460
 it should be credible, and it should be beautiful.

317
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,900
 And I will just concentrate on these three words.

318
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:35,060
 And I just want to share a little bit

319
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:39,580
 the difficulty of trying to do these three things.

320
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:44,580
 I am a professor here in the College of Public Theology.

321
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:48,120
 And one of the things I get to do is,

322
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,480
 oh, my computer's gonna turn off.

323
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,520
 Anyway, one of the things I get to do

324
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,920
 is churches invite me to talk.

325
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,440
 And when there's some things the senior pastor,

326
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,080
 when he doesn't want to talk about that issue,

327
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,960
 he will invite me to talk about that issue

328
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,960
 because I can talk and I walk away, okay?

329
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,800
 And they can never invite me again.

330
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,900
 So I get to talk to different difficult issues,

331
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,900
 including issues about faith and politics.

332
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:20,900
 So I want just to share how difficult sometimes it is

333
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:24,980
 to have a gospel message which is both embodied,

334
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:27,180
 credible, and beautiful.

335
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,800
 Start with embodied.

336
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:33,800
 The difficulty with embodied gospel or gospel message,

337
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,620
 whether in words or in deeds,

338
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:40,220
 is sometimes it's gonna be very painful to be embodied.

339
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:43,620
 Now, there was a time when, you know, in the '50s,

340
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:47,140
 Hong Kong churches is a very embodied church, it was,

341
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:50,960
 because we gave out a lot of food for the refugees.

342
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,140
 Those were easy days, in a sense, to be embodied.

343
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,960
 The main restriction is maybe you don't have enough money

344
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,820
 to buy enough food for those refugees.

345
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,620
 And but then nowadays, it's a little bit different

346
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:06,480
 because today the main problem is not hunger

347
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,340
 although there's always hungry people in Hong Kong

348
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,580
 as in anywhere else in the world.

349
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,460
 But the main issue is not, you know,

350
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:16,740
 a lot of Hong Kong people are dying of hunger.

351
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,900
 The issue confronting us, a lot of it,

352
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:22,180
 like Reverend Jackie said, is very political.

353
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:27,100
 For example, some of the embodiment is enforced from above.

354
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:31,380
 The Chinese government tells us that the Hong Kong church

355
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,820
 should start with signification.

356
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:38,040
 We should have a Chinese version of Christianity.

357
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:43,040
 So for example, can we have a prayer day on October 1st,

358
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,160
 our national day?

359
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,960
 Now, somebody, for some churches,

360
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,720
 if we have a prayer meeting on October 1st,

361
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,900
 it's very appropriate.

362
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,000
 We are being embodied, we pray for our nations.

363
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,960
 But for some other people in Hong Kong,

364
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,920
 that will be a sign of your political situation

365
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:05,680
 that you're trying to appease the Chinese government.

366
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,600
 So if you're embodied in something,

367
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,420
 you make some other people angry.

368
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,700
 Or take another example,

369
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:16,520
 can we have a prayer meeting in June 4th?

370
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,840
 Dr. Ledbetter knows what's June 4th, right?

371
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,800
 Will police start knocking on our door

372
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,760
 if our church has a prayer meeting on June 4th?

373
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:33,560
 So when you try to be embodied in the concerns

374
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,920
 of some group of Chinese people,

375
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,800
 sometimes it can be dangerous,

376
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,140
 sometimes it can be painful,

377
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:42,960
 sometimes you can make part of the church very angry.

378
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,760
 So sometimes people don't,

379
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,760
 the church don't talk about issues in the society

380
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,720
 because like Dr. Jackie said,

381
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,440
 because it's too divisive.

382
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,280
 We don't want to get into all the pain

383
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,280
 and all the arguments.

384
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,600
 And I have no easy answer for that.

385
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,720
 I mean, it's not fair to expect Dr. Ledbetter

386
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,360
 to have an answer since it's not in Hong Kong.

387
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,880
 But that's something I struggle, you know?

388
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,120
 If being embodied means a lot of arguments and pain,

389
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,160
 how embodied the church should be?

390
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,580
 Or maybe the church should talk about heaven

391
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,840
 and just be appraised and let people forget

392
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,680
 about the pains of the world.

393
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,120
 Maybe, is it a better choice?

394
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,960
 I don't know, sometimes it may be.

395
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,680
 As a second thing about credible,

396
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,400
 I will try to make it real short.

397
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:35,080
 Sometimes when you are credible to one group of people,

398
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:39,480
 you become not credible to another group of people.

399
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:44,160
 For example, many of you know I am a board member

400
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,640
 of Society for the Truth and Light,

401
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,580
 which is respond to the LGBTQ movement.

402
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:55,580
 We try to deconstruct the arguments of the LGBTQ arguments.

403
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,720
 I have the experience of just writing something

404
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,680
 on Facebook because at that time there was an argument

405
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:06,680
 saying people like us, the Society for Truth and Light,

406
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,480
 they are worse than the Nazis.

407
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:13,480
 They want to kill all those LGBTQ people and so on.

408
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:17,880
 I wrote something in response to that kind of discourse.

409
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,760
 And then someone wrote on my Facebook,

410
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,100
 underneath my comment on my Facebook,

411
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,080
 on the comment section, they said,

412
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,800
 if people like me is ruling Hong Kong,

413
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,480
 we will just imprison all the LGBTQ people.

414
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,040
 I feel so sad about it.

415
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,520
 I mean, if I say something you don't like

416
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,960
 and you think it's wrong, that's fine.

417
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,440
 Criticize me, something I've said.

418
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,400
 But you are criticizing something I've never said.

419
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,040
 I never said anything about how to treat the LGBTQ people.

420
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,800
 I just try to deconstruct some of the arguments

421
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,920
 of that movement.

422
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:55,080
 And that guy, whoever that person is,

423
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,640
 just assume that's what I want to do.

424
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:01,160
 And I found that, so it's hard to be credible this way

425
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,400
 because if you are credible to one group,

426
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,060
 the other group, the opposite group,

427
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:09,840
 assume all kinds of discourse that you haven't spoken.

428
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,200
 So how to be credible?

429
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,480
 Must I choose side?

430
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,500
 If I choose to be credible to this group,

431
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:19,400
 I have to give up hope to be credible to another group.

432
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,960
 Must I choose side?

433
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,020
 The third point, being beautiful.

434
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:29,400
 I wish Dr. Leberton can say a little bit more about that.

435
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,800
 I find that that is being more and more important,

436
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,380
 particularly for the younger generation today.

437
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:41,200
 To use the vocabulary of Jonathan Evers,

438
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,800
 one of the greatest American theologians,

439
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,520
 the younger generation look for affections.

440
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,460
 They don't want good truth.

441
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:54,340
 They want words and pictures and actions

442
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:57,960
 that can arouse their affections.

443
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:01,420
 And I found the Hong Kong churches

444
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:04,640
 is not very good at that.

445
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,780
 I think me, the older generation,

446
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:10,680
 usually trained to think in a moralistic way.

447
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:14,240
 So any issue come up, the first question they ask,

448
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,280
 is it right or is it wrong?

449
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:21,000
 We always want to put it in a category called right or wrong.

450
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,120
 Sometimes the action of me doing that,

451
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:28,120
 laboring everything either as right or as wrong,

452
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:31,720
 looks offensive to the young people.

453
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,320
 And we break the communication

454
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,800
 without them really listening to what we are talking about.

455
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,620
 Beautiful means we do things and say things

456
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:44,240
 in a way that is attractive to people,

457
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,640
 appeal to their emotions,

458
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,560
 as well as proclaiming the truth.

459
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,560
 How can a church do that?

460
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:55,740
 Or how can a church train itself to do things in this way?

461
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,760
 I'm not sure.

462
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,940
 I honestly don't know.

463
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:01,880
 So this is a question I just pose to Dr. Lebutin

464
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:05,560
 and pose to all of you in case any one of you

465
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,720
 have some wisdom to share with us.

466
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,800
 So I'll stop my sharing here.

467
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,640
 Thank you.
