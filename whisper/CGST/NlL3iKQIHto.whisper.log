[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.640]   Good morning or good evening everyone, depending on where you are. Welcome to the final day
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:27.960]   of CJST Josephine's Soul Culture and Ethics lecture week. I am Esther Xue, assistant professor
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:37.080]   of biblical studies. We are so honored to have our keynote speaker Dr. Labberton with us at the start
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:47.920]   of 2021 via this virtual platform. Besides his role as president of Fuller Theological Seminary,
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:56.160]   Dr. Labberton also serves in several significant world ministry institutions. Particularly,
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:03.160]   he's known as leadership with scholar leaders international and John Stott ministry,
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:11.120]   that is, Lim-Hamm partners. Actually, I can survive through my PhD partly because I've
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:19.120]   been supported spiritually and financially by these two institutions. Thanks, Dr. Labberton.
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:28.480]   I believe we were so inspired by your fruitful lectures in the past three days. You have
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:37.160]   clearly shown the cultural locations and the key factors of the crisis of American white
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:46.720]   evangelicalism and your reflections on them shed light on the situation of Hong Kong or Chinese
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:56.720]   evangelical churches. Well, after the crisis, finally we move forward to today's topic on hope.
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:05.560]   Please join with me to welcome Dr. Labberton to present on evangelicalism still or not yet,
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:13.680]   to explore how the crisis of American white evangelicalism requires the restoration is
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:22.520]   a soul by discovering is a source and hope. Thank you very much. I appreciate again being
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:29.640]   here. I have been very warmly welcomed by all of you and I'm grateful for that. I want to say
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:36.960]   again, my special thanks to your president, Dr. Stephen Lee, for the invitation to come and be
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:44.640]   part of these lectures. And I look forward, I hope to one day being able to visit CGST in person.
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:51.720]   Again, it's a community that I have had connection with for over 30 years. And I'm extremely
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.760]   grateful for your ministry and for your life together. I'm aware of the significant challenges
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:04.400]   that many churches throughout Asia and particularly in Hong Kong are facing these days. And
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:11.040]   therefore my own particular gratitude for your willingness to allow me to be part of your
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.960]   conversation. And I hope and pray as I have from the beginning that these days together will be
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:27.120]   useful to you. So the title of this final lecture, as we've heard is evangelicalism still or not yet.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.360]   You'll notice in the English spelling of this, that there's a hyphenation between evangel and
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:41.040]   ecolism. And one of the arguments that I want to make is represented by that simple construct.
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:50.720]   That is that it's the evangel, Jesus and the kingdom of God, which is central. Ecolism names a
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:58.720]   movement, a body of people, a set of cultural practices and theological and spiritual and ethical
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.880]   stances that have been taken in light of the gospel. But I want to argue tonight that our hope
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:12.960]   is found in thinking again about the evangel and letting that be what defines who we are and how
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:20.080]   we live in the world. So let me begin then by saying this, if there's going to be hope, which
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:25.360]   I definitely believe there is, our American evangelical is going to find it by claiming
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:32.720]   that we are "still evangelical" or asking the question, are we yet evangelical?
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:41.600]   In the first construct, are we still evangelical? The claim can often be that it's like a destination
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:48.880]   at which some have already arrived or a trajectory, by contrast, a direction,
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:56.400]   but by no means yet reached. If we're claiming that we're still evangelical, it seems to me that
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:02.800]   we are in danger of claiming that we have arrived and that we need to hold on to the terrain that
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:10.080]   was defended and claimed before. But if we ask the question, are we yet evangelical?
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:17.040]   We're asking, is our life and our ministry, individually, personally, and institutionally,
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:24.400]   is it a reflection of the evangel itself? That puts us on a very, very different trajectory.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:32.240]   In other words, is evangelical an identity that we claim like a badge that we could put on our chest?
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.960]   Or is evangelicalism an invitation?
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:49.920]   Is evangelical mission an exercise in dominion with territory claimed and a flag firmly planted?
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:58.880]   Or is evangelical mission a witness to the invitation to find life in the kingdom of God
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:07.520]   and to become part of a new community that seeks to be an embodied reflection of Jesus Christ?
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:17.200]   To pose these binary alternatives reflects the ways that I find aspects of American evangelicalism
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:24.160]   to be tragic and offensive to the gospel itself. Encroaching on the unique supremacy and authority
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:33.520]   of Jesus is, sadly, a deceptive duplicity that subverts the primary and the primacy and character
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:43.440]   of Jesus and supplants it with American culture dressed in gospel garb, gospel clothing. It can
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:52.160]   make the sounds of the gospel while it lives a different and divergent story. Of course, it must
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:07:05.280]   be said that no expression of the gospel is free from compromise and human distortion.
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:15.360]   And in Romans, or rather in Matthew 28, it is an astonishing thing that Jesus gives
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:23.040]   the great commission that we call the mission that defines the mission of God's people in the
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:30.080]   world to 11 disciples, the text points out, not the perfect number 12, but just to 11.
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:36.320]   And the text says that some believed and some doubted. And in Greek, it's that some believed
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:43.360]   and doubted. It's that the same people both believed and doubted. The church is always fewer
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:48.480]   numbers than we would hope. And it's always far from being the true and
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:57.760]   doubtless people that we might imagine. To Jesus, this band of 11 believer doubters,
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:06.400]   11 believer doubters, this band was the right group to be God's witnesses to nothing less
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:15.760]   than the hope of the world. This is all part of the shocking evangel. God's redeeming love and
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:24.320]   justice in Jesus Christ should ground and to find a new communion or community of disciples
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:33.600]   on a journey of transformation. If the question is not still evangelical, but rather yet evangelical,
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:42.960]   then American white evangelicalism could begin the kind of reset that only the evangel itself
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:48.400]   offers. Some of the primary elements of Bebbington's quadrilateral depiction of
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:56.400]   evangelicalism, which we discussed earlier, could contribute to the reclamation and recreation
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:04.480]   of American white evangelicalism. So let me begin by making several points. The first is this,
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:12.480]   the hope for American white evangelicalism lies in the evangel. It does not lie in evangelicalism.
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:22.320]   The hope of evangelicalism in America is born by the evangel, not by evangelicalism itself.
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:29.600]   The hope is not that the ickle-ism of evangelicalism, past or present, that is not our
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:38.880]   hope. Agendas, personalities, structures, assumptions, prerogatives cloud and encrust
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:56.400]   the evangel and attach to it like barnacles to some kind of port. The ickle-isms encase
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:05.280]   God's living word inside a particular set of language games regarding abortion, human sexuality,
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:16.000]   race, gender, mannerliness, control, and doctrine. So around the evangel, in other words,
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:25.360]   are these barnacles or these attachments that are claiming that they are virtually equal to the
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:31.920]   evangel itself. A similar set of religious codes conscripted first century Israel.
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:39.120]   It was into that context that Jesus announced the arrival of the kingdom of heaven or the kingdom of
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:49.840]   God and called unlikely disciples and generously taught and healed Jew and Gentile, righteous and
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:56.720]   unrighteous alike. Jesus embodied a scandal that refused the boundaries of acceptability,
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:04.160]   that confronted the abusive control of Sabbath keeping, that honored the good Samaritan,
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:12.000]   and that saw in the faith of a Roman centurion a faith that exceeded that which he had seen
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:21.440]   in all of Israel. In other words, Jesus subverts the practices and claims of dominion and nationalism
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:28.800]   and individualism and agency and fear, not least those things done in the name of God.
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:38.240]   All of this meant paring away what was assumed to be primary in order to actually hear what was
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:45.840]   primary, the good news that was and is truly good because of Jesus Christ.
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:54.160]   American white evangelicals need the evangel to save us from ourselves.
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:12:01.280]   We need to be delivered, rescued from evangelicalism. Upsetting the money changers
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:08.640]   in the temple seems like the right picture. We stand inside the faith, but we in one sense or
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:16.160]   another need the faith that has been practiced to be overthrown. Procuring and providing implements
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:23.120]   of worship, but distorting and distracting people from true worship was the problem in the temple.
[00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:31.920]   When Jesus flips the tables and calls them thieves and a den of robbers, he exposes
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:39.840]   what had been unassailable, and it changes everything about identity, power, money,
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:49.120]   control, and more. It was a religious, social, and economic system that was being dismantled
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:57.920]   at that moment, as well as confronted. Is it too much to believe that American white evangelicalism
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:04.400]   is in need of the same confrontation? The purpose is not deserved judgment,
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:12.640]   but instead the discovery of the good news again, and as it were for the first time.
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:22.960]   The evangelicals need to be converted back to the evangel. The presumptions of evangelicals
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:29.280]   undermines the ability to allow the good news to do its fundamental confrontation,
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:35.920]   conviction, repentance, lament, and reconstruction.
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:47.200]   Zacchaeus got this to the core, and it changed his inner life and his public life. It meant
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:54.000]   tangible actions of reparation in place of acts that up to that point had been all about
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:03.120]   self-preservation. He got the word Jesus was making, that Jesus was making all things new,
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:09.280]   and that meant all of him for the sake of all who are around him.
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:17.840]   As evangelicals, we are known for talking conversion, but we do not necessarily practice it
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:26.560]   ourselves. The ongoing work of letting the actual evangel be our life is not the same
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:35.360]   as living inside evangelical culture. Allowing Jesus Christ to confront and to break American
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:42.160]   evangelicalism of its distractions and its idols would be essential for its revival.
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:52.400]   Do we need a road to Damascus confrontation? Saul was, after all, so assured that his spiritual,
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:15:00.160]   theological, and political pedigree were in place. Dominion, nationalism, identity,
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:08.320]   agency, and fear were in full flight. And then, on the road to Damascus,
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:16.240]   the risen Christ confronts him when he is right in the middle of his own self-righteous crusade
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:22.880]   with a life-redefining question. "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?"
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:32.160]   Cast down and blinded for three days, but also fed and kept by God's provision.
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:39.760]   And then he was unexpectedly welcomed by the touch of Ananias' words.
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:47.600]   "Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road by which you came,
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:54.320]   has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit."
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:16:04.960]   What confronts and redeems Saul is the evangel. It's not evangelicalism.
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:13.520]   Through his blindness, through later 13 years of study and reflection, Paul lives as a mature,
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:22.960]   imperfect reflection of an unexpected evangel that was still in the process of making him, Paul,
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:32.480]   new. American white evangelicalism needs to hear and receive Jesus' confronting question.
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:43.600]   "Why do you make my good news look and sound so bad?" We need the evangel to rescue us.
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:48.720]   The next point is this, that American white evangelical
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:58.480]   needs the evangel to help evangelicalism die. The apostle's birthright, his personal pride,
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:06.320]   his persecuting dominion over Jesus' followers, his religious stature as a Pharisee of Pharisees,
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:13.200]   his political identity as a Roman citizen, had to become, as he says in Philippians, "dumb."
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:19.920]   It was this dismantling of Saul that allowed him to become Paul.
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:25.200]   The mark of his conversion was not in holding on to the prerogatives
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:33.520]   and privileges of which he had so understandably been proud while learning to profess Jesus.
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:46.000]   Rather, his proud religious life, his public life, had to die so the new life in Christ could be born.
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:55.760]   Laying down his trophies to identify, as he says, with the fellowship of Christ's sufferings
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:18:05.360]   led Paul to speak and embody an entirely different life, completely unlike the life
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:11.280]   that he had led before his conversion on the Damascus Road and the events that followed.
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:19.840]   The success of American white evangelicalism has exposed, ironically, its failure.
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:28.160]   By choosing to pursue the road of victory that has not led to human, ecclesial, or social thriving
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:34.800]   for American white evangelicalism, but too often, as we've explored, to a barren and shameful display
[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:42.720]   of self-serving appetites and self-protective interests, this is hardly a mirror of the Lord
[00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.960]   that we claim to trust and follow.
[00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:54.720]   American white evangelicalism is a part of the body of Christ that cannot be remade without
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:19:01.760]   dying to significant elements of our common life. The death that is needed must confront
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:10.480]   its idolatrous assumptions, as we've thought, about dominion, nationalism, and individualism,
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:19.600]   about whiteness, and agency, and fear. These are the primary posts that define the broken
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:25.040]   and scandalous architecture within which American white evangelicalism has been built.
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:34.160]   Life in Christ cannot thrive in this prison of privilege. These things are a betrayal of an
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:40.960]   evangel-centric life, and they substitute human categories and privileges that are bent against
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:48.480]   the humble purposes of God's redemptive reign. Failure to put these things to death exposes their
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:57.440]   power and our false allegiance. No wonder American churches are being vacated by young adults and
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:05.200]   teenagers who fail to see a basic integrity of life that matches faith. Why should these young
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:12.480]   people not leave? When we make them the problem, that is, the young adults and teenagers,
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:19.280]   and fail to see that we, that is, the holders of the treasures of white evangelicalism in America,
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:27.040]   that we are the problem, the scale of the crisis only grows darker. We fail to see what we have to
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:34.640]   first admit so that we can be changed. If, for example, American white evangelicalism
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:42.160]   had truly repented of its deep complicity in racism and its participation in centuries of
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:48.640]   torturous and abusive slavery, that would utterly change what has become the nearly impossible
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:56.080]   conversation today about reparations, that is, paying back in some way the people who are
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:21:05.520]   descendants of slaves. This willingness would not be expected of a self-interested secular nation.
[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:12.560]   Of course our secular nation is not interested in that. But the people of God? Would it not be
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:18.800]   the natural outcome of a true dying to the offense and scandal of slavery and the contemporary
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:25.760]   entanglements with racism and white supremacy? For at least the people of God in the 21st century
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:34.400]   to work on behalf of appropriate reparations for slaves' descendants. Perhaps reparations from the
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:41.760]   nation may not come, but for the role of American white evangelicals to raise reparations for their
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:48.880]   role in the defense and benefit from slavery. The promises of Zacchaea echo. "Look, Lord,
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:57.520]   here and now I give half of my positions to the poor, and if I cheated anybody out of anything,
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:07.120]   I will pay back four times the amount." Jesus said to him, "Today salvation has come to this house,
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:16.880]   because this man too is a son of Abraham. For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost."
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:26.000]   What is the point of American white evangelicals defending and arguing against the witness of
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   black and brown Christians and others in the United States who testify to suffering
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:39.120]   because of whiteness in general and Christian whiteness in particular? Would not a spiritual
[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:46.400]   humility empower God's people to seek the truth, to name reality, to take responsibility,
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:51.280]   to confess wrong, to repent, and to truly start again?
[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:58.400]   It is hard to find this as a deep track in the history of the American white evangelical church.
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:07.840]   It has not profoundly and pervasively happened, and the proof lies in the ongoing legitimacy of
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:14.480]   the Christian movement that can so appropriately be labeled American white evangelicalism.
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:22.000]   That total phrase would never be needed if the American church, white evangelical church,
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:29.040]   had responded. The unnamed but ever-present reality of whiteness shows the willingness
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:35.520]   of millions of Christian people to die to their cultural and racial privilege.
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:44.560]   White evangelicals profess that dying leads to living, but that is true only if we live our
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:53.760]   dying. The next point is this, that the death of American white evangelicalism could actually be
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:24:00.960]   its birth. Revivals are typically defined by church historians as a combination of two
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:09.280]   simultaneous factors, evidence both of personal transformation and of social transformation.
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:16.880]   The need for each contributes to the necessity of the other. The admission that personal change
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:24.160]   is required in order to produce social change, and social change without personal change
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:32.240]   may be too superficial to make enduring change last. Let's hypothetically imagine that the
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:39.520]   portrait of American white evangelicalism that I've given you is sufficiently accurate to bring
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:47.360]   many to their knees, and by God's grace, to usher in a revival of a deep and transformative kind.
[00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:55.440]   Please join me in an imaginary exercise of how a story of revival in America,
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:25:02.400]   not of secular and multi-religious society that America is, but of the American white
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:11.840]   evangelicals themselves. The story might read like this, dateline January 2020, or even better,
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:20.480]   now January 2021. American white evangelicals in several cities and towns are showing themselves
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:27.360]   in an entirely new way. In place of their typically proud and adamant rhetoric of confidence,
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:36.800]   we are hearing now new voices with an entirely different tone. Rather than them pointing blame
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:44.080]   at others, these evangelicals are realizing the responsibilities that they have failed to practice,
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:49.920]   quietly at first, but now building in congregations and other gatherings.
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:58.000]   This community that we have heard from with such stridency is now making confession.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:06.960]   People who described themselves previously as unwilling to hear and accept the experience of
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:13.920]   others, especially others who do not share their racial social background, are normally listening
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:19.360]   to their brothers and sisters of color. It's like they are actually hearing these stories
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:28.800]   for the first time. The report could go on perhaps like this, immigrants seeking justice,
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:35.680]   having had their child taken from them and caged before, are telling their stories,
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:42.160]   and in place of defending borders and denying compassion and care for vulnerable people,
[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:49.200]   American white evangelicals are at the borders weeping and acknowledging the fears that have
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:56.080]   kept them so angry and defensive that they would want to keep other people out.
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:27:02.240]   Gatherings of white evangelicals, the report might go on, are now happening at the southern
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:09.600]   U.S. border, and people who fought for the wall to be built are now lamenting at the suffering
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:14.960]   that they have helped cause. They're gathering with Latino leaders in different parts of the
[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:22.480]   country, and they're trying to start over in hearing the stories and grasping the injustice
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:33.360]   perpetrated against Latinos, too often previously unsupported by white evangelicals, but now
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:42.880]   supported and cared for. The report could go on, tours of the sites of lynchings against
[00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:48.960]   black men and women in America in the past are now being swamped by gatherings of white evangelicals,
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:55.600]   as are some of the primary sites of the Underground Railroad and of the Civil Rights
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:28:02.160]   Movement in the 1960s. Reading groups seem to be springing up everywhere in towns and cities,
[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:08.000]   and in evangelical white churches who are listening to the profound words of
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:15.360]   Frederick Douglass and W.E.B. Du Bois and of Martin Luther King and of Ruby Bridges
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:24.160]   and of Fannie Lou Hamer and of James Baldwin and of Malcolm X and of Ta-Nehisi Coates.
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:31.440]   These are all African Americans in America. Publishers are reporting significant increases
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:36.880]   the report would go on in the sales of such writers, and the prominence of these voices
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:44.080]   is finally continuing to grow. It is like something that was never really seen or understood
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:50.480]   or trusted is now front and center in American evangelical circles.
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:58.240]   What's more than this is that there are scenes of home and community gatherings just for confession.
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:03.680]   People are admitting the ways that they've defended themselves and rejected the voices
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:09.200]   of others who are not like them. A related but different movement seems to be developing in
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:14.960]   churches that have treated women as second-class people and likewise need to be repented of.
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:19.760]   They're being invited by their male pastors to tell their stories with trust
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:27.360]   so these women's voices can now be heard and believed. And where actions are needed,
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:33.760]   including legal action, they will take such steps and where appropriate admit their complicity.
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:39.520]   A theme of those that we have met is that what is happening is personal,
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:46.320]   the report would go on, but also institutional. People realize that it is not just about a change
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:52.400]   of hearts and minds, but about changes in the structures and habits of our public lives
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:59.120]   that need to be changed as well. This feels revolutionary. A Black pastor and a Latino
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:03.840]   leader said this was deeper and broader than they have ever seen it before.
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:11.520]   It is not measured at this point, they said, by demonstrations, but by gatherings or services of
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:19.440]   confession and lament and healing led by Black, Latino, and Asian leaders of their churches.
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:28.960]   Stay tuned for more. Now this little imaginary exercise of mine is not a pure dream.
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:35.200]   Such things are happening among some American white evangelicals,
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:41.920]   but by too small a percentage. Only a deep work of the Spirit of God
[00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:54.880]   would make it possible for such events to develop as an organic reset of American white
[00:30:54.880 --> 00:31:02.240]   evangelicalism. I share this dream with gospel hope, but also with deep sorrow.
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:10.480]   I think Jesus is the one who weeps over Washington, D.C. in recent weeks, or New York, or Boston,
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:18.400]   Chicago, or Los Angeles, and wants to see revival. God's fulfillment will come,
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:28.640]   but we are in the already and not yet in between, following the one in Jesus Christ who is with us
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:35.520]   on a long journey, which is never complete in this life, where faith will finally become sight,
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:42.560]   and where we see fully and no longer through a glass darkly. We are given confidence,
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:52.320]   but not certainty. We are straining on at this point, but not yet arrived. We live in trust
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:56.560]   for what we have not yet fully seen.
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:32:05.920]   Let's do something more modest, if nonetheless profound. After more than two decades of
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:11.280]   ministry surrounded by the University of California, Berkeley, I can say that it is
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:17.760]   an icon of secularism in America. I was there serving as a pastor in Berkeley, surrounded by
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:24.320]   the campus, and I very seldom found people unwilling to engage with issues and debates
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:30.160]   of religious meaning, as long as there was room for mystery and humility,
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:39.840]   for an acknowledgment of unfinishedness and uncertainty. Christian faculty at the University
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:45.440]   of California, Berkeley, they may not have had an easy time communicating with colleagues
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:51.360]   and students about how to understand the world through the lens of the Bible,
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:33:00.800]   but even so, it was imaginable if two things were present. If the professor gave true evidence of
[00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:08.720]   genuine humility, and second, if they gave an evidence of an honest life, consistent with a
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:18.960]   complicated world in the midst of their profession of faith. If either humility or true action of
[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:26.480]   honesty and candor were absent, the result from students would be derision. In the presence of
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:33.120]   both of these things, there could be debate, but there could also be respectful silence.
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:41.760]   I remember one time when there were huge campus demonstrations on the campus of the University
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:48.480]   of California, Berkeley, that were largely led by Jewish students against what they saw as
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:55.760]   Islamic fascism. And on the central plaza of the campus, there had been daily gatherings
[00:33:55.760 --> 00:34:03.920]   during this one week of thousands of students from Monday to Friday. On the Friday of that week,
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:10.400]   during the last day of demonstrations, a remarkable undergraduate, who was a white
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:16.880]   evangelical woman that I know, a student, who had been present to support and encourage the
[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:23.600]   dialogue between Jews and Muslims, took the microphone in the closing moments as the sun
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:31.120]   was beginning to go down over the plaza. She was known by people there, and she was known as a
[00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:38.240]   Christian, but she had credibility to be able to say to the audience of Jews how grateful,
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:44.720]   and Muslims, how grateful she had been for the week of dialogue, as passionate as it had been.
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:53.120]   And then she surprised everyone by unexpectedly asking a group of Jews and Muslims a very
[00:34:53.520 --> 00:35:01.520]   straightforward question. She simply said, "Please raise your hand if you believe that Jesus was the
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:10.160]   son of God." Not one person in this crowd of thousands did so. She would have known that.
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:16.560]   And in the stillness of this moment, and with a very humble and earnest heart,
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:21.760]   she slowly said to them all, "I love you."
[00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:32.160]   The typically cynical editor of the student newspaper later muted something like this.
[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:41.280]   "I saw, I saved the last word of this editorial to honor Tinley Ireland," the young woman who had
[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:49.760]   spoken, "and for what she did on that final afternoon. I don't know or believe in her God,
[00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:57.920]   but whatever that is, and whatever love that is, I need."
[00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:10.320]   This is an authentic witness, a credible evidence of the presence, love, justice, and respect
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:15.200]   that the gospel, the evangel itself, is meant to produce.
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:23.360]   If American white evangelicals could begin a process of rebirth,
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:29.280]   then American white evangelicals must recover a genuinely Christian identity.
[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:36.080]   The crisis of American white evangelicalism can be summed up in the inadequacy, if not the absence,
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:44.640]   of these two qualities. In place of humility, often an overreaching confidence that they and
[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:52.480]   they alone know and define the truth. In a place of honesty, an admission of weakness and limitation,
[00:36:52.480 --> 00:37:01.040]   they proclaim and over-assert what they don't know fully, but claim to know and enact consistently.
[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:10.880]   This is what exposes the unacceptable hypocrisy to so many. What aspects of Christian identity
[00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:18.880]   of white evangelicals seem to have lost? We might start here, that as it says in the Heidelberg
[00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:25.600]   Catechism, the answer to question one, "What is your only hope in life and in death?"
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:34.400]   To which the answer is, "We belong not to ourselves, but that in body and soul,
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:40.640]   in life and in death, we belong to our faithful Savior, Jesus Christ."
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:49.360]   If we read this in light of the gospel narratives, we do not then embrace a mere theological frame,
[00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:56.800]   but a new way of being in the world that challenges and reprioritizes all other
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:38:03.680]   assumptions of our social, economic, racial, ethnic, and educational identity. Our life is a
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:10.960]   life now "hidden in Christ," and in relationship to which we come by the power of the Spirit to
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:19.440]   live into this new reality that God says is new. Christ died to make this, which is necessary,
[00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:27.120]   namely our redemption and reparation, possible since we cannot redeem ourselves. This is the
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:36.640]   identity into which we are meant to grow as maturing disciples. When we are baptized and
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:42.480]   we acknowledge entering into Christ's death and resurrection, and our own dying and rising,
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:49.760]   it is not a mere religious ceremony, but a sacred and public sign of the beginning of a new life.
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:58.080]   This is a communal reality, not just an individual one, and it happens before the church
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:05.520]   and in some sense before the world. It is our identity, not my identity alone,
[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:13.200]   and it is with and for God's glory, including but not defined by my desires. And it's for the
[00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:21.040]   building up of the body of Christ, including but not defined by my gifts, and the evidence of God's
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:29.600]   life-transforming reign in whatever context we consider, including but not bound by my own
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:37.440]   social location, as Paul says, or to me to live as Christ and to die as gain.
[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:47.040]   If American white evangelicals were to live this identity and find new life, find hope,
[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:54.960]   it means letting some things die, letting die our sense of self-definition, our sense of
[00:39:54.960 --> 00:40:03.200]   individualism, our sense that we hold primary agency, our sense that our Christian identity
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:09.840]   is primarily private and inward, our sense that we are followers of Jesus,
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:15.280]   marked with his death and resurrection, and filled with his spirit and joined to others
[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:22.880]   who share that new life and that look like us. Our sense, in other words, that we are first white
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:30.000]   or American or male, rather than realizing we are first Christ's people.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:37.680]   American white evangelicals would also not only need to recover a Christian identity,
[00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:43.440]   but recover a Christian sense of location. According to the Apostle Paul,
[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:50.240]   our first and foremost location as Christian disciples is that we live, quote, "in Christ."
[00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:58.400]   This picture of our lives is both mystical and theological, but it is also more incarnational
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:06.240]   than those categories alone might suggest. To be in Christ is to grow up in the capacity to see
[00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:15.360]   and think and feel and engage in communion with others, to re-socialize one another in Christ.
[00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:21.840]   To be in Christ is to dwell in our divine communion of Father, Son, and Spirit.
[00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:27.040]   And this is deeply inward, but not private and not only personal.
[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:35.920]   The need to realize our Christian social location. If American white evangelicals were to live
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:43.760]   in Christ, it means letting some things die, that this place is ours, that our social location
[00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:51.360]   is first and foremost where we choose to live, that we, that is white evangelicals,
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:56.800]   are in the top location, that our social location is neutral when it's clearly not,
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:42:03.440]   that we know the truth and the wisdom and the decisions to make, and that our only life in
[00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:10.240]   Christ knows how to learn to read our home, our town, and our nation.
[00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:19.280]   American white evangelicals, in addition to identity and location, need to recover
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:26.880]   Christian communion. God's people, we together here, right at this moment,
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:33.520]   in Hong Kong, around the Chinese world, wherever that you might be listening,
[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:41.040]   and around the United States and throughout the whole globe, we are to be the living evidence
[00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:48.480]   that Christ died and rose. And according to Philippians 2, we do so by showing that we have
[00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:57.040]   died and risen to be part of a new humanity, a new communion of unlike people. This is how
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:03.920]   and why the church is to be. If American white evangelicals were to live out this, what would
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:10.720]   need to die? We would need to crucify the pride and presumption of our social location. We would
[00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:16.560]   need to repent and lament and reconcile and restore our past and be willing to understand
[00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:22.960]   what we need to release about the expectation of finding a church that is basically finding comfort
[00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:31.040]   instead of finding transformation. Finally, the future and hope of American white evangelicalism.
[00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:39.120]   God's repertoire of recreating anything, whether it's the Chinese church or CGST
[00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:45.760]   or Fuller Theological Seminary or American white evangelicalism, is without limit.
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:54.880]   God has every capacity and desire and will and purpose to recreate us. God can and God will do
[00:43:54.880 --> 00:44:01.760]   what God can and will do. Depending on the theological tradition that we are in, we have
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:08.480]   presuppositions about what God might do. I'm here not as the prophet to declare what God will do,
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:14.640]   but to suggest what seems needed. All of these comments that I've tried to share with you
[00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:22.240]   are conditioned by God's choosing to be and do what he does in Jesus Christ. Perhaps the least
[00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:27.360]   likely possible strategy for the redemption of the world that could have been imagined,
[00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:35.760]   that a Jewish first century male who incarnates nothing less than the whole of God's character
[00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:45.200]   in life, is the one by whom the whole world, in all of its difference and diversity,
[00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:53.520]   in all of its crisis and urgency, can be saved by Jesus Christ. This is not a strategy any of
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:45:00.800]   us would have devised, but it is at the very core, it is the heart and the heartbeat of the evangel
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:09.600]   itself. Therefore, God's true heart and truth and imagination continue to hold our goodness
[00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:16.560]   and our brokenness and any hope for our redemption, including hope for the white
[00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:22.720]   American evangelicalism we've been discussing. I do not presume God will do what seems to my
[00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:31.920]   perspective to be so needed. What I trust is that God is good, that God is near, and that God will
[00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:41.360]   complete what he has begun. So for the sake of scattering the understandable despair or resignation
[00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:47.200]   that I find in some of the crisis of God's church in the 21st century, let's remember that the
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:54.640]   enterprise that we are a part of is that we know as reality to be God's wondrous project.
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:46:05.360]   This mess that I've described as white American evangelicalism is also part of the body of
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:12.080]   Christ himself. We do not come to the table that is about human enterprise and effort,
[00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:21.440]   but to the table of God's unending love and mercy and justice. The purposes for which the world has
[00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:28.800]   been made, the goodness with which God has created, the severe brokenness that God is
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:35.760]   redeeming in the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, and the new creation that is initiated in the
[00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:43.280]   resurrection, the end to which God is moving all things by the presence and power of the Holy Spirit
[00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:50.640]   in the people of God and in the world. These are the solid grounds of our collective hope,
[00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:59.360]   and to that we give thanks and praise every day. In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:12.160]   Thanks, Dr. Nebiton, for this insightful lecture. I align with you that our hope is evangel,
[00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:18.960]   the true gospel, not in the ecologies of evangelicalism's past or present.
[00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:26.560]   The future and the hope is in God's wondrous project. Thanks, Dr. Nebiton.
[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:38.640]   For all the audience, if you have questions, you can post on our website in the live streaming page.
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:49.440]   Please scroll down the web page after the live streaming in Putonghua. There is a Q&A section
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:59.120]   where you can input your questions after you put in your name. Now, let's welcome our two respondents.
[00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:09.440]   Wenz Guang, our associate professor in practical studies, will respond first. And then, Dr. Hong
[00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:18.000]   Liang, our assistant professor in theological studies, will respond next in Mandarin, or you
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:23.920]   prefer in German, but not sure whether our translator can do their jobs. I'm kidding.
[00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:27.040]   Mandarin, please. Yeah, Wenz.
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:44.720]   Dr. Labaton's lectures went far beyond academic scholarship or sophisticated inspiration.
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:53.120]   We have been trusted with deep sharing that reflects an honest soul-searching that is brave
[00:48:53.120 --> 00:49:03.440]   enough to deconstruct what defines one's own identity. This week has been a call to repentance
[00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:12.080]   for all of us. Now, after four sessions of problem identification, confession,
[00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:19.280]   and forward-looking vision, I wonder how each of us has decided to respond.
[00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:28.720]   We are being reminded that the path to follow Christ cannot escape dying to ourselves.
[00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:37.440]   But we might have underestimated the gap between the talk about repentance and living it.
[00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:45.360]   Actually, the deploring condition of the evangelical witness had been laid out in
[00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:51.360]   the Cape Town Commitment during the third Lausanne Conference in the year 2010.
[00:49:51.360 --> 00:50:00.720]   And that was 10 years ago. The self-critique about complicity in corruption, racism,
[00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:07.360]   slavery, and violence had been laid out clearly a decade ago.
[00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:17.040]   The call to repentance for the Christian church had been sounded loud and clear.
[00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:22.880]   But look at where we are still standing today.
[00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:32.720]   True repentance is not something we can usher in at our own will. Before we ask whether we are
[00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:41.280]   truly evangelicals, perhaps we might need to step back and revisit whether we are truly repentant
[00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:50.800]   sinners. The gateway to life is small and the road is narrow, and only a few ever find it.
[00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:59.520]   Not many can enter, not because we cannot afford to pay the price required, but quite the opposite.
[00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:07.440]   It's because we refuse to enter freely, letting go of our own judgment of what is good
[00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:16.240]   and acceptable to God. We refuse to enter with nothing of our own, letting go of what we perceive
[00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:24.240]   as effective, authentic witnesses, or the right way to advance God's kingdom.
[00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:33.840]   This is definitely not a problem unique to white evangelicals, but anyone who is still embodied
[00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:42.240]   in flesh and functions in a cultural setting. White or non-white, male or female,
[00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:51.280]   Republicans or Democrats, blue camp or yellow camp, poor or rich, global south or global north,
[00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:58.640]   evangelicals or whatnot. How does true repentance really look like?
[00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:06.480]   I'm often drawn to learning from people with disabilities. In the healing narratives of the
[00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:15.040]   gospel, we see a rather extraordinary pattern of Jesus declaring forgiveness to those who came to
[00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:22.400]   ask for physical healing. The interesting thing is that he did not ask them to repent
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:29.520]   before he forgave them. That happened to the paralyzed person in the gospel of Mark chapter 2,
[00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:35.840]   and to the man who was lying next to the pole of Bethsaida in John chapter 5.
[00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:43.760]   No, our evangelical conversion formula did not show up in the Bible narratives.
[00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:52.960]   They were declared forgiven and healed. It seems that coming to Jesus for help is all that is
[00:52:52.960 --> 00:53:02.000]   required. The blind beggar on the road to Jericho just shouted, "Jesus, son of David, have mercy on
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:10.080]   me." He did not spend his time visioning how his journey of repentance would look like. He surely
[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:16.400]   did not prescribe whether he should then follow Jesus on the road or whether he should then go
[00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:24.800]   back to his family and hometown to witness Christ. The penance and the way to witness is not prescribed
[00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:35.520]   by the one asking for forgiveness. We cannot copy or prescribe the repentant actions of Zacchaeus
[00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:42.720]   as a formula to demonstrate repentance. That will just turn into another form of legalism.
[00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:52.000]   What we should do in response to saving grace will become clear to us after encountering
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:54:01.440]   the one who heals and forgives. Repentance is about encountering, not about doing.
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:11.040]   Jesus had repeatedly praised the faith of those who came to him asking for help with full
[00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:18.480]   acknowledgement of their own disabilities. On the contrary, he reprimanded the Pharisees for not
[00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:26.400]   seeing their own blindness. Those of us who consider ourselves as being on the right side of history
[00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:35.120]   and religious tradition often walk around lame, naked, and blind without realizing it.
[00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:42.080]   And the moment we sense that something is not correct, we try to fix it ourselves.
[00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:47.920]   Perhaps like a child who sees dirty paint on her face in the mirror,
[00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:54.080]   we try too hard to get rid of the dirt ourselves with our own dirty hands.
[00:54:55.920 --> 00:55:03.360]   I'm afraid that the evangelical way of repentance is far too passive for us evangelicals.
[00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:09.760]   Just sit and wait for help? Seriously, how can we just sit there and do nothing?
[00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:12.400]   We are evangelicals after all.
[00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:23.120]   We actually feel that we are responsible to act, to decide on what is right. We like to
[00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:30.720]   manage the world for God. We like to prescribe penance for ourselves and others. And we think
[00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:37.680]   that if we manage to analyze our own paralysis and blindness correctly, and by correctly,
[00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:41.840]   of course, we mean biblically, we can then walk and see again.
[00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:50.880]   The absurdity of our condition is beyond our comprehension, just because of who we are,
[00:55:51.600 --> 00:56:00.160]   evangelicals. From a management perspective, I must say that God has chosen a group of very
[00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:08.000]   inefficient, vulnerable, and corruptible people to express the beauty and the power of the evangel.
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:14.880]   From a social scientific perspective, his strategy is totally out of touch
[00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:24.080]   with the reality of the human condition. But who are we to judge whether God could or could not
[00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:31.920]   use certain people? Who are we to decide that his kingdom could only be advanced by those
[00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:36.720]   who, according to our own assessments, are truly evangelical Christians?
[00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:45.520]   Sad to say that much of human suffering comes from deeply religious people feeling responsible
[00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:53.520]   for making the world a more godly place. We want to make an impact towards advancing the kingdom
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:57:01.040]   of God, which includes getting rid of the bad guys, the defiled, the hypocritical, the unjust,
[00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:08.720]   and the scandalous, and the not-so-evangelicals. We often do not realize that the more we act
[00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:18.960]   as judges and managers, the messier the world becomes. Alas, how should we then live?
[00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:28.640]   We are now living in the middle of a pandemic. Our lives are more connected to each other than
[00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:36.960]   we've ever realized. There is no more room to draw boundaries between the guilty and the not-so-guilty.
[00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:45.360]   We have heard his servant speaking to us these few days. Let's remember how the Lord instructed
[00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:52.080]   Moses to put the brown snake on a pole and offer salvation to those who look at it.
[00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:59.120]   The only way of salvation for us is to drop our own agenda for saving the day
[00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:08.640]   and to look upon the one crucified for us. Our only hope lies in the compassionate love of Christ,
[00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:17.760]   crying on our behalf to the Father to forgive us because we don't even know what we have done wrong.
[00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:22.560]   Jesus, Son of God, have mercy on us.
[00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:42.560]   [Pause]
[00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:52.880]   President Leberton, Wenz, Chairman Esther, students and friends, good morning or good evening.
[00:58:52.880 --> 00:59:05.120]   We have come to the last of the four lectures by Dr. Leberton on the history,
[00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:08.880]   current state of play, and crisis of American white evangelicals.
[00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:17.040]   Thanks to him that he has shared with us his thoughts and reflection, his struggle, as well as
[00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:25.680]   his hopes. As a last respondent, I would like to share my reflection from the perspective of eschatology.
[00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:36.560]   It was exactly 100 years ago, that was in 1921, that Karl Barth completed his manuscript on the
[00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:43.440]   second edition of his commentary on the Epistle to the Romans. The book was formally published in 1922,
[00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:52.000]   which marked the beginning of Barth's battle with the anthropocentrism of 19th-century liberal
[00:59:52.000 --> 01:00:00.320]   theology. For Barth, the eschatological nature of the kingdom of God invalidated the secular value
[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:09.040]   system presumed in liberal theology. The final judgment and a new heaven and earth repudiated
[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:19.280]   all secular identity and religious identity. The conflict between eschatological nature of
[01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:26.400]   the kingdom of God and the existing world became a major threat of 20th-century Protestant theology.
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:35.840]   Dr. Laboutin's theological critique of American white evangelicalism reminds us of this 100 years
[01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:43.840]   of history of theology. His critique also illustrates that this threat is still valid
[01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:53.760]   in the 20th century as of today. The history of theology tells us that at every critical juncture
[01:00:53.760 --> 01:01:00.880]   of historical changes, the eschatological nature of the kingdom of God will gain attention again.
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:10.240]   The question is, what kind of eschatology do we need today? I think
[01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:19.600]   this is a generic question involved in the specific question of the crisis of American
[01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:24.000]   white evangelicalism. I would like to share with you my three points of reflection.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:34.320]   First, the history of 20th-century theology reveals that any eschatology that does not bear
[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:41.840]   fruit in ethics is barren, and any eschatology which is completely reduced to secular ethics
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:48.640]   is distorted. The identity crisis of Christianity stems from the secularization,
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:52.960]   earthliness, and total contextualization of eschatology.
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:02:02.480]   An eschatology that has been corrupted by contextualization,
[01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:07.200]   as illustrated by Dr. Laboutin, he has critically analyzed this for us.
[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:19.360]   Second, does it mean that we should then fall into an eschatology which totally negates the world?
[01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:28.240]   After the publication of the second edition of the Commentary on the Epistle to Romans,
[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:34.080]   Barthes endeavored to overcome the negation of the world from an eschatological viewpoint.
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:42.480]   God is a God for God, despite the infinite distance between God and the world.
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:46.720]   We look at religions in the world.
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:54.800]   ISIS totally distorted the Islamic faith, which is essentially merciful in nature,
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:03:01.280]   into a terrorism that fights against the whole world and its civilization in front of the whole
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:12.640]   world. The core of eschatology of this terrorism is only a refraction of hatred and revenge.
[01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:20.160]   For Christianity, this is a painful lesson with deep theological meaning.
[01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:30.800]   As Paul emphasized in Romans 4.17, the God in whom Abraham believed is the one who gives life
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:36.000]   to the dead and caused things that are not as though they were. Eschatology
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:45.200]   is inseparable from creation. Hatred for the world will only push Christianity
[01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:48.880]   into the dangers of losing its very innate quality.
[01:03:50.960 --> 01:04:00.560]   Third, Dr. Labertine has portrayed an egalitarian vision for the American
[01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:05.840]   white evangelical community, which emphasizes humility and a faith-congruent life.
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:13.760]   He also pointed to the hope of self-renewal for the American white evangelicals in the current
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:20.560]   crisis. From a theological point of view, neither of the two types of eschatology
[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:25.120]   in my aforementioned points could form the basis of this kind of transformation.
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:33.200]   Listening to the lecture, I gather that this lecture implicitly assumes another eschatology,
[01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:39.600]   one that emphasizes the feigned arrival of the kingdom of God in this world.
[01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:44.640]   It has neither become assimilated with the world as in my first point,
[01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:53.680]   nor in negation of the world as in my second. As an American philosopher, A.N. Whitehead,
[01:04:53.680 --> 01:05:04.320]   mentioned in his book Process and Theology, this coming is like someone slowly and in quietness
[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:11.760]   operate by love. It is vulnerable, surrounded by risk of this world on all fronts.
[01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:21.120]   The crux of the issue is a new creation in the world. Its concern is neither to bid farewell
[01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:28.000]   to the globe or to make dramatic prophecies about the catastrophic ending of this world,
[01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:35.920]   but rather the feigned arrival of the kingdom of God in this lacerated world,
[01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:42.240]   a feigned new creation which is present amidst the lacerations of the world,
[01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:47.040]   being torn by it and also going through its cruelty and pains.
[01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:55.200]   Just as we are listening to Dr. Levitin's four lectures,
[01:05:56.960 --> 01:06:03.360]   the world is still in the middle of the systemic crisis brought by the year-long pandemic.
[01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:08.560]   The crisis of American white evangelicalism is but a small part of it.
[01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:17.280]   It would be theologically wrong to read this systemic crisis as an end-times catastrophe
[01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:23.760]   because that would put humans' existential fear for death caused by an illness
[01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:32.480]   on par with the coming of the kingdom of God. The real theological meaning of this systemic crisis
[01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:38.800]   is that it shattered the historical illusion of globalization which is marked by ever-growing
[01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:45.040]   affluence and consumption, and that it revealed the reality of the human condition
[01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:51.440]   in which we live, such as poverty in the created world, the fight for survival,
[01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:56.480]   and the threats of sickness and death which we all once thought could be totally eradicated
[01:06:56.480 --> 01:07:17.440]   by modern civilization. In this crisis, a new solidarity characterized by poverty and distress,
[01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:23.760]   competition and collaboration re-emerges. In the post-COVID-19 era,
[01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:31.520]   eschatological thinking should definitely be developed in the direction of understanding
[01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:37.760]   the feigned arrival of God's kingdom in this solidarity which is both real and cruel.
[01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:43.520]   Dr. Levitin's lectures on American white evangelicalism has certainly showed us that
[01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:50.880]   this is a possible approach. So thank you, Dr. Levitin. Thank you, everyone.
[01:07:50.880 --> 01:08:13.440]   Testing. Thanks, Wins. You emphasize the key element that repentance is about
[01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:22.480]   encountering with vulnerable or even corruptive people, not about doing, not maybe as a usual and
[01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:32.880]   traditional evangelical way. Thanks. Very inspiring and important thing, the element here.
[01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:42.640]   Thank you, Dr. Hongliang. You bring us to another level of perspective, particularly you're talking
[01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:54.240]   about eschatology and God's kingdom dimly penetrating into our present world. So I think
[01:08:54.240 --> 01:09:02.320]   yeah, your point is so important. So I was wondering whether Dr. Levitin wants to have
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:10.240]   any comments or response to Wins and Hongliang. Thank you. Yes, thank you very much. I appreciated
[01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:15.680]   both respondents' comments and I wish that we were sitting together in person so that we could
[01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:20.480]   have a much longer conversation. I would no doubt learn a great deal from both of you and would
[01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:28.720]   welcome that chance. I think that the words that were shared were provocative and I think that in
[01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:35.840]   many ways both of them felt to me like they were putting their finger on eschatological dimensions,
[01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:43.360]   though that was clearly the primary theme of the second presenter. It was true in many ways in both
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:52.000]   cases because the final end game, the telos to which all of this is directed is deeply embedded
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:56.880]   in what I've been trying to share and in the distance between where we are and whatever that
[01:09:56.880 --> 01:10:05.360]   telos is. So I appreciated that and I do think that it puts its finger on another aspect of
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:14.480]   American agency, this sense that we can push history in our own direction, that we can make
[01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:21.520]   it happen. That's one side. The other side is that I think I live in a context that is
[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:29.440]   full of the tension between a belief that Christians are given principal responsibility
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:37.440]   for receiving rather than initiating and another element of Christian tradition that would say
[01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:42.640]   that Christian initiative is really quite significant and Christian responsibility
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:48.560]   is greater than some would want to make it in an argument that can sometimes sound too passive.
[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:56.560]   So evangelicalism tends to straddle both of those worlds and you have some people on one side and
[01:10:56.560 --> 01:11:03.040]   some people on another. I think that partly creates why it's unclear not only what the
[01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:09.680]   eschaton is about but how you get from wherever we are to there and whose agency it is. We'll
[01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:15.360]   bring that about. It's my conviction that in the end it is about God's initiative and agency.
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:21.360]   It's not something that can be produced by our own human efforts. The failure to call people
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:29.840]   to repentance, bringing about repentance, is just further evidence that this is a mystery that is
[01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:37.200]   clearly in God's hands. I think what we're all trying to name is the reality of God's good and
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:44.960]   perfect intentions, which I trust will one day come to pass, though for now we live astride
[01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:52.480]   these two things. I am trying to figure out how it's possible to neither be passive in the sense
[01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:58.480]   that I don't want to be or active in the sense that I think I'm not called to be, but actively
[01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:06.320]   passive, passively active in a way that is, I think, the tension that both of our presenters
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:17.760]   have pointed to. Thank you, Mark. Do you two have any follow-up? Okay, thanks. As a chairperson,
[01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:26.000]   may I take this privilege to ask you a first question, Dr. Levitton? Yes. In your lecture,
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:33.280]   you give three recovers, recover a Christian identity, recover a Christian location, and
[01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:41.600]   recover a Christian communion. And I can see how these recover relate to the death of the several
[01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:49.360]   key elements you've discussed in your previous lectures, like dominion, nationalism, individualism,
[01:12:49.360 --> 01:13:02.640]   agency fear. Well, I'm still wondering in what way we can recover these, you know,
[01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:07.680]   three elements you were talking about, our Christian identity, our Christian communion,
[01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:12.320]   and Christian location, and that these things die.
[01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:20.800]   This is how I've understood your question. Let me make sure that I have it right.
[01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:27.760]   You're wondering how those three areas of things that need to be recovered are the antidote to
[01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:36.800]   the things that I'm saying need to die. Is that right? Yes. I'm wondering in what ways,
[01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:43.680]   you know, we're talking about we recover these three areas, and then you say, okay, in this area,
[01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:50.960]   we assume that those things die. But in what ways, in what ways we can arrive at that point
[01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:59.040]   to let these things die? Well, let me try, and then I want you to respond back. So, for example,
[01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:03.600]   if you were talking about a recovery of Christian identity, the things that I've mentioned that need
[01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:11.680]   to die are among the things that I think confuse and subvert a Christian identity. So therefore,
[01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:17.200]   what I'm proposing about what needs to be recovered has to do with clarifying who we really
[01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:23.680]   are and building it on rock and not on sand. The things that I'm naming need to die are the things
[01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:32.160]   that are like sand, which are the false foundations for our lives. Now, how do you do that? Well,
[01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:40.000]   that's a particular thing that involves any given community, a kind of location, a starting point.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:47.680]   I know what it means in some white American settings, but I'm aware that I, even in that
[01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:54.000]   homogeneous category, there's a great deal of variation. And as a pastor, I know that a great
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:59.360]   deal of this work of spiritual transformation happens at the micro level, not at the macro
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:06.400]   level. But there are other things that happen collectively, as well as personally. So I would
[01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:13.280]   want to work with the congregation, for example, and have on issues of Christian identity. How do
[01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:21.280]   we really understand who we are? From what does that identity arise? Is it innate or is it a gift?
[01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:27.520]   If it's a gift, from whom and for what is the gift given to us, et cetera? Just the working out of
[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:37.280]   some of those very important questions and issues. But I think paired with that is then the death of
[01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:44.560]   acknowledging that, for example, to say in a community like Berkeley, the words of the Heidelberg
[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:51.520]   Catechism, that I belong not to myself, but to my faithful savior, Jesus Christ. Those are radically
[01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:56.960]   countercultural words, because the culture around the University of California would say,
[01:15:56.960 --> 01:16:06.800]   I am absolutely, utterly, finally, and eternally my own. So people are raised in that environment,
[01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:12.320]   and they claim to be Christians. Have we crucified, in the best sense, the right
[01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:20.720]   sense that I'm trying to name, at least, have we crucified a sense of independent existence
[01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:30.800]   in which the self is at the center? That's a false identity, I would argue. So let me pause there. I
[01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:34.640]   could go on, but let me pause there and see if I'm answering what you're asking, because I don't want
[01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:38.480]   to miss what you're trying to say. >> Yes, yes, thank you. I think you
[01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:48.480]   answered my question already. So actually, why I ask this question, because when I read your book
[01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:54.880]   called "The Crisis and Promise of Following Jesus Today," I really enjoy reading your book.
[01:16:54.880 --> 01:17:01.680]   And then when you discuss relocating, reorienting, refocus, and talking about the way of beloved,
[01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:10.320]   the way of wisdom, and the way of suffering, I'm thinking maybe that relates to your question,
[01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:16.400]   when you're discussing here about recovery. So yeah, but you also, yeah, yeah, pointing to that
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:21.280]   point just before. So yeah. >> Yes. Yes, thank you very much.
[01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:28.880]   >> Thank you. If you two have further follow-up. >> In response to your question about how
[01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:40.960]   does that happen? How do we recover and then in the process die? I echo with Dr. Leberton on the
[01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:47.920]   need to reexamine whether we're living out the gospel or living out our own social location.
[01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:58.560]   And I think part of the way to maybe from another perspective looking at this issue is that, well,
[01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:07.600]   we all know that we cannot escape ourselves. That is the difficulty here. But maybe we can
[01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:16.480]   look at the scenario from a very different perspective, is maybe we can live out the gospel
[01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:26.880]   through our social dislocation. And I would maybe suggest that this is one way of rediscovering our
[01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:34.320]   Christian social location. Let me expand a little bit more. Like social dislocation,
[01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:42.880]   I mean things that marginalize us. We can be marginalized and discriminated by a lot of things,
[01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:48.720]   like say our gender, our race, or our social status. And I think that everyone has his or
[01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:56.720]   own domains of social dislocation. No matter how white or how male or how powerful and dominant
[01:18:56.720 --> 01:19:04.240]   you are, it may be your age, your health condition, or your wealth that make you feel like
[01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:11.760]   you are discriminated or marginalized at some point. And now, what does living out the gospel
[01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:19.280]   in our social dislocation mean? I would like to share a bit from my personal experience, if I may.
[01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:28.720]   In my case, the most obvious domains of my social dislocation are, first, I'm being a woman in a
[01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:36.400]   male-dominated society, and secondly, being married but do not have children in an Asian culture.
[01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:42.880]   So in Hong Kong, the marginalization and discrimination are not so obvious,
[01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:51.120]   but it became a main theme of my encounter with people during the six years when I was working
[01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:59.120]   in Kabul, Afghanistan, teaching physical therapists there. The work was supported by a Christian NGO.
[01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:07.120]   I often thought my social dislocation, that is my femaleness, my barrenness, is an obstacle to my
[01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:13.200]   ministry. I mean, how do people look at you and think that God is someone who blesses, you know,
[01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:20.160]   his followers? But quite the opposite, it has become the broken vessel that carries the treasure
[01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:26.880]   that shines through. In my case, that did not work out because there were people who advocated for my
[01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:35.920]   okayness, not that. But it began with my own conversion, first. It became clear that from
[01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:43.360]   encountering God who confirms my blessedness, even though I'm seen as a lesser human being
[01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:51.600]   because I'm a woman, or a lesser than whole woman because I do not have children. So the conversion
[01:20:51.600 --> 01:21:00.240]   starts from myself, you know, the conversion to be able to stand as the blessed and redeemed person
[01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:07.440]   in the confrontation and hostility of my culture. It takes time, it takes a lot of dialogue and
[01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:14.640]   wrestling with God, but it does not happen at will. The assurance and blessedness for me is the
[01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:24.320]   evangel in my social dislocation. And to my surprise, people around me are attracted by how
[01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:31.760]   my faith affirms my personhood and empowers me to be at peace with my social dislocation.
[01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:38.960]   And mind you, people and environment did not suddenly become very warm and, you know, very
[01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:45.040]   embracing. It's still very violent and discriminating. And yet, living out this
[01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:53.920]   peace and blessedness among such a culture has connected me to people in their own fear and hurt.
[01:21:53.920 --> 01:22:02.080]   And this has opened a lot of open doors of connection in our dislocations in various senses.
[01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:11.920]   And to journey along this dislocation in opening to the gospel that reassures us.
[01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:18.880]   So this is something that we might want to look at, you know, re-examine our ways of mission.
[01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:26.960]   Because a lot of times the way, you know, the people who need love and healing does not get
[01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:34.000]   it when people coming as Christians are imposing things like wars and sanctions on their own
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:41.200]   motherland. So this is something I'd like to share. May I respond to that? Sure, sure, please.
[01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:49.840]   I just want to say first, just a very personal expression of gratitude and thank you for sharing
[01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:56.560]   what you've just done for a couple of reasons. First, that my wife and I also have been unable to
[01:22:57.520 --> 01:23:05.040]   biologically have children. We have in years past adopted two children who are have been our
[01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:12.960]   sons since they were born. But the journey of not having children physically and the way that that
[01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:18.880]   affected us together as well as individually and then the way that it affected us in relationship
[01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:26.560]   to others was a very, very important part of our own marital formation. And I so respect and
[01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:36.240]   treasure what you've just said about understanding how to live out our dislocation as an act of
[01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:44.560]   discipleship and a learning of how to understand ourselves and see our social location
[01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:52.720]   and dislocation as in some sense a mercy or at least that it holds an avenue of being a mercy
[01:23:52.720 --> 01:24:00.160]   to us and perhaps to other people. It certainly has been the case likewise for us that that period
[01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:05.920]   which went on for 10 years and really for us has gone on always even though we were fortunate in
[01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:14.720]   our case to be able to adopt two newborn children over time. The sense that we were still
[01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:20.720]   a family that had been unable to conceive a child biologically was a very significant thing that I
[01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:27.280]   think has been a wound that God has used profoundly in our own lives and I think
[01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:34.560]   used very significantly in the lives of others. So that particular story means a great deal to me
[01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:40.400]   and I think your way of handling it is such a marvelous and encouraging inspiration to me
[01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:45.920]   because it's really in a way what I've been trying to argue for. I think that is what I mean by the
[01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:53.360]   faint coming of the kingdom, right? It's in that funny intersection of both hope and
[01:24:53.360 --> 01:25:02.080]   lack of resolution that we live our lives. I think it's part of what exilic life is meant to be and
[01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:07.760]   I think in a country like the United States that has tended to see itself as a promised land,
[01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:15.600]   falsely that's another story, but to see itself in that way, well what it's really needed and what
[01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:21.920]   it certainly needs now is for the church to see itself as a church in exile and to embrace that
[01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:30.160]   social dislocation is actually very hopeful to me. But if we are actually exiles but we want to keep
[01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:37.200]   demanding a return to the promised land which is a false hope, then we're really in a difficult place
[01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:42.160]   and I think it's unclear which direction the White Evangelical Church will go.
[01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:51.280]   Thank you again. Thank you for your feedback and I think a lot of times we can blame it on
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:57.760]   prosperity gospel or anything but I think in especially in Asian culture, honor and shame
[01:25:57.760 --> 01:26:06.960]   culture, it's very hard for even like Christians to take pride in whatever situation that God has
[01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:14.320]   put them in. For example, if you are a church leader in Hong Kong and if you experience or a
[01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:21.760]   family member experience mental illness or if there is something going wrong with your kids or
[01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:32.240]   in your marriage, I think it's very hard to talk about it or even be transparent about how you go
[01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:41.920]   through such thick situations in life with the gospel, with the grace of God. I think that's
[01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:48.160]   something we need to not to take away our social location but to really look at it all sides
[01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:58.000]   including our dislocation in it. Yes, thank you so much. Yeah, same thanks for all of you. I mean
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:04.800]   this question is related to what we just talked about like the location is in the Christian of
[01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:12.800]   the location, the nationality, the culture, are we decontextualizing the gospel in culture
[01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:17.600]   or we'd rather to seek a transformation of culture and redemption of our practice?
[01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:30.080]   I think the answer is yes. I think it has to be all of that, right? I mean part of it is about
[01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:35.840]   us being transformed but part of it is about the agency which is I think the only way of
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:41.360]   understanding why Jesus would use words like you are the light of the world, you are the salt of
[01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:50.080]   the earth. Clearly we are meant to be affective agents in the world in some sort of way and to
[01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:58.080]   bring to the world in the case of light a world of darkness, to bring to a world of decay salt
[01:27:58.080 --> 01:28:07.280]   that restrains that decay. So I think it's both things. I think there has to be a personal work
[01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:14.800]   of transformation in our social location and not denying our social location but allowing ourselves
[01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:23.280]   to bring our whole social location to the God who sees us and has created us and wants to redeem us
[01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:27.440]   but also a God who then simultaneously always wants to use us. This is why it's always a
[01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:39.120]   mystery to me that in the economy of God we are both the focus of God's work even while we are
[01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:49.200]   also the workers. We're both things always. We are the work and we are the workers and it's that
[01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:56.160]   dual dynamic that we live every day. I hope that addresses the question.
[01:28:56.160 --> 01:28:59.840]   Yes, yes.
[01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:13.360]   So let me respond from a theological point of view.
[01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:24.320]   I very much like the point made by Dr. Laboutin in his lecture that
[01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:27.280]   the goodness in creation.
[01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:35.200]   Why do I raise this point?
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:44.000]   If we talk about a historical crisis, but there are many many reasons behind it.
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:54.800]   And if we look at crisis of American white evangelicalism, it is a component part of the
[01:29:54.800 --> 01:30:02.480]   recent history of theology, especially Protestant theology as a characteristic
[01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:14.400]   that from the time of Reformation is very quickly relinquished its rights in explaining nature.
[01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:24.800]   In modern Protestant theology, representative icon Bonhoeffer,
[01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:38.000]   in his anthropology manuscript in 1940s, he pointedly talked about
[01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:47.040]   how the whole Protestant theology has since Reformation very quickly relinquished the
[01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:57.680]   Catholic tradition of distinguishing between grace and nature. We don't have the power to
[01:30:57.680 --> 01:31:07.840]   talk about nature from the Protestant theology, especially since the fallen world,
[01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:14.480]   created, the values of the created are not talked about.
[01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:29.440]   In American evangelicalism, in the development of this theology, it demonstrates clearly
[01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:40.560]   this point. So, since 19th century theology, until now, whenever we talk about eschatology,
[01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:55.360]   the post-millennium point of view, turned slowly to the pessimistic anti-millenniumism.
[01:31:57.600 --> 01:32:03.360]   Between the two, are there fundamental differences? To me, there is no difference,
[01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:12.560]   because both of them do not have the ability to make any theological hermeneutics of the
[01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:22.400]   current situation. From the world view of natural sciences, or from the world interpretation from
[01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:28.960]   the Catholic tradition, for those two, they are absent in Protestant theology.
[01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:38.480]   So, we need a parallel narrative for this. I think this is a very big weakness.
[01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:44.880]   And Dr. Levitin, in your lectures, when you talked about the goodness of creation,
[01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:54.720]   this should become a new angle of study in Protestant theology, to look at this world,
[01:32:54.720 --> 01:33:01.920]   and to interpret a starting point, very important. From this point of view,
[01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:10.880]   what we see today, as the COVID-19 situation, the systemic crisis that they created,
[01:33:11.520 --> 01:33:18.720]   from a theological point of view, it's not totally negative, or just a negative of the event.
[01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:31.120]   It can be something with very positive value, because it let us see that the modern civilization,
[01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:37.280]   and what it tried to create, in terms of affluence and consumption as a major
[01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:44.320]   value, has totally collapsed, and has corrupted our human nature.
[01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:58.160]   It's poverty and fear. I think this is a very good resource for theological reflection.
[01:33:58.160 --> 01:34:02.480]   Thank you very much, Dr. Levitin. >> Yes, I'd like to again respond.
[01:34:02.480 --> 01:34:08.080]   That's a very, very helpful statement. Thank you so much for that. And let me illustrate
[01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:15.200]   what the tension is, I think, that would, I think, go in the same direction as your observations.
[01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:22.320]   It's worth noting that one of the major influences on American white evangelicalism is the theological
[01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:29.600]   movement known as dispensationalism. Dispensationalism, as many of you might know,
[01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:35.760]   is an American theological conviction in which the material world is fundamentally
[01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:42.480]   of little, if any, real significance. It's all about a long trajectory of an eschatological
[01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:50.960]   vision that's immaterial. And in that sense, an eschatology that would suggest that the telos is
[01:34:50.960 --> 01:35:00.000]   the world, the material world will "burn up," and that the eternal world will be, in the best sense,
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:06.400]   only a resurrected material reality and bear little, if any, resemblance to the reality that
[01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:15.520]   we have today. And so, therefore, when a pandemic like this comes along and the reaction has been
[01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:21.760]   against science, it's not just against science, it's against material existence and its importance
[01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:28.720]   and an over-crediting of spiritual reality and a dramatically under-crediting of the meaning
[01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:34.320]   of material life, and therefore an under-appreciation and a rejection of science,
[01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:39.600]   because it's literally giving itself to something that will not matter in the end.
[01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:47.200]   And it's this tragic stranglehold that dispensationalism still has on a lot of
[01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:54.240]   American Protestantism and American evangelicalism in particular. And I think it's consonant with
[01:35:54.240 --> 01:36:00.480]   what was just shared and with the way that, in a way, that avoidance of seeing goodness,
[01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:06.240]   actual goodness, true, even eternal goodness, I'll put it that way to make the point,
[01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:14.080]   an eternal goodness to material reality that will be made new, but not expunged, not burned down,
[01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:21.520]   but brought to its fulfillment. And I think that that's a very, very important theme. And I so
[01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:26.000]   appreciate what you've just shared. I hope that if you want to interact with what I've just said,
[01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:36.320]   I would love to hear your comments back. >> I totally agree with that. The way we see
[01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:44.320]   how God's kingdom will reveal our theology would actually influence a lot on how we interact with
[01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:51.920]   the world. And previously I mentioned about sanction and war. I must take the chance to
[01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:58.880]   make a note about this. I think a lot of foreign policies in the US, based on this theology of how,
[01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:03.760]   you know, what is good and evil and how to bring about God's kingdom's coming,
[01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:10.400]   these foreign policies were done in the name of justice and to protect people from regimes that
[01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:17.600]   are seen as evil and to bring about God's eschaton. I think a lot of times war and/or
[01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:27.120]   sanction are imposed as acts of justice and being on the same side of God. But having lived in and
[01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:34.960]   visited countries under these policies, I must say that I'm angered and shamed by the lack of
[01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:42.960]   awareness of what is actually happening on the ground. After Afghanistan, I have visited briefly
[01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:52.880]   the DPRK and the Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon. I must say that the American Christianity
[01:37:52.880 --> 01:38:00.720]   has a lot to answer to as far as the unjust suffering of ordinary people there, who,
[01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:06.800]   especially vulnerable people like children, women, or people with disabilities.
[01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:15.520]   But on the other side, that's not the end of hope. We do not wait for us to correct ourselves
[01:38:15.520 --> 01:38:21.760]   because before anything good can happen. I witness that God is still doing work in his own ways.
[01:38:21.760 --> 01:38:30.400]   If we are open to the sovereignty of God to choose who he works through, for example, in the hospital
[01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:38.080]   in the Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon, they are getting a lot of help from the Japanese Red
[01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:46.800]   Cross. Not a Christian organization, but a lot of Christ-likeness shines through the medical
[01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:54.960]   personnel there. And on top of that, several Palestinian Muslim women are making efforts to
[01:38:54.960 --> 01:39:03.440]   network help from various resources across religious and racial boundaries. And that brought
[01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:10.880]   us to what Dr. Hong had mentioned, that maybe our own stream of spirituality and theology is not
[01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:19.760]   able to see our own blind spots. And I think we do need a lot of dialogue ecumenically and also
[01:39:19.760 --> 01:39:29.920]   interfaith to actually see a fuller picture of who God is and what we are supposed to be
[01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:33.760]   and how we should live and collaborate with each other.
[01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:41.280]   I agree with that very much. Thank you so much for telling that, using those examples. And I
[01:39:41.280 --> 01:39:48.320]   would say the same thing is true in so many different directions. And on a more localized
[01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:53.840]   level, it was what I was meaning yesterday about the examples of the global church conference
[01:39:53.840 --> 01:39:58.800]   and of the small groups that I was describing that are trying to bring unlike people together
[01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:07.680]   so that we share what we call in our own location wisdom, but maybe folly if we bring it into
[01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:12.480]   conversation with others whose perspective and experience is really so different from ourselves.
[01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:18.720]   So I applaud the examples and I share with you from another part of the world,
[01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:25.680]   horror at much of what the American government as well as the American church does. Even while
[01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:32.480]   I also say I'm grateful for various things that happen sometimes because of and often despite
[01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:41.120]   what we are. Thank you for all the discussions. That is quite fruitful. So from Holy Land's
[01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:49.600]   big picture of eschatology and then once, yeah, reflection on her personal experience. And now I
[01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:56.960]   want to back to this question I think relates somehow to what we discussed. Here's the question,
[01:40:56.960 --> 01:41:06.480]   could it be that the whole paradigm of Christianity needs to be examined or else we would just be
[01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:15.360]   abandoning evangelicalism only to pick up another ecologism? How do you see the issue of evangelicalism
[01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:22.560]   has to do with the general perception of the church of God as the powerful and move mover,
[01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:30.560]   Christ is the victor and the spirit as a power for us to use? Okay, you have any comment on?
[01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:38.480]   That's an enormous question. Well, let me just say briefly a few things without in any way
[01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:44.960]   suggesting I'm giving an adequate answer to that question. So yes, it is absolutely not only
[01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:50.320]   possible, it seems almost predictable that if we move from one tribe to another, we just are
[01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:56.560]   substituting tribes. We're not necessarily being transformed. So I would say that we have to move
[01:41:56.560 --> 01:42:05.360]   with caution and wisdom and without any naivete about the fact that the newness that the New
[01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:12.720]   Testament describes is a newness of death and resurrection. So what we're talking about is
[01:42:12.720 --> 01:42:18.080]   death and resurrection. We're not talking about finding a better brand. That's a completely
[01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:24.400]   different process and much more superficial. I think the question is, and I think this is where
[01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:30.480]   two respondents of each in their own way made this point, there's really a genuine deep spiritual
[01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:38.160]   work that has to go on in us to make us Christ-like. Literally, it required the death
[01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:44.560]   and resurrection of Jesus to make it possible. And if that's the case, then let's not be the
[01:42:44.560 --> 01:42:52.320]   slightest bit superficial or silly about the kind of degree of change that is needed in our lives.
[01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:57.760]   If it was something that could be easily manipulated by just changing parties,
[01:42:57.760 --> 01:43:01.440]   then clearly it would not be what Jesus is actually talking about.
[01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:13.920]   So let me start there. Let me also say that we want to move with hope, but with caution. In some
[01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:20.800]   ways, it's based on the hermeneutics that we might call at the end of 1 Corinthians 13. I don't know
[01:43:20.800 --> 01:43:29.040]   if this is true in China, but often that chapter, 1 Corinthians 13, is imprisoned, I'll say, in
[01:43:29.040 --> 01:43:34.560]   wedding services. And it's not a text that's necessarily read or preached on very much
[01:43:34.560 --> 01:43:41.360]   otherwise. But if we come to the end of that text, the Apostle Paul, the most adamant voice
[01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:47.840]   in the New Testament, is the voice that says, "We see, but we see through a glass darkly."
[01:43:48.960 --> 01:43:55.200]   And I want to hermeneutically embrace that and say, as I go forward as a Christian disciple,
[01:43:55.200 --> 01:44:01.040]   as a part of a church community, as the leader of a theological institution,
[01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:08.640]   I want to advocate an epistemology and a hermeneutics that's based on the possibility
[01:44:08.640 --> 01:44:15.280]   of seeing, but seeing through a glass darkly. And how we hold those two things in tension
[01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:21.440]   will say a great deal about how we understand ourselves and the God that we are claiming
[01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:27.440]   has been made known in Jesus Christ. Some, and I would argue fundamentalism is particularly guilty
[01:44:27.440 --> 01:44:33.680]   of this, of saying that the lens is completely transparent, that we can see utterly and clearly.
[01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:43.200]   But skeptics and many inside the church, and certainly many outside the church, would say,
[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:49.520]   "There's nothing there, or there's no capacity for sight." And I think to that, Paul would say,
[01:44:49.520 --> 01:44:54.000]   "No, there is something there, and there is something that can be seen."
[01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:59.440]   But Paul would be the one that would say to the fundamentalists, "But it's not transparent."
[01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:07.920]   So what we've been talking about here needs to be held with that double combination
[01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:13.680]   and an acknowledgement that as we go forward, we're always looking to see as much as by God's
[01:45:13.680 --> 01:45:19.760]   grace we might come to see and know, but by God's grace, not more than we can see and know,
[01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:25.760]   leaving us utterly dependent on what is yet to be made known, what is yet to be done,
[01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:29.760]   what's yet to be accomplished in us and/or through us or together with us.
[01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:38.080]   I wonder if anyone of either of the respondents would want to engage in that. That's just a tiny
[01:45:38.640 --> 01:45:45.040]   thumbnail of what I think that question requires.
[01:45:45.040 --> 01:45:57.680]   I agree that the need for the courage to be vulnerable, it's very much an important
[01:45:57.680 --> 01:46:07.440]   aspect that we need to actually look at why we want to change paradigm, why we want to be
[01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:17.440]   better. Is it because we want to have a better rating, more followers, be on the right side,
[01:46:17.440 --> 01:46:27.200]   or what's our purpose of even changing? Sometimes the action, the changing action is good, but I
[01:46:27.200 --> 01:46:32.720]   think we've read in the Bible that God does not actually really just look at the actions.
[01:46:33.760 --> 01:46:40.160]   He surprises with things that he looks at. His measuring tape is often not our own.
[01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:49.280]   So I think the vulnerability and utter whatever we've done that's the best we can do,
[01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:57.200]   and then to come to Christ with a confession that we are useless and sinful servants.
[01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:05.920]   I think that's what I want to add in that because there's a Chinese saying that
[01:47:05.920 --> 01:47:12.880]   "Sing zhe wei wong, bai zhe wei kou." The winner is king, the loser is outlaw.
[01:47:12.880 --> 01:47:20.880]   So we always want to be on the winning side, not literally wanting more money or fame, but
[01:47:20.880 --> 01:47:27.520]   actually at least on the winning side of the right, correct theology, the correct kind of evangelism.
[01:47:28.240 --> 01:47:35.120]   So is it because we want to rule and we want more followers, or is it really because we
[01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:40.640]   want to be vulnerable in front of the gospel of Christ?
[01:47:40.640 --> 01:47:42.560]   Yes, yes. Thank you.
[01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:49.200]   That's true. And I think time flies, so we may still have several questions, so we'll see.
[01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:57.520]   And the other question is about like this. Among evangelicals, there are some strange beliefs.
[01:47:58.320 --> 01:48:07.680]   For example, COVID-19 is a hoax. Requirement of wearing a face mask is a violation of freedom.
[01:48:07.680 --> 01:48:15.440]   Climate change is a hoax. Strict gun control cannot prevent mass shootings, etc.
[01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:23.600]   Can you explain how these ideas are developed among evangelicals? How are these ideas related
[01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:27.280]   to whiteness and maleness, if there is any relationship?
[01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:38.720]   Well, the way that they relate to white evangelicalism is that, as I mentioned a few
[01:48:38.720 --> 01:48:44.480]   moments ago, that there is this pervasive anti-materialist thread that is a very important
[01:48:44.480 --> 01:48:50.720]   part of white evangelicalism. And it has to do with a rejection then of science, of facts,
[01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:59.360]   of so-called material truth. So this is a long history. You could trace it, at the very least,
[01:48:59.360 --> 01:49:04.800]   from the time of the Enlightenment, but you could also, in an American context, you could also trace
[01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:11.600]   it back to what's called the Scopes Trial of the 1920s. And that was between fundamentalists and
[01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:18.240]   modernists. And it was in that debate and in the implications of things that happened around that,
[01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:28.000]   that a great number of American fundamentalists now sometimes are included, predominantly included,
[01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:37.680]   in the name evangelical, that science was rejected and still is often rejected.
[01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:43.760]   So the rejection of the analysis of the disease, the rejection of the analysis of the prevention,
[01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:49.920]   or the partial prevention, as in masks, or the prevention of the legitimacy of a vaccine,
[01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:56.240]   are all part of one narrative that's basically grounded in a sense of the fact that scientists
[01:49:56.240 --> 01:50:02.640]   and secular scientists are doing evil in the world, that science is not the main concern,
[01:50:02.640 --> 01:50:09.440]   it's really spirituality. It's what the Spirit of God is going to do. And that by letting yourself
[01:50:09.440 --> 01:50:17.120]   be invaded by an external force, as in overreaching government, or overreaching medicine,
[01:50:17.120 --> 01:50:28.880]   is itself to give way to the falsehood of things that are destructive and subversive to an American,
[01:50:28.880 --> 01:50:34.800]   and in particular, a Christian identity. So the fact that this is so pervasive in the United States,
[01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:41.440]   that 70 million people, more than 70 million people, still voted for Donald Trump,
[01:50:41.440 --> 01:50:46.880]   the chief propagator of such lies and distortions, is an enormous tragedy.
[01:50:46.880 --> 01:50:51.840]   On the other hand, it's no surprise, because he saw that that point of view was attractive to many,
[01:50:51.840 --> 01:50:59.760]   many right-wing Christian people in the United States, and it was his single largest group of
[01:50:59.760 --> 01:51:05.600]   supporters, which is why the tragedy that we're talking about of the crisis of American white
[01:51:05.600 --> 01:51:15.200]   evangelicalism is intertwined with such truly tragic histories and long arguments that have to
[01:51:15.200 --> 01:51:21.600]   be understood and responded to, and for which human effort is clearly inadequate.
[01:51:21.600 --> 01:51:34.800]   Thank you for your response. Yeah, the other question is like about repentance,
[01:51:34.800 --> 01:51:43.360]   maybe. The repentance that Mark advocates to begin at the local congregations. However,
[01:51:43.360 --> 01:51:51.840]   most church leaders are more interested in growing the congregations than repenting social
[01:51:51.840 --> 01:51:56.240]   sins. How do we start changing in our congregations?
[01:51:56.240 --> 01:52:03.760]   Well, if we go back to the example of Jesus, I do think it's quite profound that, of course,
[01:52:03.760 --> 01:52:08.400]   it was right at the moment that Peter confessed Jesus to be the Christ that he also said that he
[01:52:08.400 --> 01:52:15.280]   was facing turning his face toward Jerusalem. Peter intervenes and says, no, that's not at all
[01:52:15.280 --> 01:52:21.760]   what you should do. And Jesus uses the strongest and most critical words that I think he uses
[01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:27.600]   almost anywhere except toward the Pharisees, perhaps, when he says, get behind me, Satan,
[01:52:27.600 --> 01:52:34.480]   to Peter. Amazing declaration. And then he goes on to say, if you follow me,
[01:52:34.480 --> 01:52:41.360]   you must take up your cross and do so. Now, this has never been popular teaching throughout the
[01:52:41.360 --> 01:52:46.160]   whole of Christian history. There have been renewal movements upon renewal movements that
[01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:54.640]   have gone back to these seminal elements of the gospel to say, are we trying to live a Christian
[01:52:54.640 --> 01:53:02.720]   faith without dying? And a lot of the popularity of mega church growth and church growth as a goal
[01:53:02.720 --> 01:53:10.080]   itself is really built on the assumption that we can offer a dying free Christianity as though
[01:53:10.080 --> 01:53:16.240]   Jesus dies, but we don't ever die. My reading of the New Testament, not least the gospels,
[01:53:16.240 --> 01:53:23.760]   but also of Paul, is that Jesus died decisively for us, but that we enter into that death
[01:53:24.480 --> 01:53:32.080]   by our willingness to actually take responsibility for ourselves and to put ourselves in a position
[01:53:32.080 --> 01:53:37.760]   of identification with Jesus in such a way that we lay down our prerogatives, that we lay down
[01:53:37.760 --> 01:53:44.880]   our power, that we lay down our stature, our influence, etc. Now, the crisis, of course,
[01:53:44.880 --> 01:53:50.720]   of church growth is nobody grows a church by putting up outside its doors a sign that says,
[01:53:50.720 --> 01:53:58.400]   "Come and die." That's not the theme. Bonhoeffer, of course, makes this point very, very clearly.
[01:53:58.400 --> 01:54:07.680]   And I think it still is a haunting thing that commitment to church growth often has been
[01:54:07.680 --> 01:54:13.920]   unwilling to confront. We assume that the goal is just getting more people to come to church.
[01:54:15.440 --> 01:54:20.560]   That's not a bad goal if what we're offering them is actually the gospel on the other end.
[01:54:20.560 --> 01:54:27.520]   If what we're really offering them is a compromised and failed gospel that really doesn't take
[01:54:27.520 --> 01:54:32.480]   our circumstances seriously, then I think we've really offered people something other than the
[01:54:32.480 --> 01:54:39.440]   gospel itself. And that's a tragedy. And I think that does explain in part American white
[01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:44.640]   evangelicalism. You may or may not know this. It may or may not be true in your churches, but
[01:54:45.200 --> 01:54:50.720]   there are many, many churches in America now that would consider themselves evangelical churches
[01:54:50.720 --> 01:54:58.320]   that would never offer a prayer of confession, for example. It just doesn't happen. It's not
[01:54:58.320 --> 01:55:03.760]   in the communal worship of the church. It might happen at a moment of conversion when a person
[01:55:03.760 --> 01:55:10.480]   perhaps is being invited to come forward or to make a confession of faith. But the emphasis
[01:55:10.480 --> 01:55:18.080]   is often on the confession of faith, not a call or an act of repentance, as we were hearing about
[01:55:18.080 --> 01:55:25.120]   earlier. It's this repentance that the church wants to avoid and then to build a church that
[01:55:25.120 --> 01:55:31.120]   doesn't repent. Well, that's like trying to build America by a president who never confesses having
[01:55:31.120 --> 01:55:37.520]   done wrong. So it's an impossibility. It's just the most ordinary possibility, let alone a
[01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:49.200]   theological impossibility. >> Perhaps we can look at it like actually the church can be the mission
[01:55:49.200 --> 01:56:02.080]   field. And we have overrated the institutional church as the only venue that God's church exists.
[01:56:04.640 --> 01:56:15.440]   But having said that, I think the way to bring repentance, I often say that how can people admit
[01:56:15.440 --> 01:56:24.560]   that they're wrong? And very often it's in front of people who really love them, who are willing
[01:56:24.560 --> 01:56:35.680]   to suffer the consequence of their own sins and be able to bear it and forgive them. At least that's
[01:56:35.680 --> 01:56:44.320]   my experience. So I think that it's very easy to kind of say that, to look at other people's
[01:56:44.320 --> 01:56:49.040]   thoughts. And I think we need each other to tell us where our blind spots are and to love us enough
[01:56:49.760 --> 01:56:55.280]   to embrace us even though we're so horrific. >> Yeah. And that's where the church community
[01:56:55.280 --> 01:56:59.840]   can be such a gift, right? If you can create an environment where people are prepared to be honest
[01:56:59.840 --> 01:57:06.400]   in that way, it will require that they are also loving in a way that can actually foster that
[01:57:06.400 --> 01:57:14.000]   kind of honesty of confession. And many churches are not like that. I was on a Zoom call today
[01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:19.440]   with several people who were describing having grown up in a very brutal kind of Christianity,
[01:57:19.440 --> 01:57:32.320]   which was very measured about its demands and very sparse in its expressions of love. And it did so
[01:57:32.320 --> 01:57:37.280]   in the name of saying it was being a more faithful and righteous church. But for the people that I
[01:57:37.280 --> 01:57:43.360]   was talking to, it was a deeply wounding experience, which for many years left them
[01:57:43.360 --> 01:57:50.800]   feeling that they couldn't know God because they could never be good enough. And this was all inside
[01:57:50.800 --> 01:57:57.360]   a church that was claiming that they were proclaiming the gospel of God's love. But the
[01:57:57.360 --> 01:58:04.480]   love and the judgment were so skewed that it was impossible. Later, they came to that discovery.
[01:58:04.480 --> 01:58:09.360]   But I'm just underscoring, I think, what I understood you to say. I believe that the love
[01:58:09.360 --> 01:58:15.360]   that has to surround us, that is God's love and is meant also to be our love, can make an enormous
[01:58:15.360 --> 01:58:23.280]   difference in how the good news is heard. Thanks. But due to our time limitation, I think our Q&A
[01:58:23.280 --> 01:58:29.360]   session has to be ended here. Sorry that some good questions we don't have time to address.
[01:58:29.360 --> 01:58:39.200]   Receive my apologies. So yeah, this morning or evening is very fruitful and stimulating for us
[01:58:39.200 --> 01:58:46.560]   Thank you so much, Dr. Labberton, for giving us such a unique lecture week. I was so enjoy your
[01:58:46.560 --> 01:58:54.000]   lectures. Actually, I really like your tone, your ways of interactions, very pastoral,
[01:58:54.000 --> 01:59:04.640]   caring, and humble. Very impressive. Many thanks, Dr. Labberton. Thank you to all our respondents
[01:59:04.640 --> 01:59:11.040]   in these four days. Your response and comments helped us to gain more from the lectures. Thank
[01:59:11.040 --> 01:59:19.760]   you to all the translators' hard work and all our CGST staff who helped to make this event happen
[01:59:19.760 --> 01:59:25.840]   and go well. Thank you for your participation wherever in the overseas or in Hong Kong.
[01:59:25.840 --> 01:59:34.240]   And thank you for your active involving in asking questions, giving comments, which we ought to leave
[01:59:34.240 --> 01:59:46.880]   out in the invention, as Dr. Labberton has stated in his lectures. At the end of our 2021 Josephine
[01:59:46.880 --> 01:59:57.280]   Soul Culture and Ethics lecture, may I ask our senior pastor Mark to pray to complete our annual
[01:59:57.280 --> 02:00:04.000]   lecture week. I would be honored to do so. Let me briefly just say again how grateful I am for
[02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:10.800]   the chance to have participated in these lectures. I pray for the church in Hong Kong, and I pray for
[02:00:10.800 --> 02:00:18.160]   the church in the world that is the Chinese church throughout the world for its grace and strength
[02:00:18.160 --> 02:00:27.040]   and for its influence to be the aroma of this amazing, mysterious, and clear gospel
[02:00:27.680 --> 02:00:35.920]   that is in Jesus Christ. Let's pray together. Oh God, it is in our weakness that we come to you
[02:00:35.920 --> 02:00:41.360]   now at the end of this time to just again offer ourselves, offer one another, offer the churches
[02:00:41.360 --> 02:00:48.960]   and congregations that we're a part of, offer the church of Jesus Christ in Hong Kong, throughout
[02:00:48.960 --> 02:00:56.000]   the Asian world, throughout the world, and we offer likewise the white evangelical church in America
[02:00:57.120 --> 02:01:04.000]   to you. You are the one who reigns in mercy and justice. You're the God who reigns in love and
[02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:11.760]   kindness, the God who understands us thoroughly in our weakness, and yet you are also the one who by
[02:01:11.760 --> 02:01:21.760]   the power of your spirit can redeem, can recreate, can literally remake us to be people who reflect
[02:01:21.760 --> 02:01:28.800]   more and more of the reality of your life in the world, individually and collectively. So
[02:01:28.800 --> 02:01:36.400]   we cry out to you for mercy. We give thanks for your unending faithfulness. For you alone, oh God,
[02:01:36.400 --> 02:01:44.080]   are our hope. In the name of Jesus Christ, Father, Son, and Spirit, Amen. Amen.
[02:01:45.920 --> 02:02:04.240]   Thank you. Thank you, everyone. Yeah, it's nice. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Thank you. Thank you.
