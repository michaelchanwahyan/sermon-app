[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.000]  (音樂)
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000]  Good morning or good evening everyone
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000]  Depending on where you are
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000]  Welcome to the final day of
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000]  CGST Josephine's Soul Culture and Ethics lecture week
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000]  I am Esther Xue
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000]  Assistant Professor of Biblical Studies
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000]  We are so honored to have
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000]  our keynote speaker Dr. Labberton
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000]  with us at the start of 2021
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000]  via this virtual platform
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000]  Besides he is known as president of
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000]  Fuller Theological Seminary
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000]  Dr. Labberton also serves in several
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000]  significant world ministry institutions
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000]  Particularly he is known as
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000]  leadership with scholar leaders
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000]  international and John Stott ministry
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000]  NATI's Lindheim partners
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000]  Actually I can survive through my PhD
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000]  partly because I have been supported
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000]  spiritually and financially
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000]  by these two institutions
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000]  Thanks Dr. Labberton
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000]  I believe we were so inspired
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000]  by your fruitful lectures
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000]  in the past three days
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000]  You have clearly shown the cultural locations
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000]  and the key factors of the crisis
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000]  of American white evangelicalism
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000]  And your reflections on them
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000]  shed light on the situation of Hong Kong
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000]  or Chinese evangelical churches
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000]  Well, after the crisis
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]  finally we move forward
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000]  to today's topic on hope
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000]  Please join with me to welcome Dr. Labberton
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]  to present on evangelicalism
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]  still or not yet
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000]  to explore how the crisis of
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]  American white evangelicalism requires
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000]  the restoration its soul
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000]  by discovering its source and hope
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000]  Thank you very much
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]  I appreciate again being here
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]  I have been very warmly welcomed
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]  by all of you and I'm grateful for that
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]  I want to say again my special thanks
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]  to your president Dr. Stephen Lee
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]  for the invitation to come
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]  and be part of these lectures
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]  And I look forward I hope to one day
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000]  being able to visit CGST in person again
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]  It's a community that I have had
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000]  connection with for over 30 years
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]  And I'm extremely grateful for your ministry
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]  and for your life together
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]  I'm aware of the significant challenges
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000]  that many churches throughout Asia
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]  and particularly in Hong Kong
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]  are facing these days
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]  And therefore my own particular gratitude
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]  for your willingness to allow me
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]  to be part of your conversation
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]  And I hope and pray as I have from the beginning
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]  that these days together
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]  will be useful to you
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]  So the title of this final lecture
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]  as we've heard is Evangelicalism
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000]  Still or Not Yet
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]  You'll notice in the English spelling of this
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]  that there's a hyphenation
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000]  between evangel and icalism
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]  And one of the arguments that I want to make
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000]  is represented by that simple construct
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000]  that is that it's the evangel
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]  Jesus and the kingdom of God
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]  which is central
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]  Icalism names a movement
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]  a body of people
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]  a set of cultural practices
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]  and theological and spiritual
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000]  and ethical stances
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000]  that have been taken in light of the gospel
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]  But I want to argue tonight
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]  that our hope is found in thinking again
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]  about the evangel
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000]  and letting that be what defines
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000]  who we are and how we live in the world
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000]  So let me begin then by saying this
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]  If there's going to be hope
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]  which I definitely believe there is
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]  Our American evangelical
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]  is going to find it by claiming
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]  that we are "still evangelical"
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]  or asking the question
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]  Are we yet evangelical?
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]  In the first construct
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]  Are we still evangelical?
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]  The claim can often be
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]  that it's like a destination
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]  at which some have already arrived
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000]  or a trajectory, by contrast
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]  a direction, but by no means yet reached
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000]  If we're claiming that we're still evangelical
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]  it seems to me that we're in danger
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000]  of claiming that we have arrived
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]  and that we need to hold on
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000]  to the terrain that was defended
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000]  and claimed before
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000]  But if we ask the question
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000]  Are we yet evangelical?
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000]  We're asking
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000]  Is our life and our ministry
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000]  individually, personally and institutionally
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000]  is it a reflection of the evangel itself?
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000]  That puts us on a very, very different trajectory
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000]  In other words, is evangelical an identity
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]  that we claim like a badge
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]  that we could put on our chest?
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000]  Or is evangelicalism an invitation?
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000]  Is evangelical mission
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000]  an exercise in dominion
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000]  with territory claimed
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000]  and a flag firmly planted?
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000]  Or is evangelical mission
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]  a witness to the invitation
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000]  to find life in the kingdom of God
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000]  and to become part of a new community
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000]  that seeks to be an embodied reflection
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000]  of Jesus Christ?
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000]  To pose these binary alternatives
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000]  reflects the ways that I find
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000]  aspects of American evangelicalism
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]  to be tragic and offensive
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000]  to the gospel itself
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000]  Encroaching on the unique supremacy
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000]  and authority of Jesus
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000]  is sadly a deceptive duplicity
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000]  that subverts the primary
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000]  and the primacy and character of Jesus
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000]  and supplants it with American culture
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000]  dressed in gospel garb, gospel clothing
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000]  It can make the sounds of the gospel
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000]  while it lives a different and divergent story
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000]  Of course it must be said
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000]  that no expression of the gospel
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000]  is free from compromise
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000]  and human distortion
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000]  And in Romans, or rather in Matthew 28
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000]  it is an astonishing thing
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000]  that Jesus gives the great commission
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]  that we call the mission
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000]  that defines the mission of God's people in the world
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000]  to 11 disciples, the text points out
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000]  not the perfect number 12, but just to 11
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000]  And the text says that some believed and some doubted
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000]  And in Greek it's that some believed and doubted
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]  It's that the same people both believed and doubted
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]  The church is always fewer numbers than we would hope
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]  And it's always far from being the true and
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]  doubtless people that we might imagine
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000]  To Jesus, this band of 11 believer doubters
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000]  11 believer doubters
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000]  This band was the right group
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000]  to be God's witnesses to nothing less
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000]  than the hope of the world
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000]  This is all part of the shocking evangel
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000]  God's redeeming love and justice in Jesus Christ
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000]  should ground and define a new communion
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000]  or community of disciples
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]  on a journey of transformation
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000]  If the question is not still evangelical
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000]  but rather yet evangelical
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000]  then American white evangelicalism
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000]  could begin the kind of reset
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000]  that only the evangel itself offers
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]  Some of the primary elements of
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000]  Bebbington's quadrilateral depiction of evangelicalism
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000]  which we discussed earlier
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000]  could contribute to the reclamation and recreation
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]  of American white evangelicalism
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000]  So let me begin by making several points
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000]  The first is this
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000]  The hope for American white evangelicalism
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000]  lies in the evangel
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000]  It does not lie in evangelicalism
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000]  The hope of evangelicalism in America
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000]  is born by the evangel
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000]  not by evangelicalism itself
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000]  The hope is not that the icalism of evangelicalism
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000]  past or present, that is not our hope
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000]  Agendas, personalities, structures, assumptions
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000]  prerogatives cloud and encrust the evangel
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000]  and attach to it like barnacles
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:54.000]  to some kind of port
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000]  The icalisms encase God's living word
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000]  inside a particular set of language games
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.000]  regarding abortion, human sexuality, race, gender
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000]  mannerliness, control and doctrine
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000]  So around the evangel, in other words
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]  are these barnacles or these attachments
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]  that are claiming that they are
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000]  virtually equal to the evangel itself
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000]  A similar set of religious codes
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000]  conscripted first century Israel
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000]  It was into that context
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000]  that Jesus announced the arrival of the kingdom of heaven
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000]  or the kingdom of God
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000]  and called unlikely disciples
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000]  and generously taught and healed
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:52.000]  Jew and Gentile, righteous and unrighteous alike
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000]  Jesus embodied a scandal
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000]  that refused the boundaries of acceptability
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000]  that confronted the abusive control of Sabbath keeping
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000]  that honored the good Samaritan
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000]  and that saw in the faith of a Roman centurion
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000]  a faith that exceeded that which he had seen
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000]  in all of Israel
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000]  In other words, Jesus subverts the practices
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000]  and claims of dominion and nationalism
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000]  and individualism and agency and fear
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000]  not least those things done in the name of God
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000]  All of this meant paring away
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000]  what was assumed to be primary
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000]  in order to actually hear what was primary
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000]  the good news that was and is truly good
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000]  because of Jesus Christ
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000]  American white evangelicals need the evangelism
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000]  the evangel to save us from ourselves
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000]  We need to be delivered, rescued from evangelicalism
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000]  Upsetting the money changers in the temple
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000]  seems like the right picture
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000]  We stand inside the faith
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000]  but we in one sense or another
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000]  need the faith that has been practiced
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000]  to be overthrown
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000]  Procuring and providing implements of worship
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000]  but distorting and distracting people from true worship
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000]  was the problem in the temple
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000]  When Jesus flips the tables
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000]  and calls them thieves and a den of robbers
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000]  He exposes what had been unassailable
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000]  and it changes everything
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:42.000]  about identity, power, money, control and more
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000]  It was a religious, social and economic system
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000]  that was being dismantled at that moment
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000]  as well as confronted
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000]  Is it too much to believe
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000]  that American white evangelicalism
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000]  is in need of the same confrontation
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000]  The purpose is not deserved judgment
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000]  but instead the discovery of the good news
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:14.000]  again and as it were for the first time
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000]  The evangelicals need to be converted
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000]  back to the evangel
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000]  The presumptions of evangelicals
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000]  undermines the ability
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000]  to allow the good news
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000]  to do its fundamental confrontation
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:38.000]  conviction, repentance, lament and reconstruction
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000]  Zacchaeus got this to the core
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000]  and it changed his inner life
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000]  and his public life
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000]  It meant tangible actions of reparation
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000]  in place of acts
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000]  that up to that point
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000]  had been all about self-preservation
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000]  He got the word Jesus was making
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000]  that Jesus was making all things new
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000]  and that meant all of him
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000]  for the sake of all who were around him
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000]  As evangelicals we are known
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000]  for talking conversion
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000]  but we do not necessarily
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000]  practice it ourselves
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000]  The ongoing work of letting
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000]  the actual evangel be our life
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000]  is not the same as living
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000]  inside evangelical culture
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000]  Allowing Jesus Christ to confront
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000]  and to break American evangelicalism
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000]  of its distractions and its idols
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000]  would be essential for its revival
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000]  Do we need a road to Damascus confrontation?
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000]  Saul was after all so assured
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000]  that his spiritual, theological
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000]  and political pedigree were in place
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000]  Dominion, nationalism, identity, agency
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000]  and fear were in full flight
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000]  And then on the road to Damascus
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000]  the risen Christ confronts him
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000]  when he is right in the middle
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000]  of his own self-righteous crusade
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000]  with a life-redefining question
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:25.000]  "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?"
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000]  Cast down and blinded for three days
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000]  but also fed and kept by God's provision
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000]  And then he was unexpectedly welcomed
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.000]  by the touch of Ananias' words
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000]  "Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000]  who appeared to you on the road
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000]  by which you came has sent me
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000]  so that you may regain your sight
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:59.000]  and be filled with the Holy Spirit."
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000]  What confronts and redeems Saul
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000]  is the evangel, it's not evangelicalism
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000]  Through his blindness, through later
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000]  13 years of study and reflection
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000]  Paul lives as a mature
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000]  and perfect reflection
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000]  of an unexpected evangel
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000]  that was still in the process
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.000]  of making him, Paul, new
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000]  American white evangelicalism
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000]  needs to hear and receive
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000]  Jesus' confronting question
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000]  "Why do you make my good news
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000]  look and sound so bad?"
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000]  We need the evangel to rescue us
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000]  The next point is this
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000]  that American white evangelical
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000]  needs the evangel
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.000]  to help evangelicalism die
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000]  The apostle's birthright, his personal pride
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000]  his persecuting dominion
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000]  over Jesus' followers
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000]  his religious stature
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000]  as a Pharisee of Pharisees
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000]  his political identity
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000]  as a Roman citizen
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000]  had to become, as he says in Philippians
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000]  "dumb"
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000]  It was this dismantling of Saul
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000]  that allowed him to become Paul
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000]  The mark of his conversion
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000]  was not in holding on to the prerogatives
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000]  and privileges of which he had
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000]  so understandably been proud
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000]  while learning to profess Jesus
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000]  Rather, his proud religious life
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000]  his public life
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000]  had to die
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000]  so the new life in Christ
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000]  could be born
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000]  Laying down his trophies
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000]  to identify, as he says
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000]  with the fellowship of Christ's sufferings
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000]  led Paul to speak and embody
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000]  an entirely different life
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000]  completely unlike the life
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000]  that he had led before
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000]  his conversion on the Damascus Road
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000]  and the events that followed
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000]  The success of American white evangelicalism
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000]  has exposed, ironically, its failure
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000]  By choosing to pursue the road of victory
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000]  that has not led to human, ecclesial
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000]  or social thriving
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000]  for American white evangelicalism
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000]  But too often, as we've explored
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000]  to a barren and shameful display
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000]  of self-serving appetites
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000]  and self-protective interests
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000]  This is hardly a mirror of the Lord
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000]  that we claim to trust and follow
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000]  American white evangelicalism
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000]  is a part of the body of Christ
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000]  that cannot be remade without dying
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000]  to significant elements of our common life
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.000]  The death that is needed
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000]  must confront its idolatrous assumptions
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000]  as we've thought about communion
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000]  about dominion, nationalism and individualism
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.000]  about whiteness and agency and fear
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000]  These are the primary posts
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000]  that define the broken and scandalous architecture
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000]  within which American white evangelicalism
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000]  has been built
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000]  Life in Christ cannot thrive
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000]  in this prison of privilege
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000]  These things are a betrayal
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000]  of an evangelistic life
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000]  and they substitute human categories
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000]  and privileges
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000]  that are bent against the humble purposes
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000]  of God's redemptive reign
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000]  Failure to put these things to death
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000]  exposes their power
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000]  and our false allegiance
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000]  No wonder American churches
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000]  are being vacated by young adults
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.000]  and teenagers
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000]  who fail to see a basic integrity
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000]  of life that matches faith
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000]  Why should these young people not leave?
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000]  When we make them the problem
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000]  that is the young adults and teenagers
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000]  and fail to see that we
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000]  that is the holders of the treasures
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000]  of white evangelicalism in America
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000]  that we are the problem
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000]  the scale of the crisis only grows darker
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000]  We fail to see what we have to first admit
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000]  so that we can be changed
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000]  If for example
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000]  American white evangelicalism
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000]  had truly repented
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000]  of its deep complicity in racism
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000]  and its participation in centuries
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000]  of torturous and abusive slavery
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000]  that would utterly change
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000]  what has become the nearly impossible
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000]  conversation today
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.000]  about reparations
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000]  that is paying back in some way
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000]  the people who are descendants of slaves
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000]  This willingness
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000]  of course our secular nation
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000]  is not interested in that
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000]  But the people of God
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000]  would it not be the natural outcome
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000]  of a true dying to the offense
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000]  and scandal of slavery
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000]  and the contemporary entanglements
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000]  with racism and white supremacy
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000]  for at least the people of God
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000]  in the 21st century
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000]  to work on behalf of appropriate reparations
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000]  for slaves' descendants
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000]  Perhaps reparations from the nation
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000]  may not come
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000]  But for the role of American white evangelicals
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000]  to raise reparations for their role
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000]  in the defense and benefit from slavery
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000]  The promises of Zakiya echo
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000]  Look Lord, here and now
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000]  I give half of my positions to the poor
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000]  And if I cheated anybody out of anything
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000]  I will pay back four times the amount
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000]  Jesus said to him
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000]  Today salvation has come to this house
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000]  Because this man too
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000]  Is a son of Abraham
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000]  For the Son of Man came to seek
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000]  And to save the lost
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000]  What is the point of American white evangelicals
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000]  Defending and arguing against
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000]  The witness of black and brown Christians
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000]  And others in the United States
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000]  Who testify to suffering
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000]  Because of whiteness in general
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000]  And Christian whiteness in particular
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000]  Would not a spiritual humility
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000]  Empower God's people
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.000]  To seek the truth
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000]  To name reality
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000]  To take responsibility
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000]  To confess wrong
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.000]  To repent
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000]  And to truly start again
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000]  It is hard to find this
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000]  As a deep track in the history of the world
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000]  Of the American white evangelical church
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:04.000]  It has not profoundly and pervasively happened
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000]  And the proof lies in the ongoing legitimacy
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.000]  Of the Christian movement
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000]  That can so appropriately be labeled
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000]  American white evangelicalism
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000]  That total phrase would never be needed
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000]  If the American church
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.000]  White evangelical church had responded
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.000]  The unnamed but ever-present reality of whiteness
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.000]  Shows the willingness of millions of Christian people
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000]  To die to their cultural and racial privilege
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000]  White evangelicals profess that dying leads to living
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000]  But that is true
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.000]  Only if we live are dying
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000]  The next point is this
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000]  That the death of American white evangelicalism
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000]  Could actually be its birth
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000]  Revivals are typically defined
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000]  By church historians as a combination of two
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000]  Simultaneous factors
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000]  Evidence both of personal transformation
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000]  And of social transformation
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000]  The need for each contributes to the necessity of the other
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000]  The admission that personal change is required
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000]  In order to produce social change
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000]  And social change without personal change
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.000]  May be too superficial to make enduring change last
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000]  Let's hypothetically imagine
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000]  That the portrait of American white evangelicalism
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.000]  That I've given you
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.000]  Is sufficiently accurate to bring many to their knees
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000]  And by God's grace to usher in a revival
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000]  Of a deep and transformative kind
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000]  Please join me in an imaginary exercise
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000]  Of how a story of revival in America
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000]  Not of secular and multi-religious society that America is
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000]  But of the American white evangelicals themselves
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000]  The story might read like this
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:15.000]  Dateline January 2020 or even better now January 2021
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.000]  American white evangelicals in several cities and towns
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000]  Are showing themselves in an entirely new way
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:28.000]  In place of their typically proud and adamant rhetoric of confidence
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:34.000]  We are hearing now new voices with an entirely different tone
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:39.000]  Rather than them pointing blame at others
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000]  These evangelicals are realizing the responsibilities
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000]  That they have failed to practice
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000]  Quietly at first
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000]  But now building in congregations and other gatherings
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000]  This community that we have heard from with such stridency
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000]  Is now making confession
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.000]  People who described themselves previously
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.000]  As unwilling to hear and accept the experience of others
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000]  Especially others who do not share their racial social background
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000]  Are normally listening to their brothers and sisters of color
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:22.000]  It's like they are actually hearing these stories for the first time
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000]  The report could go on perhaps like this
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000]  Immigrants seeking justice
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000]  Having had their child taken from them and caged before
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000]  Are telling their stories
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000]  And in place of defending borders
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.000]  And denying compassion and care for vulnerable people
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000]  American white evangelicals are at the borders weeping
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000]  And acknowledging the fears that have kept them so angry
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:57.000]  And defensive that they would want to keep other people out
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000]  Gatherings of white evangelicals the report might go on
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000]  Are now happening at the southern US border
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000]  And people who fought for the wall to be built
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.000]  Are now lamenting at the suffering that they have helped cause
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000]  They are gathering with Latino leaders in different parts of the country
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000]  They are trying to start over in hearing the stories
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:24.000]  And grasping the injustice perpetrated against Latinos
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:32.000]  Too often previously unsupported by white evangelicals
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000]  But now supported and cared for
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000]  The report could go on
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:45.000]  Tours of the sites of lynchings against black men and women in America in the past
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.000]  Are now being swamped by gatherings of white evangelicals
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.000]  As are some of the primary sites of the Underground Railroad
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.000]  And of the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000]  Reading groups seem to be springing up everywhere
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.000]  In towns and cities and in evangelical white churches
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000]  Who are listening to the profound words of Frederick Douglass
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000]  And W.E.B. Du Bois and of Martin Luther King
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:18.000]  And of Ruby Bridges and of Fannie Lou Hamer
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:24.000]  And of James Baldwin and of Malcolm X and of Ta-Nehisi Coates
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.000]  These are all African Americans in America
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:33.000]  Publishers are reporting significant increases the report would go on
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000]  In the sales of such writers
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000]  And the prominence of these voices is finally continuing to grow
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:45.000]  It is like something that was never really seen or understood or trusted
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:51.000]  Is now front and center in American evangelical circles
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000]  What's more than this
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000]  Is that there are scenes of home and community gatherings
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000]  Just for confession
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.000]  People are admitting the ways that they've defended themselves
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000]  And rejected the voices of others who are not like them
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000]  A related but different movement seems to be developing in churches
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000]  That have treated women as second-class people
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000]  And likewise need to be repented of
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000]  They are being invited by their male pastors to tell their stories with trust
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:25.000]  So these women's voices can now be heard and believed
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.000]  And where actions are needed, including legal action
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:35.000]  They will take such steps and where appropriate, admit their complicity
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000]  The theme of those that we have met
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.000]  Is that what is happening is personal, the report would go on
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000]  But also institutional
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000]  People realize that it is not just about a change of hearts and minds
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000]  But about changes in the structures and habits of our public lives
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000]  That need to be changed as well
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000]  This feels revolutionary
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000]  A black pastor and a Latino leader
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.000]  Said this was deeper and broader than they have ever seen it before
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000]  It is not measured at this point, they said, by demonstrations
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:15.000]  But by gatherings or services of confession and lament and healing
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:20.000]  Led by black, Latino and Asian leaders of their churches
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.000]  Stay tuned for more
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:29.000]  Now this little imaginary exercise of mine is not a pure dream
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:35.000]  Such things are happening among some American white evangelicals
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.000]  But by too small a percentage
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000]  Only a deep work of the Spirit of God
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:51.000]  Would make it possible for such events to develop
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:56.000]  As an organic reset of American white evangelicalism
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000]  I share this dream with gospel hope
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000]  But also with deep sorrow
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:08.000]  I think Jesus is the one who weeps over Washington, D.C. in recent weeks
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000]  Or New York or Boston
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000]  Chicago or Los Angeles
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000]  And wants to see revival
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000]  God's fulfillment will come
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:24.000]  But we are in the already and not yet in between
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:30.000]  Following the one in Jesus Christ who is with us on a long journey
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000]  Which is never complete in this life
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000]  Where faith will finally become sight
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000]  And where we see fully and no longer
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000]  Through a glass darkly
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000]  We are given confidence but not certainty
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000]  We are straining on at this point
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000]  But not yet arrived
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000]  We live in trust
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:59.000]  For what we have not yet fully seen
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:04.000]  Let's do something more modest if nonetheless profound
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000]  After more than two decades of ministry
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000]  Surrounded by the University of California, Berkeley
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:14.000]  I can say that it is an icon of secularism in America
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000]  I was there serving as a pastor in Berkeley
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000]  Surrounded by the campus
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.000]  And I very seldom found people unwilling to engage
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000]  With issues and debates of religious meaning
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000]  As long as there was room for mystery and humility
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:35.000]  For an acknowledgment of unfinishedness
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000]  And uncertainty
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000]  Christian faculty at the University of California, Berkeley
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:47.000]  They may not have had an easy time communicating with colleagues and students
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:52.000]  About how to understand the world through the lens of the Bible
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:58.000]  But even so, it was imaginable if two things were present
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:03.000]  If the professor gave true evidence of genuine humility
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.000]  And second, if they gave evidence of an honest life
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.000]  Consistent with a complicated world
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.000]  In the midst of their profession of faith
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:21.000]  If either humility or true action of honesty and candor were absent
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.000]  The result from students would be derision
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000]  In the presence of both of these things
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000]  There could be debate
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000]  But there could also be respectful silence
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:39.000]  I remember one time when there were huge campus demonstrations
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.000]  On the campus of the University of California, Berkeley
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000]  That were largely led by Jewish students
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000]  Against what they saw as Islamic fascism
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000]  And on the central plaza of the campus
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000]  There had been daily gatherings during this one week
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000]  Of thousands of students
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.000]  From Monday to Friday
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000]  On the Friday of that week
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000]  During the last day of demonstrations
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000]  A remarkable undergraduate
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000]  Who was a white evangelical woman that I know
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000]  A student who had been present
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:20.000]  To support and encourage the dialogue between Jews and Muslims
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000]  Took the microphone in the closing moments
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000]  As the sun was beginning to go down over the plaza
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.000]  She was known by people there
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000]  And she was known as a Christian
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000]  But she had credibility
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000]  To be able to say to the audience of Jews
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.000]  How grateful, and Muslims, how grateful she had been
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000]  For the week of dialogue
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000]  As passionate as it had been
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000]  And then she surprised everyone
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000]  By unexpectedly asking a group of Jews and Muslims
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.000]  A very straightforward question
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000]  She simply said
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000]  Please raise your hand
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.000]  If you believe that Jesus was the Son of God
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:09.000]  Not one person in this crowd of thousands did so
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000]  She would have known that
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000]  And in the stillness of this moment
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000]  And with a very humble and earnest heart
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000]  She slowly said to them all
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.000]  I love you
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:29.000]  The typically cynical editor of the student newspaper
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.000]  Later muted something like this
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:38.000]  I saw, I saved the last word of this editorial
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000]  To honor Tinley Ireland, the young woman who had spoken
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000]  And for what she did on that final afternoon
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000]  I don't know or believe in her God
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000]  But whatever that is
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000]  And whatever love that is
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000]  I need
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.000]  This is an authentic witness
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.000]  A credible evidence of the presence
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.000]  Love, justice and respect
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.000]  That the gospel, the evangel itself
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:16.000]  Is meant to produce
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000]  If American white evangelicals
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.000]  Could begin a process of rebirth
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000]  Then American white evangelicals
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.000]  Must recover a genuinely Christian identity
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.000]  The crisis of American white evangelicalism
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000]  Can be summed up in the inadequacy
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.000]  If not the absence of these two qualities
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000]  In place of humility
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.000]  Often an overreaching confidence
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.000]  That they and they alone know and define the truth
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.000]  In a place of honesty
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.000]  An admission of weakness and limitation
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.000]  They proclaim and over-assert
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000]  What they don't know fully
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.000]  But claim to know and enact consistently
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000]  This is what exposes
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:07.000]  The unacceptable hypocrisy to so many
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000]  What aspects of Christian identity
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.000]  Of white evangelicals seem to have lost
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000]  We might start here
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000]  That as it says in the Heidelberg Catechism
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.000]  The answer to question one
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.000]  What is your only hope in life and in death
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.000]  To which the answer is
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.000]  We belong not to ourselves
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.000]  But that in body and soul
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.000]  In life and in death
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000]  We belong to our faithful Savior Jesus Christ
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:45.000]  If you read this in light of the gospel narratives
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.000]  We do not then embrace a mere theological frame
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000]  But a new way of being in the world
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.000]  That challenges and reprioritizes
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:02.000]  All other assumptions of our social, economic, racial, ethnic, and educational identity
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000]  Our life is a life now "hidden in Christ"
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000]  And in relationship to which
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:13.000]  We come by the power of the Spirit to live into this new reality
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.000]  That God says is new
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.000]  Christ died to make this
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.000]  Which is necessary, namely our redemption and reparation
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:26.000]  Possible since we cannot redeem ourselves
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.000]  This is the identity into which we are meant to grow
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:34.000]  As maturing disciples
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000]  When we are baptized
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.000]  And we acknowledge entering into Christ's death and resurrection
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000]  And our own dying and rising
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000]  It is not a mere religious ceremony
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:50.000]  But a sacred and public sign of the beginning of a new life
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.000]  This is a communal reality
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000]  Not just an individual one
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.000]  And it happens before the church
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000]  And in some sense before the world
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:05.000]  It is our identity, not my identity alone
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.000]  And it is with and for God's glory
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.000]  Including but not defined by my desires
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.000]  And it's for the building up of the body of Christ
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000]  Including but not defined by my gifts
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.000]  And the evidence of God's life-transforming reign
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.000]  In whatever context we consider
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:30.000]  Including but not bound by my own social location
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.000]  As Paul says, for to me to live is Christ
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.000]  And to die is gain
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:43.000]  If American white evangelicals were to live this identity
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.000]  And find new life, find hope
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000]  It means letting some things die
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.000]  Letting die our sense of self-definition
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.000]  Our sense of individualism
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.000]  Our sense that we hold primary agency
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:06.000]  Our sense that our Christian identity is primarily private and inward
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000]  Our sense that we are followers of Jesus
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000]  Marked with his death and resurrection
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.000]  And filled with his spirit and joined to others who share that new life
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.000]  And that look like us
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:25.000]  Our sense, in other words, that we are first white or American or male
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.000]  Rather than realizing we are first Christ's people
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.000]  American white evangelicals would also
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000]  Not only need to recover a Christian identity
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.000]  But recover a Christian sense of location
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000]  According to the Apostle Paul
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.000]  Our first and foremost location as Christian disciples
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.000]  Is that we live "in Christ"
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.000]  This picture of our lives is both mystical and theological
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.000]  But it is also more incarnational
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.000]  Than those categories alone might suggest
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:07.000]  To be "in Christ" is to grow up in the capacity to see and think and feel
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.000]  And engage in communion with others
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:15.000]  To re-socialize one another in Christ
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:22.000]  To be "in Christ" is to dwell in our divine communion of Father, Son and Spirit
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:27.000]  This is deeply inward but not private and not only personal
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:32.000]  The need to realize our Christian social location
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.000]  If American white evangelicals were to live "in Christ"
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.000]  It means letting some things die
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.000]  That this place is ours
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:47.000]  That our social location is first and foremost where we choose to live
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:52.000]  That we, that is white evangelicals, are in the top location
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.000]  That our social location is neutral when it's clearly not
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:01.000]  That we know the truth and the wisdom and the decisions to make
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.000]  And that our only life in Christ
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:10.000]  Knows how to learn to read our home, our town and our nation
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.000]  American white evangelicals
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.000]  In addition to identity and location
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000]  Need to recover Christian communion
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:25.000]  God's people, we together here
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.000]  Right at this moment
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.000]  In Hong Kong, around the Chinese world
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.000]  Wherever that you might be listening
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.000]  And around the United States and throughout the whole globe
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:43.000]  We are to be the living evidence that Christ died and rose
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.000]  According to Philippians 2
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:50.000]  We do so by showing that we have died and risen
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.000]  To be part of a new humanity, a new communion
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.000]  Of unlike people
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:00.000]  This is how and why the church is to be
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:03.000]  If American white evangelicals were to live out this
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000]  What would need to die?
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:10.000]  We would need to crucify the pride and presumption of our social location
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:14.000]  We would need to repent and lament and reconcile and restore our past
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.000]  And be willing to understand what we need to release
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000]  About the expectation of finding a church
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:25.000]  That is basically finding comfort instead of finding transformation
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:31.000]  Finally, the future and hope of American white evangelicalism
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.000]  God's repertoire of recreating anything
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:41.000]  Whether it's the Chinese church or CGST or Fuller Theological Seminary
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:46.000]  Or American white evangelicalism is without limit
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:52.000]  God has every capacity and desire and will and purpose to recreate us
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:58.000]  God can and God will do what God can and will do
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.000]  Depending on the theological tradition that we are in
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:05.000]  We have presuppositions about what God might do
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:09.000]  I'm here not as the prophet to declare what God will do
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.000]  But to suggest what seems needed
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:15.000]  All of these comments that I've tried to share with you
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:21.000]  Are conditioned by God's choosing to be and do what he does in Jesus Christ
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:26.000]  Perhaps the least likely possible strategy for the redemption of the world
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.000]  That could have been imagined
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.000]  That a Jewish first century male
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:38.000]  Who incarnates nothing less than the whole of God's character in life
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.000]  Is the one by whom the whole world
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:45.000]  In all of its difference and diversity
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.000]  In all of its crisis and urgency
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.000]  Can be saved by Jesus Christ
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:55.000]  This is not a strategy any of us would have devised
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.000]  But it is at the very core
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:02.000]  It is the heart and the heartbeat of the evangelist self
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:08.000]  Therefore God's true heart and truth and imagination
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.000]  Continue to hold our goodness
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000]  And our brokenness
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.000]  And any hope for our redemption
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:20.000]  Including hope for the white American evangelism we've been discussing
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:25.000]  I do not presume God will do what seems to my perspective to be so needed
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:29.000]  What I trust is that God is good
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.000]  That God is near
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:35.000]  And that God will complete what he has begun
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.000]  So for the sake of scattering
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.000]  The understandable despair
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000]  Or resignation that I find
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.000]  In some of the crisis of God's church in the 21st century
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.000]  Let's remember that the enterprise that we are a part of
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:52.000]  Is that we know as reality
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.000]  To be God's wondrous project
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.000]  This mess that I've described
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.000]  As white American evangelicalism
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:07.000]  Is also part of the body of Christ himself
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.000]  We do not come to the table
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:12.000]  That is about human enterprise and effort
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:15.000]  But to the table of God's unending love
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.000]  And mercy and justice
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.000]  The purposes for which the world has been made
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.000]  The goodness with which God has created
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.000]  The severe brokenness that God is redeeming
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.000]  In the sacrifice of Jesus Christ
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:36.000]  And the new creation that is initiated in the resurrection
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000]  The end to which God is moving all things
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.000]  By the presence and power of the Holy Spirit
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:46.000]  In the people of God and in the world
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.000]  These are the solid grounds of our collective hope
