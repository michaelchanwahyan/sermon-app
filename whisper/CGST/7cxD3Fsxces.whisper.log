[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.360]   Thank you very much indeed for Reverend Dr. Isaac for giving us a very very
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.360]   wonderful presentation and also a timely message for our city as well which is
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.280]   full of internal strife and also different kinds of inequalities and
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:23.040]   injustice. Since Dr. Isaac is flying back home tomorrow very early in the morning
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:30.960]   so as a chairperson to keep him safe to keep him returning home safe and sound I
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:38.360]   have to keep the questioning time short. So now we will open the discussion to
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.640]   the floor. So if any of you have any questions so please feel free to come
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:51.640]   forward and give the question in English and if you are not feeling
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.920]   comfortable about asking in English then you may write on the note paper and our
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.200]   helper will pass the note to me and I will try to as best as I can to
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:10.200]   translate your question to Dr. Isaac. So any questions?
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:19.000]   If you don't ask them okay they're over there.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:32.720]   Hello, thank you for your speech. Thank you for giving the talk. It's very
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:39.320]   inspirational. I have two questions I'd like to ask. I'm Noah from Hong Kong. I'm
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.520]   a Christian and I go to church here and I've lived around Palestinian Christians
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:51.520]   well Palestinians and Arabs. What I want to ask is two main questions. One is how
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.440]   do we respond to Christians who use the state of Israel as a fulfillment of
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.320]   prophecy to enhance the Bible's credibility and also as an evangelical
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.920]   tool because I've been to you know mass evangelical meetings. I've worked with
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:13.020]   people who do personal ministries and they use the state of Israel as it
[00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:19.680]   was established in 1948 as a fulfillment of a biblical prophecy and then they
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:26.120]   will say look the Bible you know prophesied this and it became true. So
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.580]   you can see that the Bible is true. It's credible and therefore you should
[00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.140]   believe it. It's a miracle. So that's my first question. Sorry it's a long
[00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:40.160]   question. The second question is how do we relate to Christians who in good
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:48.200]   faith and in conviction continue to believe and promote Christian Zionism as
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.280]   you put it. If you go on the website of BibleGateway.com by the way one of the
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:00.360]   ads is defend Israel know the facts. So and it has a huge American flag paired
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.860]   up with the modern-day Israel flag. So those are my two questions. Thank you
[00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.160]   very much.
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.560]   Yes Christian Zionism is a big big movement and very very prevalent among
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:22.160]   evangelicals. And so the first question is about Israel being a fulfillment is
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.760]   the state of Israel a fulfillment of prophecy. What I always say you know
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.000]   after this long presentation in addition to that I say we have two paths. The
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.120]   first one is to ask what does the New Testament say about these prophecies?
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:43.920]   Were they fulfilled? And more than many many places the New Testament claims
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:50.800]   that Jesus continued redeemed Israel and restored Israel. In fact many prophecies
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.920]   of the Old Testament are declared to have been fulfilled in Jesus not in a
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.680]   literal sense. Just to give you an example Amos 9 there is a prophecy about
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.920]   the restoration of the tent of David and that Israel will inherit the Edomites
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:12.600]   and the tent of David will be restored. There will be prosperity and so on. If
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.520]   you ask any Christian Zionist how is that interpreted they he's tell you
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.040]   that's clear that's the state of Israel. And then I said go to Acts 15 and you
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:28.560]   see that Paul Peter sorry James Jesus brother in the council in Jerusalem says
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.400]   no that's actually fulfilled through the ministry of the church when Gentiles
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.960]   enter into faith. So clearly he didn't adopt a literal strict interpretation to
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.040]   prophecies. And I can go to many other places and can give you other examples.
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:49.720]   One statement says in Jesus all the promises of God have their yes and amen.
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.200]   And then of course what I said about Galatians 3 even if you know continue to
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.320]   believe that Israel will be restored now the promises to Israel because we became
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.120]   part of Israel as I explained in Galatians 3 that that should
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:09.000]   challenge that. So that's my first way of saying did the New Testament does the
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   New Testament claim that the Old Testament prophecies were fulfilled. But
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.480]   even for the sake of argument let's assume that actually the New Testament
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.120]   doesn't claim that. Let's for the sake of argument say the Old Testament
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.200]   prophecies should be fulfilled and then take Old Testament prophecies and
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.640]   compare them with the current reality in the land. They don't match. The only thing
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.520]   that matches is the presence of Jews in the land. Everything else doesn't match.
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.600]   The prophecies are not about Israel returning to the land. The prophecies are
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:49.480]   about Israel returning to the land and repenting and believing in God and
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:54.720]   building the temple and the Messiah coming there and nations coming to
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:00.280]   Jerusalem to worship the God of Israel and the renewal of nature. Where is that?
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:07.880]   That's not happening. You see so basically if you are a literal Christian
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.800]   who believes you should read the Old Testament literally then that means you
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.520]   should not believe that Israel is a fulfillment of prophecy because what we
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:22.640]   have today is a secular state that more or less based on our Christian belief at
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:29.040]   least does not believe in Jesus as the Son of God. Okay so it doesn't work on
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:33.440]   both ways and that's how I answer those who say that Israel is a fulfillment of
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.800]   prophecy and you're right that many of those who believe in that
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:46.760]   are well-intentioned Christians yet they have as I argue a very most of the time
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:54.280]   limited knowledge and if I dare I say even ignorance about the facts on the
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:59.360]   ground. Oftentimes they are shocked to know that Palestinian Christians exist
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:05.280]   and then they they tell us well okay God loves the children of Ishmael and I tell
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:09.800]   them I'm not the child of Ishmael I'm a child of Abraham. Read the Bible and
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:14.840]   that's when they don't know what to do but the thing that changes most people's
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:19.160]   perception is coming to the land and seeing the realities of injustice on the
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.960]   ground and that causes many people to go back to scripture and reading is this
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:31.480]   what prophecy is all about to begin with. So I hope that answers.
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:44.240]   There's a question written in English. How has the response been from Israeli
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:51.200]   Jews regarding your theological views that you proposed here tonight? Do you
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:56.840]   feel that Israeli Jews genuinely are interested in inclusiveness regarding
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:04.640]   the ownership of Palestine or is it more closer to an I win you lose mentality?
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:12.280]   Okay yeah good question. I know of very few Israeli Jews numbered
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:17.040]   messianic Jews but their leaders at least who would listen to my lecture and
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:21.320]   say amen we agree in every word you said.
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:29.720]   And so there are some who would agree with us yet the majority do not accept
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:36.640]   my interpretation of scripture and the majority you see for most messianic
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:42.640]   Jews what we are challenging what I am challenging today has to do with also
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:49.160]   their identity because many of them when they believed in Jesus it happened in a
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:53.280]   place like North America or Canada or outside the land not all but many of
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:59.600]   them and then they thought or they believe that this is the moment in
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:03.200]   history in which God is redeeming the Jewish people and bringing them back to
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:07.600]   the land. So it becomes part of their identity so they move to live in Israel
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:12.960]   and then they encounter us and we tell them you're wrong about all of that and
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:17.880]   so that poses them with a big big challenge usually a lot of withdrawal
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:22.840]   and so today we see a lot of messianic Jews who don't want to engage with us
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:29.480]   theologically and we see others who are willing to engage with us theologically
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:38.000]   so it's not one one way of responding to us or another. We've had messianic Jews
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.720]   Israeli messianic Jews who come to Bethlehem to debate us in a very
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:47.380]   friendly manner in which we begin by saying we're one in Christ but we
[00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:52.280]   disagree on theology. We've met sometimes we meet as theologians to discuss these
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:57.320]   issues and write books in which we present one view they present other view.
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:02.120]   The last year I've done at least two debates with messianic Jews messianic
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:07.280]   Jewish theologian in front of students of theology about these issues and so
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:12.120]   there are different ways in which we deal with these differences and so by
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:19.320]   and large most messianic Jews do not agree with my interpretation yet see me
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:25.720]   still as a brother in Christ and a big number of messianic Jews see it as a I
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:31.840]   win you lose mentality and would not rather engage in dialogue with us yet
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:37.920]   there is a number of them who don't see it as this way and want to emphasize
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:43.760]   that we need to learn from one another. A messianic Jewish friend of mine his name
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:48.840]   is Richard Harvey all the time tells me whenever we debate or talk or write
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:55.600]   statements together that we need to adopt a mentality in which we co-depend
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:59.480]   on one another when we write theology not only we learn but co-depend on one
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:06.900]   another. I don't think we're there yet but at least few of us are aware of the
[00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:12.560]   other position all the time and try to take it seriously all the time. If you
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:18.680]   are interested in all of this Google Larnaca statement something that
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:22.960]   explains all the differences it's a statement four pages that explains the
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:27.160]   major differences between messianic Jews and Palestinian Christians and suggests
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:33.040]   way of dealing with these differences in the future.
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:57.040]   [Pause]
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:06.960]   It seems that it's a big topic that we need more time to think and well if
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:14.240]   there are no more questions then shall I close tonight's event here and shall we
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:19.800]   please again show our greatest appreciation to Dr. Isaac for his
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:32.120]   wonderful speech tonight. [Applause]
