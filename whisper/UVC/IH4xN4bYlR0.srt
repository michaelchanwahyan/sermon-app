1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 Good morning/afternoonish, I'm Yuvi. It's good to see a lot of you again.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 So welcome back to church and to worship with us.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 Okay, so every year, one of the biggest sporting events that we have in the US is the Super Bowl, right?

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 And this year, it is estimated about 127 million viewers tune in for the Super Bowl in New Orleans.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 And this is probably on the more conservative ends as well, because I would assume there are probably a lot of Super Bowl watch parties that are going on.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 And we actually have one here right at UV as well, and I know some of you were here with us that night.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 So for some people, they tune in to the Super Bowl because they are the fans of the game, or they are fans of either of those teams.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 But for another group of people, they tune in to the Super Bowl because of the commercials, but more importantly, because of the halftime show.

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Do any of you fall into this second category? I'm sure there are some of us that belong to that group, right?

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 So the halftime show for the Super Bowl this year was headlined by Kendrick Lamar, who is arguably one of the biggest names in the hip-hop scene.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 And if you actually pay close attention to his halftime show performance this year, all the way from the stage design, the Uncle Sam persona by Samuel L. Jackson,

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 the dancers that are dressed in the colors of American flags, and even the reference to 40 acres and a mule, just to name a few of those.

13
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 His performance was actually a creative blend of high-level entertainment that is accompanied by deep social and political commentary,

14
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 where he addresses issues such as racial inequalities in our nation's history, and also cultural identity being in America.

15
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 But the pivotal moment for Kendrick Lamar's halftime show performance was when he performed his award-winning Grammy Song of the Year called "Not Like Us."

16
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 This song is a diss track targeting another raper called Drake.

17
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 So this feud between Kendrick Lamar and Drake has been going on for quite some time now.

18
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 But by performing this particular song in the Super Bowl, Kendrick Lamar brought the ongoing personal but public rivalry between him and Drake

19
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 all the way to the biggest stage of the world and put it on display for everyone to see, pretty much.

20
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 However, this kind of public rivalry and conflict does not only happen in our pop culture.

21
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 The sad reality is that it happens within the church as well.

22
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 If you just look at the church histories, there is the Great Schism in 1054 AD,

23
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 where a split happened between the church with the Roman Catholic Church in the west and the Eastern Orthodox Church in the east.

24
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 There's also the Protestant Reformation, which eventually led to the Thirty Years' War between the Catholic and Protestant states in Europe as well.

25
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 A couple of weeks ago, I saw a Facebook post from one of the biggest Christian evangelical organizations in the U.S., I think.

26
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 Basically, the post is kind of like critiquing the ministry and the work of another pastor who is from a different theological tradition.

27
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 And as you can imagine, the comment section pretty much just becomes a place for public, virtual arguments between these two sides of people.

28
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 So why did I bring this up? These examples are just a snippet of what is going on in our current world.

29
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 Even now, as I'm speaking, there is the war happening in Gaza in the Middle East.

30
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 And we're also entering into the third anniversary of the war that is happening between Ukraine and Russia as well.

31
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 And if you have been following along the news, especially with the meeting between President Trump and President Zelensky,

32
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 please pray for the leaders of our country that they will care for the things that Jesus truly cared about, for justice and peace,

33
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 not to show our strength or fall into kind of like the lies of American exceptionalism.

34
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 But with the ever-increasing division in our society, including within our church, how should we as followers of Jesus respond?

35
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 We have been studying through Jesus' Sermon on the Mount for the past couple of months now,

36
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 and I think the Sermon on the Mount is especially relevant to the cultural moment that we are currently in.

37
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 Because in it, Jesus lays out how life in his kingdom ought to look like and how we, as believers, can take part of it.

38
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 So in my first sermon, we look at the Beatitudes in which Jesus describes the attitude or character of those who are considered as blessed in his kingdom.

39
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 And one of them is this, "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God."

40
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 To understand what a peacemaker is, we need to first understand what peace is exactly.

41
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 For a lot of us, when we think about peace, we just think of the absence of conflict, right?

42
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 Maybe you live with a couple of roommates. One of them, they just like to leave all the dishes in the sink unwashed.

43
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 And another one of them, maybe they just like to leave the dirty clothes in the washer or dryer for weeks.

44
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 And when you have to use it, you just open it up and say, "Well, I guess I have to wait for the dirty clothes to get cleared out first."

45
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 And maybe for you, peace is not confronting them with those issues, even though inside of you, you don't really experience peace at all.

46
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 But because for you, peace is just the absence of any sort of conflict.

47
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 But the idea of peace in the Bible is more than just the absence of conflict.

48
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 It also means the presence of something better.

49
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 In the Old Testament, the word for peace in Hebrew is "shalom."

50
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 And shalom represents a state of being whole or being complete, in contrast to the state of chaos, brokenness, or disorder.

51
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 And this is why the Jews, they usually greet each other with "shalom," hope you are doing well.

52
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 And when we come to the New Testament, the birth of Jesus is being announced as the arrival of peace, or "erene," in Greek, on earth.

53
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 Why? Because through Jesus, he made peace between sinful human and a holy God through his death and resurrection.

54
00:06:49,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 Or in other words, Jesus restores a broken relationship between human and God that has been tainted by sin since the beginning in Genesis, back to wholeness.

55
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 And not only that, he now calls his followers to do the same, to carry on this peace into the world.

56
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 So, to be a peacemaker doesn't just mean that we do our best to avoid conflict.

57
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 If you see a brother or sister living in sin, false peace might look like this, not calling them out, because you want to avoid any confrontation and conflict.

58
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 But true peace, on the other hand, would mean pointing out their blind spots because you love this brother or sister, and you want to see them experience true shalom or wholeness.

59
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 So, the section in the Sermon on the Mount that we're currently in explores the better righteousness that Jesus has redefined for his followers.

60
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 So far, we have looked at how Jesus redefined his greater righteousness, and we discovered God's heart behind the sixth and the seventh commandments in the Ten Commandments, right?

61
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 That is the kind of attitude in our hearts that treats everyone made in the image of God as worthy to be respected.

62
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 So, if you can recall, similar to murder, Jesus said that when we show anger or contempt towards a brother or sister, we diminish the value and worth of someone made in the image of God.

63
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 And similar to adultery, when we lust after a brother or sister, we strip them of their humanity and turn them into an object for our own gratification.

64
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 And in my last sermon, we also look at how Jesus refrains kind of like the Jewish debate on divorce, and instead he shifts the focus on God's original design for marriage instead.

65
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 So, this morning, we're going to look at two more examples on how Jesus redefines what true righteousness means in contrast to the righteousness of the Pharisees and the teacher of the law.

66
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 So, if you have your Bible with you, let's turn with me to Matthew chapter 5. We are going to read from verse 33 to 42.

67
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 So, Matthew chapter 5, verse 33.

68
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 "Again, you have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'Do not break oath, but fulfill to the Lord the vows you have made.' But I tell you, do not swear an oath at all, either by heaven, for it is God's throne, or by the earth, for it is his footstool, or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great king.

69
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black. All you need to say is simply 'yes' or 'no,' and anything beyond this comes from the evil one."

70
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 Verse 38.

71
00:09:42,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 "You have heard that it was said, 'Eye for eye and tooth for tooth.' But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn them the other cheek also. And if anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, hand over your coat as well.

72
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with them two miles. Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you."

73
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 So, this is the word of God. Let us pray.

74
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 Father, as we open up your words this morning, I just ask that your Spirit will be with us. Prepare our hearts as we receive your words, and allow your words to take root in our heart and transform our life, so that we can bring honor and glory to you through the way that we live.

75
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 So, pray this in your Son's name. Amen.

76
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 So, Matthew chapter 5, 33 and 242. What is it about?

77
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 If you are taking notes, you can write this down.

78
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 "In a fragmented world, we are called to bring peace through our word and deed."

79
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 So, this is the idea that we will be exploring today.

80
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 In a world where people are divided based on their skin colors, based on their economic status, based on their political ideologies, or beliefs in health or science, and so many other things that disunites us,

81
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 we, as followers of Jesus, are called to bring peace through our word and deed.

82
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 So, we're going to first take a look at how we can bring peace through our words.

83
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 So, we bring peace through our words by speaking truthfully and with integrity.

84
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 We bring peace by speaking truthfully and with integrity.

85
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 So, verse 33. "Again, you have heard that it was said."

86
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 So, once again, these examples begin with this same rabbinic formula.

87
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 "You have heard that it was said to the people long ago."

88
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 And just to give a refresher, every time when a Jewish rabbi wants to start a discussion on a specific Mosaic law, they would introduce it using this formula.

89
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 So, Jesus, as the definite and ultimate interpreter of the law, Jesus is doing the same thing right here.

90
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 And the law that is in focus this time centers around oath-making.

91
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 So, "Do not break your oath, but fulfill to the Lord the vows you have made."

92
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 This is not a direct quotation, but it is actually a summary of a series of law regarding oath from the Old Testament.

93
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 Nowadays, we would probably hear people say something like, "I swear to God," and then go on to give their statement, right?

94
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 But oath in the ancient world, and even during Jesus' times, looks a little different than what we're used to now.

95
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 And they probably carry a little more weight as well.

96
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 So, let me give a little context to oath in the ancient world.

97
00:12:51,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 So, in the ancient Near East, people would invoke or call upon the name of their gods as a witness to affirm a statement.

98
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 And one of the ways that oath can give credibility to a promise or to a statement is by having some kind of curses or consequences being attached to it in the case of dishonesty.

99
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 So, for example, someone will make an oath and swear, "I swear that may Marduk or Baal or insert whatever God's name in there,

100
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 may this God strike me dead or make me ill if I break this oath or if I do not follow along with this promise."

101
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 And for the people of God, of course, they would invoke upon the name of the Lord or Yahweh when they make their oath.

102
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 And so this is what Jesus is pointing to here in verse 33 on how the Jews and the custom are when it comes to oath making.

103
00:13:50,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 And as you can probably expect at this point, Jesus then continues on to give his version and redefine what true righteousness means with this interpretation.

104
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 "But I tell you, do not swear an oath at all, either by heaven, for it is God's throne, or by the earth, for it is his footstool, or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great king.

105
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black."

106
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 So let's pause here. What is going on in here?

107
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 So during Jesus' time, the Jews, they would not mention the name of the Lord because out of reverence and out of respect for it.

108
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 So instead, what they would do is that they would use other things that are being associated with God when they make an oath.

109
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 So the heaven, the earth, or the city of Jerusalem are just three of the common realms that the Jews would call upon when they make the oath.

110
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 But what Jesus is saying right here is that, "Don't swear by the heaven or by the earth, for they belong to God the creator, not us as human.

111
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 And also, don't call upon Jerusalem, because it is God's city. It is not for us to call upon or for us to control or invoke."

112
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 And just in case someone asks, "Okay, Jesus, what if I just swear on my own head? It is part of my body. I should have control over it, right?"

113
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 Well, Jesus says, "No, God has authority over us as well.

114
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 We do not have the power to even turn our hair white, which symbolizes old age and wisdom, or turn them black, which symbolizes youth and life."

115
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 So, one thing to note here, when Jesus says, "Do not swear an oath at all,"

116
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 he is not nullifying old oaths because we find in other parts of the New Testament where God himself makes an oath in the books of Hebrews,

117
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 and so does Paul in some of his epistles as well.

118
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 What Jesus is prohibiting here is the kind of superficial and flippant oath made on seemingly ordinary or insignificant issues,

119
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 and sometimes even worse, blatantly false claims or conspiracies.

120
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 And what is wrong with all of these?

121
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 At the root of these is a kind of attitude that thinks that we, as human, we have the authority to manipulate God for our own benefits,

122
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 using God's reputation as a tool to lend credibility to our own statement or our own words.

123
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 So what should we do then? This is where verse 37 comes in.

124
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 And Jesus said, "All you need to say is simply yes or no, and anything beyond this comes from the evil one."

125
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 So, rather than relying on oath, Jesus called us to speak truthfully in all circumstances,

126
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 and anchor the truthfulness of our words in our personal integrity.

127
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 So let our yes be yes, and let our no be no. Live up to your own promises and stand by your own words.

128
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 Do not use oath as an excuse for not taking any responsibility for the words that comes out of our mouth,

129
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 because these come from Satan.

130
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 And so here are just some of the applications that how we can speak truthfully with our words.

131
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 So first one, speak with integrity and do not use our words to slander other people.

132
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 Secondly, in a digital age, we communicate not just true words spoken, but also true words written or words typed up, right?

133
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 Especially in the age of social media.

134
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 So, how we can bring peace with our words?

135
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 Discern the information that you have heard or read online, and do not be quick to spread them around,

136
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 or repost anything that you see online that has the potential to further divide us instead of uniting us.

137
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 This is because as followers of Jesus, we are called to bring peace through our words.

138
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 So, speak truthfully and with integrity.

139
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 And as the Apostle Paul instructed the church in Ephesus, do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouth,

140
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen.

141
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 So, this is how we can bring peace through our words.

142
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 Another way that we can bring peace is through our actions or through our deeds.

143
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 We can bring peace by acting selflessly and generously.

144
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 So, let's take a look at the next example from Jesus here.

145
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 Verse 38.

146
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 "You have heard that it was said, 'Eye for eye and tooth for tooth.'

147
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 But I tell you, do not resist an evil person.

148
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn them the other cheek also.

149
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 And if anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, hand over your coat as well.

150
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 And if anyone wants to, and if anyone forces you to go one mile, go with them two miles.

151
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you."

152
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 So, the principle right here, an eye for an eye or tooth for a tooth, is actually called the law of retribution.

153
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 And we actually find it in various places in the Old Testament.

154
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 And in the Old Testament, this principle of justice is not about personal retribution or personal vengeance,

155
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 but it is actually about regulating excessive punishment.

156
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 In other words, it doesn't mean that if someone takes one of your eyes,

157
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 now you have the legal right to take your eyes out.

158
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 No, the purpose of this principle is to regulate the penalty by saying that the punishment should fit the crime.

159
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 So, for example, if someone knocks a tooth out of your mouth,

160
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 you can't just end your life and take your life by killing them.

161
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 Because the punishment, again, it doesn't fit the crime.

162
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 And by making this law in the legal system, it actually provides an appropriate avenue

163
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 where people can pursue justice in a legal way instead of personal vengeance or personal revenge.

164
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 But once again, Jesus continues to say, "But I tell you, do not resist an evil person."

165
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 I want to be careful here because someone can hear this and think,

166
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 "Is Jesus just telling us to just sit there and ignore the need for justice?

167
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 Or when we see evil being done, do we just sort of let it go and not resist it at all?"

168
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 So again, I want to emphasize that in this particular section,

169
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 when Jesus talks about not resisting an evil person,

170
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 Jesus is not rejecting the principle of justice at all,

171
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 but he is speaking on retaliation and revenge at a personal level.

172
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 So what Jesus is not saying here is that we do not resist evil at all.

173
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 1 Peter 5 says that the devil is like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.

174
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 And we, as God's people, we are called to resist him.

175
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 What Jesus is not saying here is also that we do not call out or oppose evil.

176
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 Time and time again in the Old Testament,

177
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 we see that the prophets actually calls out the evil and the injustice that is happening in Israel

178
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 and the surrounding nations as well.

179
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 And in the New Testament, we also see the apostle Paul actually calls out Peter

180
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 because Peter is not acting in a way that is in line with the truth of the gospel.

181
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 And right here, Jesus is also not talking about justice in the legal system or in the government.

182
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 Romans 13 is pretty clear.

183
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 It shows us that God has given his authority to the government to execute justice on his behalf.

184
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 So right here, Jesus is calling us to let go of our right to get even or to repay violence with violence,

185
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 but to depend on the ultimate justice of God.

186
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 And I know this is not easy at all because it requires patience on our behalf.

187
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 It requires us to wait on the Lord.

188
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 But not only that, we are also called to repay evil with good.

189
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 And Jesus actually gives a few illustrations here.

190
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 So the first one, "If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also."

191
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 So throughout history, the right hand is usually the more dominant hand for most people, right?

192
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 So to slap someone on the right cheek will be a backhand slap, pretty much like this way.

193
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 And in the first century context, a backhand slap is actually meant to be an insult to humiliate someone

194
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 that usually has a lower social status compared to you,

195
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 while a forehand slap is usually for a peer or someone who has equal status with you.

196
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 And so in this situation, Jesus tells his disciple to turn the other cheek,

197
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 to take the high road and be humiliated rather than to take revenge.

198
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 And I actually like how one of the commentators put it.

199
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 He says, "When we turn the other cheek, we force them to treat us as equal

200
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 because they will have to slap us with their forehand this time instead of the backhand."

201
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 And in the second example, Jesus said, "And if anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt,

202
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 hand over your coat as well."

203
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 So shirt during Jesus' time is usually an inner garment and the coat is the outer garment.

204
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 And compared to the shirt, the coat, which is the outer garment, is usually the more important one

205
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 because it is used not just as a protective layer from the elements,

206
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 but it can also be used as a blanket or a makeshift shelter

207
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 when someone needs to sleep in the field on the long road trips.

208
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 And in Exodus specifically, the law also states that even the poor people

209
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 should have the right to keep their coat.

210
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 But in these examples that Jesus gave us here,

211
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 the better righteousness would be to relinquish the more important possession,

212
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 which is the coat, and to treat the injustice with costly generosity.

213
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 And in the third case, Jesus said, "If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with them two miles."

214
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 And again, you need a little context to understand this.

215
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 So in the Greco-Roman world, a civilian is actually obligated by the law

216
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 to carry the load of a Roman soldier for about one mile if they're being requested.

217
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 And for the Jews, they hated this practice.

218
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 But again, Jesus shows his disciples the better way by telling them to go the extra mile,

219
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 even though they hated this practice.

220
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 Instead of getting stuck in the cycle of repaying evil with evil,

221
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 Jesus calls us to respond with generosity.

222
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 Then Jesus sums up this section in verse 42,

223
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 "Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you."

224
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 So all the things that Jesus asks from us here requires a kind of humility and selflessness, right?

225
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 To not only release our right to get even with someone,

226
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 but also to respond to the injustice or the evil with kindness and generosity.

227
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 If we really think about it, what Jesus is asking from us here is quite a tall task, right?

228
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 Maybe some of you would say, "Jesus, you don't really understand the injustice that I have to endure,

229
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 or you don't understand the things that are being done to me."

230
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 One of the passages that has had the biggest impact in my personal life these past few years

231
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 is from Hebrews chapter 4.

232
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 Talking about Jesus, the author of Hebrews say,

233
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 "For we do not have a great high priest who is unable to empathize with our weakness,

234
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are, yet he did not sin."

235
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 So what Jesus has taught us here, he did not just say it,

236
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 but he himself embodied this kind of humility and selflessness for us to follow.

237
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 In Jesus' arrest and trial, we read that he was being spat on, he was being struck,

238
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 he was being falsely accused, and he was ultimately being humiliated on the cross.

239
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 And yet, one of his final words on the cross is this, and I want us to listen carefully.

240
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 This is what Jesus prayed to his father.

241
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 He said, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing."

242
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 So church, Jesus shows us the perfect examples of humility and selflessness,

243
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 both through his words and his action,

244
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 so that he's able to bring peace between God and human, as well as between human and human as well.

245
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 So if we, as the church, were able to exemplify this kind of costly generosity,

246
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 I think the watching world would start to take notice of the way that we treat each other,

247
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 and also the out-of-the-world kind of peace that we have.

248
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 And this, church, I think can be one of the most powerful witnesses to the kingdom of God

249
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 in our fragmented society.

250
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 So, let's pray.

251
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 Father, we thank you for you have sent your son Jesus

252
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 to bring peace and to restore the shalom that was being broken by sin.

253
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 And not only that, you have given us the gift of the Holy Spirit

254
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 so that we're able to live in a way that follows after your examples.

255
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 So, Father, I don't know what are some of the things that are going through our minds currently.

256
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 Maybe some of the evils that we have experienced,

257
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 or the things that are being said or done to us,

258
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 or the injustice that we see in the world that just seems like no justice is being done.

259
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 So, Father, help us as we wait patiently for your ultimate justice when you come again.

260
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 Help us to be people that represent your kingdom,

261
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 that represent what you have called us to be, to be the peacemaker.

262
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 For you promised that your kingdom belongs to people like this,

263
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 and that we will be called the sons and the daughters of God.

264
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 So, help us to be people that bring peace to our families,

265
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 to our relationships, to our workplace, to wherever you have called us,

266
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 so that we're able to show the world who we belong to.

267
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 We're able to show the world who Jesus truly is, the Prince of Peace.

268
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 So, Father, help us to live in a way that brings glory to you this week.

269
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 Praise the Lord, Amen.

270
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 Okay.
