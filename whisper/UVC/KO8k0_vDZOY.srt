1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
 (soft music)

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,840
 - All right, let's turn to our Bible

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:09,160
 because this is one of the essence

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,400
 that we gather as the Church of God.

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,400
 And we are going through a new series on the Bible,

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,040
 back to basics.

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,920
 And we begin the series by this picture, right?

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,200
 This picture I show you last week is a tall building,

9
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,280
 it's a high rise building.

10
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:30,280
 And it recalls us how important the foundation

11
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,280
 of a building is.

12
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,200
 The taller the building,

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,200
 the deeper the foundation needs to be.

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,600
 And as you can see this diagram,

15
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,040
 the foundation goes all the way down, right?

16
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,360
 From the ground down through the soft soil,

17
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,440
 through the mud and all the way down to the bedrock,

18
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,760
 which does not move, right?

19
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,920
 So in order to have a strong building,

20
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,800
 in order to have a secure building,

21
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,600
 you have to build your foundation first, right?

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,200
 And the foundation is not seen, right?

23
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,280
 It's not visible most of the time,

24
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,260
 but it's important, right?

25
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:06,200
 Without it, the building will collapse, right?

26
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,000
 Without it, you cannot build a building taller and taller,

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,840
 right?

28
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,760
 And the same way for our spiritual life,

29
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,600
 the same way for our life in God,

30
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,680
 if we believe in the name of Jesus Christ,

31
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,960
 we accept Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior,

32
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,200
 we need to build a solid foundation for our life.

33
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,880
 And our relationship with God,

34
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,840
 hinge on our foundation.

35
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,000
 And we have to do it one day at a time

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,040
 and do it so one block at a time

37
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,960
 so that we have a solid foundation, right?

38
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,960
 So last week we talk about,

39
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,600
 we studied one of the Psalms in the Bible,

40
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,040
 Psalm 119, which is the longest chapter of the Bible,

41
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,600
 longest Psalm in the Bible.

42
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,240
 The Psalm talks about the importance and the influence,

43
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,960
 the power of the Word of God.

44
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,600
 And that's why we need the Word of God.

45
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,040
 So today as we begin,

46
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,080
 we will begin with the, what?

47
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,360
 Verse of the week, yes, right?

48
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,320
 Remember to take home last week

49
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,960
 is to spend at least 10 minutes of your day,

50
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,520
 the best time of your day,

51
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,560
 spend 10 minutes at least to read the Bible, right?

52
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,800
 Read the Word of God, right?

53
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,720
 Did you do that?

54
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,560
 Okay, I see one person nodding the head.

55
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,800
 Nodding the head, right?

56
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,680
 I know you've done it, yeah, I know you've done it.

57
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,360
 I believe in you, okay?

58
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,960
 Take at least 10 minutes to read the Word of God, right?

59
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,960
 Read the Bible and memorize the verse of the week.

60
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,360
 And this is the verse of last week, right?

61
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,600
 So let's do that together, all right?

62
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,040
 Psalm 119, 105, let's read it together.

63
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,520
 Your Word is the lamb to my feet and the light to my path.

64
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,440
 Can you recite it?

65
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:44,720
 Yeah, 105, 119, 105, okay?

66
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,320
 (speaking in foreign language)

67
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,280
 Oh, okay, right?

68
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,040
 Okay, I practice it, all right.

69
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,680
 So this is the verse of last week

70
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:01,240
 and I hope that you have it recited and memorized by heart.

71
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,920
 And we put emphasis on the Word of God.

72
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,640
 As a church, I told you we are the people of the book, right?

73
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,760
 Of this wonderful book, of this sacred book

74
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,920
 that God has revealed to us.

75
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,720
 And today we'll continue to dig into the Word of God

76
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,320
 and I want you to, if you have a Bible,

77
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,440
 it's a print Bible or a Bible app in your phone,

78
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,160
 turn with me to the book of 2 Timothy.

79
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,320
 It's one of the books in the New Testament

80
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,240
 called 2 Timothy.

81
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,120
 Toward the end, if you search the table of contents,

82
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,320
 toward the end, it's called 2 Timothy.

83
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,240
 And there are two points from 2 Timothy chapter three.

84
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,220
 And I wanna share with you,

85
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:46,560
 I wanna go through this wonderful chapter with you

86
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,880
 and the first half of the chapter

87
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:52,880
 from verses one to nine, chapter three of 2 Timothy

88
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:57,720
 talks about the dangers of neglecting the Word of God.

89
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,720
 There are many dangers if we neglect the Word of God.

90
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,380
 And the second part of this chapter from verses 10 to 17

91
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,440
 talks about another big point,

92
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,400
 which is the benefits of learning the Word of God.

93
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,160
 And because time is limited today

94
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,320
 and I will go through the first half,

95
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,880
 which is verses one to nine, the dangers,

96
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,160
 there are dangers of neglecting the Word of God.

97
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,260
 Ask questions, ask the church.

98
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,840
 Have you ever thought about it?

99
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,520
 If we don't have the Bible,

100
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,920
 if we don't dig deeper and deeper into the Bible,

101
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,400
 if we don't understand the Bible,

102
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,480
 if we don't know the Bible enough, right?

103
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:42,000
 If our knowledge of the Word of God is insufficient,

104
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,520
 inadequate, there are dangers there.

105
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,520
 And we turn to this book called Second Letter to Timothy

106
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,680
 or 2 Timothy.

107
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,680
 And we call this kind of books,

108
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,380
 with 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy and the book of Titus,

109
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,680
 there's three letters,

110
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,640
 there's three books in the New Testament.

111
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,880
 We call them pastoral letters, okay?

112
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,960
 Pastoral letters.

113
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,880
 And what it means is that these are letters

114
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,440
 sent by the apostle Paul.

115
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,840
 He is the last disciple and the least disciple,

116
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,440
 apostle of all, called by God to preach the gospel

117
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,280
 to the Gentiles.

118
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,080
 He's the last and the least apostle called by God.

119
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,800
 And Paul is called by God to be apostle,

120
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,920
 preaching the gospel to the Gentiles, the non-Jews.

121
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:34,240
 And Paul goes around in the Roman Empire of his day

122
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,000
 and plant many small churches.

123
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,480
 And these small churches are being planted

124
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:44,000
 and being launched in different cities in the Roman world.

125
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,560
 And these small churches are growing, right?

126
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,760
 Sometimes in the midst of, or many times

127
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,040
 in the midst of struggles and challenges.

128
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,480
 And from time to time, early Christians

129
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,900
 are actually suffering and they are being persecuted

130
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,340
 by the authorities.

131
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:04,360
 And there are crisis from without,

132
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,760
 and there's also crisis for these churches from within.

133
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,040
 Because there are some false teachers

134
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,660
 who come into the church community

135
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:17,360
 and spread a false gospel, false teachings.

136
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,000
 And Timothy is one of Paul's disciples,

137
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,900
 one of his mentees.

138
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,560
 And Paul is kind of like a spiritual father to Timothy,

139
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,520
 and Timothy is kind of like a spiritual son to Paul.

140
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,720
 And under Paul's direction, Timothy is in charge

141
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,760
 of the home churches in Ephesus.

142
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,420
 Heard about this city name called Ephesus?

143
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:44,280
 It's a big city, right?

144
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,440
 Like Chicago.

145
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,080
 It's a metropolitan city in the Roman world.

146
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,720
 So Ephesus is a huge city, and you can imagine

147
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,580
 how difficult it is to pass through

148
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:58,580
 and to grow small churches in a huge city like Ephesus.

149
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,880
 In a big city, there are many, many different forces

150
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:06,120
 that counteract the church community.

151
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:11,120
 Cultural forces, economic pressure,

152
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,760
 religious forces, and spiritual forces.

153
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,480
 They all counteract the church and the gospel.

154
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,240
 And Paul writes letters to Timothy.

155
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,720
 In total, he wrote two letters.

156
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,760
 And to another disciple in another place called Titus.

157
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,440
 So Paul wrote two letters, at least two letters

158
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,480
 to Timothy, his disciple, his pastor student,

159
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:37,100
 to help him, help him to be encouraged

160
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,240
 as he passes the church.

161
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,620
 Because there are false teachers in the community,

162
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:46,620
 and these false teachers twist the truth and deceive many,

163
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:50,200
 especially those who are naive and uneducated or ill-equipped

164
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,760
 and these people are being led astray by false teachers,

165
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:58,160
 by cult leaders, or anyone who infiltrate into the church.

166
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,560
 And you can imagine how difficult that task is for Timothy.

167
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,240
 And Timothy has to teach, has to correct,

168
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,760
 has to grow the church at the same time,

169
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,560
 and deal with problems in the church

170
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,280
 and such an enormous mission.

171
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,520
 And being a spiritual father,

172
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,380
 Paul writes letters to Timothy.

173
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,720
 These are called pastoral letters

174
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,320
 because the tone in those letters are very personal.

175
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,520
 So as we can read some of the passages from these letters,

176
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,080
 you kind of find that it's kind of like

177
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,780
 a further theological training for Timothy.

178
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,280
 Already a pastor at Ephesus,

179
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,460
 trying to give him the equipment,

180
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,480
 trying to give him the knowledge,

181
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:45,180
 the courage to go on pastoring the churches.

182
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,800
 So in 1 and 2 Timothy, if you read them,

183
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,720
 scan through the content,

184
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,280
 Paul talks about the gospel of grace,

185
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,520
 sound teaching, the importance of sound teaching

186
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:59,880
 and theology and doctrines, which are so important.

187
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,820
 And because Timothy also has to raise up leaders

188
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:06,480
 among the communities,

189
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,080
 Paul also, in 1 and 2 Timothy,

190
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,800
 reminds Timothy the qualities

191
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,360
 and the qualifications for leaders,

192
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,440
 for elders, for deacons.

193
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,600
 And Paul, you know, but all in all,

194
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,560
 trying to encourage Timothy to be patient,

195
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,920
 to endure hardship.

196
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,680
 You know, it is hard to lead the church.

197
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,000
 You know what I'm saying?

198
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,540
 It's not easy, right?

199
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,600
 It's not easy.

200
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,440
 It's one of the most challenging leadership assignments

201
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,240
 on earth, is leading the church.

202
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,040
 And now we come to 2 Timothy,

203
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,840
 which is the second letter Paul writes

204
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,080
 to his mentee, Timothy.

205
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,760
 We turn to chapter three, okay?

206
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,080
 If you have your Bible, turn to chapter three as well.

207
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,920
 Also, the scripture is on the screen.

208
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,200
 Chapter three, verse one.

209
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,280
 You should know this, Timothy.

210
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:03,280
 Paul is addressing Timothy in a personal tone.

211
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:08,200
 Know this, Timothy, that in the last days,

212
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,880
 there will be very difficult times.

213
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,660
 For people will love only themselves and their money.

214
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:18,240
 They will be boastful, proud, scoffing at God,

215
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,560
 disobedient to their parents, ungrateful.

216
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,280
 They will consider nothing sacred.

217
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,840
 They will be unloving, unforgiving,

218
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:30,120
 and slander others with no self-control.

219
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,440
 They will be cruel and hate what is good.

220
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,000
 They will betray their friends and be reckless,

221
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,360
 be puffed up with pride, love pleasure rather than God.

222
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,600
 They will act religious, but they will reject

223
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,780
 the power that make them godly.

224
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,240
 And Paul said to Timothy, "Stay away from these people.

225
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,360
 "Stay away from them."

226
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:57,160
 You know, the last days, what is the last days?

227
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,320
 In New Testament terms, in biblical terms,

228
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,820
 last days is the period between the first coming

229
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:08,140
 of Jesus Christ and the second coming of Jesus Christ.

230
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:11,280
 Christ came, Jesus came the first time,

231
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,760
 2,000 years ago, right?

232
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:19,320
 He was born God incarnate, and he lived the kingdom life

233
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,400
 in the midst of his disciples, in the midst of the people.

234
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,840
 2,000 years ago, he died on the cross in Jerusalem.

235
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,480
 He died on the cross and he was crucified, right?

236
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,960
 He was crucified, and he died for our sin,

237
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,800
 died for the sin of mankind.

238
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,240
 And on the third day, he rose again,

239
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,240
 and he was ascended to heaven, and he is king over all.

240
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,720
 And that is the first coming, right?

241
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,600
 It has been detailed in many books

242
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,680
 and many passages in the New Testament.

243
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,960
 That's the first coming.

244
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,040
 And there's also the second coming, which is in the future,

245
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,240
 which lies in the future.

246
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,520
 Jesus will come back again

247
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,680
 because that's what Jesus said, right?

248
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,040
 That's what we are told in the Bible, in the word of God.

249
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,440
 And there's a second coming.

250
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,680
 Jesus can come any time, any moment, right?

251
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,240
 So the last days in New Testament terms

252
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,360
 is the period, I don't know how long, right?

253
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,640
 Between the first coming and the second coming.

254
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,720
 And that is the last day

255
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,920
 because this is the last period of human history

256
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,040
 in biblical terms.

257
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,120
 And that is the last day.

258
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,040
 And Paul is reminding Timothy in this period, right?

259
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,680
 And we are in this period, how people behave.

260
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,880
 And this last day, the time is critical

261
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,720
 because the last day is the period

262
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,640
 full of dangers, full of temptations,

263
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:49,240
 full of trials and suffering, right?

264
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,920
 And being Christian is not gonna make it easy.

265
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,200
 It is difficult, right?

266
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:01,200
 And we continue with this passage,

267
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,680
 verses six and following.

268
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,480
 He's talking about the ungodly people in the last days.

269
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,080
 And Paul said, "They are the kind

270
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,160
 "who work their way into people's homes."

271
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,480
 Why?

272
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,600
 Why do they infiltrate into people's homes?

273
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,320
 Well, as I told you, the early churches,

274
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,040
 they meet in homes, right?

275
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,680
 They meet in people's houses.

276
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,400
 They don't have the church building.

277
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,520
 You know, church is a community, it's a family.

278
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,640
 And they get together in different families, right?

279
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,400
 Whoever has a bigger living room,

280
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,560
 they gather at the living rooms.

281
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:41,480
 So, "They are the kind who work their way

282
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,960
 "into people's homes and win the confidence

283
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,600
 "of vulnerable women who are burdened

284
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,400
 "with the guilt of sin and controlled by various desires.

285
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,400
 "Such women are forever following new teachings,

286
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,120
 "but they are never able to understand the truth.

287
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,200
 "These teachers, these false teachers,

288
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:04,160
 "oppose the truth just as Jannate and Jambres oppose Moses.

289
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,800
 "They have depraved minds and can't defeat faith,

290
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,120
 "but they won't get away with this for long."

291
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,280
 And Paul says, "Someday, everyone will recognize

292
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:19,280
 "what fools they are, just as with Jannate and Jambres."

293
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,560
 It's a long passage, but listen up.

294
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,920
 How Paul described the people in the last day.

295
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,200
 The people love falsehood, and they hate truth.

296
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,720
 They hate people telling them the truth.

297
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,720
 The objective truth.

298
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:40,720
 And listen how the descriptions are being demonstrated.

299
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,680
 And they love themselves.

300
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,000
 These people love the money.

301
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,920
 They resist the will of God.

302
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,040
 Or simply put, they're just proud, right?

303
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,560
 They're prideful.

304
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,880
 And look at the behaviors.

305
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,560
 They're trying to justify the behaviors

306
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,080
 in the name of God, even in the name of God, right?

307
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:02,720
 Act religious, talk religious, and talk religious,

308
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,400
 but they reject the authority of God, right?

309
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,280
 And Paul uses one of the examples

310
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,040
 known by many Jews of this day.

311
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,880
 Two men by the names of Jannate and Jambres,

312
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,480
 and these two men oppose Moses.

313
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,600
 Now, interestingly enough, you cannot find these two names

314
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,400
 in the Old Testament.

315
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,760
 You cannot find it in the book of Exodus.

316
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,920
 You can only find it in some hundred years before Jesus.

317
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,320
 So 200, 300 BC.

318
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:37,560
 At that time, the Jews,

319
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,560
 because they were under different empires,

320
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,160
 and the international language has changed,

321
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,840
 changed from the previous language to a new language

322
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,360
 called Aramaic, right?

323
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,920
 And you know the Bible, the Old Testament,

324
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,440
 was written in which language?

325
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,920
 Hebrew, right?

326
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,040
 Hebrew, by and large, Hebrew.

327
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,360
 There was some Aramaic in some chapters.

328
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,000
 But by and large, it's in Hebrew.

329
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,600
 But in those days, some hundred years before Jesus,

330
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,840
 those Jews, when they gather together in synagogues,

331
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,880
 they wanna hear the word of God being preached.

332
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,800
 So the leader of the synagogue will read part of the passage

333
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,880
 from the Hebrew Bible, of course in Hebrew, right?

334
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,000
 And those Jews, because they are not very fluent

335
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,440
 in biblical Hebrew, and by that time,

336
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,440
 the international language was Aramaic,

337
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,840
 so many of them actually speak and hear Aramaic, right?

338
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,240
 So what do you do, right?

339
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,760
 The original language of the Old Testament,

340
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,320
 the Hebrew Bible, is Hebrew, right?

341
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,440
 And there's always a translator there, right?

342
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,480
 Translator in the synagogue.

343
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,840
 And he's gonna translate from Hebrew to Aramaic

344
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,720
 so that the people can understand the Bible,

345
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,080
 understand the word of God.

346
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:58,160
 So the paraphrase or the translation is called tagam, right?

347
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,320
 You see the word at the bottom of the screen?

348
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,800
 T-A-R-G-U-M.

349
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,760
 It's a Hebrew word.

350
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,160
 Simply means translation, right?

351
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,700
 Translation, translated from Hebrew to Aramaic.

352
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:14,680
 It's kind of Aramaic paraphrase of the Old Testament.

353
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,200
 When they come to the book of Exodus,

354
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:21,200
 when Moses was confronting the magicians of the Pharaoh,

355
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,000
 right, with the miracles of God,

356
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,040
 with the signs and wonders of God,

357
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:30,960
 and the Aramaic paraphrase, the tagam,

358
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,440
 add these two names,

359
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:37,960
 Jannaz and Jambres, to the story.

360
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:42,960
 So because the Jewish readers would know the story by heart,

361
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,800
 Paul is using this example to show that

362
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,360
 what people would do, the ungodly people,

363
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,480
 the false teacher would do in the last days.

364
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,600
 They're just like the ancient history.

365
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,320
 What had happened is that these two men,

366
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,640
 as we know Jewish audience,

367
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,640
 these two men opposed the authority of God through Moses.

368
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,960
 So what Paul is trying to get at

369
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,500
 is that there were false teachings being widespread

370
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,560
 in the early churches,

371
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,160
 and they were vulnerable to false teachings,

372
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,000
 especially the women.

373
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 Now if you read this chapter or read this passage casually,

374
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,520
 you'll find it kind of uncomfortable, right?

375
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,700
 'Cause it seems like Paul doesn't have

376
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,780
 much good things to say about women, right?

377
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:40,780
 Women are being described as uneducated, naive, right?

378
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:44,000
 At first glance, Paul doesn't have much positive view

379
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,880
 on women, does he, right?

380
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,720
 But that's not true.

381
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,160
 You cannot read the passage out of the context, right?

382
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,320
 And you have to understand what happened in those days.

383
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,480
 2,000 years ago in the first century,

384
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,920
 women were especially vulnerable, right?

385
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,320
 Because in those days,

386
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:07,280
 women didn't have the opportunity to get educated, right?

387
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,840
 And nowadays, it's totally different, right?

388
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:15,080
 Women are sometimes much more educated than men, right?

389
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,840
 So what Paul is getting at in his day

390
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,760
 is that there were women in home churches,

391
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,880
 they didn't have the privilege of education.

392
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,000
 So they were less educated, less equipped, right?

393
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,400
 Because they're less equipped,

394
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:32,400
 so they're easier to be deceived by false teachers, right?

395
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,880
 And that's what the false teachers

396
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:38,480
 or some of the false teachers

397
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,540
 trying to do infiltrate into the church

398
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,820
 and try to deceive people, right?

399
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:48,120
 So that they are more vulnerable to deception,

400
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,880
 and they follow those new teachings,

401
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,400
 so-called new teaching, and are deceived.

402
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,320
 And there's danger of neglecting the word of God, right?

403
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:02,280
 So we understand the context in Paul's day,

404
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:07,280
 and apply to our days,

405
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,340
 it's actually pretty similar.

406
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:13,240
 It's not talking about women being more vulnerable.

407
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,580
 Actually, Christians can be vulnerable

408
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,080
 if we are ill-equipped,

409
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,720
 if we are not equipped in the word of God,

410
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,960
 if we don't know much about the word of God, right?

411
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,520
 And there's a danger of neglecting the word of God.

412
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,760
 In Paul's days, in Timothy's day,

413
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,440
 as in today, right?

414
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:40,480
 If we do not dig deep into the word of God,

415
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,480
 if we don't know much about the Bible,

416
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,400
 if we don't know how to read the Bible,

417
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,060
 we are in danger of false teachers,

418
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,980
 or make ourselves more vulnerable

419
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:54,920
 to false, unbiblical teaching.

420
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,200
 And this is alarming, right?

421
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,600
 This is alarming.

422
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:03,600
 And this is why, you know, in our church,

423
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,780
 I put much emphasis on reading

424
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:10,340
 and understanding the Bible, right?

425
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,860
 Yes, we come to know God

426
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:15,620
 and restore our relationship with God,

427
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,560
 our creator, our father.

428
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,720
 That's important, that's the starting point, right?

429
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,080
 However, in the journey of faith,

430
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,140
 we have to understand the Bible

431
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:27,540
 because the words in the Bible

432
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:31,680
 are God's authoritative words, right?

433
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,720
 Everything has to come under this standard.

434
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,840
 The highest standard for Christian living and doctrines

435
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,020
 is the Bible, is the word of God, is the scripture.

436
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,620
 And everything that we do,

437
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:47,380
 every tradition that we get to know,

438
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,660
 or we grow up with,

439
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:52,440
 has to come under the final standard,

440
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,200
 the highest standard, which is the word of God,

441
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,580
 which is the Bible.

442
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,540
 And that's why I put emphasis on reading

443
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:00,220
 and understanding the Bible, okay?

444
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,120
 This understanding the Bible

445
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:06,600
 is not a monopoly for pastors or scholars.

446
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:10,340
 It's for every single Christian.

447
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:11,820
 Everyone who follow Jesus Christ

448
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:15,820
 has to understand and know the Bible.

449
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:21,900
 One of the top-notch Christian scholars or historians

450
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:26,020
 today is Mark Noll.

451
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,940
 Mark Noll used to teach in different institutes,

452
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,660
 including Whitten College.

453
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:33,200
 And you know where Whitten College is?

454
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,100
 Whitten College is about 40 minutes west of Chicago.

455
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,580
 It's very close to us.

456
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:40,660
 And he used to teach there for many, many years.

457
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:44,940
 His specialty is contemporary church history,

458
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,340
 American church history.

459
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:49,100
 And Mark Noll has written a book,

460
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:52,220
 and it was published in the mid '90s,

461
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,420
 and it's still in print.

462
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:59,780
 You know, renew edition, reprint edition.

463
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,740
 And it's this book.

464
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,360
 And the title of the book is

465
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,980
 "The Scandal of the Evangelical Mind."

466
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:10,400
 And if you pick up this book,

467
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,200
 and he will tell you what goes wrong

468
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,120
 in the evangelical faith in the church today.

469
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,920
 And the first sentence of the book is this sentence.

470
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,800
 The scandal of the evangelical mind

471
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,860
 is that there's not much of an evangelical mind.

472
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:30,880
 Isn't that interesting, right?

473
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,800
 He's talking about one of the biggest problem that we have

474
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:37,580
 is that Christians are often anti-intellectual.

475
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:42,380
 There's a divorce somehow between our intellect,

476
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:47,380
 how we think, and our piety, our spirituality.

477
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:50,520
 And if you go to lay Christians,

478
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,340
 sometimes you have dialogues

479
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,840
 or a conversation about Christian faith.

480
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,440
 Mind, you know, how we think, the clarity of thinking,

481
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,880
 clarity of what we believe and how we practice

482
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,760
 is not in the picture.

483
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,760
 Spirituality is often defined as something lack of intellect

484
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:15,380
 or doesn't have anything to do with intellectual, right?

485
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:19,120
 Because we think, okay, those are for scholars, right?

486
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,440
 Those are lifeless stuff, right?

487
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,720
 And we don't need to deal with that, right?

488
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,280
 And Mark Noe is trying to diagnose

489
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:30,240
 what is going on in evangelical spirituality.

490
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,880
 Is that there's not much of a mind, right?

491
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:37,400
 We often approach spiritual truth

492
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,080
 or approach the Bible or approach our faith

493
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:45,080
 with kind of a anti-intellectual attitude, right?

494
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:49,000
 We don't care about how we analyze.

495
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,960
 We don't care about how we articulate our faith,

496
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:57,320
 whether we can explain our faith with clarity.

497
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,820
 And sometimes spiritual is being defined as fanatic, right?

498
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:05,240
 Frenzy, right?

499
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,800
 As long as we feel high, as long as we feel good,

500
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,040
 and that's okay, right?

501
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,360
 And check the brain at the door, right?

502
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,500
 It seems like biblical faith is not grounded

503
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,220
 in any way with reason, right?

504
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,720
 But, you know, brothers and sisters,

505
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,280
 you need to understand in the Bible,

506
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:29,180
 faith, biblical faith, is grounded in facts

507
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,420
 and in reasons, right?

508
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,480
 It is.

509
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:37,480
 It is grounded in facts and reasons in history, right?

510
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:41,960
 Biblical faith, true faith, is factually grounded.

511
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,240
 It's reasonably grounded, right?

512
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,960
 What you believe, what we believe,

513
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,480
 is not a lip of faith, right?

514
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,640
 You just close your eyes and jump over there, right?

515
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,120
 Oh, hopefully this is the right thing to believe in.

516
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:58,160
 No, the scripture tells us you can examine the facts

517
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:03,000
 and examine what the Bible says with a clear mind, right?

518
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,640
 And sometimes we just don't care.

519
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,920
 Brothers and sisters, we cannot do this.

520
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,960
 And Paul is asking Timothy to watch out

521
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,320
 because the false teachers is trying to infiltrate

522
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,080
 into the church and spread false teachings

523
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:19,280
 because, you know, they just don't reason with you.

524
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:22,200
 I think this is really, really sad

525
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,720
 because many people know that the Bible

526
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,720
 is the best-selling book of all time, right?

527
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,840
 You know that?

528
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,200
 The Bible is the best-selling book of all time

529
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,420
 with five to seven billion copies printed

530
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:37,820
 over the last 1,500 years.

531
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:40,760
 Five to seven billion copies, right?

532
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:44,200
 And the Bible has been translated into different languages,

533
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:49,200
 modern languages, Chinese, Korean, right?

534
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,160
 English, Spanish, and all sorts of different languages.

535
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:57,120
 It's been translated into 700-plus languages.

536
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,200
 And there are many, many translations to come, right?

537
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,560
 And I think this is really, really sad.

538
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,320
 This is really tragic that many people know this,

539
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,280
 but sometimes we don't put effort

540
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,440
 to understanding the Bible.

541
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,140
 It's more tragic that we have the Bible in our hands,

542
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,780
 in our phone, in our computer,

543
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:17,280
 but we don't even try to understand,

544
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:21,640
 try to handle the Word of God correctly, right?

545
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,520
 We're just being floppy in our study.

546
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:27,200
 We're just being floppy in our thinking.

547
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,600
 You know, therefore, I still believe,

548
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,040
 I still believe as a pastor,

549
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:35,120
 I've been pastoring for 25-plus years.

550
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,240
 As a pastor, I still believe the importance

551
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,440
 of classical theological training,

552
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,600
 formal theological training.

553
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,680
 You gotta go through school,

554
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,080
 some sort of degree program,

555
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,000
 and you need to be equipped,

556
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,160
 and well-equipped to learn scripture

557
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,540
 so that you can teach, right?

558
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:58,860
 I still believe all the pastors,

559
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:01,480
 all those who are being called to ministry,

560
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,260
 especially teaching ministry,

561
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:06,760
 they have to go through some sort of formal training.

562
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:10,520
 Some sort of formal credentials are necessary.

563
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:13,560
 It's not anything goes.

564
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:17,200
 You have to go through some sort of formal credentials

565
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:22,200
 in order for you to be equipped to teach other people, right?

566
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,040
 You know, when I first studied in seminary,

567
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:33,040
 I started the Master of Divinity program in seminary,

568
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:37,560
 and you know, the toughest subject,

569
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:42,560
 the most hated classes among our students,

570
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,400
 you know what that is?

571
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,480
 It's original language, right?

572
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,600
 Hebrew and Greek, right?

573
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,840
 We just hated it, right?

574
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,340
 We have to memorize all these vocabularies

575
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:59,760
 and the paradigms and the grammatical rules, right?

576
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,440
 It's a new language, right?

577
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,440
 I don't even have time for my own native language, right?

578
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,020
 To polish my own language,

579
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,720
 but when we get into seminary,

580
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:14,280
 we have to study the word of God in its original language,

581
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,400
 right?

582
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,720
 Can you imagine, you know,

583
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,760
 someone studying like the greatest literature,

584
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:26,560
 the greatest English literature, Shakespeare, in Chinese,

585
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,460
 in translated version?

586
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:31,000
 No, you can't, right?

587
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,040
 You just can't translate that, right?

588
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,240
 So you have to understand,

589
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,920
 you have to know how the original language works, right?

590
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,640
 In order to have a better understanding.

591
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,440
 And so for seminary students, right?

592
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,000
 Some sort of credential,

593
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,360
 some sort of formal training is needed.

594
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,840
 Even though you hate it, you just have to do it, right?

595
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:54,880
 At least you have some working knowledge of how it goes,

596
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,380
 the basics for the Hebrew and Greek or even Aramaic.

597
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,420
 And you know what the word seminary means?

598
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:05,800
 The word seminaries, we have Trinity Seminary,

599
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,760
 Evangelical Seminary.

600
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,640
 We have a Moody, right?

601
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:13,080
 Also seminary, you know, some other seminaries.

602
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,680
 You know what the word seminary means?

603
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,280
 (speaks in foreign language)

604
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,640
 Right?

605
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,800
 Yeah, in Chinese, (speaks in foreign language)

606
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:25,200
 Seminary is an old English word.

607
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,280
 It was first used in the 16th century.

608
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:30,400
 It comes from a Latin word, seminarium.

609
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:36,040
 Seminarium means plant a nursery,

610
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,160
 a seed plot.

611
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:40,760
 Now you get it, what seminary is all about, right?

612
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:44,120
 It's a seed plot for those who are getting themselves

613
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:47,720
 ready to serve God, to teach the Word of God, right?

614
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:52,320
 They come to seminary, it's like a small farm

615
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,680
 to grow the seeds, right?

616
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,640
 Until they sprout and they're strong enough

617
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,960
 and they are ready to be transplanted

618
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,960
 and to help churches to walk in the Word of God, right?

619
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,720
 And I consider myself privileged to receive

620
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,120
 some theological training in North America, right?

621
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,960
 You know, in North America, all the schools,

622
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,320
 the Bible schools, seminaries, are actually

623
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:21,200
 some of the best schools in the world, right?

624
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,720
 In the best school in the world.

625
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,760
 I've been to three seminaries.

626
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,120
 Westminster Theological Seminary, they have two campuses,

627
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,720
 Philadelphia and San Diego, Southern California.

628
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,760
 The second one I went to is Regent College

629
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,440
 in Vancouver, Canada.

630
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,840
 That's where I got the MDiv, Master of Divinity.

631
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:43,160
 And then I started to serve and took a sabbatical

632
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:46,760
 after some years and I went to Wyndham College

633
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:49,720
 for my biblical archeology study.

634
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:54,360
 And then now I'm in a program at Midwestern Seminary

635
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,640
 in Kansas City.

636
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:59,120
 And all of these seminaries, I have learned so much, right?

637
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,160
 I walk into the classroom, I'm humbled.

638
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:06,200
 Humbled by what I don't know, right?

639
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:10,560
 Humbled by the vastness of the Bible, right?

640
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:14,360
 The vastness of our God, how great our God is.

641
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:17,440
 And we will continue to learn it, right?

642
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,280
 And my first seminary, Westminster Theological Seminary,

643
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:23,840
 one of their slogans is, "Whole counsel of God."

644
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,720
 You gotta know the whole counsel of God.

645
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,640
 The whole will of God being revealed in scripture.

646
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,640
 You cannot just cherry picking all the time.

647
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:36,080
 You have to be confronted by the whole Bible

648
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,800
 because the whole Bible reveals the whole counsel of God.

649
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:43,960
 The whole will of God, the demand of God,

650
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:47,020
 the covenant of God, the word of God.

651
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,880
 You cannot cherry picking.

652
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,840
 It's not Whole Foods.

653
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,720
 You can come in and according to your desire,

654
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,840
 pick whatever you like.

655
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,680
 The Bible is not Whole Foods.

656
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,880
 You come to the Bible and you need to stand

657
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,840
 under this highest authority, this highest standard.

658
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,240
 You gotta be confronted by the Bible,

659
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,080
 your living, what you believe,

660
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,800
 and how you practice the faith,

661
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,760
 and what your doctrines are, right?

662
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,720
 All the time, you need to come to the Bible.

663
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,120
 The Bible is like a mirror.

664
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:21,760
 It comes, you go into the mirror

665
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,520
 and check whether you look okay, right?

666
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,080
 And every time you open the Bible,

667
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,860
 every time you read the Bible,

668
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:33,240
 you are doing self-checking, right?

669
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,160
 Checking yourself, checking your Christian life,

670
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,240
 whether it's aligned with the will of God

671
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,900
 or it's misaligned in some areas.

672
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,880
 And with the spirit of repentance,

673
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,300
 you come before God and ask God to help you

674
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,920
 to align your Christian living

675
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,520
 according to the will of God.

676
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:54,460
 And that's why I have to take home for you today, all right?

677
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:57,580
 So last week, I shared the first two points with you.

678
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:00,260
 Take at least 10 minutes a day to read the Bible, okay?

679
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,500
 Guys, okay?

680
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,000
 If you don't know, if you haven't started,

681
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,920
 I ask you to go to the book of Ephesians, all right?

682
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:11,200
 I know our men's group is going through the book of Ephesians

683
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,800
 and just read, there are six chapters, right?

684
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,960
 Six chapters in the letter of Ephesians

685
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,860
 and you can start with chapter one,

686
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:21,640
 chapter two the next day,

687
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,920
 chapter three, chapter four, five, six,

688
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,440
 and then there are many things

689
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,080
 that you may not be able to understand at this point,

690
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,960
 but you can go back, right?

691
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,680
 You can recycle it, right?

692
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,160
 Going back to the first chapter and try to meditate,

693
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,340
 try to understand what is going on here.

694
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,320
 What is the argument?

695
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,460
 What is the thesis of the chapter?

696
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,680
 What is the point, right?

697
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,560
 What is the point of what Paul is saying?

698
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,960
 You know, those are texts.

699
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:50,420
 Those are languages and you have to understand it.

700
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,560
 You have to comprehend the meaning.

701
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,000
 Or you can start with one of the gospel, as I told you,

702
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,400
 Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John.

703
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,800
 You can start with one chapter a day.

704
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,680
 Take 10 minutes a day, that's the whole point,

705
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,360
 to read the Bible and to think about it.

706
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,280
 And then memorize our verse of the week, okay?

707
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,560
 I have a next verse for you later, okay?

708
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,160
 So, you know, be ready.

709
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,200
 Number three, I wanna add this,

710
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:18,040
 to read some good books for spiritual growth, okay?

711
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,400
 Good books.

712
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,240
 I'm telling you, I wanna emphasize good books.

713
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:26,520
 Because there are bad books out there, all right?

714
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,280
 You know, I'm over 50 years old

715
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,320
 and I remember when I was young in faith,

716
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,200
 when I was still a college student,

717
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:38,400
 and my home church didn't have a pastor,

718
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,000
 didn't have good teacher.

719
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 So we have to go out to bookstores, Christian bookstores.

720
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,580
 Yeah, can you find a Christian bookstore these days?

721
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,980
 No, right?

722
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,380
 They're all closed down, right?

723
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,320
 This is pretty sad, right?

724
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,400
 Everyone goes to Amazon, right?

725
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,280
 Everyone goes to eBooks, right?

726
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,680
 We went to the bookstores and find some books

727
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:04,160
 to help us and guide us in our Christian walk, right?

728
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,000
 And you go into the books,

729
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,040
 oh, there are different sections, different categories, right?

730
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,840
 And you go in and you try to find some good books

731
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:14,240
 and we didn't know what good books are, right?

732
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,120
 We just cannot judge, we cannot discern.

733
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,500
 So I bought quite a few books

734
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,620
 because I was yearning for the Word of God

735
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:23,060
 and I read all I can, right?

736
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,620
 And then years later I find that,

737
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,780
 oh, these books are actually bad

738
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:30,740
 and I didn't know better, right?

739
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:32,740
 Those are prosperity gospel.

740
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:33,580
 Those are, you know,

741
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:36,700
 truncated understanding of scripture, right?

742
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:39,780
 They're fun to read, they're enjoyable to read.

743
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,660
 However, they are not sound teaching,

744
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,580
 they are not solid teaching.

745
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,780
 And years later I find out, right?

746
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:48,140
 I feel so bad about myself

747
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:52,480
 and I have to kind of re-run away my own spiritual life

748
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,180
 by reading good books, getting to know good books.

749
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,460
 And brothers and sisters, you need to read,

750
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:00,060
 or you need to start the habit of reading.

751
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:03,380
 You need to start the habit of reading.

752
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:06,220
 Yeah, I know in our days and age,

753
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:08,100
 we don't like to read, right?

754
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:12,740
 We like YouTube or TikTok, right?

755
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:15,280
 All those sound bites, you know?

756
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,920
 We just like, you know, be entertained, right?

757
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:22,580
 And passively receive information and misinformation.

758
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:24,480
 And we don't train ourself

759
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,360
 to be better people of discernment.

760
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,420
 You know, you need to train yourself how to think,

761
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:33,660
 how to analyze, how to articulate, right?

762
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:40,040
 And I wanna recommend you some of the good books

763
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,720
 for spiritual growth, right?

764
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,560
 Some of the good books, right?

765
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,480
 Again, there are many books out there, right?

766
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,200
 The worst thing today is that you go to Amazon,

767
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:53,520
 you search spiritual growth, you know,

768
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:58,120
 by and large you will come across some of the very, very,

769
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:01,480
 you know, truncated teaching, right?

770
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:05,800
 Because those books are often written by, you know,

771
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:09,200
 people who don't learn enough in the world.

772
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,360
 And they don't have the credential to do so,

773
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,400
 to write certain things.

774
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,280
 So, you know, we have to learn

775
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:19,720
 and develop the habit of reading.

776
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:24,440
 Because reading is active learning, right?

777
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:29,440
 You read a passage, it's always actively engaging your mind.

778
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,800
 You try to understand those words

779
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,680
 and try to connect them together and find the thesis, right?

780
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,280
 Find what it says, right?

781
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,320
 You have to summarize it,

782
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,000
 you have to go back to the text and to digest it,

783
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,440
 to comprehend it, right?

784
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,240
 You have to have the habit of reading,

785
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,120
 ask questions in order for you to grow spiritually.

786
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,480
 There's no way you can get without reading.

787
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,680
 Some serious reading, some solid reading, right?

788
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,880
 I want to recommend you some of the books,

789
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,120
 some of the classics actually, very good books.

790
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:03,320
 Some of them are older, some of them are more recent.

791
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,800
 On the left you see the book written by J.I. Packer.

792
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,520
 He passed away not too long ago.

793
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,760
 He has this classic,

794
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:16,120
 "Over One Million Copies Sold," right?

795
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,000
 I'll be more thankful,

796
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,480
 it says, "Over One Million Copies Comprehended."

797
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,120
 Read and comprehend.

798
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:26,200
 However, it's a very good book, "Knowing God."

799
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,800
 It's a very simple, systematic, summary,

800
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,240
 explanation of the whole Christian faith.

801
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:35,000
 And it's been translated into different languages.

802
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,760
 Chinese is one of them.

803
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,680
 And Tim Keller has written many, many good books.

804
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:43,280
 Yeah, Keller also passed away not too long ago

805
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,000
 and be with the Lord.

806
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,440
 But one of the book is, "The Reason for God," right?

807
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,480
 "Believe in an Age of Skepticism."

808
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:53,000
 This is a book especially good

809
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,100
 for those who are seeking the faith.

810
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,400
 You want to understand the faith,

811
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:01,200
 you haven't made the commitment to believing in God,

812
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,880
 in Jesus, but this is a book for you, Tim Keller.

813
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,160
 "The Reason for God," right?

814
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,760
 He walks through you step by step,

815
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:13,040
 logically, reasonably, what our faith is all about, right?

816
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,280
 Why do we believe in God, right?

817
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,960
 And on the right is,

818
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,560
 Anthony writes, "Simply Question,"

819
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:22,080
 why Christian identity makes sense, right?

820
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:27,080
 And these are very, very solid resources to help us grow.

821
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:33,720
 Yeah, not too long ago, during Good Friday weekend,

822
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:36,640
 we invited Dr. Chloe Sun, right?

823
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,560
 Old Testament professor

824
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,360
 from Fuller Theological Seminary in Southern California.

825
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,500
 She came and gave a workshop,

826
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,660
 a series of workshops on interpreting the Psalms

827
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:47,840
 and the Bible.

828
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:52,840
 And many of Chloe's books are actually helpful

829
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,680
 for us to understand the Word.

830
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,560
 And so, all I'm trying to encourage you

831
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,200
 is that take some moment to read the Bible

832
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,200
 and also find some good books for spiritual growth.

833
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,520
 We can go to our bookshelf

834
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:09,160
 and find some good books as well, right?

835
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:14,160
 And I wanna end today with this verse of the week, all right?

836
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:20,960
 Matthew chapter 22, verses 37 to 38.

837
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,520
 And this is what Jesus said.

838
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:27,560
 Jesus said, "You must love the Lord your God

839
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:31,600
 "with all your heart, all your soul, and all your mind."

840
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,920
 And this is the first and greatest commandment.

841
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,040
 Why did I pick this one?

842
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:40,160
 You must love the Lord your God with all your heart,

843
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,520
 all your soul, and all your mind.

844
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:48,000
 Your thinking is a way of worship.

845
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,060
 Your thinking, your knowing God,

846
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:54,000
 is a way to draw closer to God.

847
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,820
 It's not just by feeling, right?

848
00:41:56,820 --> 00:42:00,700
 It's not just spiritual high, but with a cool head.

849
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:03,440
 You think in clarity.

850
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,460
 You think about the faith.

851
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:07,000
 You have a correct understanding,

852
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,640
 solid understanding of the Word.

853
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,400
 And that is the first and greatest commandment.

854
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,200
 Let's recite it together, all right?

855
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:16,040
 Matthew chapter 22, verses 37 to 38.

856
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,760
 "You must love the Lord your God

857
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,640
 "with all your heart and all your soul, and all your mind."

858
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:26,560
 And this is the first and greatest commandment, all right?

859
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,460
 Let's recite that this week.

860
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:29,660
 Let's all pray together.

861
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,460
 Father, we come before you.

862
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:36,520
 We give you thanks because you are the God who speaks,

863
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,900
 and you are the God of truth.

864
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,960
 And thank you for revealing your will

865
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,620
 and your whole counsel through scripture.

866
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:48,400
 Thank you for this book that we have.

867
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,360
 Thank you for the content that we have.

868
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:54,200
 It talks about you, God.

869
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:59,040
 It talks about how you deal with a sinful mankind,

870
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,560
 how you love us, how you deal with this broken world.

871
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,200
 It talks about your heart.

872
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:11,720
 Help us to get to know you more, deeper and deeper,

873
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,640
 drawing closer to you.

874
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,880
 And I pray for the sisters and brothers here

875
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:19,780
 that we do make the effort of knowing you.

876
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:24,120
 And by knowing you, we experience joy and peace in you.

877
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:28,680
 Reading the word, reading your scripture,

878
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:32,340
 we come closer and closer to the heart of God.

879
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:35,800
 And I pray that you will bless us each day

880
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:39,400
 with some moments to meditate, to think about your word.

881
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:45,380
 And as we go reading, as we get to know our faith

882
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:50,380
 more and more, draw us closer so that we know you better.

883
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:54,500
 And thank you for being our God.

884
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:56,820
 That we can relate to you.

885
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:58,340
 We can call you friend.

886
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:00,340
 We can call you heavenly father.

887
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:04,480
 And thank you for the grace and for the peace that we have.

888
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:09,620
 So may your spirit send us out with a spirit of truth

889
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:13,460
 to yearn for your truth, to get to know you.

890
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:16,460
 And may your church rise up and grow up

891
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:22,380
 with the foundation solid, grounded in your word.

892
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:23,940
 In Christ, I pray.

893
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:25,780
 (gentle piano music)

894
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:27,900
 Well, God bless you and I wanna see you next week.

895
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:31,020
 And hopefully you can stay a little bit

896
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:34,900
 and for table fellowship to enjoy the refreshment

897
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:35,940
 prepared by Kelly.

898
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:37,020
 Thank you, Kelly.

899
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:40,420
 And get to know one another and say hi to one another.

900
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:43,500
 (gentle piano music)

901
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:44,940
 (piano music)
