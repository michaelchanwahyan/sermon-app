1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,160
 All right. Good morning, UV. I hope all of you had a great Thanksgiving this past week,

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,440
 whether it is spending time with family, with friends, enjoying some good and delicious

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:21,080
 Thanksgiving food, or also just buy some new stuff on Black Friday. So I got a chance to

4
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:28,080
 went to the suburbs and spend Thanksgiving with a family from my previous church, Dennis

5
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,880
 and Emily. So it was great to be able to catch up with them again and also hang out with

6
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,680
 three of their teenage kids, because all three of them were also my youth students at my

7
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:45,080
 youth group in my last church. And it is always fun to get to be reminded of kind of like

8
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:52,760
 the interesting or funny ways that those three siblings interact with one another. So all

9
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,320
 that to say, I had a great Thanksgiving. And I also want to acknowledge that as we enter

10
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:04,280
 into these holiday seasons, this might be a season that is not a joyful season for some

11
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,880
 of us, that this can be a challenging season, especially if there's conflicts within your

12
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:15,920
 families or this time of grieving for some of you. So I want to acknowledge that. And

13
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:22,000
 also, I just want to say, I hope during this Advent season leading up to Christmas, I pray

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:30,040
 that the Lord would meet each and every one of us in a specific ways as well. Okay, so

15
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,800
 this past September, I had the opportunity to go back home to Malaysia to visit some

16
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:42,440
 of my friends and also family. And when I step into my house, I immediately notice something

17
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:47,880
 different from the last time that I was home about seven years ago. So on one side of the

18
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:53,840
 living room is actually a whole new set of wooden cabinets. And without having to ask

19
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,880
 my mom much about it, I can pretty much guess what happened to the old cabinets. It is termite

20
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:07,720
 infestation. So growing up, termites is always an issue at my house. And if you don't know

21
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:14,440
 about termites, let me give you a quick biology lessons about termites. So termites, they're

22
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:20,600
 tiny little insects that look pretty much like an ant. However, they're a lot more destructive

23
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:27,760
 than our regular house ants. So for these termites, they like to feed on dead plants,

24
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,560
 they like to feed on trees or any sort of like wooden structures. And they usually prefer

25
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,600
 to hide in dark and humid environment. So you normally won't find them like feeding

26
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:44,480
 on the surface of the wooden structure at all. And in fact, the wood surface might appear

27
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:50,680
 completely fine, even though the termites are destroying them from the inside. And this

28
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,000
 is pretty much what happened to some of the wooden cabinets at my home. While they look

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,320
 totally fine from the outside, there were just a lot of hollow parts inside those cabinets

30
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:05,320
 that they're just not structurally sound anymore, to the point that they have to be completely

31
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:11,600
 replaced. And you guys have to know that this cabinet is a kind of like a central piece

32
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,520
 in like in my house in the living room. This is where we put our TV. This is where we put

33
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:21,320
 our sound system. And there's also a lot of like storage space where we put like our old

34
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:26,400
 photo albums. So it is a pretty important piece. And to see it being replaced because

35
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,520
 of the termites, it kind of like hurts me a little as well. So we have been slowly going

36
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:37,040
 through Jesus' Sermon on the Mount verse by verse for the past couple of months. And at

37
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,760
 this point, you might ask, "Hey, Chi, what does the termites or the termites infested

38
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:48,040
 cabinet have to do with Jesus' Sermon on the Mount?" Well, just like this wooden furniture

39
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:53,480
 that appears completely fine from the outside, but they're just not functional anymore because

40
00:03:53,480 --> 00:04:00,240
 of the termites. The issue that Jesus had with how the scripture was being taught and

41
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:05,920
 lived out by the religious leaders of his days is that these religious leaders, they

42
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,880
 approached this law that Jesus gave them or that God gave them in the Old Testament from

43
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:17,520
 a very surface level, but they completely missed the heart of God behind the law. And

44
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:23,080
 as a result of that, the worship, just like this termite infested furniture, the worship

45
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:30,200
 became an empty religion that has pretty much lost its function and its purpose as well.

46
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,800
 So in my past few sermons, we have looked at the Beatitudes and explored together what

47
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,120
 a truly blessed life looks like. We have also studied the different characters and qualities

48
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:46,520
 that represent life in the kingdom of heaven. And in my last sermon, we look at how we can

49
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:52,440
 experience this truly blessed life, that is by following Jesus and living in full submission

50
00:04:52,440 --> 00:05:00,520
 to him and his commands. Jesus is the only way and only truth that will lead to a flourishing

51
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:08,240
 life because he is the only one that can fulfill the law and the prophets. And what this means

52
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,080
 is that the law and the prophets or the Old Testament scripture in its entirety, they

53
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:19,000
 ultimately points forward to Jesus and Jesus becomes the official interpreter of this Old

54
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,960
 Testament scripture. So today we're going to look at first of the six examples of how

55
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,600
 Jesus fulfilled the scripture by revealing the true intent and the true purpose behind

56
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,760
 this law. And just a quick background, each of the six examples that we will be looking

57
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:43,680
 at from Matthew five, verse 21 to 48, they all begin with the same formula. You have

58
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:50,480
 heard that it was saved. And this formula in Jesus's time, when a Jewish rabbi, he

59
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:55,720
 want to begin a discussion about a specific mosaic law, they will usually introduce the

60
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:02,180
 discussion with this formula. You have heard that it was saved and then the mosaic law.

61
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:07,640
 So in the same way, Jesus begins each of his six discussion by using something that his

62
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:13,900
 audience will already be familiar with, and that is in line with the rabbinic tradition.

63
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:19,800
 But each and every time Jesus would take this one step further and he would go on and give

64
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:26,120
 his own interpretation. But I tell you this. So if you have your Bible with you, please

65
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:33,240
 turn to Matthew chapter five and we're going to read from verse 21 to 26. Matthew chapter

66
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:42,160
 five, verse 21 to 26. You have heard that it was saved to the people long ago. You shall

67
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:49,400
 not murder and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment. But I tell you that anyone

68
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:56,320
 who is angry with a brother or sister will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who

69
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:03,080
 says to a brother or sister, Raka is answerable to the court and anyone who says you fool

70
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:09,680
 will be in danger of the fire of hell. Therefore, if you're offering your gift at the altar

71
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,320
 and there, remember that your brother or sister has something against you. Leave your gift

72
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:20,520
 there in front of the altar. First, go and be reconciled to them. Then come and offer

73
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:27,060
 your gift. Settle matters quickly with your adversary who is taking you to the court.

74
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:31,600
 Do it while you're still together on the way or your adversary may hand you over to the

75
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:39,440
 judge and the judge may hand you over to the officer and you may be thrown into the prison.

76
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,760
 Truly I tell you, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny. This is the

77
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:55,040
 word of God. Let us pray. Father, as we open up your word this morning, I just ask that

78
00:07:55,040 --> 00:08:02,320
 your spirit will be with us, that your spirit will fill our heart and prepare us to receive

79
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:11,160
 the word that you have for us today. Amen. Okay. So in my last sermon, we ended in verse

80
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:16,400
 20 looking at kind of like what kind of righteousness that is required for us to enter the kingdom

81
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,340
 of heaven, right? And for Jesus, the righteousness according to the Pharisees and the teachers

82
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:28,420
 of the law, they ultimately fall short of God's standard because their version of righteousness

83
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:35,600
 only concerns about outward actions or kind of like sort of like a behavioral management.

84
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:40,320
 On the other hand, the righteousness according to Jesus, it doesn't just deal with our outward

85
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:47,000
 actions but it cuts straight to our inner motivations and our core desires that impacts

86
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,600
 how we relate to other people. So the example that we will be looking at today is centered

87
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:58,040
 around the sixth commandment, you shall not murder. And we'll take a look at how Jesus

88
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,680
 moved past just a literal understanding of this commandment straight to the root issues

89
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:10,060
 of these actions. And the message that Jesus has for us is that Jesus had for us is this.

90
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:15,800
 While we may never commit the act of murder, we can still unintentionally allow the same

91
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:23,920
 kind of attitude to take root and permeate in our heart. I can probably say with 99%

92
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,960
 confidence that none of us here in this room have committed a murder, right? But again,

93
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:34,360
 what Jesus is kind of like warning us against is that we can still unintentionally allow

94
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:40,960
 the same kind of attitude to take root and to grow in our heart. So let's look at the

95
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:48,360
 first point together. Jesus demands a higher righteousness from us. Jesus demands a higher

96
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:54,440
 righteousness from us. So Jesus begin by saying, you have heard that it was said to the people

97
00:09:54,440 --> 00:10:01,160
 long ago, you shall not murder. So this first part actually, as we have looked at just now,

98
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:06,440
 this comes from the sixth commandment that the Lord gave to Moses, the Lord gave to the

99
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:12,840
 people of Israel through Moses at Mount Sinai in the book of Exodus. But then we see that

100
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:18,920
 there is a penalty being added on to this. It says anyone who murders will be subject

101
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:24,360
 to judgment. So this add-on penalty is actually part of the judicial process in the Jewish

102
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:30,360
 court system. And by attaching this penalty to the sixth commandments, it tell us one

103
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:36,920
 important thing. It tell us that Jesus, he's actually not speaking against the Mosaic law

104
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:44,000
 or the Torah itself. No, as we have established last time, Jesus himself clarifies, I have

105
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:51,480
 not come to abolish the law. So what Jesus is trying to correct here is the Torah as

106
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:57,460
 traditionally interpreted and understood by the Jewish people. One that is being taught

107
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:02,520
 in the synagogue or one that is being passed down in the family or in the Jewish culture

108
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:10,000
 as well. So Jesus, he is not reacting against the Mosaic law itself. But what Jesus is reacting

109
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:18,380
 against is a shallow and legalistic understanding of the law. So this is when the Lord gave

110
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:24,680
 the 10 commandments for the first time at Mount Sinai. Now in a similar setting on the

111
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:30,760
 mountainside, Jesus is trying to go back to the heart of God behind these commandments.

112
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:39,400
 One that is not tainted by any of our human interpretation or human tradition. So what

113
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:44,960
 is the heart of God behind the commandments of you shall not murder? Let's look with me

114
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:49,560
 again. Verse 21, you have heard that it was said to the people long ago, you shall not

115
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:56,600
 murder and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment. But I tell you that anyone who

116
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:04,360
 is angry with a brother or sister will be subject to judgment. So here, Jesus, he goes

117
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,920
 beyond the shallow understanding of the sixth commandment straight to the root issues behind

118
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:15,920
 murder. That is anger and contempt towards brothers or sister. So the brothers and sister

119
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:21,440
 here usually used to refer to the communities of believers, just like how we call one another

120
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,840
 brothers and sisters in Christ. But I think in this context, we can actually apply this

121
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:32,100
 to those outside of our community of faith as well. So while the traditional understanding

122
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:38,320
 of the sixth commandment say that anyone who murders will be subject to judgment, Jesus

123
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:44,160
 brings in a higher righteousness by claiming that anyone who is angry with a brother or

124
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:52,640
 sister will be subject to judgment. So according to our human standard of righteousness, you

125
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:58,120
 might be completely innocent because you have never committed murder. But according to the

126
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:05,840
 righteousness defined by Jesus himself, your anger makes you guilty before God and liable

127
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:15,040
 to the same kind of judgment. And then Jesus continued, again, anyone who says to a brother

128
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:21,920
 or sister, "Raca," is answerable to the court. So "raca" here is actually a loan word from

129
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:28,600
 Aramaic, and it doesn't really mean much, but it is used as a derogatory term to call

130
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:35,120
 someone as empty-headed. So if you say someone's head is empty, that means there's like no

131
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:41,440
 brain inside, right? So this is kind of like similar to calling someone, "You have no brain."

132
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:47,360
 And Jesus say, "Anyone who says to a brother or sister, 'Raca,' is answerable to the court."

133
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,840
 And this court is the high court in the Jewish court system, which is the Sanhedrin. And

134
00:13:52,840 --> 00:14:00,960
 anyone who says, "You fool," will be in danger of the fire of hell or Gehenna. So the NIV,

135
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:05,440
 which is the translation that I use here, actually smoothed this out a little bit. But

136
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:12,000
 fire of hell, in other translation, is being translated as Gehenna. And Gehenna is used

137
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,080
 to refer to a place that is south of Jerusalem called the Hinnom Valley. And what is the

138
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:23,360
 significance of this place, the Valley of Hinnom? In the Old Testament, the Valley of

139
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:29,720
 Hinnom is where child sacrifice were being offered to the pagan god, Molech. And we see

140
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:35,720
 this in places like 2 Kings. When King Josiah renewed the covenant with the people of Israel

141
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:42,920
 and with the Lord, this is what 2 Kings says. "He," referring to King Josiah, "He desecrate

142
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:48,800
 Topeth, which was in the Valley of Ben Hinnom. So no one could use it to sacrifice their

143
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:57,520
 son or daughter in the fire to Molech." And during Jesus' time, this place, Gehenna, or

144
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:02,600
 the Hinnom Valley, is used as a place where garbage were being disposed and then burned

145
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,600
 day and night. So if you just look out from Jerusalem and look towards this direction

146
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:13,800
 of the Hinnom Valley, you will see fire being burned day in and day out. And I can imagine

147
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:20,440
 the smells probably doesn't smell really good as well, right? So Gehenna basically becomes

148
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:28,720
 a metaphor for the fire of hell. So Jesus say, "Anyone who says, 'You fool,' will be

149
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:36,880
 in danger of Gehenna," or in danger of the fire of hell. And here in verse 22, we also

150
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:43,480
 see sort of like a progression. Jesus begins by talking about an internal attitude or feeling

151
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:50,420
 of anger. And then he move on to kind of like that anger being expressed outwardly by showing

152
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:57,160
 contempt to a brother or a sister. And what is contempt? I feel like this is probably

153
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:04,160
 a word that we don't usually use in our day-to-day language, right? So according to Oxford languages,

154
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:12,000
 contempt is the feeling that a person or a thing is beneath consideration, worthless,

155
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,440
 or deserving scorn. Again, contempt is the feeling that a person or a thing is beneath

156
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:26,520
 consideration, is worthless, or deserving scorn. And how is contempt being shown here

157
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:32,080
 in the examples that Jesus gave? It is by insulting a brother or a sister with names

158
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:40,480
 like "raka" or "fool." And showing contempt is actually not just about actively belittling

159
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:50,160
 someone. Showing contempt can take the form of passive indifference or being cold to someone.

160
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,080
 Maybe at your house, your spouse has been trying to ask you to help with some of the

161
00:16:54,080 --> 00:17:01,480
 things at the house, whether it is fixing a broken light bulbs or kind of like to mow

162
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:07,880
 the lawns or to take the trash out. But every time when your spouse kind of like bring this

163
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:14,360
 request before you, you might be listening, but you're actually not. And you're just responding

164
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:18,920
 in a way that is like trying to get them off your back so that you can continue with whatever

165
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:26,200
 you're doing. Or maybe you're walking down the street in Chicago and you saw a homeless

166
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:30,440
 person kind of like slowly approaching you. And at that moment, you just kind of like

167
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:35,560
 say to yourself, "Okay, I'm just going to ignore this person because he or she is probably

168
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:42,080
 not worth my time. I'm just going to like continue with whatever I'm going on." So this

169
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:50,640
 kind of passive indifference or treating someone coldly is also a form of contempt as well.

170
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,480
 And so what Jesus is saying that if you show anger or contempt towards your brother or

171
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:02,440
 sister, you will face judgment both here on earth in a human court and also before the

172
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:09,920
 Lord with the fire of hell. And you might ask, "Jesus, why do you take anger and contempt

173
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:16,880
 so seriously and kind of like put them on par with murder in some cases?" I think this

174
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:23,840
 is because behind anger and contempt is a posture of disregarding the value and worth

175
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:30,280
 of a person made in the image of God. And this is exactly the same kind of attitude

176
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:37,240
 behind murder. When someone doesn't take life of another image very seriously or take

177
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:46,000
 the life as sacred and worthy to be treated with respect and dignity.

178
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:53,120
 And I want to be clear here. What Jesus is not saying is that anger as an emotion in

179
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:59,800
 and of itself is a sin. If you just read through the Psalms, you can see all kind of raw emotions,

180
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:08,120
 right? There's joyful emotions, happy, there's grief, there's lament, and there's also anger.

181
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:15,040
 And in a lot of cases, God welcomes us to pour out our raw emotions before Him, including

182
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:21,680
 our anger. So what Jesus is not saying is that anger as an emotion in and of itself

183
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:29,600
 is a sin. And we also see Jesus himself express his anger as well. We see Jesus getting

184
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:35,240
 furious at the money changers and the merchants at the temple. And he even kind of like pull

185
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:40,080
 out a whip to drove them out of the temple because they were taking advantage of the

186
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:46,620
 pilgrims that came all the way to the temple to worship the Lord.

187
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:52,380
 We see Jesus express his anger towards the legalistic way that some of the Pharisees

188
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:59,320
 practice the law by prioritizing the Sabbath rituals over actually allowing Jesus to heal

189
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:07,400
 a man that is in need. We also see Jesus became angry at death itself when he stood in front

190
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:15,600
 of the tomb of his friends Lazarus that has just passed away. So I want to be clear. There

191
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:21,960
 is a time and a place for anger. And the kind of righteous anger that is expressed in the

192
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:31,180
 right way with the right intention towards the right thing is not a sin. And in fact,

193
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:36,360
 if you never felt angry towards any of the injustice or the brokenness in our world around

194
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:43,560
 us, I might dare to say that you might not be living in according with the Holy Spirit.

195
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:50,760
 However, the anger that Jesus talks about here is a kind of destructive anger that is

196
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:57,080
 being directed towards another person made in the image of God. This is the kind of anger

197
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:03,920
 that Jesus is speaking up against. So after laying out his standard of righteousness,

198
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:09,960
 Jesus then continues to give two applications on the response that he requires from us when

199
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:18,420
 anger and contempt is present in our community and our relationship with other people.

200
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:25,320
 So verse 23, "Therefore, if you're offering your gift at the altar and there remember

201
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:30,600
 that your brother or sister has something against you, leave your gift there in front

202
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:38,840
 of the altar. First, go and be reconciled to them. Then come and offer your gift. Settle

203
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:44,000
 matters quickly with your adversary who is taking you to court. Do it while you are still

204
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 together on the way, or your adversary may hand you over to the judge, and the judge

205
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:55,500
 may hand you over to the officer, and you may be thrown into prison. Truly I tell you,

206
00:21:55,500 --> 00:22:00,280
 you will not get out until you have paid the last penny."

207
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:08,360
 So here's my second point. Jesus demands a better response from us. Jesus demands a better

208
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:16,080
 response from us. For Jesus, the antidote to the issues of anger and contempt towards

209
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:23,880
 others is reconciliation. So the better response that Jesus requires from us is to actively

210
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:33,680
 pursue justice and seek reconciliation. Let's look at the first situation here. "Therefore,

211
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:38,400
 if you are offering your gift at the altar." So I want you all to notice the present tense

212
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:44,480
 here. "If you are offering your gift at the altar." The situation that Jesus described

213
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,800
 here involves the Jewish sacrificial system where someone is in the process of bringing

214
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:57,080
 the gifts to the altar in the Jerusalem temple. And obviously, we don't practice this kind

215
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:02,140
 of sacrificial system anymore in our church nowadays, right? So I think it would be helpful

216
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:06,360
 to give a little background to what Jesus is describing here so that it will help us

217
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:12,720
 better understand what is Jesus asking from us exactly. For the disciples that Jesus is

218
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:18,480
 speaking to, a lot of them came from the town of Galilee, and they usually only go to the

219
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:26,480
 temple in Jerusalem once or twice a year during one of the three festivals, the Passover,

220
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:33,940
 the Feast of Weeks, or the Feast of Tabernacles. And the journey from Galilee to Jerusalem

221
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:39,160
 can take anywhere from three to four days to one whole week, depending on which route

222
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:45,920
 they choose. And once you get into the temple in Jerusalem, you still have to wait in a

223
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:51,880
 long line, perhaps for a couple more days, to be able to finally offer your gifts that

224
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:59,200
 you brought with you at the altars. So the scenarios that Jesus is trying to paint here

225
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:07,060
 is that after an exhausting journey to get all the way from Galilee to Jerusalem, and

226
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:13,600
 then waiting in line for a couple more days, it is finally time for you to offer your gifts

227
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:21,420
 at the altar. So just think of all the efforts it takes to get to this point. But then Jesus

228
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:30,600
 continues, "And there, remember that your brother or sister has something against you."

229
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:35,460
 You might miss this if you don't read it carefully, so I'm going to read it again. It says, "If

230
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:41,300
 you're offering your gifts at the altar, and there, remember that your brother or sister

231
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:49,340
 has something against you." Did you guys catch that? In this situation, it is the other party

232
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:55,260
 that has something against you, and you might very well be innocent at all. But then Jesus

233
00:24:55,260 --> 00:25:02,400
 gives this command to his disciples, "Leave your gift there in front of the altar. First,

234
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:12,960
 go and be reconciled to them. Then come and offer your gift." So a lot of the time, our

235
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,360
 natural tendency when something goes wrong is to point fingers at other people or to

236
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:23,680
 shift the blame, right? But for Jesus, it is not about who is at fault, but the greater

237
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:29,040
 righteousness and the better response that Jesus demands from us is this, that we take

238
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:37,240
 the initiative to make things right and to seek reconciliation whenever possible. Of course,

239
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:42,880
 I want to be sensitive here, and I understand there are some exceptions to this, such as

240
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:51,920
 when someone is just not repentant, or in the case when someone is a victim of abuse,

241
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:58,540
 where seeking reconciliation with their abuser might not be the wise thing to do. However,

242
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:04,500
 in most cases, I will say that I agree with Apostle Paul when he emphasized this in Romans.

243
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:12,840
 If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone. So for Jesus,

244
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:18,600
 he understands that the presence of anger and conflict within the community of believers

245
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:26,440
 can be so destructive that he actually commands his disciples to leave the gift at the altar,

246
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:33,520
 go back and reconcile with the person, and then come back and offer your gift. Even if

247
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:39,040
 it means that you have to walk a few more days' journey back to Galilee, and then walk

248
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:43,840
 a few more days' journey back to Jerusalem again, and then you have to wait in line all

249
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:49,680
 over again just to offer your gift at the altar. So Jesus might be using some hyperbole

250
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:55,720
 here, but I think his point is still the same. This is the kind of radical response that

251
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:03,800
 Jesus demands from us as his followers, a way of living that prioritizes seeking reconciliation

252
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:10,200
 and pursuing justice within the community of believers, even over our religious rituals

253
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:18,440
 or our religious worship. And then Jesus continues in verse 25. "Settle matters quickly with

254
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:23,000
 your adversary who is taking you to the court. Do it while you are still together on the

255
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,120
 way, or your adversary may hand you over to the judge, and the judge may hand you over

256
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:34,320
 to the officer, and you may be thrown into prison. Truly I tell you, you will not get

257
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:40,840
 out until you have paid the last penny." So in these second examples, Jesus extends his

258
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:45,960
 application to those outside of the community of faith, from how we relate to other brother

259
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:53,360
 and sister to now on how we relate to an enemy or an adversary. While we might not be the

260
00:27:53,360 --> 00:28:00,840
 guilty party in the previous situation, this time we are clearly at fault. But regardless,

261
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:06,520
 Jesus warns us that reconciliation is an urgent matter, and we need to make peace with our

262
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:15,080
 enemy before it is too late. If not, we will have to pay the full price for our own actions.

263
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:22,500
 And church, this is the better response that Jesus demands from us, that reconciliation

264
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:29,400
 and justice is an urgent matter, and it should take priority over our rituals' worships.

265
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:35,600
 Why? Because God cares more about justice and righteousness than religious rituals and

266
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:45,600
 anti-worship. So I want to end this section by taking a look at Micah 6 to 8. So Micah,

267
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:50,500
 he is the prophet to the southern kingdom of Judah. And during his time, there was just

268
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:57,720
 a lot of injustice among the religious leaders and prophets in Judah, from bribery, showing

269
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:03,240
 favoritism to the wealthy, all the way to stealing from the poor and even taking away

270
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:11,940
 their land. So this section of Micah 6 is a poem in the form of question and answer.

271
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:17,580
 And right here you will see this person is asking the question. He is desperate to figure

272
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:23,840
 out what kind of things he should bring when he comes before the Lord and worship Him.

273
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:31,520
 And he is ready to pretty much offer anything that he has to the Lord. So look at verse

274
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:39,080
 6 together. "With what shall I come before the Lord and bow down before the exalted God?

275
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:45,720
 Shall I come before Him with burnt offerings, with calves a year's old?" So burnt offerings,

276
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:51,740
 out of all the different types of offerings in the Old Testament, is the most costly one

277
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:56,080
 because you pretty much have to burn out the entire animals and there's like nothing left

278
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:01,660
 for you to be taken home and to be eaten. And the calves a year old is usually also

279
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:06,500
 considered the best kind of calves and the best kind of animals to use for the burnt

280
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:13,460
 offerings. And then this person continues, "Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of

281
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:19,580
 rams or with ten thousands rivers of olive oil?" So now we see he switched from kind

282
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:29,320
 of like quality to quantity now. Thousands of rams or ten thousands rivers of olive oil.

283
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:34,880
 And it seems like this is still not enough. He then continues, "Shall I offer my firstborn

284
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:41,380
 for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?" So now he comes to

285
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:46,580
 a point where he's willing to offer up even his own son that is the most valuable possession

286
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:52,500
 that someone can have. But listen to how the Lord responds to him.

287
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:59,500
 "He has shown you, O mortal, what is good. And what does the Lord require of you? To

288
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:07,140
 act justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God."

289
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:13,700
 So God doesn't really care about how expensive or valuable our offering to him is. Or God

290
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:21,040
 doesn't really care about how big our worship service is or how many people attend our church.

291
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:26,540
 What he cares about is for us to act in a way that is aligned with his heart, that is

292
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:35,240
 to act justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with him. When there's anger and contempt

293
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:43,260
 or any form of injustice in our community or in our worship, Jesus says that our worship

294
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:48,900
 is compromised. So here's what I want all of us to take away

295
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:56,620
 from our passage today. Because Jesus cares about how we relate to people made in his

296
00:31:56,620 --> 00:32:05,460
 own image, we need to actively pursue justice and seek reconciliation. This is the higher

297
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:12,420
 righteousness that Jesus demands of us, that we treat every human made in his own image

298
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:19,120
 with the utmost respect and dignity. And this is the better response that Jesus requires

299
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:27,320
 of us, that we actively pursue justice and seek reconciliation. So once again, because

300
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:33,200
 Jesus cares about how we relate to people made in his own image, we need to actively

301
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:40,720
 pursue justice and seek reconciliation. So before I end, I have two application questions

302
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:49,560
 here that I want all of us to spend some time to reflect on. So as we come to the end of

303
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:57,960
 the year, is there someone that you need to reach out and seek reconciliation with? Are

304
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:04,960
 there certain people or group of people that we are tempted to show contempt towards, including

305
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:15,100
 passive indifference? Ask the Lord for forgiveness and for a transformed heart. So we'll spend

306
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:19,640
 some time to reflect on these questions and after that, I think Mark will come up and

307
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,480
 lead us in communion.

308
