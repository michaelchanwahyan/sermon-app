1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
 Good morning church and welcome back to

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,520
 Uv it is good to begin the new year in the house of the lord worshiping

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,680
 Him together

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,160
 So if you have been with us, uh

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:18,240
 Since last year you will know that every first sunday of the month besides going through

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,840
 Or participating in communion. We have also been diving into jesus sermon on the mount

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:33,040
 And one of the reasons that I choose to preach expository through this section, uh in matthew from matthew chapter 5

8
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,560
 to 7

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,640
 section by section verse by verse

10
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:43,360
 In contrast to preaching topically where I pick a topic and then just kind of like find different passage to supplement it

11
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,680
 It's because

12
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:51,680
 I cannot just choose what I want to talk about in the bible and avoid the topics that I don't want to speak on

13
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,880
 Rather the scripture itself

14
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:01,120
 Function as a guide for myself and the word of god dictates what I will be preaching on

15
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:09,760
 So today we will actually dive into a topic which can be a little taboo to talk about in church at times

16
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:16,000
 And not only for the church. I feel like this is also especially true in our asian culture

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,720
 Which tends to be a little more reserved at times at least in my own experience growing up

18
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,180
 So today we're actually going to touch upon the topics of sex and sexuality

19
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:32,720
 And if i'm being honest, I would probably avoid preaching on this topic if I have the option

20
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,860
 Because it is a very sensitive topic and also highly contested

21
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,520
 issues

22
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,520
 Especially in our current cultural climate

23
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:50,960
 However, jesus himself he doesn't shy away from this topic. So I feel like as the church we should not be as well

24
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,400
 as we are

25
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:57,680
 In fact sex and sexuality is part of god's original design that he called good

26
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:06,900
 The unfortunate reality is that the world the world that we live in currently is constantly bombarding us with all different ideologies and perspective

27
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,880
 That is just so far off from god's original design

28
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,280
 So

29
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,600
 As the church as christ followers

30
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:22,320
 I think it is even more urgent and important for us to understand what godly sexuality looks like

31
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:27,680
 So if you have your bible with you, let's turn with me to matthew 5

32
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,240
 And we're going to read from verse 27 to verse 30

33
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:37,300
 So matthew chapter 5 verse 27

34
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,880
 You have heard that it was said

35
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,040
 You shall not commit adultery

36
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:50,400
 But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart

37
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,520
 If your right eye caused you to stumble

38
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,160
 Gouch it out and throw it away

39
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:02,080
 It is better for you to lose one part of your body than your whole body to be thrown into hell

40
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,600
 And if your right hand caused you to stumble

41
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,160
 Cut it off and throw it away

42
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,920
 It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell

43
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,240
 so

44
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,920
 Let's pray

45
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,920
 Heavenly father

46
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,560
 As we open up your word this morning

47
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,520
 I just ask that um, your spirit will be with us

48
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,920
 Prepare our hearts as we receive your word

49
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,040
 And I also ask that your holy spirit will be with me as I preach this morning

50
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,560
 I ask that uh, you will take away anything that is not from you

51
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,440
 And may your word and your word only be preached this morning

52
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,720
 Amen

53
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:58,800
 So I know it is the new year already but not that long ago we just celebrated christmas, right?

54
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,320
 And usually during the christmas season besides celebrating the birth of jesus

55
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,800
 There are usually a lot of activities that is centered around gifts, right?

56
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:13,760
 Whether it is gift givings or gift exchange and in fact during our christmas service here

57
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,920
 We had a white elephant gift exchange as well

58
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,480
 And so this past christmas in our youth group in summit

59
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:26,640
 We organized a white white elephant christmas gift exchange for our high schooler as well

60
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,380
 And if you have participated in any sort of like gifts related activities

61
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:38,800
 I'm sure you have seen this old trick being done at some point where someone will put their actual gifts inside like a mismatched box

62
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,760
 Maybe like a bunch of toilet paper in like a really nice ps5 box

63
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,760
 And until you get to the actual gift itself

64
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,920
 It is pretty much impossible to tell what is actually inside the box

65
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:57,040
 And so without fail during our summit christmas party a couple of our students

66
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,120
 They did the same old trick

67
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,040
 One of them ensign. He's a guy but he bought

68
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,840
 a pretty nice barbie doll

69
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,920
 But instead of kind of like wrapping it in like a nice wrap or box

70
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:16,880
 He actually put it in like a 20 pound like noodles box basically like a huge box that he say he just like found at home

71
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:23,040
 And other students rex he bought also like some card games that is pretty nice

72
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:30,800
 But he ended up like putting it in layers after layers of different box cereal boxes shoe boxes and then also like different wrappings as well

73
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,040
 so

74
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,100
 Imagine you are the person receiving the gifts in this situation

75
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,360
 What actually matters to you?

76
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,280
 Is it the box itself?

77
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,280
 or the actual gift

78
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,520
 Would you rather get a really nice box?

79
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,200
 But with a gift inside there you're like, uh, I don't really need that

80
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:55,920
 Or would you rather get a general or basic box but with a gift inside that you actually want?

81
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:02,160
 I'm sure most of us will probably choose the later, right?

82
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,720
 So in the same way in our passage today

83
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,500
 We'll see that when jesus he talks about righteousness

84
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,240
 And what it means to live rightly as god's people

85
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,960
 in god's world

86
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,960
 under god's rule

87
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,820
 He doesn't really care about the outward appearance of obedience or compliance

88
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:28,800
 But what jesus really cares about is the posture and attitude of our heart

89
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:36,880
 So in my last sermon we began to dive into this new section in jesus sermon on the mount which includes six case studies

90
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,880
 On jesus on jesus own version of righteousness and how he has fulfilled the law and the prophets

91
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:50,320
 Each of these six examples they highlight how we as christ followers ought to live in community. We find another

92
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:55,360
 Within the church and also with those outside of the church in the world around us

93
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,740
 And last time we look at the first examples

94
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:06,960
 On the sixth commandment you shall not murder and how jesus points to the root issues behind murder and showing anger and content

95
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,520
 towards her brothers or sister

96
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:16,160
 And the root issue is not treating a person made in the image of god with respect and dignity

97
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:22,660
 And so today the righteousness that jesus redefines for us and for his listeners

98
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:27,140
 Centers around the seventh commandment. You shall not commit adultery

99
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:34,960
 And similar to the first examples on murder jesus teaching on adultery today also has to do with something that is inside of us

100
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:42,800
 The core desires and intention of our hearts that impacts how we relate to other people made in the image of god

101
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,320
 So here is my three main point for today

102
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:52,020
 First we need to reclaim a godly view of sex and sexuality

103
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:56,400
 And second we need to ruthlessly eliminate sin

104
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,280
 And lastly, we need a transformed heart to live rightly

105
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,580
 So point number one we need to reclaim a godly view of sexuality

106
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:09,940
 Let's take a look again at verse 27

107
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:14,480
 You have heard that it was said

108
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,480
 You shall not commit adultery

109
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:23,280
 So once again, we see this same formula that jesus is using here. You have heard that it was saying

110
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:29,940
 And when jesus audience hear this they would immediately know that jesus he is about to start a discussion

111
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,480
 on the particular mosaic law

112
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:39,380
 And this time the specific law that jesus will focus on is on the seventh commandment. You shall not commit adultery

113
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:42,400
 But what is adultery?

114
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:50,560
 For jesus adultery refers to any sexual relationships that is outside of the covenant of marriage

115
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:57,360
 Again adultery refers to any sexual relationships that is outside of the covenant of marriage

116
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,920
 In other words, this commandment is not just for the married couples

117
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,500
 But it also include any kind of sexual relationships

118
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,600
 That is outside of the bound of marriage including

119
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,160
 Like people that are single like me

120
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:19,700
 So if you have any sexual relationship outside of the marriage covenant or without a marriage covenant, it is considered as adultery

121
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:26,480
 But once again as the only one who has perfectly who has perfectly fulfilled the law of god

122
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,820
 Jesus he goes one step further and give his own interpretation

123
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:36,420
 Pointing us towards the heart behind this seventh commandment of you shall not commit adultery

124
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,920
 So jesus continues in verse 28

125
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,200
 But I tell you this

126
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:49,120
 Anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart

127
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,160
 So right here jesus is not talking about

128
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,740
 Just kind of like looking at someone and finding them attractive

129
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:05,600
 But the kind of looking that jesus talks about here is the kind of looking that makes you objectify a person

130
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,100
 Treating someone as an object to bring yourself pleasure

131
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:15,460
 And when we objectify a person we strip them of their god-given dignity

132
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:21,920
 So in some way this is similar to when we kind of like show anger and contempt towards another brother or sister

133
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 And also notice how it begins

134
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,360
 It begins with the eyes looking right?

135
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,400
 And then we stay at what we look at for a little bit longer than we should

136
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,840
 And what we see becomes the desires of our heart

137
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,520
 Does this pattern sounds familiar at all

138
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:48,000
 This is the same pattern that we find in the stories of the fall in genesis tree

139
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:55,200
 This is genesis tree. It says when the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye

140
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,920
 And also desirable for gaining wisdom

141
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,480
 She took some and ate it

142
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,360
 So my question for us is this

143
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,720
 What are our eyes looking at

144
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:17,140
 And do these things help us to follow jesus or do these things help us to follow what our corrupted heart desires

145
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,860
 and

146
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,820
 Especially living in the age of social media

147
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:27,780
 there's like so many things that we look at whether it is on our screen on the tvs or

148
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:32,100
 Around us all the time. So I think it is even more important to

149
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:36,100
 really pay attention to where we kind of like

150
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:40,740
 Put our time into what are some of the things that we look at in our daily life

151
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:46,600
 And at this point I think it is important to make a few clarification

152
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,540
 So we don't swing all the way to the other end of the spectrum and fall into bondage as well

153
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,620
 so

154
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,380
 first clarification

155
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,040
 We need to make a distinction between temptation

156
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:02,680
 And the act of following true with our temptation

157
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:09,800
 Okay, so there's a difference between the temptation itself and also the action of following true with our temptation

158
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:15,140
 It is not a sin when temptation like the last thought pop up in our mind

159
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:22,900
 Because we don't have complete control again. We have some sort of control, but we don't have complete control of our thoughts

160
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,540
 or our surroundings

161
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:32,260
 You can't just be like, okay, I don't want to be tempted so i'm just gonna lock myself inside a cave

162
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:35,780
 So I just don't see anything. We're not able to leave like that, right?

163
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:38,740
 So that's not possible

164
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:46,660
 Also, it is not wrong to have sexual desires in fact it is part of who we are as human beings

165
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:51,060
 But what we do have control over is this

166
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:57,700
 Do we follow true with our temptation or do we resist it?

167
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:06,180
 Do we entertain the lustful thoughts in our mind longer than we should or do we cut it off right away

168
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,220
 Do we let our sexual desires and passion

169
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:18,100
 Take control over us or do we practice self-control which is the fruit of the spirit

170
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:22,260
 So what truly matters

171
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,660
 Is how we deal with temptations?

172
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,220
 and our desires

173
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,220
 when they come up

174
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,380
 so one of the

175
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,900
 famous theologian

176
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:39,140
 A german theologian martin luther if you don't know him. He's pretty much the person who started up the

177
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:42,580
 Protestant reformation out from the catholic church

178
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,140
 And this is what he says about temptation

179
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,780
 it says

180
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:50,980
 Thus you see that temptation can be avoided by no one

181
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,940
 But resistant may be made

182
00:13:53,940 --> 00:14:00,580
 And with prayer and recourse to divine aid we can put ourself in readiness to meet such designs

183
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:08,660
 In the book of an old father we read that a young brother expressed a desire to be rid of his thoughts

184
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:11,940
 Thereupon the old father said

185
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:17,300
 Dear brother, you cannot prevent the birds from flying in the air over your head

186
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:21,780
 But you can prevent them from building a nest in your hair

187
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:27,640
 So as saint augustine says we cannot prevent offenses and temptations

188
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:34,740
 But by prayer and invocation of the help of god we can prevent them from overcoming us

189
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:41,320
 This is from his explanation of the lord's prayer and the sixth petition, which is lead us not into temptation

190
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,580
 So again

191
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:47,380
 What he's basically saying is we cannot prevent

192
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:52,340
 Thoughts from coming up in our mind. We cannot prevent the bird from flying in the air over us

193
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:58,100
 But what we can control is to prevent the bird from building a nest on our head

194
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,140
 or prevent those kind of negative thoughts to

195
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:04,340
 Like take roots in our mind

196
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:09,400
 So again, it is not a sin to have sexual desires or experience temptation

197
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:15,940
 But when we give into the temptation or let our passions and desires take control over us

198
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:18,660
 That becomes an issue

199
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,140
 So that is my first clarification

200
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,540
 second clarification

201
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:29,860
 Sex and sexuality are part of god's design. They're not something that is dirty or sinful

202
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:32,740
 But quite the opposite

203
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:38,500
 They're actually meant to be good gifts from god for us as human to celebrate to enjoy

204
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:48,500
 Unfortunately, the reality is that just like the rest of the creation this good and perfect gifts from god has been tainted by sin

205
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:56,180
 You've probably heard of ideas such as um, I can be whatever I want to be or I can do whatever I want

206
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,340
 as long as it makes me happy or

207
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:02,020
 More recently my body my choice

208
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:07,380
 And of course, I don't have time in my sermon to dive into all these different

209
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:10,020
 issues on gender and sexuality

210
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:15,620
 But I want to point you to a resource if you're interested to learn more about how we as christ followers

211
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:21,240
 We can approach this topic. So this is a book called love thy body by nancy piercey

212
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:25,400
 And in this book she talks about issues all the way from abortion

213
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,480
 homosexuality and transgenderism

214
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,220
 to the use of porn to divorce and

215
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:36,420
 Cohabitation and one of the reasons that I appreciate this book is because the author

216
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,260
 nancy

217
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,260
 She approached all these topics

218
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:45,860
 Both with a strong biblical conviction and a deep compassion for the people at the same time

219
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:50,500
 So if you want to pick up a new book to read for the new year, I would recommend

220
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:54,360
 Highly recommend this book love thy body by nancy piercey

221
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,300
 So

222
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,100
 back to our clarification, so the biggest red flag

223
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:08,420
 and the most glaring issues with this kind of attitude of I can be wherever I want to be or my body my choice

224
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,380
 Is that when god created the world?

225
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:17,140
 There is a certain grain or certain flow to it. Just like the grain on a piece of wood

226
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:21,380
 I'm sure all of you have seen a piece of wood, right or even like touch them

227
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:26,260
 If you have never seen a piece of wood with some like wooden structures behind that sound booth

228
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:29,060
 You can go over there and observe it, uh later

229
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:32,980
 But if you have a piece of wood and you look at it carefully

230
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,780
 You probably see a certain like grain and flow to it, right?

231
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:41,780
 And if you touch it and kind of like move your hands along the grain, it probably feels relatively smooth

232
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:44,580
 But if you try to go against the grain

233
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:50,100
 A grain against the flow and kind of like move your hands on the opposite direction

234
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:54,180
 You probably might get hurt or even get some splinters, right?

235
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:57,380
 So in the same way

236
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:01,460
 In our universe when god created it, there are certain natural orders

237
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:06,340
 Patterns and inherent structures that is within the universe

238
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:12,420
 And when we live according to it, we will experience the flourishing life that god has promised

239
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:16,580
 But when we choose to go against this grain of the universe

240
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:19,620
 We will experience dysfunction

241
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,420
 and destruction

242
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:29,700
 So let's take gravity for example, so gravity it is always pulling things towards where

243
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,300
 Towards the center of the earth, right?

244
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:41,140
 You can never change that it is the fact when god created the world gravity is always pulling things towards the center of the earth

245
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:46,680
 So you can't just complain to god. Hey god, this gravity is too restrictive

246
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:50,120
 Why is it only pulling things in one direction?

247
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:55,380
 I want to be able to fly I want to go against gravity

248
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:58,740
 well, of course

249
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:04,820
 You can choose to you can still choose to do whatever you want by jumping off a cliff and trying to fly

250
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:08,500
 But you might actually end up dying doing that

251
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:13,480
 So this is the same thing when it comes to sex and sexuality

252
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,340
 There is a certain order

253
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:18,020
 And design to it

254
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:24,580
 That we have to live according to if we want to truly experience the flourishing life that jesus has promised

255
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:28,420
 So

256
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:31,620
 I just spoke to some of the issues that i've seen in our current culture

257
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:37,700
 Now I want to take some time to speak to us as the church and some of the things that we can do better as well

258
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:40,500
 So as the church

259
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,180
 as christ followers

260
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:45,540
 Instead of telling the non-believing world that they get it all wrong

261
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:49,220
 And kind of like judging them because we think that we are right

262
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:53,620
 I think we can actually do a better better job in witnessing to the world

263
00:19:54,100 --> 00:20:00,740
 The beauty of god's design for sex and sexuality instead of just pointing out what the world is doing wrong

264
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:05,700
 So when I was a student at iit I had an opportunity to

265
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:09,620
 Go to ecuador for a summer mission with crew

266
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:12,980
 And during the middle of our six weeks mission trip

267
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:21,460
 We had a mid-mission retreat at this place called banyos in ecuador. I know it is banyos is also bathroom for spanish

268
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:26,740
 Uh in spanish, but this place is far off from looking like a bathroom

269
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:30,340
 This is a very popular tourist attraction

270
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:33,060
 Kind of like on the mountain side in ecuador

271
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:40,980
 And one of the things that we get to do when we were at banyos is that we got to hike up at the summit of

272
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:45,640
 Tungurahua, which is an active volcano in ecuador

273
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:52,900
 So I remember when we arrived at the summit it was probably around like sunset around evening at that time

274
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:56,580
 And the view up there it was absolutely stunning

275
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:00,660
 Like I was just surrounded by all these great mountains and in the midst of it

276
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:06,820
 I just feel like so small and you just look out and you see the clouds and also like the sun like

277
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:12,340
 The sunlight the golden rays from the sunlight just kind of like piercing through the clouds

278
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:15,940
 So I actually have a few pictures um to show

279
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:19,940
 So these are some of the pictures that I took on that trip

280
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:24,660
 So the pictures on the left is kind of like my point of view when I got up to the summit

281
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:28,520
 So if you look right in front of you, that is pretty much the volcanoes

282
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:34,980
 And then if you look a little bit to the right there's like this treehouse kind of structure over it, right

283
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:41,540
 And on that treehouse, there's this swing called swing at the end of the world. So there's a picture on the right

284
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:47,380
 So when you actually go on this swing, you kind of you pretty much just like swing off the cliff

285
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,380
 into like

286
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,260
 Just like I don't know how many feet drop like below you

287
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,580
 but again

288
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:59,860
 I know it is a little risky, but it is actually the view out there is also like really really gorgeous

289
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:04,740
 You just look at all the mountains below you all the trees and all the valleys

290
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:11,300
 And that is probably like some of the most like some of my most favorite place that I have visited so far

291
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,180
 So imagine

292
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:19,160
 If I when I share with you about my experience visiting, uh, banyos

293
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:22,820
 Instead of focusing on the beauty of this place

294
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:25,620
 All the things that I tell you

295
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:30,420
 are the negative part like oh, it is probably a little risky and dangerous because

296
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:35,800
 This volcano this mountain is one of the most active volcanoes in ecuador

297
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:39,620
 It may erupt at any time and I don't know what will happen

298
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:43,940
 or hey, you have to be really careful out there and

299
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:46,580
 probably skip the swing because

300
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,700
 if

301
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,260
 You fall off from the swing you might just die

302
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:54,820
 So imagine if this is all I tell you about this place

303
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:59,380
 Do you think this place will still be compelling enough for you to visit?

304
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:05,400
 So in the same way when we talked about god's design for sex and sexuality

305
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:11,700
 I think we have to do a better job in highlight the beauty of god's creation and god's design

306
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:16,120
 And make it more compelling instead of just focusing on all the negatives

307
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:20,660
 So what is sex supposed to be according to god's design

308
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:28,580
 It is a unity fact between a man and a woman within the covenant of marriage where two become one flesh

309
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:32,020
 And this is a union not just the physical body

310
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,820
 but also of the mind

311
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:37,940
 the emotion the soul and the spirit

312
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:41,220
 More importantly

313
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,800
 It is supposed to point forward to the relationship

314
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,020
 between christ

315
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,620
 And his church

316
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,620
 And this is a beautiful image

317
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:52,340
 So church

318
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:57,400
 We need to do a better job in reclaiming a godly view on sex and sexuality

319
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,340
 And make it more appealing to the world around us

320
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:05,000
 We need to reclaim a godly view on sex and sexuality

321
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,580
 One that is in alignment with god's design

322
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:12,420
 And then show it to the world. So that is our first point

323
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:20,840
 So second point we need to ruthlessly eliminate sin. So take a look with me at verse 29 and 30

324
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:24,580
 If your right eye caused you to stumble

325
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:27,220
 Gouge it out and throw it away

326
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:32,740
 It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell

327
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:37,780
 And if your right hand causes you to stumble cut it off and throw it away

328
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:43,700
 It is better for you to lose one part of your body than of your whole body to go into hell

329
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,180
 So you might be wondering

330
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:48,980
 Didn't jesus just emphasize what is truly important?

331
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:54,420
 It's not our outward actions, but the desires and intention of our heart

332
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,980
 Why is he all of a sudden talking about the eye and the hand again?

333
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:04,740
 Well, yes jesus cares about the true intention of our heart

334
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:10,020
 But right here jesus is trying to show how seriously we should treat sin

335
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:13,460
 And the consequences if we take sin lightly

336
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:16,760
 So in both of these hypothetical situations

337
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:24,180
 We find the phrase cause you to stumble if your right eye caused you to stumble or if your right hand caused you to stumble

338
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:31,640
 This phrase caused you to stumble comes from the greek word scandalito, which is where we get our english word scandalous

339
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:36,020
 And some english translation. They actually translate it as causing you to sin

340
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:42,420
 But here it means more than just simply causing someone to commit a sin

341
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:51,060
 Scandalito here carries the nuance of causing someone to steer away from the path that leads to eternal life in jesus

342
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:53,620
 towards the life

343
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,620
 That leads to eternal destruction

344
00:25:55,620 --> 00:26:03,220
 And how do we know this if you look at the consequences? It is hell or gehenna the hellfire awaiting

345
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:07,700
 If we don't deal with the stumbling block that causes us to sin

346
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:15,940
 And when you look at the solution that jesus provide for us that he instructed us to do it is pretty violent and aggressive, right?

347
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:21,640
 Why because when it comes to dealing with sin we need to be decisive

348
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,940
 and ruthless

349
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:26,420
 Jesus, he's not trying to tell us to literally

350
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:29,300
 Gouge our eyes or to amputate a limb

351
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:34,180
 But he is using hyperbole to get our attention in order to make his point

352
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:40,980
 That we need to ruthlessly eliminate sin if we want to follow him and become more like him

353
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:47,140
 When the apostle paul speaks to the church in ephesus on how they should live

354
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:53,160
 In light of their new identity in christ. He warns them do not give the devil a foothold

355
00:26:53,160 --> 00:27:00,980
 If we leave even just a tiny bit of foothold to the devil and think that uh, we will probably be all right

356
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,540
 I want you to think again

357
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:07,300
 I'm sure you all have heard of the stories of david and beth sheba

358
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:10,740
 and a lot of time we kind of uh

359
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:15,860
 When we think of these stories we think of it as kind of like the starting point of david's downfall, right?

360
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:20,660
 But I think this david downfall actually begins way earlier than that

361
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:28,660
 The story of david and beth sheba begins with king david being complacent during a time of war

362
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:32,260
 So imagine during a time of war

363
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:39,620
 Second samuel told us that instead of going out to war with his men king david. He actually stays back in his palace

364
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:42,100
 in jerusalem

365
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:45,860
 And on this particular day, he woke up not in the morning

366
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,660
 Not in the afternoon

367
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,660
 but in the evening

368
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:57,140
 A king during a time of war should be on high alert and on standby mode all the time, right?

369
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:00,120
 But king david here he's doing the opposite

370
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,380
 He is sleeping in his palace until the evening

371
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:08,020
 This shouldn't be the routine of a king during a time of war

372
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:15,480
 However, david he's probably just getting complacent because god has given his armies victories

373
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:19,480
 after victories after victories over all the different enemies

374
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:25,180
 And when david leaves this tiny foothold for the devil by being complacent

375
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:30,200
 On that particular evening it led to more and more serious sin

376
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,800
 beginning with him lasting over beth sheba

377
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,760
 And then committing adultery with her

378
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,740
 And then trying to cover up his own mistakes

379
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:42,840
 And when his plan to cover up fell

380
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:49,180
 David ultimately came out with the plan to have besheba's husband uriah killed in the battlefield

381
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:58,680
 So do you see how serious the consequences can be if we leave just even a tiny foothold for the devil

382
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:02,440
 This is why we need to ruthlessly

383
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,240
 eliminate sins in our lives

384
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:09,660
 Especially the parts that we have control over like resisting temptation

385
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:12,360
 and taking control over

386
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,600
 our passion and desires

387
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:18,600
 However, I understand that this is easier said than done a lot of times

388
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:23,720
 I will be the first one to admit that there are probably way too many times where I myself

389
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,520
 failed to resist temptation

390
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,460
 Regardless of how hard I tried

391
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:32,520
 Can you somewhat relate to that?

392
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:41,240
 And this brings me to my final point we need we need a transformed heart to live rightly

393
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,600
 We need a transformed heart to live rightly

394
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:51,160
 We can't live rightly by just not breaking the law or by trying to follow the law

395
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:54,600
 But we need a transformed heart to live rightly

396
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:59,160
 Throughout israel history in the old testament the people of god

397
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:06,300
 failed to live up to god's law generations after generations which ultimately led to the destruction of jerusalem

398
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,680
 And also the exiles in babylon

399
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,380
 However in the midst of this nationwide tragedy

400
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:15,000
 We find a glimpse of hope

401
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,600
 Where god promised that he would renew the covenant with his people

402
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,320
 And transform their heart

403
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:26,760
 So this is in the book from the book of jeremiah. So jeremiah 31

404
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,480
 verse 31 to 34

405
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:37,880
 The days are coming declares the lord when I will make a new covenant with the people of israel

406
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,440
 And with the people of judah

407
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,740
 It will not be like the covenant I made with their ancestors

408
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:47,080
 When I took them by the hand to lead them out of egypt

409
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:52,200
 Because they broke my covenant though. I was a husband to them declares the lord

410
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:57,880
 This is the covenant I will make with the people of israel

411
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:05,720
 After that time declares the lord I will put my law in their minds and write it on their hearts

412
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,560
 I will be their god and they will be my people

413
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:14,120
 No longer would they teach their neighbor or say to one another

414
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:20,520
 Know the lord because they will all know me from the least of them to the greatest

415
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,000
 declares the lord

416
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,640
 For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more

417
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,200
 so

418
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,920
 What what the lord is saying here is basically under this new covenant

419
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,920
 The law of god will no longer be inscribed on stone tablets

420
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:43,640
 But it will be inscribed in our hearts in our mind

421
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:49,720
 And church we are the people who live under this new covenant

422
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:58,440
 The same spirit who raised jesus from the dead is also living in us now giving us the power to overcome sin in our lives

423
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:05,800
 So in order to live rightly before the lord we cannot do it in our own strength or in our own ability

424
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:12,040
 But we need a heart that is being transformed by the power of the gospel

425
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:19,800
 And this is the good news that jesus brings to us that we're not only free from the penalty from of sin

426
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,880
 But we are also free from the power of sin over us

427
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:29,880
 And we know that one day when jesus comes again, we will be free from the presence of sin forever

428
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:35,560
 And this is why I think that jesus he is very intentional in starting his kingdom teaching

429
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:41,880
 On the beatitudes which pretty much focus on the attitude and the posture of our hearts

430
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:45,560
 By being poor in spirit by being humble and meek

431
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:52,840
 This is because jesus he understands that we need a transformed heart to be able to live rightly before the lord

432
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:57,640
 Not just by trying to not break the law or trying to follow the law perfectly

433
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,080
 That is the way of the pharisees and the teachers of the law

434
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,800
 So

435
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:08,200
 As we begin the new year. I think this is a good time for us to set our hearts in the right place

436
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:12,280
 And allow god to transform it in order to live rightly

437
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:19,820
 Not through our own strength, but through the work of jesus who has fulfilled who has completely who has perfectly fulfilled

438
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:25,720
 The righteous requirement of god and also through the power of the holy spirit living in us

439
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:30,200
 So I have some reflection questions for us here to reflect

440
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,560
 As we kind of like begin our new year

441
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,920
 So what is god saying to me this morning?

442
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,800
 And what am I going to do about it?

443
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:47,480
 Are there certain areas or sin struggles in my life where I need the power of jesus to transform my heart

444
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,120
 In order to live rightly before the lord

445
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:54,440
 so I would encourage you all to take some time or just

446
00:33:55,560 --> 00:34:00,600
 Take a picture of these questions and maybe in the following week just take some time to reflect on these questions

447
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,240
 and as pastor mark say

448
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:07,800
 Um, this is the new year and we want to be able to have a good

449
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,280
 um kind of like

450
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:16,600
 Yeah a good routine in our spiritual walk in our walk with jesus as well if we want to truly follow jesus

451
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:21,320
 So, um, let's pray

452
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:24,600
 Heavenly father

453
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,400
 We thank you that uh, you are not a god

454
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,280
 who punish sins

455
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,960
 But you are a god

456
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,120
 Who show us grace even though we?

457
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:38,600
 As human we have time and time again failed to live up. Um

458
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,320
 to your standard of righteousness

459
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:45,640
 So jesus we thank you for this gift of righteousness that you have given us at the cross

460
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:48,280
 That we are able to come before you

461
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,920
 Just as we are

462
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,920
 Carrying all the weight and the burdens

463
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,520
 And laid it in front of your throne

464
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:04,920
 Father as we begin the new year, I just ask that you would give each and every one of us here in this room

465
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:11,160
 Just a desire to know you more just a desire

466
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:14,840
 To live in a way

467
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:21,560
 That uh represents our kingdom citizenships that represents who we belong to

468
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,480
 So grant us the power through your holy spirit

469
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:30,440
 To be able to live rightly before you and to be able to witness the world around us

470
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,240
 the beauty of god

471
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,640
 The beauty of who you are jesus

472
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:39,480
 So help us jesus in your son's name. We pray

473
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,880
 amen

474
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:48,920
 So thank you for coming this morning again. Happy new year and we have some refreshment outside for you to enjoy

475
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:52,760
 So I would encourage you to stay back. Enjoy some fellowship with us

476
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,600
 and

477
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,600
 You are dismissed
