[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   [speaking Chinese]
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   [speaking Chinese]
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   [speaking Chinese]
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.920]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.840]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.760]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.680]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.600]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.520]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.440]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.360]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.280]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.200]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.120]   - Well, we have a very special speaker today, all right?
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.520]   And Wasam asked me, is he the first Arab
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.400]   in our congregation, I think, right?
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.560]   You're the first one, right?
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.760]   Iraqi, right?
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.760]   And he's a native Iraqi, and he's from Baghdad, Iraq.
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.560]   How many of you have been to Baghdad, Iraq?
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.040]   (audience laughing)
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.160]   One, okay, all right.
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.440]   And he, through a very dramatic experience,
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.680]   came to Christ in Baghdad, Iraq.
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.480]   And he will tell you more about his story.
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.840]   Now he's Associate Minister of Sunset Church of Christ
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.720]   in Taylor, Michigan.
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.720]   Taylor, Michigan, you've been there, right?
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.080]   Michigan, you've been there, right?
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.160]   State of Michigan.
[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.160]   And his vision is to tell Muslims about Christ
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.720]   and to tell Christians about Islam.
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.000]   And I think this is a very relevant topic today.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.440]   Our coworkers, our friends, our neighbors,
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.920]   maybe Muslims, or maybe they believe in Islam,
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.960]   and they love to tell you about their faith
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.880]   and how to respond as a Christians.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.240]   So a very, very relevant topic.
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.200]   And Wasam has also written two books.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.200]   The first one is "I Am an Arab and I Am a Christian."
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.240]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.160]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.000]   The second book he has written is "Islam in Christ's Eyes."
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.240]   It's a scripture study, it's a group study guide
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.240]   to help you understand Islam from a Christian perspective
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.400]   and how to respond to Islam.
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.200]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.120]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.040]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.960]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.720]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.840]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.120]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.080]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.000]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.960]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.880]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.920]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.680]   Wasam, we wanna welcome you.
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.520]   - Thank you.
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.600]   (audience applauding)
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.440]   Thank you.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.280]   Good morning.
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.120]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.600]   It is so surreal that I'm invited in one weekend
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.120]   to talk in two Chinese congregations.
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.040]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:40.080]   I started the Arab Christian ministry.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.600]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.000]   Upon my graduation
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.840]   from Sunset International Bible Institute.
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.760]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.760]   Locally, I work from my church, preaching the gospel
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.120]   to the predominantly Muslim population
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.240]   in the neighboring Dearborn, Michigan.
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.160]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.400]   And globally, I work as the adjunct assistant dean
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.840]   for the Arabic studies
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.560]   with Sunset International Bible Institute.
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.480]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:27.960]   And yet, I think you are never famous
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.560]   until you have your name said in Chinese.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.560]   (audience laughing)
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.480]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:41.320]   I was born to a Muslim family in Baghdad in 1979.
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.280]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.400]   A few months after my birth,
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.760]   Saddam Hussein became our president.
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.680]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.520]   And Ayatollah Khomeini led the Islamic revolution
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.400]   in the neighboring Iran.
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.320]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:11.200]   And we started to have the war
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.400]   between the two countries that lasted for eight years.
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.800]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.880]   I was born and raised in a classic example
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:24.200]   of a world that was not told to love one another.
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.120]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.520]   A world that is not shaped by the goodness
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.080]   and the love of Jesus Christ.
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.400]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.880]   Shortly after the war, Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait.
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:45.800]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:52.320]   We had the sanctions that lasted for 13 years
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.640]   in which my whole family lived on $1 a month.
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:59.560]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.360]   And we had the Gulf War of 1991.
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:06.280]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:10.120]   Up until that point,
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.920]   Saddam Hussein was a secular socialist military dictator.
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:17.840]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:25.640]   But after he had a Shiite revolt in the south,
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:29.480]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.840]   he realized he could not impose a secular system
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.440]   on the predominantly Muslim people of Iraq.
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.360]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:44.960]   So after he crushed that revolt,
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.680]   he started to put on a show of Islam.
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:51.600]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:56.200]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:06.120]   He wrote Allahu Akbar on the Iraqi flag.
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:10.760]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.800]   He ordered the Quran to be taught
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.320]   in all the Iraqi schools.
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:18.240]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.160]   He built hundreds of mosques all around Iraq.
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.760]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:29.160]   And he started to turn the Iraqi community
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.360]   from being secular to being more Muslim.
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:35.280]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:39.520]   My father retired in 1992.
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:43.120]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:45.720]   And my mom started working as a seamstress,
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.800]   mending the clothes of our neighborhood
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.240]   to provide for the family.
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:53.160]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:57.640]   I was in the middle of my teenage years,
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.800]   in the middle of the 1990s.
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:03.160]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.480]   When Iraq was officially at enmity
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.800]   with everything that is different in the world.
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:11.720]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:17.600]   We did not have the terrorism and the car bombs
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.400]   and Al-Qaeda that is ravaging the Middle East now.
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:24.320]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:30.720]   But all of that was a culture that was preached in mosques.
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:34.640]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:38.560]   Taught in schools.
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.000]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.800]   And propagated by the government's limited channels.
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:48.720]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:52.360]   Hate was preached everywhere.
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:56.080]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.280]   It is hate that eventually caused me
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.920]   to convert out of Islam.
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:03.840]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:09.520]   Hate is evil, whether it is in Iraq
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.640]   or in America or in China.
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:15.560]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:21.800]   We did not starve for food or water
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.840]   because of the sanctions years.
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:27.760]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:33.000]   But we were starving for a different kind of bread
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.920]   and a different kind of water that we did not even know.
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:39.840]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:44.840]   My four year old sister passed away in 1996.
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:48.760]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:51.840]   My mom, a panicked mother,
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.840]   and the funeral of her daughter was--
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:57.760]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:03.760]   Was begging for someone at the funeral
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.920]   to provide her with a glimpse of hope
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:07.920]   that that innocent child went to heaven.
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:11.840]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:20.360]   No one was able to provide her with that hope.
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:24.200]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.600]   And the only man who was knowledgeable in the Quran
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.400]   told her she will be judged for the very first breath
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.120]   she took in when she was born.
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:35.040]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:39.680]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:42.920]   A few months later that same year.
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:45.400]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:47.000]   My uncle got cancer.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.920]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.000]   He was the uncle that I loved most.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.760]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:58.000]   He was so kind and so generous and so humorous.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.520]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:03.080]   But when I last saw him,
[00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:05.280]   he would cry every time I talk with him.
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:09.200]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.920]   Not only because he saw his death coming,
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:14.560]   which he did in a few days.
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:18.680]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:20.400]   But for the first time in his life,
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.600]   he was unable to go to the bathroom.
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:26.760]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:29.520]   To get ritually clean for the Muslim prayers.
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:33.440]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:37.480]   He was in bed, soiling himself.
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:40.480]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:42.440]   He thought God was done with him.
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:45.920]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.480]   And he died without hope.
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:49.520]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:51.200]   That's when I decided that's it,
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.600]   between me and God,
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.880]   rejected Islam and became an atheist.
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:58.800]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.400]   I thought I would be happy if I were an atheist.
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:05.400]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:07.840]   But somewhere deep inside me,
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.960]   I was looking for justice and for a sense of direction.
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:14.880]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:19.320]   I wanted to entertain and distract myself.
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:23.240]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:25.600]   I started to think about the world
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:28.560]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.160]   I started reading books,
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.560]   listening to music and watching movies.
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:36.960]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:39.560]   Most of the books that I read quoted the Bible.
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:43.600]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:46.680]   I got curious to get myself a copy of the Bible
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:48.680]   only to understand these quotes.
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:52.600]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.400]   I was in my second year in college
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:57.960]   studying civil engineering.
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:00.920]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:03.560]   When the first Mission Impossible movie was released.
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:07.320]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:11.280]   Tom Cruise picked the Gideon's Bible and read Job 314.
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:15.200]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:19.160]   That was the first time I see the Bible.
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:22.840]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:24.000]   I got so curious.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.120]   I went to a flea market in Baghdad
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.760]   and bought my first Bible.
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:31.680]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.920]   It was the Gospel of John.
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:35.880]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:37.680]   I thought that was the entire Bible.
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:40.000]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.080]   I did not find Job 314 in the Gospel of John.
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:46.640]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:48.240]   So I thought Muslims were right.
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.320]   Everybody is making up a different Bible.
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:54.560]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.400]   Something caught my attention in the Gospel of John though.
[00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:00.560]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:02.040]   The way Jesus addressed
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:04.960]   the hypocritical religious authorities of his time.
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:09.840]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:12.520]   Something you're not supposed to do in a Muslim community.
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:16.480]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:19.680]   I was born and raised to two devout Muslim parents.
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:23.600]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:26.160]   And they taught me that every Imam
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.160]   is a steward of God's word.
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:32.080]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.440]   And we should not question them.
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:36.600]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:38.440]   Well, not Jesus in that book.
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:41.360]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.640]   It was the summer holiday
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:45.280]   between the second and the third year in college.
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:49.080]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.880]   When I was back at that flea market
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.520]   flipping the New Testament.
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:56.120]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:59.000]   I saw the Gospel of John in the New Testament.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.080]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:04.000]   That was the first time I realized
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.360]   that the Gospel of John was not another Bible.
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.040]   It was part of a bigger book.
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:11.960]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:14.320]   So I bought the New Testament.
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:16.720]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:17.720]   A few days later,
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.160]   I realized that the New Testament
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:20.680]   was part of another bigger book.
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:24.760]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:27.360]   So I realized that I lost a lot of money already.
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:30.440]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.400]   And bought my first complete Bible.
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:35.800]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:39.200]   I was so shocked to see the accurate historical
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.600]   and geographic description in the Bible
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.680]   of a world that I am familiar with.
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:47.600]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:54.440]   Babylon, that's 50 miles to the south of my parents' house.
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:58.360]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:01.680]   Babylonians and Assyrians,
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:03.360]   these are the native Iraqis.
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:07.280]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:13.240]   Nebuchadnezzar, his poster is next to Saddam Hussein's
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:15.600]   picture in every street corner in Baghdad.
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:19.520]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:25.360]   The captivity, the pride of the Iraqi history
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:27.320]   that we studied in the seventh grade.
[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:31.240]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:32.080]   I'm sorry.
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:36.000]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:49.640]   And I was thinking, man, the guy who made up this book
[00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:51.560]   really knew his history and geography.
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:55.480]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:01.360]   A Christian philosopher once said.
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:03.840]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.240]   That there are three things that we all need.
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.600]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:11.040]   And these are first, truth.
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:12.640]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:13.920]   And then goodness.
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:15.200]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.400]   And then beauty.
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.880]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:22.200]   But he said what we want is the exact opposite order.
[00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:26.240]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.520]   We want beauty first.
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.240]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:30.960]   And then goodness and then truth.
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:33.280]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:35.880]   The beauty of the Bible caught my attention first.
[00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:39.760]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:42.480]   It is the most influential and most beautiful piece
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:44.200]   of literature that was ever written.
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:47.760]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.520]   Then I fell in love with the goodness of the Bible.
[00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:53.760]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:56.000]   A book that preaches love and not hate.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.320]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:00.920]   Peace and not violence.
[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:04.360]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:06.440]   Forgiveness and not vengeance.
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:11.040]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:13.520]   Integrity, benevolence, you name it.
[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:17.040]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:19.440]   And I fell in love with the Bible for being good
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:22.320]   way before I believed in the Bible for being true.
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:26.240]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:30.600]   I had so many questions to ask.
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.040]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.600]   I did not have any Christian friends.
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:35.840]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:38.080]   But when the third year in college started,
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:41.440]   I saw a man with a cross in his shirt in our class.
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:45.360]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:48.520]   He obviously flunked the third year.
[00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:51.760]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.240]   I asked him, are you a Christian?
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:54.320]   Do you know your Bible?
[00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:57.320]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:58.400]   He said, go ahead.
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:00.920]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:03.480]   I said, do you Christians believe that you are saved
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:06.200]   by God's grace or by your obedience?
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:10.120]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:14.960]   Like every other preacher,
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:16.800]   he did not directly answer my question.
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:20.720]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.280]   But he took the opportunity
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:25.320]   to introduce the gospel message to me.
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:28.920]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:32.320]   He explained to me how God is a holy and just God
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:33.880]   that does not tolerate sin.
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:38.560]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.440]   But at the same time, he's a loving God,
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:42.800]   so he sent his son to take our sins on him
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:44.280]   and die on the cross for us.
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:48.200]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:51.640]   It's a combination of God's grace and our obedience.
[00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:55.560]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:58.120]   I said, interesting.
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:58.960]   One more question.
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:02.240]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:03.720]   Do you really believe that?
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:06.520]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:07.680]   He said, oh yeah, we do.
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:09.680]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:11.600]   Next day, he brought me some literature
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:14.080]   that talked about how many tens of thousands
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:16.760]   of Bible manuscripts we have today in the museum.
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:20.680]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:31.600]   From different times, from different places,
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.000]   written in different languages.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.560]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:39.040]   And they all match each other.
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:43.520]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.440]   That was the first time anyone tells me
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:47.480]   that the Bible has not been corrupted.
[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:51.400]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:54.160]   I was 19.
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:55.760]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:57.800]   I was so happy to learn that the book
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:59.960]   that has the solution to every problem
[00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:02.640]   my community is suffering from turned out to be true.
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:06.560]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:13.600]   I was so happy to learn that the book
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:16.960]   that was both beautiful and good turned out to be true too.
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:20.880]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:23.640]   I thought everybody else would be as happy.
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:27.400]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:28.240]   I was wrong.
[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:29.720]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:32.280]   The first person I tried to share the gospel with
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:34.320]   was the woman that I loved the most.
[00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:38.240]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:41.120]   My mom used to wake up before me
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:42.760]   to make breakfast for me every day.
[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:46.680]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:48.920]   And at that time, she would not answer me
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:50.400]   when I say good morning, mom.
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:54.320]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:58.200]   One morning I asked mom, what's wrong?
[00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:02.120]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:05.360]   She turned to me and she grabbed me by the collar.
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:07.560]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:09.240]   And she asked me, please tell me
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:10.840]   what did I fail to provide to you?
[00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:14.480]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:16.000]   That you do this thing to me.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.600]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:19.800]   I said, what thing?
[00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:21.400]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:23.320]   She said, I've been working day and night
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:25.240]   to make a human being out of you.
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:29.640]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:32.840]   I've been wearing my eyes out on that sewing machine.
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:36.760]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:40.160]   To send you to school.
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:42.760]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:46.000]   And you've been using my money to buy that blasphemous book
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.280]   that I've been seeing among your college books.
[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:52.200]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:55.320]   Look at yourself, grow up.
[00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:57.720]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:58.560]   With that,
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:03.120]   with the lack of wisdom and the lack of encouragement.
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:05.680]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:07.360]   With the fact that I started to lose
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:08.640]   many of my Muslim friends
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:11.120]   and did not gain any new Christian friends.
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:15.040]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:18.360]   And with the fact that I started to get harassed
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:20.480]   by the religious authorities in my neighborhood.
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:24.400]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:27.280]   I came to that point where I thought,
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:28.600]   maybe this is all wrong.
[00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:31.920]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:33.200]   Maybe there is no God.
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:34.520]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:36.600]   Maybe the gospel was just another philosophy
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:38.960]   I wanted to entertain and distract myself with.
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:42.880]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:47.120]   I renounced the Christian faith and gave away my Bible.
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:51.320]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:53.120]   A few months later,
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:54.520]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:55.600]   I realized,
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:56.760]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:59.960]   that the hope and the satisfaction,
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:03.000]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.680]   and the fulfillment and the assurance,
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:07.600]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:09.960]   that I had when I claimed God's promises
[00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:11.440]   in the Bible as my own,
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:15.360]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:18.960]   cannot be replaced with anything in this life.
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:22.880]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:26.960]   I'd rather be a persecuted Christian with hope,
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:30.800]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.120]   than a comfortable non-believer with no hope.
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:37.760]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:39.160]   So I got a new Bible.
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:41.080]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:43.520]   In English this time, so my mom would not understand it.
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:44.360]   (audience laughing)
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:46.360]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:48.720]   And I continued to read the Bible in secret
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:50.400]   for the rest of my stay in Baghdad.
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:53.960]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:57.720]   My biggest discouragement was that it would take me 12 years
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:00.800]   going to every single church building in Baghdad
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:02.680]   trying to get baptized in faith.
[00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:06.600]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:15.720]   I finished school in 2000.
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:19.840]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:23.200]   Finished my service as a Republican guard in 2002.
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:27.120]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:29.480]   America invaded Iraq in 2003.
[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:33.120]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:34.520]   We started to have the internet
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:36.880]   and we started to be open to the outside world.
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:41.200]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:44.840]   I would go online and download sermons and Christian songs
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:46.560]   and upload them to my MP3 player
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:48.520]   and listen to them on my way to work every day
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:50.160]   and read the passage from the Bible.
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:54.080]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:59.160]   Until that one morning in 2009.
[00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:01.120]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:04.520]   When my workplace, the Iraqi Department of Public Works.
[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:08.920]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:10.760]   Was rocked by a truck bomb.
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:13.800]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:17.120]   I was in the staircase, I came out of it without a scratch.
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:21.040]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:24.080]   We moved to a substitute building
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:25.720]   in another neighborhood in Baghdad.
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:29.640]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:33.600]   That building had an internet cafe next to it.
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:37.680]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:40.800]   One afternoon I signed up for a free Bible study.
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:44.720]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:47.720]   And that's when everything started to change.
[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:51.240]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:53.920]   A woman was assigned to grade my Bible tests.
[00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:57.840]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:04.240]   She asked me in her first email if I had any prayer requests.
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:08.240]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.760]   I said, "Would you please pray that I can get baptized?
[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:12.640]   "I've been a believer for 12 years already."
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:17.160]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:18.720]   And would you please pray that I can live
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:20.480]   in a Christian-friendly community
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:22.000]   where I can say Jesus is Lord
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.640]   without getting killed right on the spot.
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:27.560]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:35.080]   That same day I came across a free book called Bible Basics.
[00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:39.560]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:42.800]   Written by a British man who had a ministry in Latvia.
[00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:46.720]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:53.160]   I ordered a free copy of that book.
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:57.240]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:59.840]   He ended up coming to Iraq and baptizing me
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:02.480]   in a bathtub in Kurdistan, Northern Iraq.
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:06.400]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:13.040]   The woman that used to grade my Bible tests
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:15.560]   was a caregiver for a quadriplegic man
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:18.280]   in a Christian man's house in Pennsylvania.
[00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:22.200]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:25.040]   The Christian man told her if that Iraqi plans
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:27.080]   to come over here, he can stay with us.
[00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:31.160]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:37.880]   A few weeks later, the American embassy in Baghdad
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:39.960]   started issuing visas for Iraqis
[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:41.840]   for the first time in 20 years.
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:45.760]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:49.680]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:58.400]   So I applied for the visa.
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:00.240]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:01.520]   Bought the plane ticket.
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:03.120]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:04.280]   Packed one bag.
[00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:05.640]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:07.560]   Said the final goodbyes to my family.
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:10.640]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:12.960]   Flew all the way from Baghdad to New York City.
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:16.440]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:18.320]   Came to this nation with one bag.
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:20.800]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:23.320]   With only enough money to survive for weeks.
[00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:26.760]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:29.440]   And with one contact, a poor woman in the Amish country.
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:33.360]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:39.560]   One Christian man there heard my story.
[00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:42.920]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:46.480]   He had me speaking in his church in Pennsylvania.
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:50.280]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:52.760]   The preacher of which turned out to be a graduate
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:54.760]   from the school I eventually ended up going to.
[00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:58.680]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:03.840]   He raised support money for me to go to school
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:06.120]   on the time I ran out of the last dollar
[00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:07.320]   that I brought with me from Iraq.
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:11.240]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:15.560]   I finished school and moved to the Detroit area.
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:19.400]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:21.240]   Back to the Muslim community,
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:22.880]   the same community I escaped from.
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:27.320]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:31.200]   Eight years ago, I used to hide my faith to stay alive.
[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:35.120]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:39.880]   And today, I share my faith to make a living.
[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:43.800]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:47.640]   Once again, appreciate your invitation.
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:49.320]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:51.160]   And your time and thank you and God bless.
[00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:53.000]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.760]   (audience applauding)
[00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:55.800]   Thank you very much.
[00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:59.040]   Well, we still have five minutes
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:02.000]   and maybe there are some questions from the congregation
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.960]   and we wanna ask you or you wanna answer
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:05.800]   if you have an answer.
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:06.800]   I am all yours.
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:07.880]   (audience laughing)
[00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:09.440]   Do you guys have any questions?
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:11.080]   Yes, ma'am.
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:12.440]   - Oh, Emily, please get a mic.
[00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:16.360]   - Can you tell us how bad they would treat Christian
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:19.760]   back in like Iran or Baghdad that you used to,
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:20.920]   well, before you leave?
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:24.040]   - There is much more to,
[00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:27.040]   well, they are persecuting Christians in Baghdad
[00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:28.320]   that you would know.
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:31.560]   Okay, learn the basic facts first.
[00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:33.400]   When I was born and raised,
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:34.800]   that was under Saddam Hussein
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:36.800]   who was a member of the Ba'ath Party
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:39.360]   that was established by a Greek Orthodox Christian.
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:41.760]   The Iraqi Prime Minister,
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:44.680]   the international face of Iraq, Tariq Aziz,
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:45.920]   was a Catholic Christian.
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:49.400]   And so there has not been any persecution
[00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:52.280]   on a religious basis under Saddam Hussein.
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:55.720]   Now, after Saddam Hussein,
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:58.880]   we still have a civil constitution
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:01.200]   and we still have a lot of Christians.
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:03.640]   In fact, my boss in Baghdad when I was an engineer
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:04.920]   was a Catholic woman,
[00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:07.920]   but the government is not strong enough
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:09.440]   to impose law and order.
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:14.520]   When a car bomb explodes in an Iraqi marketplace
[00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:17.280]   and kills 99 Muslims and one Christian,
[00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:20.160]   that story will be reported somewhere
[00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:23.720]   as a Muslim persecuting Christians.
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:25.520]   I think there is much more to the stories
[00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:27.600]   that you can hear, at least from Baghdad,
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:29.560]   from what I saw in Baghdad,
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:31.720]   than what you see from your end.
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:34.800]   Christians are being persecuted everywhere
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:37.520]   and more severely in the Muslim countries
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:38.680]   than here in the United States,
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:40.480]   but there is much more to the story.
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:44.000]   - Any other questions?
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.640]   (audience laughing)
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:47.880]   How many-- - Yes, ma'am.
[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:48.720]   - Oh, sorry.
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:53.200]   - I'm interested to know how did you tell your mom
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:55.760]   and your family when you leave the country?
[00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:56.600]   - Okay.
[00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:59.280]   Good question.
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:04.040]   My mom first did not take me seriously.
[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:07.800]   Then she took me seriously and she was really sad.
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:09.960]   Then right before I left, she said,
[00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:11.440]   "I know that you are doing the right thing,
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:13.120]   "but promise me one thing.
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:15.440]   "You do not join a drug dealing gang."
[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:17.640]   (audience laughing)
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:20.320]   So that's the only thing she knew about America.
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:22.040]   I said, "No, Mom, I'm not gonna do that.
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:23.360]   "I would never do that."
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:28.320]   Unfortunately, things in Iraq started to go
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:30.160]   from bad to worse at that time.
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:32.080]   It's not as bad anymore.
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:35.200]   So ISIS came into the scene and more people got killed.
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:38.000]   And my mom eventually said, "You have always been wise.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.400]   "I have never told you that,
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:41.240]   "but I knew that you were doing the right thing."
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:43.360]   My whole family knows about my conversion
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:45.480]   and my work now and they are fine with it.
[00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:48.080]   In fact, the first book that I wrote,
[00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:51.120]   the book that exposes Islam, actually that's the second book.
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:52.880]   The first book is "Islam in Christ's Eyes."
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:55.680]   I told my mom, "I wrote a book that exposes your faith
[00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:58.280]   "as bad and false and I dedicate it to you."
[00:34:58.280 --> 00:34:59.640]   She said, "I'm proud of you."
[00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:02.640]   (audience laughing)
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:08.080]   - Right there, Steve.
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:08.920]   - Sir.
[00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:09.760]   - Can I get a mic?
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:11.880]   - You made your mom change her view.
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:12.720]   - Time.
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:13.560]   - Time?
[00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:14.680]   - Yeah, you only have one chance
[00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:16.520]   to offend somebody with the gospel message.
[00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:18.480]   Two decades later, no one really cares.
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:19.480]   (audience laughing)
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:20.600]   - So you cast the bombardment
[00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:22.920]   of the gospel message, basically?
[00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:26.240]   - Well, no, my family are still all devout Muslims.
[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:31.240]   And yeah, I mean, to be tolerant and receptive
[00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:33.200]   and respectful is one thing.
[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:36.040]   To, for their hearts to be convicted of their sin
[00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:38.640]   and for them to really feel that they need a savior,
[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:39.940]   that is a different thing.
[00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:43.000]   It's always harder with the family.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.520]   I mean, when I first started to tell my mom about the gospel
[00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:49.320]   she told me, "Are you saying that you are right
[00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:51.600]   "and this whole world is wrong?"
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:54.080]   To her, the whole world is Islam.
[00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:58.680]   And so, yeah, I mean, it took time.
[00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:00.120]   That's the only thing.
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:00.960]   Yeah.
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:02.320]   - Well, as I said in the introduction,
[00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:05.160]   we have some friends or neighbors or co-workers
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:07.440]   who are in the Islamic faith.
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:11.180]   We are Christians and what are the pointers
[00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:14.120]   that you can share with us, how to share the faith,
[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:15.880]   how to connect with a Muslim neighbor?
[00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:20.040]   - Okay, long story short, show them the love of Christ
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:23.360]   before you show them the truth of his gospel.
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:25.760]   'Cause people are interested in what is beautiful first
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:28.400]   and then what is good and then what is true.
[00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:31.760]   I have a whole course on that called Islam in Christ's Eyes
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:35.040]   that starts with, see, when you preach the gospel to anyone
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:37.560]   you will have to start where they are at now.
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:41.680]   And so what Muslims believe now and where to start,
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:44.320]   the theology of Islam explains the element
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:46.340]   of the Islamic faith, I talk about that.
[00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:48.400]   And to understand how things ended up
[00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:50.640]   the way they are at now in the Muslim world,
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:54.000]   you will have to have a basic exposure
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.480]   to the history of Islam.
[00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:58.440]   So history and then theology and then how to preach
[00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:00.480]   the gospel to Muslims, this all is a course
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:01.840]   that is called Islam in Christ's Eyes
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:05.560]   that I'm giving now in, what's the name of the congregation,
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:07.960]   the other Chinese congregation that I'm talking to?
[00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:09.760]   They have the name in Chinese characters,
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:11.000]   I have no idea. (audience laughing)
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.400]   And they gave me a ride here and a ride there.
[00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:18.400]   And so, before you share the gospel,
[00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:21.840]   okay, before you ask how can I share the gospel,
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:24.000]   you will have to ask an equally important,
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   if not a more important question,
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.320]   why should I share the gospel with them?
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:31.480]   What is the motive when you want to share the gospel?
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:34.080]   What is the proper motive if you wanted to share the gospel
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:35.600]   with your non-Christian neighbor?
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:36.840]   Here is the right motive.
[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:40.000]   When you share the gospel with your neighbor,
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.600]   Muslim or non-Muslim, remember that if they responded
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:47.760]   to that message of salvation,
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:50.440]   you will be stuck with them for all the eternity.
[00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:54.240]   Is this what you really want or not?
[00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:57.520]   If you don't love them that much,
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:00.160]   if you cannot stand seeing them in your neighborhood,
[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:02.000]   don't you dare preach the gospel to them.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.040]   Move on and preach the gospel to somebody else
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:05.360]   that you really like.
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:08.200]   So start with the proper motive first,
[00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:11.640]   and then the means, and then the opportunity.
[00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:14.840]   And no, we are not trying to murder anybody here.
[00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:17.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.400]   - All right, so let's give a round of applause to Wissam.
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:21.240]   - Thank you.
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:22.440]   - Why don't we pray together?
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:23.280]   - Sure, please.
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:25.480]   - We pray for his ministry in Michigan.
[00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:29.040]   We also pray for more Arab people coming to Christ.
[00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:29.880]   - Thank you.
[00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:30.800]   - All right, let's pray.
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:32.120]   Father God, we just want to give you thanks
[00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:35.600]   because you are the God of the whole world,
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:39.640]   and you love every one of us with grace,
[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:41.760]   and with love, and with beauty.
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:42.960]   We pray for Wissam.
[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:47.560]   We praise you for how you have led him to come to Christ,
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:49.360]   to come to know the gospel,
[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:52.240]   and come to the United States to start the ministry,
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:57.240]   to preach Christ to many Muslims in his neighborhood.
[00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:59.800]   We just pray that you will continue to use him,
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:02.920]   use his story, use his experience, his knowledge,
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:07.600]   to bring many to Christ, for your glory.
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:11.520]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:15.440]   (speaking in foreign language)

[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:23.280]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:48.120]   - Amen.
[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:48.960]   - Thank you very much.
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:49.800]   - I appreciate that, thank you.
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:52.880]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:53.720]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:54.560]   (audience laughing)
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:55.400]   - Oh, wow.
[00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:56.240]   - That's right.
[00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:57.080]   - Is that all the Chinese you can speak?
[00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:58.360]   (audience laughing)
[00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:00.720]   - Yeah, and I got that from Brush Hour.
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:01.560]   - All right, so.
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:05.400]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:07.440]   Islam in Christ's Eyes.

[00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:12.520]   I am a Christian.
