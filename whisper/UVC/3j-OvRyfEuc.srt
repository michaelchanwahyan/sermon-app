1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 Hey family, as always I am praying for you. I hope that you're warm and safe this week and

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,280
 enjoying the winter. If you're someone who likes to get out in the weather and enjoy the snow,

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:17,960
 then I hope you're doing that. If you just like to stay in and stay warm and sit by the fireplace and read or

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:24,240
 get on the couch and and watch a movie that you love, then I hope you're enjoying that. I hope that you're

5
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:32,160
 feeling well and being safe and warm even during this cold time. I also want to wish you a very happy

6
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,960
 Lunar New Year. I know all of the holidays have been so different this year

7
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,080
 because we're not able to gather together in the way that we normally would.

8
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:47,760
 But I hope that you are enjoying this time and that you're able to connect with family and friends, even if it's only virtually.

9
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,180
 Hope that you're able to connect with the people that you love and to share

10
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:57,820
 with them how much you love them and how grateful you are for their presence in your lives. And also hope that you're able to just

11
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:03,680
 enjoy celebrating and looking forward to the next year and what it could mean for us.

12
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,400
 I hope that however you're celebrating the Spring Festival this year, I hope that it's joyful and

13
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,440
 encouraging and a blessed time for you and for the people you love.

14
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:19,240
 Valentine's Day too, if you're celebrating that, I hope that you're enjoying that, celebrating that with someone that you love as well.

15
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:26,520
 And I want to remind you as always to connect with us. You can send us an email at info@urbanvoicechurch.com.

16
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,520
 We'd love to hear from you all.

17
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:35,760
 But today we're going to be looking again in Matthew chapter 6, still looking at these kingdom values, and we're finishing up

18
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:43,080
 the topic of anxiety. We've been talking about this for a few weeks now. So let's look at Matthew chapter 6 verse 25 here.

19
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,520
 We're going to read all the way down to verse 34. It says this,

20
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:53,600
 "Therefore I tell you do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body,

21
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,720
 what you will put on. Is not life more than food and the body more than clothing?

22
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,680
 Look at the birds of the air.

23
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,840
 They neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns and yet your heavenly Father feeds them.

24
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:11,400
 Are you not of more value than they? And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to the span of

25
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,520
 life? And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow.

26
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,320
 They neither toil nor spin, yet I tell you even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.

27
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:27,640
 But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven,

28
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,160
 will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?

29
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:36,520
 Therefore do not be anxious saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?'

30
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,320
 For the Gentiles seek after these things and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all.

31
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,280
 But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things will be added to you.

32
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,640
 Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself.

33
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,000
 Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,200
 As we talked about

35
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,960
 anxiety over the past few weeks, we talked about the fact that

36
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:04,400
 Jesus is not telling us here to be naive or out of touch with reality.

37
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,560
 He understands that our life is going to involve trouble and difficulty and challenges.

38
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,920
 We live in a broken and fallen world and

39
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:20,320
 he understands that we are going to be aware of those things and even concerned about them. And that's okay. That's actually healthy.

40
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,640
 We need to be aware and concerned of those challenges of life.

41
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:28,280
 But Jesus doesn't want that awareness and concern to grow into something

42
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:33,240
 that damages us and that causes us to to make unhealthy decisions.

43
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:37,160
 And that's one of the big things that we see a lot of times when we are

44
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,800
 trapped by worry and fear and anxiety.

45
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:48,040
 I've been there in my life and maybe you've been there or seen someone who was there in their life. When we begin to

46
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:54,560
 get anxious and worried and fearful, we begin to make unhealthy decisions that we would not

47
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,040
 make otherwise. And those decisions can be damaging to us or to the people around us

48
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:08,160
 because they're motivated by fear and they're motivated by our worry. And that fear and worry can cause us to do some really

49
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:13,480
 even uncharacteristic things. It can cause us to do some strange things that just

50
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:18,680
 are not what God has for us. And that's one of the reasons that Jesus is

51
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,800
 calling us out here and saying, "I don't want you to live in anxiety

52
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,240
 because I don't want you to to be motivated by fear.

53
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,440
 I don't want you to make decisions and do unhealthy things in your life that come about because of

54
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:37,600
 your fear and your worry." And in these verses, Jesus is lovingly acknowledging our need and our weakness.

55
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,040
 And he's saying, "Hey, I get it. I get that you get afraid. I get that you worry."

56
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,960
 There's so much beauty and love in the fact that Jesus is talking about this with us.

57
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:52,080
 And he's getting in the middle of our struggle and our mess and he's loving on us and I appreciate that so much.

58
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:58,320
 But he's also showing in these verses that his desire for us is not to get stuck in anxiety and fear and worry.

59
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,440
 His desire for us is not to be under bondage to it and not to be

60
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,360
 crushed by it. That's not what he has for us.

61
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,480
 It may be a lifelong challenge for us,

62
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:14,840
 but he wants us to experience freedom and healing as we go through life and even victory in this area of our life.

63
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,920
 And

64
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,560
 Jesus is pointing us to the fact that he

65
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:26,040
 cares for our physical needs and he cares for our emotional and spiritual needs and he cares about the things that are

66
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:32,840
 beyond our control even. We see this in these verses. Jesus is saying, "Look, I know you have stuff that worries you.

67
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,440
 I know you worry about the stuff that you need and I care about that.

68
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:42,800
 I know that you worry about things that happen that are hurtful or harmful or difficult and you have no control over them

69
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,100
 and I care about that." I think there's such a loving heart here

70
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:54,560
 that's displayed in these verses and we talked about how as we move away from anxiety, we need to change our focus.

71
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:01,980
 We need to let that change in focus bring about a change in perspective and we need to grow in our trust of Jesus.

72
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:07,600
 And what I want us to see this week is that Jesus is really telling us to pursue

73
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,940
 the heavenly kingdom and leave the rest to him. We can see this in verse 30.

74
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:19,120
 It says this, "But if God so clothes the grass of the field which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not

75
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,560
 much more clothe you, O you of little faith?"

76
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:28,280
 He's saying, "Look, God is caring for nature and God will much more care for you.

77
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:33,240
 So have faith. Keep your focus in the right place. Keep your eyes on the heavenly kingdom."

78
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:42,020
 And in verse 32, he says this, "For the Gentiles seek all after all these things and your heavenly father knows that you need them all."

79
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,680
 Jesus is drawing this contrast when he uses that word Gentiles.

80
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,680
 He's talking about the people who are outside the kingdom of God, the people who don't believe.

81
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,480
 And he's saying, "Look, the people who are outside the kingdom,

82
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,260
 they're the ones who get so worried about all this stuff.

83
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:05,240
 They're the ones who are really focused on their food and their clothing and those are huge issues to them."

84
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,060
 And for us in the modern world, we could add some things to that, right?

85
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:15,560
 We could say it's the people outside the kingdom who we expect to be focused on materialism and wealth

86
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:22,120
 and all of those physical things and status and prestige and what kind of house you live in

87
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:28,400
 and what kind of car you drive and your image on the internet and what kind of meals you're eating

88
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:35,400
 and do people think you're cool or do people think you're good or do people think you're concerned about the right issue socially

89
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,120
 or that your politics are in the right place.

90
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:43,360
 All of those things that get so wrapped up in who we are as people,

91
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,080
 those are the things that people outside the kingdom of God care about.

92
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,480
 Why do they care so much about those things? Because that's all they have.

93
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:54,480
 They don't know the kingdom of God. They don't know the deeper reality of God's truth.

94
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:59,280
 And so all they have is the physical material things that are right in front of them.

95
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,120
 All they have is their status or how other people feel about them.

96
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,720
 All they have is the opinion of someone else.

97
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,400
 All they have is the attention and adoration of someone else and that's it.

98
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:17,440
 But Jesus is saying, "Look, it shouldn't be that way for you because you have a different perspective.

99
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,160
 You know the kingdom of heaven.

100
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:27,440
 You should be pursuing the heavenly kingdom and leaving the rest to God."

101
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:34,560
 In verse 33, Jesus says this very clearly, very plainly, and very profoundly.

102
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:42,240
 He says, "But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you."

103
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:48,320
 That is one of the most powerful and profound verses in the Sermon on the Mount.

104
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,760
 Jesus is saying, "Look, if you will pursue the values of the kingdom,

105
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,640
 if you will pursue rightness with God, and His righteousness."

106
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,040
 That word righteousness means living a life that is right with God,

107
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,080
 living in a way that is pleasing to God, living in a way that is obedient to God.

108
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,840
 If you will pursue the values of the kingdom, if you will pursue a life that is right with God,

109
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:20,480
 if you will seek to obey Him in your life, then God will add in all the rest.

110
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:26,400
 All those things we just talked about that are important to us as humans, God will add them in.

111
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,240
 God will take care of our physical needs.

112
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,800
 He'll make sure we have enough to eat and enough to wear.

113
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,200
 He'll make sure we have a place to live, and He'll make sure we have transportation.

114
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,400
 He will even make sure that we have relationships with other people that are healthy.

115
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:50,080
 God will add in all of those things if we will simply pursue His kingdom and the values of His kingdom.

116
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,480
 God will take care of the rest, and that's what Jesus is pointing us to in this verse.

117
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:00,240
 And Jesus is also reminding us here to take our hands off of what we can't control.

118
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,080
 Verse 34 is another verse that is just so profound and so powerful.

119
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:10,880
 It says this, "Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself.

120
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,680
 Sufficient for the day is its own trouble."

121
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,440
 I love that verse.

122
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,920
 Jesus is saying, "Why would you be worried about what's going to happen next week, or next year,

123
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:30,320
 or five years from now, because you have no control over next week, or next year, or five years from now.

124
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,320
 You can't do anything about it.

125
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,400
 And by the time you get to next week, and next year, and five years from now,

126
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:41,920
 you'll have a whole new set of circumstances, and a whole new set of problems probably,

127
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,320
 that you don't even know about right now.

128
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,800
 So why try to figure all that out and worry about that now?

129
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,120
 That day is going to have its own trouble.

130
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,480
 It's going to have its own issues to deal with.

131
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:00,000
 For today, you should simply trust and walk with God, and let Him be at work in your life,

132
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,600
 and let Him bring you peace, and comfort, and joy.

133
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:10,160
 And you can worry about next week, and next year, and five years from now, when you get there.

134
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,560
 Now Jesus is not saying that we shouldn't plan, or we shouldn't prepare for things in our life.

135
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,360
 There's other passages of Scripture that talk about that.

136
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,880
 That's something that we're supposed to do.

137
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,840
 That's a healthy thing for us to plan and prepare.

138
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,840
 But even as we plan and prepare, if we are followers of Jesus,

139
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:30,640
 we should do that with an understanding that anything could change.

140
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,760
 We should hold loosely to our plans and our preparations.

141
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,200
 We should understand that, "Okay, this is what I might like to do.

142
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,360
 This is what I might plan to do.

143
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,480
 But this could change.

144
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,320
 God could change the course of my life.

145
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,520
 God could change where I'm headed.

146
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,320
 God could change what's happening in my life."

147
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,200
 Or something else could happen, something external that's beyond my control could happen,

148
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,600
 that God might allow to come into my life, that might be difficult or challenging.

149
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:01,520
 So it may end up being completely different than what I want it to be.

150
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,120
 And that's okay.

151
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,920
 As believers, we can plan and prepare, but we need to hold very loosely to those things.

152
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,960
 Take our hands off of what we can't control,

153
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:15,840
 and stop being anxious about the future when we have no control over that.

154
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:22,640
 When I was a young man, I had a lot of plans for my future in terms of career and education

155
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,600
 and all these things.

156
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,200
 And God changed those as I went along.

157
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,680
 When I was an undergrad, I was planning to go on to grad school

158
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,280
 and to pursue a career in science, and God changed that.

159
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:41,200
 And I ended up going to grad school and pursuing a degree in divinity,

160
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,880
 and then going into the ministry.

161
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,640
 And at the time when I was going into those things,

162
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,800
 when I was in high school and the first few years of college,

163
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,040
 if you would have described to me my life now,

164
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,520
 I would have said, "That doesn't make any sense.

165
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,280
 I don't think that I would ever live that life."

166
00:12:55,280 --> 00:13:00,560
 But now looking back, I can see how good it's been for me,

167
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,800
 and how God has been good every step of the way,

168
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,520
 and how all the things that God has brought into my life,

169
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,160
 the relationships and the work that He's given me,

170
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,880
 and the ministry that He's given me, has all been so good for me.

171
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,800
 And I wouldn't want to change anything.

172
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:19,120
 But when I was a young man looking forward, I never would have planned that pathway.

173
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,880
 I would have planned a completely different pathway that, to be perfectly honest,

174
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,080
 was really focused on me and was a much more selfish pathway.

175
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,440
 And to be perfectly honest, if I had lived out that pathway,

176
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,640
 I would probably be a very selfish and proud and arrogant and self-absorbed person.

177
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,320
 I'm really glad that I didn't live out that pathway.

178
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,800
 But I didn't know what was best for me.

179
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,120
 God did. God changed a lot of stuff.

180
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,560
 And so when we think about our future, we should say, "You know what?

181
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,120
 Instead of trying to focus on all these things I can't control,

182
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,360
 I'm going to allow God to be in control.

183
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,600
 I may plan and prepare, but I'm going to hold loosely to those plans and preparations,

184
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,760
 and I'm going to let God do what's best in my life,

185
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,760
 because He knows what's best for me.

186
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,360
 He sees things that are coming in a way that I do not see.

187
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,400
 I'm going to take my hands off and let God drive.

188
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,160
 I'm going to let Jesus take the control in my life."

189
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:19,120
 And that's really important for us, and it's a way that we can avoid a lot of anxiety.

190
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,960
 If we'll stop trying to put our hands on it and force it to work

191
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,560
 and make it work out the way we want it to, life's not like that.

192
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,400
 We can't control life.

193
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,640
 We can't just bring it all down and mold life to our will.

194
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,080
 We cannot do that.

195
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,840
 And if we'll take our hands off and say, "You know what?

196
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:42,080
 I'm going to trust the Lord to control and to work, even in the difficult moments."

197
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,600
 That's something that can relieve us of so much anxiety and give us so much peace.

198
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,240
 You know what Jesus is saying here in verses 33 and 34

199
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:56,080
 is so counterintuitive to how we feel about our circumstances.

200
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:01,520
 He's saying that as we release control and let go of our desire for control,

201
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,840
 we actually find peace.

202
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:09,600
 And that seems just backwards and upside down to our minds.

203
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,800
 When we are struggling with anxiety, a lot of times we feel like if we had more control,

204
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,920
 we would find peace.

205
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,520
 We feel like if only we had more control over that situation,

206
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,560
 only if only we had more control over our future,

207
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,480
 if only we had more control over that relationship,

208
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,400
 then we could stop worrying about it.

209
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,040
 And we feel like more control would bring us peace.

210
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:37,920
 And Jesus is saying here that actually what brings us peace is when we release

211
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,080
 and we stop trying to control everything.

212
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:47,680
 We stop trying to be in charge of it and we release and trust God and His love and care in our lives.

213
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,200
 And that also has such a powerful effect on our behavior.

214
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,920
 Like we talked about at the beginning,

215
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,120
 when we're motivated by fear and worry and anxiety,

216
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,560
 we can make really unhealthy decisions because we're being motivated from an unhealthy place.

217
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,720
 And we've experienced this in our lives.

218
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,280
 Think about it.

219
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:09,760
 Some of the worst financial decisions that you've made in your life

220
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,920
 probably came during a time of anxiety and fear.

221
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:19,440
 And that anxiety and fear motivated you to do something that was rash or impulsive

222
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,120
 or just wasn't a good idea.

223
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,680
 Something that maybe you never would have done otherwise.

224
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,000
 And it ended up being unhealthy for you.

225
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,040
 The same is true in our relationships.

226
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:34,720
 When we get anxious about a relationship and feel like we need to control that relationship more

227
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,920
 and we're motivated by fear and anxiety in that relationship,

228
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:43,120
 suddenly we become manipulative and we become difficult to interact with.

229
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,280
 And the relationship suffers because of our anxiety and our fear.

230
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,240
 So many things in our life are like that.

231
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:55,040
 We convince ourselves that it would be so much better if only we had more control.

232
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,480
 The reality is we don't control anything in our life anyway.

233
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,200
 And any control that we think we have is just an illusion.

234
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,920
 But we still think we should control it.

235
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,680
 And we still want to control it.

236
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:11,600
 But the truth is that when we release that control and say,

237
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,280
 "God, I can't do this. I can't make it happen.

238
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,760
 I don't want to act out of fear of what might go wrong or what could happen.

239
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:25,280
 I want to trust you and trust your goodness and trust your love and your care for me."

240
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:32,560
 When we begin to relate to our life and our circumstances and our relationships and our future

241
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:39,440
 and all the needs that we have from that place, that's when we really do experience peace.

242
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:44,320
 Peace comes through release, through letting go of those things,

243
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,720
 not through grasping for more control.

244
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,240
 And in verse 33 here, I love this verse,

245
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,200
 "But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness,

246
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,520
 and all these things will be added to you."

247
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,200
 Jesus is calling us to loyalty to kingdom priorities.

248
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,600
 You know, we talked about in the verses that precede this section on anxiety,

249
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,040
 where Jesus is talking about our focus.

250
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:12,880
 We talked about how Jesus in those verses was calling us to loyalty to kingdom values.

251
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,080
 And Jesus wanted us to be loyal to the values of the kingdom

252
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,800
 and to seek to live those out and to be obedient to God.

253
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:26,000
 And in this section, Jesus is calling us to loyalty to kingdom priorities.

254
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,680
 He's saying, "Okay, if these values are what you value in your life,

255
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,400
 if you value the things that are important to God,

256
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,920
 then your priorities, the things that you organize your life around,

257
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,600
 the things that you say, 'This is number one and this is number two and this is number three,'

258
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,960
 will reflect those values of the kingdom."

259
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,560
 And that's what Jesus is saying to us in Matthew 6, verse 33.

260
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:51,680
 "Seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you."

261
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:55,200
 That's a fair question to say, "Well, what is the kingdom of God and his righteousness?

262
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,320
 What are those kingdom priorities?"

263
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,320
 Well, what do we know from Scripture?

264
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:06,000
 Jesus told us that the first commandment is to love God with all of our heart and soul and strength.

265
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,520
 And the second is to love our neighbor as ourself.

266
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,000
 And that those two commandments, if we would really live them out,

267
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:20,800
 that that would basically encompass all of the law and all of God's instructions to us in the Old Testament.

268
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:27,200
 So that's a great starting place to say, "Okay, if I want to be loyal to kingdom priorities,

269
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,200
 then the number one thing in my life is God and my relationship to him.

270
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,000
 And I want to love him with everything that I have.

271
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,880
 I want to love him with my mind. I want to love him with my heart.

272
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,480
 I want to love him with my will and my choices and my obedience.

273
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,040
 I want to love him with all of the whole of who I am as a person.

274
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,280
 I want all of that to holistically love God.

275
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:53,440
 And then out of that love for God, I want to love others.

276
00:19:53,440 --> 00:20:02,240
 I want to love my family, my siblings, or my parents, or my spouse if you're married,

277
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,920
 or my children if you have children.

278
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:09,520
 Or I want to love my friends, the relationships that God has brought into my life,

279
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,960
 these people that God has allowed me to have relationship with.

280
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,800
 I want to love my co-workers. I want to love the people that I go to school with.

281
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,560
 I want to love the people at my church.

282
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,760
 I want to love the people in my community, in my neighborhood.

283
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:26,880
 I want to love people who have needs in my community, in my neighborhood, that I can serve and care for.

284
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:33,360
 Though that is a kingdom priority, and to say that is more important,

285
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:39,760
 loving others is more important than me getting rich, or than me being comfortable,

286
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:47,040
 or than me stacking up a lot of possessions, or than me having an image of being some amazing person

287
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:52,720
 through my social media accounts, or than me feeling good about myself

288
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,840
 because I'm trying to do things to impress other people or to perform to some standard.

289
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,640
 It's more important for me to love others.

290
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,280
 It's more important for me, as Jesus said, to lay down my life for someone else.

291
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,840
 Remember, Jesus said that greater love has no one than this,

292
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,200
 than to lay down your life for your friends.

293
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:18,800
 It's more important for me to sacrifice for someone else than to just seek my own good,

294
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,520
 and my own wants, and my own desires.

295
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:27,200
 That's what it looks like to have loyalty to kingdom priorities.

296
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,160
 And that's what Jesus is calling us to in this verse.

297
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:35,120
 He's saying, "Look, if you will seek the kingdom of God first,

298
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:40,400
 if your loyalty will be towards the things that are important to God,

299
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,320
 and you will order your life in that way,

300
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,880
 if you will say, 'First and foremost, it's about loving God and my relationship to Him,

301
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:52,080
 and secondly, I'm going to love others, and other things are going to fall in behind that,'"

302
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,240
 Jesus is saying, "Then God will add in everything else you will need,

303
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,800
 and you can finally stop being anxious,

304
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,880
 because you won't have to worry about the future.

305
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,880
 You won't have to say, 'Well, is God going to take care of me?'"

306
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:12,400
 Because you will be so in love with God, and so caught up in your relationship to Him,

307
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,640
 that you will know that His presence is what sustains you,

308
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,240
 and what encourages you, and what gives you joy and peace,

309
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,360
 whether the future is good,

310
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,400
 or whether the future is something that you might think of as bad.

311
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:32,160
 You can say, "You know what? I'm going to enjoy God's presence in my relationship with Him

312
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,560
 if I'm healthy, or if I'm sick.

313
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:38,880
 I'm going to enjoy my relationship with God and His presence in my life

314
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,760
 if I'm rich, or if I'm poor.

315
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,400
 I'm going to enjoy my relationship with God and His presence in my life

316
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,960
 if I'm in a place of comfort, or a place of discomfort."

317
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,040
 And that is the testimony of Christianity throughout the ages.

318
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:59,040
 There have been so many people in the history of Christianity

319
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,320
 who have lived and been imprisoned for their faith,

320
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:07,200
 or been persecuted, or even tortured or killed because they believed in Jesus,

321
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,840
 and yet in the midst of that, they were joyful,

322
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,640
 and they were full of peace and full of comfort.

323
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,600
 That makes no sense, but it's because their priority was on loving God,

324
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,240
 and they were so caught up in their relationship to Him,

325
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,080
 that the earthly and physical realities didn't bother them anymore,

326
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,840
 and they had peace and comfort in the midst of something difficult,

327
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,240
 and uncomfortable, and painful.

328
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,120
 And all of us can experience that.

329
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,080
 We can experience that, whether things are good or bad.

330
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,680
 We can find peace and comfort and joy in life.

331
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:43,840
 And we can learn to love others, whether things are good or bad.

332
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,640
 Most of us as humans, we love others conditionally,

333
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,520
 and when we feel good, and when someone else is making us feel good,

334
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,760
 then we love them back, and we treat them kindly.

335
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,120
 If they're nice to us, then we're nice to them, and we all get along.

336
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,880
 But if someone's unkind to us, then of course we're not going to be kind to them.

337
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,960
 And if things are not going well in our life,

338
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,720
 then we're going to be grouchy and cranky, and we're going to snap at other people.

339
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:10,160
 And Jesus is saying that if we will have loyalty to kingdom priorities,

340
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,920
 and say, "I'm going to love others, regardless of my circumstances,

341
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,040
 even if I'm mistreated, or even if I'm going through something difficult,

342
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,640
 I'm still going to love others,"

343
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:24,080
 that we will experience God's goodness, and we will experience God's peace.

344
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,440
 And we will not be so worried and anxious about what's going on.

345
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,440
 And God will add those other things that we need into our life.

346
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,400
 So I want to close out this study we've been doing on anxiety

347
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:43,360
 by just asking you to think about what it is that brings you anxiety.

348
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,480
 And this is a question for me too. I grapple with this as well.

349
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,720
 And I want to point you to the fact that whatever it is, God is bigger.

350
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,680
 God's love is stronger.

351
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,480
 God's grace is deeper.

352
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,960
 God's power is greater.

353
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,040
 And if you're having trouble believing that right now,

354
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:07,680
 if the problem, if the obstacle seems bigger than anything else,

355
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,640
 then I want to point you back to Scripture.

356
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,040
 Go back to God's truth.

357
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,560
 The Scripture tells us God's truth about reality as it really is,

358
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:22,320
 and about who we really are, and about the way the world really is.

359
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,560
 Look at that and see what it says about you.

360
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:29,600
 See what it says about your circumstances, and bring that into your situation.

361
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,440
 So if you're anxious, and you're worried, and you're afraid,

362
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,520
 because of your past, maybe something that you've done,

363
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,120
 or something that's been done to you,

364
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:43,600
 and you feel like you can't get over it, you feel like you can't recover from it,

365
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,400
 you feel like you can't be forgiven, or you can't be clean,

366
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,160
 or you can't get free from it, or you'll never get over it or get past it,

367
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,040
 let me tell you what the Scripture says.

368
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:57,680
 The Scripture says that God's grace is greater, and deeper,

369
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:01,360
 and stronger than anything that we've gone through.

370
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,920
 Whether it was created by our own sin, or created by someone else's sin,

371
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:09,920
 someone who harmed us in some way, God's grace is greater.

372
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,880
 And healing, and freedom, and victory is possible because of Jesus.

373
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,080
 That's what the Scripture says.

374
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:21,600
 If you're anxious, and worried, and fearful because of your future,

375
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,640
 and you think about things in your life that you want to happen,

376
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,040
 and you're afraid that they might not work out,

377
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,880
 and they might not go well for you,

378
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,640
 and they might not end up being what you need, or what you want in your life,

379
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,480
 look at the Scripture.

380
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,280
 What does God say?

381
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,360
 What does Jesus say right in this passage?

382
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,400
 That God's love and care is complete and all-encompassing,

383
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,080
 even for the smallest animals and for the flowers of the field.

384
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:52,000
 And if God is that good to them, you matter much more to God.

385
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,280
 And He will be much better to you.

386
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,040
 He will care for you.

387
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,080
 He will love you.

388
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,040
 He will protect you.

389
00:26:59,040 --> 00:26:59,920
 He will guide you.

390
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,960
 He will be with you.

391
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,680
 And even the difficult things that He allows to come into your life

392
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:09,040
 will be for your good to strengthen you, to grow you,

393
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,440
 to make you more like Jesus,

394
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,600
 and to bring about God's glory in your life.

395
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,440
 Maybe you're anxious, or worried, or afraid

396
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,200
 because of relationships in your life,

397
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,560
 and things that you feel like are not going well,

398
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,920
 and they're beyond your control.

399
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,160
 What does the Scripture say about that?

400
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:30,080
 The Scripture says that God is able to change any heart.

401
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,960
 God is able to transform any situation.

402
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,440
 God is able to defend people, even from lies and false accusations.

403
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,600
 God is able to protect people,

404
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,160
 even from people who are out to do evil

405
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,400
 and who are intentionally trying to harm someone else.

406
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,920
 Whatever you're dealing with in your relationships,

407
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,720
 God has the power to bring healing.

408
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,160
 God has the power to protect you.

409
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,680
 God has the power to restore.

410
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,000
 God has the power to fix it.

411
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,720
 And God wants to do that.

412
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,760
 You can trust Him.

413
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,360
 Maybe you're anxious, and afraid, and worried

414
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,880
 because you look at the world around us

415
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,200
 and you see all of the mess.

416
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,280
 Maybe it's the COVID-19 pandemic,

417
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,320
 or maybe it's political unrest and turmoil,

418
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,160
 or maybe it's injustice,

419
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,040
 or maybe it's just things that go on

420
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,240
 in different parts of the world

421
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,440
 that you care about, but you can't fix them.

422
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,320
 You can't change them.

423
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,680
 You can't do anything about them.

424
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:29,120
 What does the Scripture say about those things?

425
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,040
 The Scripture says that God holds the world in His hands,

426
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,680
 that God laughs at the nations

427
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,360
 because they're so weak before Him,

428
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,800
 and that men make their plans,

429
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,120
 and even evil men, and government leaders,

430
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,840
 and people in positions of power make their plans.

431
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,320
 But ultimately, God rules over it all.

432
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,480
 And God is a God of love, and care, and justice,

433
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,800
 and commitment to His people.

434
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,080
 And so God takes His people safely

435
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,920
 through all of the turmoil, all of the circumstances,

436
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,680
 all of the plagues, and pestilence,

437
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,280
 and everything that happens.

438
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,560
 That's what the Scripture says.

439
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,600
 Whatever it is that causes you to be afraid,

440
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,400
 causes you to worry, causes you to be anxious,

441
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,000
 God is bigger.

442
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,760
 You can take it to Him.

443
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,160
 You can pour it out before Him.

444
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,720
 You can trust Him.

445
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,600
 And I would encourage you to do that in your life.

446
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,080
 As we talked about that very first week,

447
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,000
 Jesus lays it out for us in this passage.

448
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,360
 We've got to change our focus,

449
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,160
 put our eyes on God, and how great and good He is,

450
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:33,120
 and how great His love and care is for us.

451
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,000
 Allow that change in focus

452
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,600
 to start to change our perspective,

453
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,440
 where suddenly the problems in our life

454
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,640
 are not such a big deal,

455
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,000
 and our relationship to God is what strengthens us,

456
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,760
 and anchors us, and sustains us,

457
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,120
 and gives us joy and hope,

458
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,120
 even in difficult times.

459
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,240
 And allow that change in perspective

460
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,000
 to really start us growing in trust for Jesus,

461
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,640
 and saying, "God, I see who You are.

462
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,080
 I see what You've done.

463
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,440
 And because of that,

464
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,080
 I trust that You will take care of me.

465
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,000
 I trust that You will love me.

466
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,160
 I trust that You will bring good things into my life,

467
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,280
 and not evil.

468
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:12,160
 And I trust that You will be in control of any situation,

469
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,400
 even the most difficult things in my life."

470
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,320
 And we can experience the peace,

471
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,400
 and the comfort, and the hope

472
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,080
 that God has for us

473
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,680
 when we begin to put that type of trust in Him.

474
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,960
 I'm praying for you

475
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,520
 as you walk through anxiety, and fear,

476
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,480
 and worry in your life.

477
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,600
 And you can pray for me.

478
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,440
 And I know that God wants us to find peace in Jesus.

479
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,000
 Let's pray.

480
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 God, thank You for Your truth,

481
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,840
 and for the comfort that it brings us, God.

482
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,160
 I pray that You would help me,

483
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,960
 and help us to learn to release control,

484
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,960
 and to just trust You,

485
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,600
 and to say, "God, we are going to let go

486
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,600
 of these things in our life that cause us fear,

487
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,800
 these things we can't control,

488
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,680
 these things that knock us around,

489
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,800
 and get us sideways,

490
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,400
 and just get us confused,

491
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,240
 and cause us to be afraid and anxious.

492
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,600
 God, we're going to release those things,

493
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,480
 give them up to You,

494
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,600
 let You have them,

495
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,120
 let You take them from our hands.

496
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,040
 And we're going to trust You to do what You do.

497
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,720
 What do You do?

498
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,560
 You do good things, God.

499
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,080
 You work miracles.

500
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,520
 You are a fixer.

501
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,560
 You are a healer.

502
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,000
 You are a repairer.

503
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,120
 You are a builder.

504
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,120
 You are the one who takes our brokenness

505
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,560
 and makes something beautiful, God.

506
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,040
 And our world is full of brokenness,

507
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,400
 our lives are full of brokenness,

508
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,440
 but we trust You to fix, to heal,

509
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,560
 to restore, to repair.

510
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,480
 And God, we thank You for that.

511
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,920
 We praise You for that today.

512
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:40,480
 And we ask that we would grow in our trust of You,

513
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,200
 and find peace, and comfort, and hope

514
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,960
 as we put our trust in You,

515
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,520
 to be at work in our hearts and in our lives.

516
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,400
 In Jesus' name.

517
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,480
 Amen.
