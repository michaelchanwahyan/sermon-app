[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.840]   Yeah, that will be the announcement for all.
[00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.480]   And let's welcome Pastor Mark.
[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.240]   - Hey, good morning, everyone.
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.080]   Good to be here.
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.080]   And I'm sure you are very, very happy that I'm back.
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.280]   And can you check the mic for me?
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.880]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.320]   All right.
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.480]   Well, anyways, so today I have two parts.
[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.960]   The first part is I will talk about my experience
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.800]   going to California.
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.800]   It's a heck of a trip, you know?
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.280]   So we spent two weeks.
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.160]   I take a long break from the church, two weeks.
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.960]   And then we travel to California.
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.960]   And it was a very exhausting trip, very exhausting.
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.280]   And I'll tell you why.
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.120]   This is the first part.
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.760]   And then the second part is I'll tell you
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.560]   what my spiritual reflection is
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.360]   during this crazy trip, all right?
[00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.680]   So you remember December 25th, Christmas Sunday,
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.080]   right, remember that, right?
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.240]   We had a big celebration here.
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.320]   And then we had baptism and we had the luncheon.
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.360]   And then we played the white elephant game, right?
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.880]   So it was such a fun, right?
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.720]   And then we finished it in about one-ish
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.000]   or almost two o'clock and we depart from this place.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.680]   And because our flight flying from Chicago to Phoenix
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.240]   is gonna take off around 5.45 p.m.
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.240]   So I still had some time.
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.400]   So my whole family, actually they all left already
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.720]   after the Christmas program.
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.480]   And then I was the only one at the church.
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.280]   And I was rushing myself and just wrap up some stuff.
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.400]   And then I went home.
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.760]   I didn't pack at all.
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.120]   So all my three family members, they have already packed.
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.440]   And then I went home in such a hurry.
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.120]   I try to pack my clothing, pack all my essentials
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.880]   into my suitcase.
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.720]   So December 25th, right?
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.680]   And then around two o'clock, 2.30,
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.080]   I keep checking my Southwest app,
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.560]   finding out my first flight from Chicago to Phoenix,
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.160]   what time is departing.
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.600]   Because my friends and my family members in California
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.960]   reminding me, "Are you sure your flight
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.120]   "is departing on time?
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.000]   "Please check your flight."
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.440]   So I keep checking and it was okay at 5.45.
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.120]   And then a little bit later, got delayed for 15 minutes.
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.000]   And then later on, got delayed for 30 minutes.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.280]   So it was good.
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.780]   It was all good because I was in such a rush, right?
[00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.780]   I don't wanna forget something, right?
[00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.480]   So it give me some time and almost an hour delay.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.120]   And then I sense that it's gonna be a trouble, right?
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.580]   It's gonna be trouble.
[00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.820]   Because I checked the phone app
[00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.640]   and then I go to the website Southwest
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.920]   to check my flight departure schedule
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.160]   and they don't match.
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.920]   So amazingly, they don't match.
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.280]   And then I was talking to some of my friends
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.600]   and relatives in California.
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.480]   Hey, maybe my flight is gonna be delayed.
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.520]   Now that's a problem because I'm flying to Phoenix
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.200]   and then there's a layover less than an hour
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.920]   and then connecting flight from Phoenix to Sacramento, right?
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.700]   So if the first leg got delayed,
[00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.620]   then I would not be able to catch the second leg, right?
[00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.060]   So I talked to Nathan, Rachel and Wendy.
[00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.280]   I said, we gotta go to the airport physically
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.380]   to go to the counter and check the ticket, right?
[00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.920]   Or we may have to rebook the ticket.
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.100]   So we have Ivan, one of our neighbors,
[00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.140]   have us drop off at the airport
[00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.660]   about 3.30, right?
[00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.420]   Remember my first leg was departing,
[00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.740]   originally departing 5.45 p.m.
[00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.280]   So we were there two hours before
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.100]   and then we got dropped off at the sidewalk.
[00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.740]   And then I walk into the departure hall,
[00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.340]   going to the Southwest counter.
[00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.100]   Go inside, there was a long line
[00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.840]   of almost, I think, almost 300, 400 people.
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.160]   They're waiting to go to the Southwest counter
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.340]   and have their tickets rebooked, right?
[00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.180]   So we got in line, 3.30,
[00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.140]   and then wait and wait and wait.
[00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.780]   The line's moving so slow
[00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.620]   because the counter has only three or four people working.
[00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.500]   And then we waited, I tell you,
[00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.920]   we waited for almost four, five hours.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.900]   And almost the counter is in sight, right?
[00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.220]   Almost the counter is in sight.
[00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.740]   And then one of the managers step up
[00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.700]   and shout out loud and said,
[00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.020]   "Sorry, computer crash.
[00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.060]   "And you have to wait for a little bit more."
[00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.140]   And I said to myself,
[00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:03.840]   "It's gonna be a big trouble for me, right?
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.900]   "There's no way I can catch the second leg, right?"
[00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.800]   And then, there's a huge line in front of me.
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.540]   And then I keep checking all the Southwest flight,
[00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.700]   almost all of them got delayed.
[00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.460]   Or many of them got canceled.
[00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.500]   And my own flight keep delaying, right?
[00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.440]   5.45 to six o'clock, and then eight o'clock,
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.540]   and then 9 p.m., right?
[00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.720]   So by the time we got to the counter,
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.740]   it was almost 9 p.m., right?
[00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.500]   Right, almost 9 p.m., something like that.
[00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.740]   It was seven, seven, eight, 8 p.m., something like that.
[00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.860]   It was a long wait.
[00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.340]   Now during the wait, I was like,
[00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.540]   there was no way I can get the second leg, right?
[00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.420]   So my decision was whether I would catch the first leg
[00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:56.660]   and go to Phoenix, right?
[00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:59.060]   And going to Phoenix for what, right?
[00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.700]   So I was doing my research on my phone
[00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:05.140]   and see if we can just fly to Phoenix
[00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:10.140]   and then just figure out what to do next, right?
[00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.900]   So I was trying to figure out what to do.
[00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:19.140]   And I text Joyce, one of our pastoral staff in Phoenix,
[00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:24.140]   and then I was doing some research on the distance.
[00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:28.420]   How long does it take from driving from Phoenix
[00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.140]   all the way to Sacramento?
[00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.820]   So I was doing some research, and I had done my research,
[00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.520]   and I talked to my family members,
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.540]   my daughter, my son, my wife,
[00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.580]   and I called them out and said, "I have a crazy idea."
[00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:47.100]   And the crazy idea is we're gonna fly to Phoenix,
[00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:50.780]   and then we're gonna rent a car,
[00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:52.920]   we're gonna drive to Las Vegas,
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:57.200]   and then we're gonna stay over there,
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.980]   and then we're gonna drive from Las Vegas
[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:04.220]   all the way up north to Sacramento.
[00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.720]   It was a long drive.
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.940]   So I did my research, it's about 15 hours of driving,
[00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:14.620]   and then there's a midpoint we can stop at Las Vegas.
[00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.740]   So I asked them, "This is my crazy idea.
[00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.100]   "Are you up for it?"
[00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:21.500]   And you know what they said?
[00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:25.040]   They said, "Let's go.
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.180]   "Let's go."
[00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:29.900]   So we went to the counter and talked to the lady and said,
[00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.260]   "Hey, just let us fly to Phoenix."
[00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.100]   And then she was questioning us,
[00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:35.780]   "What are you gonna do in Phoenix?"
[00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:38.700]   "Hey, no problem, we have a good friend there,
[00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.640]   "and we're gonna stay overnight there,
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.620]   "and we'll figure out what to do."
[00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:46.700]   So we fly to Phoenix, and then finally,
[00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:51.140]   by the time we board the plane,
[00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:55.260]   it was, I think, almost 11 p.m., right?
[00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:56.300]   Almost midnight.
[00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:00.940]   And we were in the airport for nine hours already,
[00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:01.780]   almost nine hours.
[00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:06.780]   And I went to the gate, and it was chaotic, right?
[00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:08.780]   Yeah, James was there too, right?
[00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:10.100]   It was crazy.
[00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:10.940]   It was crazy.
[00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:13.140]   I was happy to see James, but I'm sad
[00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:16.060]   that we got stuck right there, right?
[00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:18.420]   And then there were a lot of people I overheard.
[00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:20.460]   Their flight got delayed and delayed,
[00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:23.980]   and then finally canceled, and they gotta go home.
[00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:26.740]   So I was praying that my flight would be okay,
[00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:29.820]   and then we will fly to Phoenix.
[00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:31.300]   So by the time we board the plane,
[00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.780]   it was almost midnight, and we were ready
[00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:36.380]   for a three-and-a-half-hour flight
[00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:38.900]   from Chicago to Phoenix.
[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:42.260]   So we arrived at Phoenix Airport.
[00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:46.740]   It was about 3 a.m., I think, 3 a.m.
[00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:50.640]   So we got off the plane and went to the baggage claim,
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.180]   and with a high expectation
[00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:55.220]   that we will get our suitcases, right?
[00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:58.360]   And then the bell started rolling.
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.400]   There's only a few bags there,
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:04.880]   and our bags were not found.
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.680]   They were not being sent to Phoenix.
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.520]   They didn't follow us.
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:12.100]   So another long line, we go to the Southwest baggage claim
[00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:15.420]   and try to find out where our bags are,
[00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:18.660]   and it turns out our bags did not follow us.
[00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:20.380]   They stayed in Chicago.
[00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:23.340]   So we were separated from our suitcases.
[00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:28.340]   And 3 a.m., 4 a.m. at Phoenix,
[00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:31.960]   luckily, fortunately, we had our hand carry
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:35.400]   with one set of clothing, our essentials,
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.160]   in our hand carry so we can live by it
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.000]   with just the minimum.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.660]   So we were pretty, pretty sad, pretty sad.
[00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:48.320]   Went to the car rental and went to the parking lot.
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.640]   It was kind of scary because 3 a.m., 4 a.m.,
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.680]   there's nobody there, and there are not many cars.
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.680]   I guess there were so many stranded travelers,
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:00.080]   they were trying to rent their own cars, right?
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:05.080]   So the car rental guy said to me,
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:08.200]   "You know, I'm sorry, we don't have
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.680]   "the standard size you requested,
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:14.140]   "but we have a free upgrade for you."
[00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:15.640]   Yeah, free upgrade for you.
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.160]   Okay, okay, that's great.
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.800]   And then he said a number of brand,
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.880]   number of different models of cars,
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.920]   and I heard Camry, I got out of Camry.
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:28.360]   (audience laughing)
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.520]   It turns out it's a new Camry, all right?
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:34.880]   So we hopped into the car and drove to Joyce,
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.780]   and we spent a day in Phoenix.
[00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:40.600]   You know, with all the trouble,
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:45.600]   I think it was a blessing to see some friends
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:51.360]   and to visit Abby and had a good time there.
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.320]   So it was great.
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.120]   And then after a day in Phoenix,
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:01.120]   we decided to drive all the way from Phoenix to Las Vegas.
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.680]   Now this is a crazy idea,
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.900]   but I think it's a very good idea, right?
[00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:07.080]   Because Rachel and Nathan,
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.440]   they'd never been to Las Vegas.
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:09.280]   Yeah, why not, right?
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:11.980]   We go to Sin City at a stop in a trip,
[00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:14.360]   and so much fun, right?
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:17.720]   So we got to the hotel, it's a big hotel,
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.440]   and again, it was a long line,
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.720]   because I guess all the stranded travelers
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:26.320]   were looking for a place to stay.
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:29.440]   So we waited in line for an hour,
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.960]   and finally we got our room keys.
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:36.960]   And it was pretty tiring, pretty exhausting.
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:42.040]   But hey, we're in Las Vegas, we could have some fun.
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.600]   And so finally we were there.
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.400]   You know, I did not gamble,
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.400]   because the whole trip is a gamble.
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.120]   Because the whole trip is already a gamble.
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.260]   It was crazy.
[00:11:55.260 --> 00:12:00.260]   We got to Las Vegas, and then took some pictures,
[00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.840]   but we were really, really tired.
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.180]   We were really tired.
[00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:06.600]   But we had to go on, right?
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.040]   So I think Tuesday afternoon,
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:12.360]   we decided to drive all the way
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:15.280]   from Las Vegas to Sacramento, right?
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:20.280]   So we drove to Bakersfield, north of Los Angeles,
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:22.400]   and then all the way up I-5
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.660]   to Bay Area and Northern California.
[00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:30.600]   That's how the trip was,
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:33.120]   and it was a really tough drive,
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:37.720]   because it just happened during that week,
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:42.600]   California was hit by huge rainstorms,
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:47.240]   and we were almost in every hour driving in heavy rain.
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:48.240]   And it was crazy.
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:53.240]   I remember there was a hilly portion of the highway
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:57.020]   near Bakersfield in Southern California.
[00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:59.720]   It was a very mountainous region,
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:02.400]   and I had to turn, twist up and down,
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:03.960]   and it was at night,
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.360]   and I could not see the lane line, you know?
[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.920]   Now my kids can tell you,
[00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:12.180]   if I drive below the speed limit,
[00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:15.820]   you know, it was pretty scary drive, right?
[00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:18.960]   When I drive slow, it was scary.
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:22.740]   When I drive faster, it was okay, right?
[00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:26.200]   I couldn't see a line because I'm getting old as well, right?
[00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:30.080]   And then I turned on the lane detection on the Camry.
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:33.800]   Hopefully it will help me to steer the turn, right?
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:37.180]   And the lane detection did not work,
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:39.680]   because it was so dark.
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:42.060]   Even technology cannot see it, right?
[00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:43.400]   Oh, it was crazy.
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:46.420]   But finally we arrive at Sacramento,
[00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:49.420]   and it was nice.
[00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:52.860]   Sorry for the picture, not the best picture,
[00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:56.000]   but you know, as I told you,
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.440]   I usually don't take long breaks from my work, from church.
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.260]   You know, some brothers and sisters,
[00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.900]   they are really caring about my wellbeing.
[00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:09.000]   They always ask me and tell me,
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.680]   "Hey, Pastor, why don't you take a long break?"
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:11.940]   Right? Yeah.
[00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:14.240]   I know why I don't take long breaks.
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.660]   (laughing)
[00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:17.400]   Now I know, right?
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:18.700]   Because once I take a long break,
[00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:21.680]   this is a crazy break, right?
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:27.640]   But in that two weeks, I think it was still a blessing.
[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:29.720]   It was still a blessing,
[00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:33.760]   because I see all the friends and friends and relatives.
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.360]   We had a good time,
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:39.840]   and there were also some people I have met online before,
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.580]   and I have never seen them.
[00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:46.240]   I was able to have a meal with them and to talk to them.
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.920]   So it was such a blessing to see
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:50.600]   all the friends and family together.
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:53.360]   I think every gathering,
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:57.000]   every moment that we can see each other,
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.640]   see some of the friends and relatives, was a blessing.
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:02.640]   Every single moment, I enjoyed it,
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:04.460]   even though it was exhausting.
[00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:07.320]   During the whole week,
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:14.440]   I was constantly reminded of one single passage in the Bible.
[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:19.240]   It is in the letter of James, chapter four.
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:21.080]   Chapter four.
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:23.200]   Chapter four, 13.
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:27.600]   "Look here, you who say,
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:30.740]   "today or tomorrow we are going to a certain town,
[00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:32.900]   "and we'll stay there a year.
[00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.740]   "We will do business there, and we will make a profit.
[00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:42.100]   "How do you know what your life will be like tomorrow?
[00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.460]   "Your life is like morning mist.
[00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:47.140]   "It is here for a little while, and it will be gone."
[00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:50.760]   Now this is the passage I keep reminding myself
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:54.180]   during the entire journey.
[00:15:54.180 --> 00:16:00.100]   James, as a pastor, he was writing this letter
[00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:02.340]   to the brothers and sisters who were scattered
[00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:06.420]   because of persecution in the church in the first century.
[00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:09.980]   And reminding them, or even confronting
[00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:11.880]   some of the people in the congregation
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:17.900]   who had a wrong attitude toward life and toward God.
[00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:21.140]   You notice here in this short verse,
[00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:28.000]   James is quoting some of the rich guys in the congregation
[00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:30.340]   who were so resourceful.
[00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:33.080]   They were merchants, they probably are traveling merchants
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:34.400]   in those days.
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:37.580]   And notice how he quote them, saying,
[00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:42.300]   "We will go, we will stay, we will do business,
[00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:45.500]   "and we will make a profit."
[00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:49.020]   He was confronting these people who thought
[00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:53.540]   they control, that they are in charge of their lives.
[00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:58.420]   And with this confrontation, James is saying,
[00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:03.080]   "To the people, you are not in charge, so be humble."
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:06.700]   We are not in charge of our own life.
[00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:09.720]   Every single moment is all by the grace of God.
[00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:14.140]   Right, this whole trip, I really, really learned this lesson.
[00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:16.500]   It didn't mean I didn't know before,
[00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:20.860]   but it was just a personal experience that is telling me
[00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:23.480]   God is the one who is in charge.
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:28.140]   God is sovereign, and we are simply stewards.
[00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:29.780]   We are simply servants.
[00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:35.580]   So maintain a constant spirit of humility
[00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:39.500]   to fear God, to know that He is the one in charge.
[00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:44.300]   We were in Las Vegas, and walking on the
[00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:46.840]   Hollywood Walk of Fame, right?
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:50.980]   Have you ever been to Las Vegas?
[00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:51.820]   No?
[00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:53.420]   Maybe you should go, yeah.
[00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:54.420]   - Wow.
[00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:55.600]   - Maybe you should go.
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:57.360]   Go to Las Vegas, you know, not to gamble,
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:00.260]   but to just walk around.
[00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.100]   So we were in Hollywood Boulevard,
[00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:06.140]   and walking the Walk of Fame,
[00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:08.980]   and you see all the stars on the street, right?
[00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:10.980]   And with the famous people,
[00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:15.980]   their name engraved on the walk, right?
[00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:18.820]   I saw this one, Elvis Presley.
[00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:22.140]   Ring any bell?
[00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:25.420]   Huh?
[00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:26.260]   Presley.
[00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:30.940]   His daughter just died, just passed away last week.
[00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:33.540]   All of a sudden, 54 years old.
[00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:37.100]   You think about your life,
[00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:41.900]   think about how our life is like what James says.
[00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:43.500]   It's like a morning mist.
[00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:47.140]   We were in San Francisco for a trip,
[00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:52.140]   and it was a rainy day, it was cool and foggy.
[00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:54.860]   San Francisco is always like that, you know?
[00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:59.860]   You go to the beautiful Golden Gate Bridge,
[00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:03.580]   just mist and fog will just come by,
[00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:05.460]   and then it will be gone.
[00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:07.700]   This is exactly what James is talking about.
[00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:10.100]   What did he say?
[00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:12.340]   Your life is like morning mist.
[00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:15.780]   You cannot hold onto it.
[00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:18.620]   You cannot control it,
[00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:21.820]   because it comes, and it will be gone.
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:27.440]   We cannot control many things in our lives.
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:31.840]   We can't even control the weather, right?
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:34.960]   People in Chicago should know
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:39.640]   that our weather is unpredictable, right?
[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:42.800]   Even our economy, especially after COVID,
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:46.040]   is kind of unpredictable.
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:49.120]   There's no way you can be in charge
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:50.720]   of every single thing, right?
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:54.980]   I saw this picture a couple days ago.
[00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:59.140]   The best Valentine gift is to give eggs, right?
[00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:02.240]   Because the price of egg is going up and down
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.660]   in an unpredictable way.
[00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:09.720]   Now, James is not against our human responsibility.
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:13.160]   No, we are stewards of our time.
[00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:16.040]   You are a steward of opportunities,
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:17.620]   resources God has given you.
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:22.760]   But what he's confronting is the wrong attitude
[00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:24.360]   toward life, toward God.
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:27.720]   What James is confronting is the wrong,
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:30.300]   misplaced attitude toward life,
[00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:33.800]   thinking that we can be in control.
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:37.320]   And the Bible says, "Hold on, hold on.
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:42.320]   "Life is unpredictable, and life is full of mystery.
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:45.740]   "So you better recognize who is in charge,
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:49.960]   "and God himself is in charge."
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:56.120]   4.15, "What you ought to say is if the Lord wants us to,
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:01.580]   "we will live and do this or that.
[00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:06.340]   "Otherwise, you're boasting about your own plans,
[00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:08.040]   "and such boasting is evil."
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:12.940]   And remember, it is sin to know what you ought to do,
[00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:15.700]   and yet not do it.
[00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:21.600]   The right attitude toward life is to fear God,
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:24.700]   to acknowledge that God is in charge,
[00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:28.380]   he's directing your path, not you.
[00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:29.780]   You simply follow.
[00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:33.960]   Now, let alone James, it's like a lot of wisdom literature
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.620]   in the Old Testament, like Book of Proverbs
[00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:38.420]   and Ecclesiastes, wisdom literature.
[00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:39.660]   Now, what is wisdom literature?
[00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:42.900]   Wisdom literature is telling us how to live our life
[00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:44.820]   under the will of God.
[00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:48.140]   To fear God is the foundation of life wisdom.
[00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:51.740]   To fear God is to relate to God properly.
[00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:55.660]   And we relate to God properly, and in Christ.
[00:21:55.660 --> 00:22:00.660]   Through Christ, we relate to God as our Father,
[00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:02.940]   and we are his children.
[00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:05.300]   And one of the main points in the letter of James
[00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:09.620]   is that you have to figure out, you have to make sure
[00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:13.020]   you have the right relationship with your creator,
[00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:17.940]   your Lord, and you are the follower,
[00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:20.980]   and you follow the sovereign will of God.
[00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:25.220]   Last Monday night, we had our English team,
[00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:27.500]   leadership team meeting together,
[00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:30.940]   and one of the conversations that we had was,
[00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:36.900]   we were all drivers, and we used to teach someone else
[00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:38.620]   how to drive, right?
[00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:41.500]   So we have kind of a sharing our own,
[00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:43.980]   you know, frightening experience, right?
[00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:45.860]   Teaching a new driver how to drive, right?
[00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:47.740]   Have you ever done anything like that?
[00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:49.620]   You know, you're an experienced driver,
[00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:52.100]   and you teach someone else how to drive,
[00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:54.180]   and you are in the passenger seat,
[00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:58.740]   and the new person is in the driver's seat, right?
[00:22:58.740 --> 00:22:59.940]   How do you feel?
[00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:01.620]   You feel out of control, right?
[00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:03.220]   You feel out of control.
[00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:08.180]   Because, you know, you can only control the car
[00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:10.620]   with your voice command, right?
[00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:13.220]   And sometimes the driver, the new driver,
[00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:14.460]   doesn't listen to you.
[00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:16.380]   So it was kind of scary.
[00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:17.980]   But think about it.
[00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:22.060]   If the driver is an experienced driver,
[00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:24.500]   someone you can trust,
[00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:29.180]   then your experience will be totally different, right?
[00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:32.340]   Have you ever seen, have you ever, you know,
[00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:35.060]   been in my car, right?
[00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:37.020]   Do you feel safe in my car?
[00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:39.700]   Oh, you feel dangerous, right?
[00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:41.140]   You feel dangerous, right?
[00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:43.780]   But a different kind of danger, right?
[00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:45.580]   Different kind of danger.
[00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:47.220]   It's not because of inexperience, right?
[00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:49.100]   Because of experience, right?
[00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:51.220]   (audience laughing)
[00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:52.060]   But think about it.
[00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:55.260]   If the driver is totally trustworthy,
[00:23:55.260 --> 00:24:00.220]   then your experience will be totally pleasant, right?
[00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:02.660]   God is in the driver's seat.
[00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:05.540]   God is the driver.
[00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:07.660]   He is the creator, He is our loving Lord, right?
[00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:10.900]   He is taking control.
[00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:13.340]   And we are in the passenger seat.
[00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:16.380]   And when you can trust God totally,
[00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:18.900]   and He is indeed trustworthy,
[00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:20.260]   then we in the passenger seat,
[00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:22.340]   we will say and we will pray,
[00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:24.980]   take me according to your will.
[00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:30.700]   And we will go to the destination, right?
[00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:34.140]   Yes, there were different turns,
[00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:35.540]   there were different corners,
[00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:37.900]   ups and downs during the journey.
[00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:40.220]   However, the driver who is trustworthy,
[00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:45.020]   our God Himself will bring you to the destination.
[00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:48.740]   That is what James is talking about, right?
[00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:50.540]   The sovereignty of God.
[00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:53.060]   Again, it's not saying we do not need
[00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:55.980]   to take responsibilities of our own affairs.
[00:24:55.980 --> 00:25:00.060]   You're a business owner, you have to be faithful
[00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:01.700]   because you're a steward.
[00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:05.420]   You are a worker in your workplace,
[00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:07.740]   you are to be faithful.
[00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:09.860]   You're a family member, you have to be faithful.
[00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:12.940]   This is all about spiritual stewardship,
[00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:14.940]   human responsibilities.
[00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:19.940]   However, we have to recognize that God is in control.
[00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:21.100]   God is in control.
[00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:25.500]   Let me close with a quote from Charles Spurgeon.
[00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:31.580]   He's one of the well-known preachers 100 years ago.
[00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:33.820]   He talks about the sovereignty of God.
[00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:36.540]   He said, "When you go through a trial in your life,
[00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:40.420]   "the sovereignty of God is the pillow
[00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:42.340]   "upon which you can lay your head."
[00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:46.980]   It's comforting to know that the driver of our life
[00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:51.060]   is God Himself, not us.
[00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:57.100]   But as we figure out the right relationship with God,
[00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:59.460]   we are in the passenger seat.
[00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:02.980]   We follow His will and be humble always before Him
[00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:06.820]   and follow and seek the will of God.
[00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:10.620]   Now, I hope this lesson will be your lesson as well.
[00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:12.820]   As you go through the journey of life,
[00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:15.260]   probably not as crazy as the two weeks
[00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:18.380]   that I experienced with Southwest Airlines.
[00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:20.020]   So thank you, Southwest Airlines.
[00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:24.420]   But we all go through up and down, right?
[00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:29.500]   And twists and turns in our own life.
[00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:34.100]   But do remember, do remember the sovereignty of God.
[00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:34.940]   He is guiding.
[00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:41.420]   And your lesson and my lesson is to obey
[00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:43.100]   and to seek and follow His will.
[00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:45.700]   Well, let's all pray together.
[00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:48.260]   And I want you to have a moment
[00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:54.620]   to bring your concern before our God, before your God.
[00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:59.020]   What is it that you are thinking?
[00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:01.340]   What kind of decisions you are facing?
[00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:03.380]   Or maybe some uncertainties in your life.
[00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:06.340]   Maybe you're praying for something
[00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:08.300]   or seeking something in your life.
[00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:12.980]   Bring it, bring your concern before our loving God.
[00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:14.540]   And then we'll close in prayer.
[00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:30.620]   Dear God, we thank you because you are sovereign.
[00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:33.860]   You are the one who is in charge.
[00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:37.060]   All of our concerns, all our cares,
[00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:40.260]   we bring before you,
[00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:44.660]   knowing that your will is always the best will.
[00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:47.460]   In our journey of life,
[00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:50.380]   we have ups and downs and twists and turns.
[00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:55.380]   Yet we come before you knowing that your will is sovereign.
[00:27:55.380 --> 00:28:01.580]   And you are not only sovereign, you are our loving God.
[00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:05.580]   And you are the one who is guiding our path,
[00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:08.860]   giving us guidance and wisdom,
[00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:12.860]   and help us to be humble, to follow your will.
[00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:18.700]   And we praise you because this is who you are.
[00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:22.060]   And you are a great and sovereign God.
[00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:25.220]   And help us serve you and worship you and follow your will.
[00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:26.500]   In Christ's name, we pray.
[00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:31.020]   Well, God bless you and I wanna see you next Sunday.
[00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:33.020]   For the bag of blessing, you need to come early
[00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:35.180]   and have some time of fellowship together.
