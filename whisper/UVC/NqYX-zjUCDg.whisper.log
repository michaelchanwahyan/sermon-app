[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.500]   Okay, Mark.
[00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.080]   - Hey, good morning, everyone.
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.760]   Why don't we say hello and shake hands to one another,
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.300]   call each other brother and sisters,
[00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.020]   remember what I said last week.
[00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.800]   So find some people and shake their hands
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.020]   and welcome them to our worship community.
[00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.440]   - Hello, Mark.
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.600]   (audience chattering)
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:35.760]   - All right, good to see you guys, good to see you.
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.600]   Good to see you.
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.880]   All right, so it's good to be here
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.000]   and today at the end of service,
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.400]   we have Communion Sunday.
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.160]   It's the first Sunday of the month
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.100]   and we're looking forward to this time
[00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.400]   to take the communion elements,
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.000]   to remember what Christ has done for us.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.280]   And again, Pastor Mark and the announcer was called,
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.280]   Kelly, did she introduce herself?
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.120]   - I don't know.
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.200]   - Okay, oh, you were there.
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.860]   Okay, Kelly, thank you very much.
[00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.560]   And there's also one more announcement.
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.000]   There's a sister show show next week, right?
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.680]   So it's after our Sunday worship service,
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.920]   you guys are gonna eat together, hot pot, right?
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.520]   Hot pot together and make candles together.
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.960]   Yeah, candles and then hot pot and then Super Bowl
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.200]   and then show show, whatever, okay?
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.500]   So it's gonna be a long day next week.
[00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.160]   Anyways, but today let's turn our attention
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.280]   to the word of God.
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.040]   We are on a series called Becoming a Healthier Church.
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.840]   Healthier Church, I think that's what God desire.
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.840]   God wants His church and local churches to be healthy, right?
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.540]   He wants you to be healthy too, right?
[00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.620]   So it's kind of related topic.
[00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.460]   You think about how to be healthier.
[00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.400]   Maybe it's your New Year's resolution.
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.840]   Nobody cares about it now, right?
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.280]   It's already February.
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.400]   So maybe it's one of your goals to be healthier.
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.800]   What kind of things that you would do or change
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.220]   in order to be healthier?
[00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.040]   Now, again, a related topic is the church.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.320]   As a church, as a faith community, as a family of God,
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.600]   how can we be more healthy?
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.520]   And we spent two weeks to take a look
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.080]   at some of the passages from the letter of Ephesians
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.640]   in the New Testament.
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.520]   Now we are turning our attention to another book,
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.440]   another letter written by Paul as well.
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.480]   It's the letter of Philippians.
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.480]   So if you have your Bible, you can turn to Philippians 1,
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.360]   how to be a healthier church.
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.360]   Chapter one, above all, you must live as citizens
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.760]   of heaven, conducting yourself in a manner worthy
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.840]   of the good news, the gospel of Christ.
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.520]   Then whether I come and see you again,
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.360]   or only hear about you, I will know that you are standing
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.080]   together with one spirit and one purpose,
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.840]   fighting together, contending together for the faith,
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.320]   which is the good news, the gospel.
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.920]   So it's a short verse from chapter one
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.680]   of the letter of Philippians, written to the Philippians,
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.400]   written to the Christians in Philippi.
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.720]   So today, I just learned some of the new here
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.640]   who are students, especially students
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.240]   at Moody Bible Institute.
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.200]   So I prepared some pop quiz.
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.880]   Okay, I prepared some pop quiz.
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.360]   All right, so well, I think you will do well
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.180]   because you're Moody students.
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.920]   Anyways, let's go over these questions together.
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.880]   All right, it's a multiple choice questions.
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.440]   As we begin to study the book of Philippians,
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.440]   I would like to begin with some of the questions
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.280]   to warm up your mind, all right?
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.560]   So are you ready?
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.400]   - Yes.
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.560]   - All right, question one, all right?
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.320]   Question one, all right.
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.160]   You ready?
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.600]   It's all about the epistle of the Philippines, all right?
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:11.560]   The church in Philippi was planned by, who planned it?
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.880]   All right, A, Apostle Peter, B, Apostle Paul.
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.000]   A or B?
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.840]   Who said A?
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.920]   Who said B?
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.660]   Why you hesitate?
[00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.080]   (laughing)
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.600]   Why you hesitate?
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.640]   All right, so it is.
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.520]   It is planned by Apostle Paul, right?
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.360]   Why you hesitate?
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.980]   It's such a simple question, all right?
[00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.160]   So more difficult question to come, all right?
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.480]   All right, now this is a tough one, okay?
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.280]   This is a tough one, all right?
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.600]   On which of his missionary journey
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.040]   did Paul plan the church in Philippi?
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:50.040]   All right, A, first, B, second, C, third journey.
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.160]   All right, think about it, okay?
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.000]   Work with your neighbors, work with your neighbors, okay?
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.080]   Ask your neighbors, do you know the answer or not, okay?
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.720]   On which of his missionary journey
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.080]   did Paul plan the church in Philippi?
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.000]   The first one, second, or third, okay?
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.220]   How many of you say A, the first one?
[00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.440]   Okay, I see a hand in the room, okay.
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.000]   By the way, thank you very much.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   They work so hard to make our worship service possible.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.440]   Sometimes there are technical difficulties, all right?
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.440]   You have any complaint, we invite you to join the team
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.840]   to help us out. (laughing)
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.040]   Anyways, option one is A, is first missionary journey.
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.280]   How many of you say B, second?
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.560]   All right, some said B.
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.040]   What, you following others, or?
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.800]   Okay, are you sure James is right?
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.900]   All right, how many of you say C, the third journey?
[00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.320]   All right, so let's see the answer.
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.400]   It is B, it is the second journey, okay?
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.960]   Second missionary journey, all right?
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.880]   All right, not bad, guys, not bad.
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.280]   All right, those of you who are hesitating
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.200]   to raise your hand to answer the question,
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.200]   you have to answer this question, okay?
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.560]   Question three, does the church in Philippi
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.880]   support Paul's mission?
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.320]   Yes or no, okay?
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.760]   Yes or no, how many say yes?
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.520]   Okay, how many say no?
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.600]   That's why he wrote the letter, right?
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.020]   No, yeah, he did.
[00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.400]   All right, all right.
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.560]   So Paul did, Paul did receive offering
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.160]   and support from the church of Philippi, all right?
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.320]   So they're a pretty good church, very generous, okay?
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.200]   So last question, okay?
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.960]   Uh, there you go, okay.
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.040]   This is a tough one, okay?
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.240]   Which of the following people were the leaders
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.320]   of the church in Philippi?
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.880]   Which of the following people were the leaders
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.600]   of the church in Philippi?
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.320]   A is, um,
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:55.160]   Euodia and Sinti, okay?
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.680]   Euodia and Sinti.
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.760]   A, B is Alexander and Philip.
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.560]   C is Timothy and Luke.
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.320]   All right, how many of you say A?
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:08.280]   All right, all right, I see some hands, okay.
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:09.520]   How many of you say B?
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.760]   B, names very familiar, Alexander and Philip.
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.200]   By the way, they're father and son, yeah.
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.440]   No, C, Timothy and Luke?
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.120]   Timothy and Luke, okay, good.
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.320]   Brave hand, brave people.
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.560]   The answer is,
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.560]   is A, all right?
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.440]   If you read chapter four, you find these two names show up.
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.800]   They are actually having some problem in the church.
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:39.040]   In any case, I want to warm you up with these questions
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.720]   to think about what the letter has to say about the church,
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:45.720]   about us as people in Christ.
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:50.040]   So the church of Philippi was planted by the apostle Paul
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.800]   in his second missionary journey.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.920]   He went the first one, he went to what we call
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:00.560]   Asia Minor or modern day Turkey in that area
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.800]   from Antioch.
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:05.520]   So he preached the gospel to different towns and cities
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:09.600]   and find some people who embrace the gospel
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:13.480]   and planted all these house churches in different towns.
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:16.800]   And then they return to their home base
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.320]   in Jerusalem and Antioch.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.440]   And then as they pray about it,
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.960]   they felt that the Spirit is moving them
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.160]   to go on for an other journey.
[00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.320]   So they started the second journey.
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.720]   And the second missionary journey,
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:36.720]   they pass through what we call Turkey,
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.680]   you see the blue line,
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:42.640]   they were in Jerusalem and then they were back to Antioch.
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.600]   And then from Antioch, they move west
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:49.960]   through Asia Minor.
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.920]   And there are different things happen
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.520]   and they wanted to go to that town,
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.720]   but the Holy Spirit is not leading them to.
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.560]   And then they moved on to another town
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:00.840]   and then move around.
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:03.120]   As they move around, they move westward
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:08.120]   to a place or a port or harbor called Chorus.
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:12.520]   So when they were there, they spend the night
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:15.120]   and God show Paul a vision.
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:19.560]   And in that vision, a man, a Macedonian man,
[00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:23.040]   Macedonian man by race, Macedonia.
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:26.000]   And in the dream, in the vision,
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.360]   this Macedonian man call on Paul and his team
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.600]   to come over, to cross the sea,
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:37.600]   the Aegean Sea to the sort of the peninsula of Greece.
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:45.840]   So to call Paul to cross the sea,
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.840]   to come over and help him, all right?
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.440]   Now that's interesting,
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.800]   because if you know something about history
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.320]   or the context of the Bible,
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:58.400]   you know, the Macedonian, all right?
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.600]   Remember the name, Alexander the Great?
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:05.280]   Alexander the Great, ring any bell?
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:06.360]   Right?
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:10.680]   Fairly familiar name, a great military leader
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:13.960]   living in 300 BC or so.
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.480]   And he was a Macedonian.
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:21.480]   And Alexander the Great, he crossed the sea eastward
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:24.440]   and conquered what do they call Turkey
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:28.600]   and the entire Asia, the entire continent
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:32.960]   and brings with him the Hellenistic culture,
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.960]   the Greek culture.
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:38.840]   So it's the Macedonian helping the rest of the world, right?
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:42.680]   Conquered the entire piece of land, entire continent.
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:45.560]   And Alexander the Great conquered the world
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:49.640]   in order to help other people in the east.
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:53.080]   Here, the vision is the other way around.
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:56.800]   Paul saw this vision, the Macedonian man
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:01.800]   calling him to help him, bring the gospel over to help him.
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:06.320]   So it's such a cultural reverse, right?
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:10.960]   So Paul follow God's guidance
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.680]   and he did cross the sea
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:17.280]   and eventually he came to a town called Philippi, all right?
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:20.600]   Actually in the book of Acts, recorded this incident.
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:24.480]   So we, here we have Luke, the writer of the book of Acts
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:27.640]   and the apostle Paul and all the other co-workers,
[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:31.560]   they bought a ship from Chorus
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.160]   and they sailed straight to another island
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.800]   and then the next day they landed
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:40.520]   to the other side of the land in Macedonia.
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:44.080]   And from there, they traveled to different towns
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:49.080]   in which the big city called Philippi, all right?
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:52.400]   So they came to Philippi, which is the district
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:55.080]   or the province of Macedonia.
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:59.360]   It's a colony of Rome, okay?
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.600]   It's a colonial city.
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:05.200]   So we stayed there for several days.
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:09.800]   Now, as you can tell, this is a major city in Macedonia.
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:13.360]   It's a major Roman colonial place
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:18.360]   and it's an important city to the Roman empire.
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.920]   Now, what is a colonial city?
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:22.600]   What is a colony?
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:23.720]   What does it do?
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:24.560]   What does it do?
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:28.240]   All right, what does it do?
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:29.760]   What does a colonial city do?
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:32.120]   What is the purpose?
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:33.840]   What is the function?
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:37.440]   For the empire, for the imperial power,
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:41.200]   they established different places, foreign places.
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.760]   They conquered the city and named that city
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:47.400]   and changed that city into a colonial port
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.640]   or a colonial town.
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:54.560]   And a colonial place has a really, really important
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:58.800]   political social function.
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.920]   For the capital of the imperial power,
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:06.480]   they established colonies around the world
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.840]   or outside of the border.
[00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:12.200]   It's to promote their own power, their own culture
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.800]   and their own values.
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:17.800]   So you live in Philippi as a Roman colonial city.
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:22.680]   Your job or your colonial dream
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.960]   is to become a Roman citizen.
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:29.200]   And by becoming a Roman citizen,
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.640]   your function in the empire, in a colonial city,
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:36.680]   is to promote the power and the value and the culture
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.520]   of the imperial power.
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:42.120]   That's what colonialism is, right?
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.120]   We are talking about our world today.
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:46.440]   It's a post-colonial world, right?
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:48.640]   Because it used to be the Brits,
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:53.640]   they conquered all the places around the globe.
[00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:57.960]   And what they wanted to do is to promote their own culture
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:00.680]   and project their power in other places.
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:05.520]   So you can imagine if you're a local person in Philippi,
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:10.080]   your lifetime dream is to become a Roman citizen
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:13.080]   and to promote the interests, the power,
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:16.000]   the propaganda of the imperial power, which is Rome.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.080]   And then if you understand this background,
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:23.720]   you should understand some of the special words
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:28.440]   that Paul used in the letter of Philippians.
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.720]   So this is a special word alert.
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:34.880]   I'll give you some context first.
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:38.800]   Some of the pictures are taken
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:44.240]   belonging to the first century of Philippi, all right?
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:48.320]   Upper left is Roman forum,
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:51.680]   and lower right is Roman theater,
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:54.080]   which seats about 50,000 people,
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:59.560]   part of the imperial power projecting their own culture.
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:03.600]   And lower left is Roman toilets, all right?
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.600]   So the Roman lifestyle,
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:09.280]   they bring with their own imperial lifestyle
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:12.000]   to different places in different city, all right?
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   So if you never try one of those Roman toilets,
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.640]   you should, yeah, because this is what we do, all right?
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:26.080]   This is what we do today, thanks to the Romans, right?
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.720]   So these are the buildings and architecture
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.240]   of imperial power.
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:34.200]   Whenever they go, they will establish their own symbols
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.760]   and their own lifestyles into the city,
[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:40.000]   especially the city in the Roman East, all right?
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.600]   So they impose foreign power
[00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:46.760]   onto different towns that they conquer.
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:50.040]   Now, here's a special word alert that I'll talk about.
[00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:53.600]   We read this verses, 127.
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:56.680]   Paul is telling the church in Philippi,
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:00.480]   "You must live as citizens of heaven,
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:03.920]   "conducting yourself in a manner worthy of the gospel."
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:07.840]   What's so special about this word
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:12.000]   is that behind this word is the Greek term.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.440]   Can you pronounce that word?
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:16.360]   Yeah, politiomai, right?
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.160]   Politiomai, right?
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.520]   Something like that.
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:20.800]   Now, you don't have to be,
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.960]   you don't have to be fluent in English
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:25.440]   in order to understand what this word is all about.
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:27.960]   What we translate in Chinese or other language
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:30.000]   or in English, live as citizen,
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   conducting that verb, behind that verb, is politiomai.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.440]   And politiomai, you can tell it's related
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:42.000]   to some of the words that we use today.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.920]   Politics, right?
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:45.800]   Citizenship.
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:50.680]   So Paul is using a Roman term, Roman colonial term,
[00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:55.620]   to tell us, to tell the church in Philippi
[00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:57.220]   what it means to be a Christian,
[00:16:57.220 --> 00:17:00.980]   what it means to be a follower of Christ.
[00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:06.540]   Paul used this colonial word not for Roman citizenship,
[00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:11.020]   but for citizenship in heaven.
[00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:14.180]   Heaven is citizenship.
[00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:17.940]   He kind of used that common word
[00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:21.380]   that people were familiar with.
[00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:27.020]   And turn it around, subverting it or remixing it,
[00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:31.300]   and put it in the context of the gospel.
[00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:34.700]   When you came to Christ,
[00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:39.700]   your ultimate identity is not the earthly citizenship.
[00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:45.700]   I know it could be a very relevant topic to all of us,
[00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:46.700]   right?
[00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:49.260]   Many of us, we probably,
[00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:52.980]   some of our life goals
[00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:57.980]   is to obtain the United States citizenship, right?
[00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:00.140]   United States citizenship.
[00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:05.100]   Or any citizenship of any strong country, right?
[00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:07.440]   Big power, superpower.
[00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:09.980]   We want to have that political right.
[00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:12.440]   We want to have that political identity.
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:16.220]   Paul is reversing it.
[00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:20.020]   Paul is saying what you are seeking
[00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:22.780]   and what you are pursuing should be
[00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:25.700]   the citizenship in heaven.
[00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:31.540]   So we are Christ's colonial city.
[00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:35.660]   We are the heavenly colonial city.
[00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:39.060]   Christ plant us in different towns,
[00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:40.460]   in different communities,
[00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:44.540]   in order to promote the gospel,
[00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:46.740]   promote the value,
[00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:53.020]   the interest of the one and only eternal kingdom of God.
[00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:55.860]   It's not the Roman way that we're concerned about.
[00:18:55.860 --> 00:19:00.180]   It is the Christ way that we should be concerned about.
[00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:03.020]   Paul is using this term
[00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:08.020]   and reminding the people in Philippi,
[00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:09.460]   all of us in Christ,
[00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:14.460]   you are being called to the best citizenship of the world.
[00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:16.780]   Better than the Romans,
[00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:19.400]   better than the United States,
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:22.780]   better than anything.
[00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:25.340]   It is the kingdom of God.
[00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:28.580]   That is our identity.
[00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:31.260]   And that's what church is all about.
[00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:34.100]   You must be political mind.
[00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:37.360]   You must be the citizens of heaven.
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:42.940]   Remind yourself what are you after in your life?
[00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:46.860]   What is your greatest interest?
[00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:48.900]   It is to promote the kingdom of Christ,
[00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:51.860]   promote the value of the kingdom.
[00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:56.220]   Again and again, Paul's used this term
[00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:58.940]   in chapter three as well.
[00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:01.980]   Same word, but you are,
[00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:06.180]   you're not Roman citizens.
[00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:10.620]   You are citizens, political mind, of heaven.
[00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:13.300]   Where the Lord Jesus lives.
[00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:18.180]   And we are waiting for him to return as our savior.
[00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:20.820]   And he will take our weak mortal bodies
[00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:24.880]   and change them into the glorious body like his own.
[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:27.940]   Using the same power with which
[00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:30.580]   he will bring everything under his control.
[00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:33.780]   He's talking about the coming king, Jesus Christ.
[00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:37.500]   The coming king of our kingdom.
[00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:40.700]   And he is coming and we are waiting for his coming,
[00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:42.500]   the glorious coming of Christ.
[00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:47.060]   And that's why we are going forward to heaven
[00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:49.780]   and we are the citizens of heaven.
[00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:52.820]   To promote the interest and the power
[00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:55.260]   in the kingdom of Jesus Christ.
[00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:56.980]   So if you ask the question,
[00:20:56.980 --> 00:21:01.460]   what does it mean to be a healthy church?
[00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:03.900]   What does it mean to be a healthy Christian?
[00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:07.160]   What does it mean?
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:11.840]   You think in the colonial way, the heavenly colonial way.
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:17.800]   A healthy Christian, a healthy church,
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:21.320]   is most concerned about promoting the gospel.
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:26.260]   And that's why Paul wrote the letter of Philippians.
[00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:30.000]   Let me give you some suggestions as we close.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.120]   Some of the marks or some of the indicators
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:36.160]   of a healthy church.
[00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:41.480]   All right, it's the outreach to other people.
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:47.200]   Church is the only organization on earth
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:50.120]   that is concerned most about the non-members.
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:52.600]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:56.320]   Church is the only body on earth,
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:02.000]   or heavenly body, heavenly sent colonial body,
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   that is most concerned about the non-members.
[00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:08.260]   How many of you are Costco members?
[00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:13.020]   Yeah, are you proud of it, being a Costco member?
[00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:14.860]   Yeah, right?
[00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:15.680]   (congregation laughing)
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:16.920]   You're proud of it, right?
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.920]   Yeah, because you need that membership card
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:22.920]   to go in to that big box, right?
[00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:27.160]   Without that card, you cannot go in.
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:29.800]   And with that card, you can bring a lot of people, right?
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:32.480]   You can bring the whole church to Costco
[00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:34.560]   and we can all buy some cheap eggs.
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:39.440]   You know, all the organizations on earth
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:42.400]   are concerned about their own members, right?
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:45.720]   But church is the other way around.
[00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:48.340]   It's the other way around.
[00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:54.800]   How do we become a part of the heavenly kingdom?
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:58.840]   It's that we should pay attention
[00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:01.960]   to those who do not belong to us.
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:05.880]   Those people who have not heard of Christ,
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:09.320]   those people who need the gospel,
[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:11.400]   who need to hear the good news.
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:16.280]   Our ultimate concern and interest should be those people.
[00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:21.000]   That's why church community, churches,
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.480]   should always be open doors, right?
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:27.620]   I know there were a lot of concerns these days
[00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:32.180]   about church safety, shooting, and all of that.
[00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:38.300]   But let us be reminded that the church is on earth
[00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:43.400]   being planted from the heavenly kingdom above
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:46.840]   is to promote the gospel, the good news.
[00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:51.480]   Some of the actions item I would like to suggest to you,
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:57.480]   and let's apply what we have learned today in your lives.
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:03.260]   Number one, pray, pray in your own prayers.
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:08.880]   Pray that you will be able to reach out to the non-members,
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:12.380]   people around you.
[00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:15.960]   I know it's all good.
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:17.860]   We have Christian brothers and sisters,
[00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:19.760]   we can hang out together, right?
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:23.720]   Last week, I spent hours in Moody Bible Institute
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:27.400]   to have fellowship with some of the brothers and sisters
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:28.800]   in the midst of us.
[00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:33.620]   And it was such a great time we had together, right?
[00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:37.580]   We can pray together, we all talk in the same language,
[00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:42.580]   right, we all talk, we're in the same wavelength, right?
[00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:45.220]   And we enjoy it.
[00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:49.860]   There are times like this, but our ultimate concern
[00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:54.860]   is to be speaking and talking and relating and outreaching
[00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:58.380]   to those who are different from us.
[00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:01.020]   We are followers of Christ, but we want to reach out
[00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:05.020]   to those who have not heard of the gospel, right?
[00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:10.020]   Yesterday I gave rides to some of the students in the city.
[00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:14.860]   There were some students that I had never met before,
[00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:17.460]   but I gave them a ride, it was a pretty long ride,
[00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:18.420]   two hours ride.
[00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:24.580]   I drove them to some place for their exam,
[00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:26.420]   and then drove them back.
[00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:27.440]   I really enjoy it.
[00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:29.740]   I really enjoy it.
[00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:34.740]   To talk to them, to tell them what I am, right?
[00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:41.420]   So in our conversation, I met them and I introduced myself,
[00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:44.700]   and then they didn't know I'm a pastor.
[00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:49.580]   So after some hours of being together in the car,
[00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:54.580]   and then we went to lunch, and then I finally said,
[00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:55.860]   "I'm a pastor."
[00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:57.780]   And then that girl was like, "Wow."
[00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:00.260]   Her eyes was brightened.
[00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:02.380]   I don't know if it's for good or for bad,
[00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:04.620]   but, "Oh, you're a pastor."
[00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:07.620]   And then I got a nickname.
[00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:11.800]   I got a nickname, she calls me Pastor Daddy.
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:16.140]   I guess I'm so old now, right?
[00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:17.840]   The students are calling me Daddy.
[00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:23.460]   I don't know if it's a good thing or not,
[00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:28.460]   but, you know, so I was able to just represent Christ
[00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:34.300]   as I relate to them, right?
[00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:39.300]   As I provide some of the services or help them out,
[00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:42.100]   this is what we should be concerning about.
[00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:47.100]   So number one action item is that for you to pray
[00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:51.500]   that God will use you to outreach other people.
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:55.640]   Second, second action item.
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:56.780]   So funny, right?
[00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:59.980]   I didn't tell Rachel, but, you know, God bless you.
[00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:01.380]   You got some sisters.
[00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:05.640]   And number two, action item number two,
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:08.620]   is to invite others to join the fellowship.
[00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:10.500]   You know, we got social activities
[00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:13.700]   and whatever we want to outreach to other people.
[00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:17.580]   It's a great platform to invite other people to join us.
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:23.500]   Number three, when other new people are coming
[00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:28.500]   to our fellowship or our dinners or our social activities,
[00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:31.860]   you know, we need to open our hearts.
[00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:35.220]   We need to open our lives to invite them,
[00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:38.360]   to make them feel welcome, right?
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:40.420]   That's what the family of God should be.
[00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:42.760]   That's what the church should be like.
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:47.300]   So number one, pray that you will outreach to others.
[00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:51.700]   Number two, invite others to join our community.
[00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:55.880]   Number three, welcome them, right?
[00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:59.280]   Let's all pray together as we partake
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:02.980]   the communion, bread and wine together.
[00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:03.820]   Let's all pray.
[00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:13.340]   Dear Father, we give you thanks for calling us in Christ,
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.600]   that we have the privilege to hear the gospel
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:20.400]   and to believe in your name.
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:24.940]   And we want to thank you for your love.
[00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:28.760]   We want to thank you for your grace.
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:31.320]   Because of the blood of Jesus Christ,
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:34.440]   we can become heavenly citizens.
[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:38.600]   And God, we pray that you will help us
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:41.160]   to live out our heavenly citizenship.
[00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:44.780]   Let our concern, let our interest,
[00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:47.360]   is to promote your gospel.
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:50.500]   And help us to reach out to others
[00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:54.800]   and use us to invite others to join your heavenly community.
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:57.920]   And I pray that your love will fill us up.
[00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:01.680]   That we'll be your channel, we'll be your instruments.
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:04.580]   As we take the bread and the cup,
[00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:08.620]   remind us once again, once again,
[00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:11.580]   that you are our Lord, Savior.
[00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:14.360]   You are our loving Lord and God.
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:17.200]   Thank you for redeeming our lives,
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:21.460]   forgiving our sins, so that we
[00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:24.740]   are called brothers and sisters in Christ.
[00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:28.300]   Thank you for your love in Christ's name.
[00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:30.300]   The world is not a place for you to live.
