[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.920]   In Christ's name we pray.
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.840]   - Well, I wanna say Merry Christmas to all of you.
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.880]   And I think like many of you,
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.140]   Christmas can be a crazy time.
[00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.560]   It can be a very busy time.
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.280]   And this Christmas season,
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.960]   I'm thinking of fathers, mothers,
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.560]   hardworking people in the restaurants
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.920]   who are running, operating in our society,
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.200]   making sure our loved ones are being taken care of.
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.200]   And today I know many of you who are part of our church,
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.160]   you did your best to make this church a better place.
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.440]   Especially today, those who are in the backstage,
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.560]   those who prepare the table,
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.880]   those who prepare the good food that we're gonna enjoy,
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.800]   and the people and the personnel on stage,
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.840]   the musicians and all the helpers.
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.320]   I know this is a crazy, busy time,
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.200]   but it's also a time for us to slow down,
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.400]   to think about what this season is all about,
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.200]   what Christmas is all about.
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.900]   I also think of many of you,
[00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.520]   or even many of us who are joining us online
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.680]   and cannot be on site.
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.840]   I'm thinking of you because I know you're going through
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.360]   some crisis in your life,
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.740]   some troubles, some difficulties.
[00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:44.080]   And you are one of those taking care of the sick,
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.260]   the dying in your family.
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.800]   And know that God is with you.
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.880]   This is a challenging time.
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.700]   Maybe you are dealing with broken relationships.
[00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.220]   Maybe you're dealing with a lot of uncertainty.
[00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.040]   And many of us, this holiday season is not easy.
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.460]   It's a tough season.
[00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.880]   But this is the time we should turn to God.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.920]   We should turn our eyes to heaven
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.160]   because Christmas is a special time
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.360]   when we celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ,
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.960]   someone who is special.
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.920]   In Jesus Christ, we have everlasting joy,
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.720]   not happiness.
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.840]   We have everlasting peace, not temporary peace.
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.360]   In Jesus Christ, we have hope, hope that is everlasting.
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.240]   I know you probably listen to a lot of songs
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.760]   about Christmas on radio or on Spotify.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.840]   If you pay attention to some of these Christmas songs,
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.120]   Christmas hymns, some of them are hundreds of years old,
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.240]   very, very old.
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.940]   And you listen to the lyrics.
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.560]   All of these Christmas songs
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.360]   speak about the most basic human desire,
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.640]   the desire deep down in our heart.
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:30.480]   We yearn for peace in our time of chaos.
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.780]   We yearn for joy in our time of sadness.
[00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.640]   We yearn for someone to be with us, and we feel lonely.
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.080]   We yearn for hope when we see there's no end in the tunnel.
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.280]   It is no wonder that in this Christmas season,
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.240]   the rate of suicide and depression increase.
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.840]   It's no wonder.
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.720]   This is a very depressing time for many of us.
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.480]   But yes, even though we are in a difficult time,
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.640]   even though we see a lot of oppressions, injustice,
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.320]   darkness in our world,
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.680]   we are reminded on this Christmas Sunday
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.600]   that a newborn King was given to all of us.
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:30.960]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.480]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.400]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.320]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.240]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.200]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.960]   (speaking in foreign language)

[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.640]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.400]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.320]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.240]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.160]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.120]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.040]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.000]   So in this Christmas,
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.840]   we wanna turn our attention to this child.
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:04.920]   The kid, the infant was born for all of us.
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:10.040]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:18.080]   We're gonna ask the children's choir to come up here
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:23.360]   and they will help us to celebrate Christmas
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.760]   by singing two very old Christmas hymns.
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:31.600]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:56.240]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.760]   Well, let's give them a big hand again.
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.920]   (audience applauding)
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:06.440]   The first Christmas was recorded in the Bible,
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:11.680]   in the book of Matthew, Matthew chapter one.
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:16.160]   This is how Jesus the Messiah was born.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:22.000]   His mother Mary was engaged to be married to Joseph.
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.560]   But before the marriage took place,
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.000]   while she was still a virgin,
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.240]   she became pregnant through the power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:35.240]   And Joseph, to whom she was engaged, was a righteous man
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.480]   and did not want to disgrace her publicly.
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:41.800]   So he decided to break the engagement quietly.
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:45.320]   As Joseph considered this,
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:48.880]   an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.200]   "Joseph, son of David," the angel said,
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.960]   "do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.080]   because the child within her
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.920]   was conceived by the Holy Spirit.
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:06.280]   And she will have a son, and you are to name him Jesus,
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:11.000]   for he will save his people from their sins."
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.360]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:20.800]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:24.720]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:28.640]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:32.560]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:36.480]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:40.400]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:44.320]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:11.760]   Now, as you read this portion of the story of Christmas,
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.600]   this is a profound mystery,
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:18.640]   perhaps the most profound mystery of all.
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:25.040]   God himself incarnate came to our world,
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:29.880]   fully divine, but fully human.
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:33.660]   There's something beyond our rationality can explain.
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:38.320]   This is the most profound truth in the Bible.
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:42.440]   And when Joseph received the news,
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.440]   God is saying to Joseph,
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:47.520]   "My plan is different from your plan.
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:51.520]   My will is higher than your will."
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.560]   Yes, for Joseph, if you can imagine,
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:57.680]   he was trying to build his own simple family, right?
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:02.120]   Have a good life, have a small family in Israel
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.020]   to farm or to be a carpenter,
[00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:08.080]   just want to live a normal life.
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:14.560]   But God said to him, and to Mary, to this holy family,
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:20.080]   he said, "I want to send the Savior through your family."
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:24.240]   Now, this is also profound,
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:28.040]   because at times you see in this story,
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.940]   God will act in a way that is different from your plan.
[00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.140]   You may have your own plan,
[00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:35.520]   and you may have thought your plan
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.460]   is the most perfect plan of all,
[00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:40.120]   but God shows up.
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:46.560]   Christmas is telling us that God is close to us
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:50.900]   and God can do his work.
[00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:54.720]   Something that is higher than your will,
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:58.640]   something that is different than your plan.
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:03.560]   But again and again, God's way is different.
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:07.900]   Though it's different, it is the best.
[00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:11.820]   So Joseph obeyed God and took Mary,
[00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:13.720]   who was conceived by the power of God,
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:16.240]   and son was born.
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:19.460]   And because of their obedience,
[00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:24.080]   God's saving plan for all of us sinners is fulfilled.
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:28.340]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:32.260]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:36.180]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:40.940]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:44.860]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:49.060]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:52.980]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:56.900]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:01.820]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:05.740]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:09.660]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:13.580]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:17.500]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:21.420]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:26.420]   the Lord. (speaking in foreign language)
[00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:30.340]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:55.940]   Now if you read this scripture again in 121,
[00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:59.900]   in the book of Matthew, it says,
[00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:04.900]   she will have a son and you are to name him Jesus.
[00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:06.980]   Right?
[00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:08.140]   Name him Jesus.
[00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:10.180]   His name will be Jesus.
[00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:14.100]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:18.860]   Now what does it mean?
[00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:22.500]   What does the name Jesus mean?
[00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:29.180]   Now in Hebrew, Jesus will sound like this.
[00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:31.700]   Yeah, sure.
[00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:33.820]   In Greek, it's Yesu.
[00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:38.140]   In Mandarin, it's Yesu, right?
[00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:40.940]   In Cantonese, it's Yesu, right?
[00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:45.780]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:47.740]   (audience laughing)
[00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:49.780]   The name Jesus, what does it mean?
[00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:55.300]   It means saving, to rescue, to redeem.
[00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:58.340]   That's why we call him savior.
[00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:01.420]   Because the name Jesus, Yesu,
[00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:05.800]   it means to save us from something.
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:12.140]   And the story says, Jesus is gonna save us from sin,
[00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:17.720]   from death, from the power of darkness.
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:22.200]   Now as I said before, I know many of us
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.520]   are facing different challenges
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:26.840]   and seeing a lot of different forms
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:29.260]   of injustice and oppression.
[00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:34.160]   In the time of Jesus, many people thought that way too,
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:38.260]   because they were under the shadow of the Roman Empire.
[00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:43.260]   And the Roman Empire was an oppressive regime.
[00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:47.280]   And today, many of us,
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:51.320]   certainly we see some situations similar
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.560]   to what they had before.
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:57.040]   We see a situation that is oppressive
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:00.640]   in many other countries, or even in our society.
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:05.080]   Because we see all the brokenness in our world.
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:07.620]   We see sin and darkness.
[00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:12.380]   Some of the people think if we have the right policy,
[00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:15.640]   if we have the right precedent,
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:19.720]   if we have the right political power,
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:22.180]   all of these issues will be resolved.
[00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:26.300]   But the Bible cuts through all of these answers
[00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:30.920]   and telling us the root problem is sinfulness.
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:35.900]   Is that we are sinful, all of us, living in darkness.
[00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:38.120]   And we need a savior.
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:40.600]   And only Jesus himself can save us
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:44.040]   from that kind of darkness.
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:48.320]   Because until the power of sin is broken,
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.880]   all changes are superficial.
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:54.560]   Only when God came to our world in our heart
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.280]   and start to transform us,
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:58.900]   then our relationships can be reconciled.
[00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:01.880]   Our world can be changed.
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:04.320]   And that's why we celebrate Christmas.
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:06.360]   And perhaps the story of first Christmas
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:10.800]   remains the most profound mystery.
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:12.960]   Because on the first Christmas,
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:16.200]   this baby, the newborn king, was born,
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.560]   fully human and fully divine.
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:23.560]   And he is the bridge between us and God himself.
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:28.120]   Christmas shows us God is near.
[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:33.940]   Now the year of 2022 is coming to a close.
[00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:37.760]   Perhaps this year is tough and challenging for you.
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:41.280]   It's very critical for you.
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:45.020]   And my prayer is that we will all turn to God,
[00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:50.200]   knowing that only in Jesus, our newborn king,
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:54.520]   we can have true peace, true joy, and true hope.
[00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:59.040]   So as we continue to worship, we will light the candle.
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.760]   And as we light the candle,
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:05.600]   as we pass the light from one to the next neighbor,
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:09.560]   and then on and on, as we light up the room,
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:11.800]   I want you to say a prayer.
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:14.920]   Say a prayer, first of all, for yourself.
[00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:20.440]   Maybe you are facing some difficulties.
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:23.320]   Maybe you are facing some issues
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:26.060]   that is beyond your ability to solve.
[00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:28.120]   Say a prayer for yourself.
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:30.500]   Let God be your God.
[00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:34.240]   Then also say a second prayer
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:38.640]   for someone you know who is needy in this season.
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:42.560]   Maybe a family member, maybe a friend or relative,
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:43.440]   maybe a neighbor.
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:46.160]   Say a prayer for them.
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.760]   May God be with them.

[00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:59.840]   So as we continue to worship, we will light the candle
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:05.960]   and we'll pass the light from one to the other.
[00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:08.720]   I know you have some candles on your table
[00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:10.520]   and you can get that prepared.
[00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:12.840]   Make sure you get the tray ready.
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:20.120]   This is our tradition at UV in our church.
[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:24.440]   On Christmas Sunday, we will light the candle
[00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:26.080]   and pass the light.
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:29.280]   And we will light up the room together.
[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:35.240]   And this symbolizes the newborn king who has come,
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:38.000]   who has come to save us.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.600]   He dispels all kinds of darkness
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:46.920]   because light always conquers darkness.

[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:44.180]   - 1 John chapter four, for God is love.
[00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:49.520]   God show us how much he love us
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:52.480]   by sending his one and only son into the world
[00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:55.760]   so that we might have eternal life through him.
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:28:01.480]   This is real love, not that we love God,
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:06.480]   but that he loved us and sent his son as a sacrifice
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:09.480]   to take away our sins.
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:14.600]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:18.520]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:37.740]   This is love.
[00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:41.700]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:44.460]   There's no wonder why Christmas is a time
[00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:47.300]   to give gifts to each other,
[00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:51.960]   to exchange gifts with our friends.
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:56.880]   I know we will have a game of white oven later,
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:59.580]   but let's hold onto this
[00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:06.300]   because I believe it will be worthwhile
[00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:09.880]   for us to ask ourselves the question.
[00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:15.640]   Now, if you have the opportunity to ask God
[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:20.640]   for a gift in this season, what would that be?
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:24.140]   If you pray to God, you have the opportunity
[00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:28.980]   to grant you one wish, one prayer, what would that be?
[00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:33.520]   What would that be considered a gift for you in this season?
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:37.780]   Perhaps you are thinking of a lot of different things,
[00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:42.700]   perhaps a better career, a better future,
[00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:47.740]   a better relationship, a better house, a better car,
[00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:51.080]   or whatever that is better than what you have.
[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:55.840]   And I believe that God can certainly grant
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:58.500]   these good things to all of us.
[00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:01.540]   But here the Bible says,
[00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:06.180]   "God has already granted us the greatest gift."
[00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:11.020]   And this greatest gift is what we are celebrating today.
[00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:14.940]   It's the one and only Son, Jesus Christ,
[00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:19.360]   His salvation, His one and only Son
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:23.160]   who will grant us eternal life, life indeed.
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:28.660]   But this scripture tells us why does God do this?
[00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:32.800]   Why did God give us His one and only Son?
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:36.760]   Because of His love.
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:42.760]   The greatest gift is given to us because of His love,
[00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:48.980]   because it is who God is and giving us the best,
[00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:51.180]   the best gift of all.
