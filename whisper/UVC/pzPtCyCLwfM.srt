1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
 - Well, this is the best time to think about

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:06,160
 the Christmas story and especially the chapters

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,960
 that have recorded the details of the birth of Jesus.

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,120
 And you will find those chapters

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,440
 in the first book of the New Testament,

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,560
 which is the Gospel of Matthew, Matthew 1 and 2.

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,960
 And also the third book of the New Testament,

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,840
 which is Gospel of Luke, chapter 1 and 2.

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,680
 And today we're going to focus on the first two chapters

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,120
 of the Gospel of Luke.

11
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,440
 And it talks about the prophecy,

12
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,320
 the annunciation of the birth of Jesus

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,800
 and his pioneer, John the Baptist,

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:45,280
 and also the detail into the details of the birth of Christ.

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,840
 So these two chapters are the so-called Christmas story.

16
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,760
 Now, when we think about the story of Christmas,

17
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,640
 we always think about, you know, it's a kid's story.

18
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,040
 It's a children's story, right?

19
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,200
 Yeah, you can find Luke 1 and 2

20
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,160
 in almost all of the children's Bible.

21
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:09,360
 And it's for a good reason because it's easy to understand.

22
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,640
 But as we think about this story,

23
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,240
 think about the details here,

24
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,440
 you find that it is not a story for children.

25
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,440
 It is not a story for kids.

26
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,480
 And perhaps this story, Christmas, is too familiar to us,

27
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,440
 but we have to read it more carefully.

28
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,280
 And if we do that,

29
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,120
 we find that the Bible's Christmas story

30
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,440
 has so much hidden meanings

31
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,600
 and so much even political meanings.

32
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,480
 And worse, that Luke, in the first two chapters,

33
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,160
 Luke 1 and 2,

34
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:46,240
 he used these words to tell the Christmas story.

35
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,680
 And if you are the first readers of the Bible,

36
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,720
 you know, if you hop into a time machine

37
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,760
 and go back to the time of Jesus, the first century,

38
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,280
 if you hear the story, if you hear some of the words,

39
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,120
 you will find that these terms are loaded

40
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,160
 with religious and political meanings.

41
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,960
 And here I give you the summary,

42
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,000
 and the summary will tell you that

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,720
 the story is not just for kids to read.

44
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:26,400
 Here, it says, it used words like Lord, Savior,

45
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:34,160
 Light, All Peoples, Gospel, Peace, God, or Son of God.

46
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,520
 Now, I highlight those words

47
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,280
 because not only they are used in the Gospel of Luke 1 and 2,

48
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,160
 as you can tell from the first line,

49
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,520
 the Lord is being used, Angel of the Lord,

50
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:52,080
 the glory of the Lord, Christ the Lord, Christ the Lord.

51
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,320
 And then Savior, unto you is born a Savior.

52
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,440
 And then Simeon, one of the old guys in the story

53
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,760
 in the first two chapters, when he saw the baby Jesus,

54
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,000
 he said he saw salvation, Savior or salvation.

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,440
 And then Light, the word Light, what is so important,

56
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,120
 you know, it's used quite a few times

57
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,240
 in the first two chapters,

58
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,120
 Light to those in darkness, in the shadow of death,

59
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,880
 glory, light and glory,

60
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,680
 light to the nations, the Gentiles, glory to Israel.

61
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,160
 All peoples, all the world to be registered.

62
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,440
 Joseph and Mary are forced to be registered to pay taxes.

63
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,760
 Good news for all people.

64
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,280
 And then the salvation is for all peoples on earth.

65
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,960
 And then the word Gospel, we heard so many, so many times

66
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,600
 and we believe in the Gospel, we proclaim the Gospel.

67
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,720
 And it's translated good news or good news of great joy.

68
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:57,120
 And then peace, peace to guide us in the way of peace, 179.

69
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,360
 And then chapter two, verse 14, peace on earth.

70
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,560
 And of course the term God or son of God

71
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,360
 show up so many times, I don't need to give you examples.

72
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,800
 And what's so special about these terms is that

73
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:15,120
 these terms are political terms used by Augustus.

74
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,760
 Augustus was the first emperor of the Roman empire.

75
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,720
 You see the statue on the upper left.

76
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:29,600
 He used a lot of these words to proclaim himself to be king.

77
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,200
 And he proclaimed himself to be Lord and savior,

78
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,960
 the light to the nations,

79
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,720
 the light to all the peoples in the empire.

80
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,160
 He's ruling all the peoples in the Roman empire.

81
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,960
 He became king and it was the Gospel to the nations,

82
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,400
 the good news to the nations.

83
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,200
 And Augustus claimed that his rule will bring upon peace,

84
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:58,480
 bring to all people the way of peace, pex in Latin.

85
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,920
 And then he claimed himself to be God

86
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,560
 and used the title son of God in the coins

87
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,200
 and in his inscriptions.

88
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,400
 Now, all of these words highlighted

89
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,840
 are often used by the Roman emperor,

90
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,520
 starting from Augustus.

91
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,800
 In other words, if you watch the YouTube or TikTok

92
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,920
 or Netflix in those days,

93
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,600
 all the news channel in those days,

94
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:29,600
 you will be bombarded by the empire's political propaganda.

95
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,720
 The political propaganda is telling you

96
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,960
 that you need to be convinced that who bring you peace

97
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,960
 and who bring you joy and who bring you the savior

98
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,200
 and the salvation and the light.

99
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,080
 It was Augustus.

100
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,440
 It was the emperor, the Roman emperor.

101
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,200
 And you will be convinced

102
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,440
 if you watch those stories and propaganda,

103
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,520
 you have to put your faith in the Roman emperor

104
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,920
 because Augustus is God manifest.

105
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,560
 Augustus is the son of God.

106
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,080
 He is the bringer of peace.

107
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,560
 Now, if you understand this background,

108
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,920
 you understand this crystal story

109
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:14,640
 is using those political terms to apply to Jesus,

110
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,240
 apply to the baby born in manger, humble and small.

111
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,320
 You see that the Bible's crystal story

112
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,960
 counters and challenges those claims by Caesar,

113
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,120
 by the Roman emperor.

114
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,280
 It says, no, it was not the Roman king who bring you peace.

115
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,560
 It was not the emperor who bring you joy or security.

116
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,920
 The Roman empire cannot do that.

117
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,240
 The Roman empire ultimately is about domination.

118
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,280
 It's about military conquest, about oppression.

119
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,520
 That's what Roman empire is all about.

120
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,560
 And today, if you read this story,

121
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,720
 Luke is telling you there are many Caesars on earth.

122
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,880
 There are many kings and kingdoms and empires on earth

123
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,120
 are telling us the same gospels.

124
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,760
 Things like you will be satisfied,

125
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,480
 you will have security if you have this or that.

126
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,720
 If you believe in this or that,

127
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,880
 if you have this kind of relationship,

128
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,720
 you have acceptance from your peers,

129
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,200
 you have this world's measure of success

130
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,480
 or your technology and all that stuff.

131
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,280
 The big idea is the gospel.

132
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,560
 This is the gospel from the secular society,

133
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,160
 from today's world.

134
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,760
 Now, it's telling you this story,

135
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,600
 it's telling you this concept

136
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,680
 that if you possess this or that,

137
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,760
 if you own this or that,

138
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,120
 you will be totally secure,

139
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,600
 you will find fulfillment, you will be happy.

140
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,120
 That is the gospel of today.

141
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,280
 And that was the gospel in Luke's day in the first century,

142
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,320
 and Jesus came.

143
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:56,160
 The Christmas story is telling us

144
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,680
 we have to counter the claims of today's Caesars.

145
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,440
 Only Jesus Christ, the Lord,

146
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,440
 brings us peace, true peace and security.

147
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,480
 If you read Luke one and two as a whole,

148
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,680
 you find that, here's the Chinese version

149
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,760
 if you're interested.

150
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:20,000
 If you look at chapter one and two of Luke,

151
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,480
 it tells you the entire Christmas story

152
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,560
 in two chapters, two long chapters.

153
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,080
 You find that the flow of the chapter

154
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,560
 or the table of content or the outline of chapter

155
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,200
 is pretty clear.

156
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:34,080
 After the introduction, there's two annunciations.

157
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,640
 An annunciation means hearing the birth of someone.

158
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,140
 All right?

159
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,880
 The two annunciation, the first annunciation is

160
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,880
 the birth of John the Baptist, right?

161
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,320
 The pioneer of Messiah.

162
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,360
 And then the second annunciation was the birth of Jesus.

163
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:59,280
 And then after that is the two mothers meeting together,

164
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,480
 chapter 139 to 45.

165
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,360
 The two mothers is John the Baptist's mother, Elizabeth,

166
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,680
 and his husband, Zachariah.

167
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,800
 They were very, very old.

168
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,320
 They were without child,

169
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,440
 but God bring them from shame to honor

170
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,880
 and gave them a child, miracle child, John the Baptist.

171
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,880
 And that's the first mother, Elizabeth.

172
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,960
 And the second mother, of course, is Mary, right?

173
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:26,080
 Mary was pregnant by the Holy Spirit

174
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,280
 and she was carrying the child, Jesus.

175
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:34,160
 And then the two mothers met together in 139 to 45.

176
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,200
 John the Baptist was in the womb

177
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,960
 and he was lipping with joy, seeing the Savior's mother.

178
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,720
 Even in the womb, he was looking forward

179
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,320
 to the arrival of the true Savior, Jesus Christ.

180
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,680
 So the two mothers meeting together,

181
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,640
 and then Mary sang the song, the praise song, "Magnifica."

182
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,040
 And that is a very, very famous hymn.

183
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,480
 If you've been to a Catholic church

184
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,400
 or you come from a Catholic tradition,

185
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,880
 "Magnifica" is one of the most significant psalm

186
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,520
 or hymn sung by Mary.

187
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:17,280
 And then after this first praise song,

188
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,680
 is the birth of John the Baptist.

189
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,760
 So it's recording the details of his birth.

190
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,680
 And then after his birth, and he was named John,

191
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:33,600
 Zachariah, the father, burst out in praises.

192
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,840
 And that is the second song in the gospel of Luke,

193
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,280
 "Benedictus."

194
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:43,760
 He's blessing God because of his miracle,

195
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,120
 because of his promise, his faithfulness

196
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,480
 to fulfill the salvation for the people.

197
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,520
 And then chapter two is the birth of Jesus.

198
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,680
 And then after the recording of the birth of Jesus,

199
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,520
 there was song from heaven, from the heavenly angels,

200
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,440
 the angelic army singing the song together.

201
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,960
 And that is one of the most famous Christmas hymns,

202
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,840
 "Gloria in Excelsis," right?

203
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,440
 "Gloria in the highest."

204
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:20,480
 And then afterward, 222 to 240, Jesus was eight days old.

205
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,560
 And from, according to Jewish custom,

206
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,800
 Joseph and Mary need to bring the child, eight day old,

207
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,120
 to the temple in Jerusalem

208
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,160
 for circumcision.

209
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,280
 So the Lord is now in the temple,

210
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,040
 the true Lord, the true savior,

211
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,640
 although he's only eight years old,

212
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,040
 showing up in the temple.

213
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,560
 And then there were different details.

214
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,360
 They offered the sacrifice, Joseph and Mary.

215
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:52,080
 And then two elderly people, Simeon and Anna,

216
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,480
 came to meet the baby Jesus.

217
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,680
 And after Simeon saw with his own eyes,

218
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,080
 the eight day old savior,

219
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:06,080
 he burst out with another song, "Nu Dimittas,"

220
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,800
 which means, "Let me depart,"

221
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,160
 because he has been waiting, waiting, waiting

222
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,240
 for the salvation to come.

223
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,080
 And finally, in the temple court, he saw the savior.

224
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,760
 So he said, "Let me depart,

225
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,080
 "because I can now depart in peace

226
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,840
 "because the Lord is good.

227
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,200
 "The Lord has been faithful."

228
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:30,080
 And then the chapter end with 12 year old Jesus,

229
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:36,080
 and he show up in the temple again, 12 year old.

230
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:40,240
 And he was sitting there discussing the law,

231
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,560
 the law, the law of Moses with the teachers.

232
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,320
 And he was sitting there,

233
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,800
 and that is the posture of rabbi.

234
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,560
 12 year old, he was the rabbi.

235
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,280
 And he was debating and asking questions

236
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:58,560
 and actually teaching the adults about the Mosaic law,

237
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,160
 about the law and the prophet and the Old Testament.

238
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:07,280
 That's a pretty amazing chapter, chapter one and two.

239
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:11,680
 But let's reveal the stories here.

240
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,280
 And in these two chapters, who have met the Lord,

241
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,800
 who have met the savior,

242
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,000
 and experienced the true peace and true salvation?

243
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,880
 Who are these people?

244
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,600
 Now I mentioned here and there,

245
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,720
 you know, the old, right here,

246
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:34,400
 the old couple, Zachariah and Elizabeth,

247
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,160
 the parents of John the Baptist.

248
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,040
 They were really really old and they were without child,

249
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,560
 but God is, God remembers them

250
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,680
 and grant them a miracle child, John the Baptist,

251
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,160
 and then raise them from shame to honor.

252
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,600
 And then John the Baptist, while in the womb of the mother,

253
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,360
 he met Jesus in Mary's womb,

254
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,640
 and John the Baptist was leaping for joy

255
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,560
 as if I want to come out,

256
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,160
 I want to come out and see the coming of the salvation.

257
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,200
 And then Joseph and Mary,

258
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,400
 Joseph and Mary, the holy family,

259
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,040
 they were powerless as well.

260
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,280
 They were the bottom of the society

261
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,440
 under the Roman empire.

262
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,320
 In the chapter two, the shepherds,

263
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:25,360
 watching the sheep in the fields of Bethlehem,

264
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,160
 they were also the outskirt of the society.

265
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:35,360
 And then Simeon, an old man waiting for the peace of God,

266
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,640
 the salvation of God to come to reality.

267
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,400
 And finally he saw it,

268
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,040
 and he saw baby Jesus eight days old,

269
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,120
 and he praises God and sings a song, "Let me depart."

270
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,760
 And then finally there's another widow, Anna.

271
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,400
 So old widow living around the temple court

272
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,360
 to serve God for years and years and decades,

273
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,160
 and waiting to see the fulfillment of the salvation.

274
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,960
 Now in these two chapters,

275
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,280
 those common people,

276
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,520
 not the kings, not the empire,

277
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,880
 not the 1% of the population,

278
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,600
 but socially outcast, socially marginalized people,

279
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,960
 they have met Jesus because Jesus showed up to them.

280
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:34,800
 Now I want to reflect on the last song.

281
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,200
 And as I said, the last song means

282
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:42,800
 that Simeon, when he saw the salvation of God,

283
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,880
 and he burst out in praises.

284
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:50,160
 And here Luke records the story, 2.25.

285
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,880
 Now there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon,

286
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,120
 who was righteous and devout,

287
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,880
 and he was waiting for the consolation of Israel.

288
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,520
 And the Holy Spirit was upon him.

289
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,400
 It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit

290
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,560
 that he would not die before he had seen the Lord's Christ.

291
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,160
 Moved by the Spirit, he went into temple courts.

292
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,400
 When the parents, Joseph and Mary,

293
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,160
 brought in child Jesus to do for him

294
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,240
 what the custom of the law require,

295
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,920
 which is the offering,

296
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:31,360
 in 28, Simeon took the baby in his arms

297
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,960
 and praised God, saying,

298
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,080
 "Sovereign Lord, as you have promised,

299
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:40,800
 "you now dismiss your servant in peace.

300
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,560
 "For my eyes have seen your salvation,

301
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,640
 "which you have prepared in the sight of all people,

302
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,440
 "a light for revelation to the Gentiles,

303
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,120
 "and for glory to your people Israel."

304
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:00,640
 Now, this guy is an old guy, right?

305
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,560
 And he saw the salvation.

306
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:07,840
 He's socially marginalized, but he met Jesus.

307
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,160
 Now in the Roman Empire,

308
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,960
 the strong and the rich,

309
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:17,040
 they enjoy status and privilege.

310
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,800
 No, they got the money, okay?

311
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,960
 They are the Elon Musk, right?

312
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,040
 They can do whatever they want, all right?

313
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,320
 That's how the Roman world works.

314
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,960
 You have the power, you have the arms,

315
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,160
 and then you rule, and you have the privilege.

316
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,240
 You have the salvation, you have the peace.

317
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,160
 But the gospel, the Christmas gospel,

318
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,280
 is counter-empire.

319
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,920
 It's against the empire,

320
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,680
 because it proclaims that the baby born in manger,

321
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,760
 humble and low,

322
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,640
 he instead is the true God.

323
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,640
 He is the Son of God.

324
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,960
 And the true good news is that Jesus is born in Bethlehem,

325
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,000
 one without power.

326
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,800
 Even though he had power, he had all the glory,

327
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,680
 but he lay aside his glory and majesty,

328
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:15,440
 and come into our midst so that we can meet the true God.

329
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,040
 We can experience the true salvation.

330
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:24,800
 Now last Friday, I and another minister,

331
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,800
 we went to visit a very, very old lady.

332
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,800
 She was dying.

333
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,200
 So we went to Northwestern Hospital,

334
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:40,080
 and with all this obstacle we overcome.

335
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:46,000
 And then we come to the room and saw this old lady.

336
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,760
 And I've known this Christian lady for a long, long time,

337
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,400
 for decades.

338
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,360
 And she has always been faithful,

339
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,800
 and always been supportive of my ministry.

340
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,000
 So I heard about, she was not doing so well.

341
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,040
 And especially the last five days,

342
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,880
 she has not been eating,

343
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,680
 and she has not been drinking for five or so days.

344
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,120
 And she was very, very weak.

345
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,120
 So we came and visited her.

346
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,360
 And it's very interesting,

347
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:24,480
 whenever we visit someone by the sickbed,

348
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,080
 so often it was like the providence of God.

349
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,200
 And as I told you, she was without food

350
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,680
 and without water for so many days.

351
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,480
 And she was over 80 years old.

352
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:45,360
 And, but when we visited her, she was very, very alert.

353
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,840
 And it's kind of providence of God, right?

354
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:53,280
 In those hours, she was kind of, I don't know,

355
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,120
 maybe she sensed that someone's coming to visit her.

356
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:01,280
 And interestingly, she was able to open her eyes

357
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,360
 and interact with me for a little bit.

358
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,760
 So I talked to her and I said,

359
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,720
 "Oh, I'm Pastor Mark, do you recognize me?"

360
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,000
 And she blinked her eyes and tried to nod.

361
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,360
 And I read Psalm 23.

362
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,160
 I read Psalm 23 with her.

363
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,480
 And I saw her smile.

364
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,120
 I saw her eyes, those weak,

365
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,640
 but radiated with hope and joy.

366
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,400
 Now that short encounter,

367
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,160
 a visit of about maybe 15, 20 minutes,

368
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,200
 talked to her family members and talked to her.

369
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,120
 I realized this is actually what this song is all about.

370
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:51,520
 Someone who has been waiting for God's salvation.

371
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,440
 Someone who has put her hope and trust

372
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,400
 in the true Son of God.

373
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,000
 And finally, in the visitation,

374
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,840
 she kind of realized that the hope is in God

375
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,000
 and no one can take it away.

376
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,040
 And I see from her eyes, I see from her reaction,

377
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:19,360
 she was filled with joy and faith.

378
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,520
 And what a moment.

379
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,520
 And I was brought to tears.

380
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,960
 If our lives center on the promise of God,

381
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,200
 God will not fail us.

382
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,880
 Yes, we have to be patient at times,

383
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,840
 patient for the work of God.

384
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:46,000
 Sometimes we have to wait for days, weeks, months, and years.

385
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,040
 But no one has put the faith in God will fail

386
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:54,480
 because God has always been faithful to us.

387
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,720
 Now in this season of Christmas,

388
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,000
 I'm sure you are busy, right?

389
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,160
 I'm sure you're very, very busy.

390
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,680
 There are some students here

391
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:07,440
 and you're probably writing your final papers, right?

392
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,680
 Some of us by the end of the year,

393
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,400
 probably very busy at work

394
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,240
 and with your family business

395
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,240
 and taking care of different people

396
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,120
 and offering hospitality to your family members

397
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,600
 or you're flying somewhere to visit your family.

398
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,080
 People come in and out.

399
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:32,400
 And Christmas has always been a season of challenge.

400
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,560
 You know, we can say ho, ho, ho all the time, right?

401
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,960
 I don't know if you listen to the radio.

402
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,360
 It's for old guy like me.

403
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,600
 I listen to radio because when I drive,

404
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,040
 I pop in the radio to the station.

405
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:52,400
 Since Thanksgiving, I've always listening to the same song

406
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,800
 playing in the radio all the time.

407
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,680
 You know what song is that?

408
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:59,440
 It's the most wonderful time of the year.

409
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,160
 It's always playing in the radio.

410
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,720
 And you know, I must admit, you know,

411
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,920
 is it really the most wonderful time of the year?

412
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,720
 Well, not quite for me.

413
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,440
 I mean, not so bad, but it's not the most wonderful time.

414
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,680
 And I'm sure it's not the most wonderful time

415
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,120
 for many of us.

416
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,240
 It may be the most difficult time for many of us.

417
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,560
 Fill with sadness.

418
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,880
 That's why in Christmas season,

419
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,320
 most of the people commit suicide because they're depressed.

420
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,960
 They're depressed in the impression

421
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,040
 that the whole world is having a good time,

422
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,280
 but not you, right?

423
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,080
 And it gets you really, really depressive.

424
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,800
 This season can be busy, can be very, very tough for you.

425
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,960
 But I want to encourage you today as we close.

426
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,200
 As we read the Christmas story,

427
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,560
 don't forget that you should invite

428
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:04,720
 the Son of God into your life.

429
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,120
 The low and humble, true Lord and Savior.

430
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,560
 He is the one we can put our trust in.

431
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,760
 And He is the one when we invite Him into our lives

432
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,200
 to walk with us.

433
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,080
 Remember I told you when I visit the patient,

434
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,720
 which Psalm did I read?

435
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,800
 Psalm 23, right?

436
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,720
 Psalm 23, okay?

437
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,840
 You don't need to recite any Psalm in the Bible

438
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,440
 except this one, okay?

439
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,040
 Psalm 23, okay?

440
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,280
 It's applicable in all occasions,

441
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,760
 especially when those people

442
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,640
 who are walking through some tough time.

443
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,680
 Because in Psalm 23, right in the middle,

444
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:49,200
 it said, "Even though I walk through the shadow of death,

445
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,640
 "the valley of shadow of death,

446
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,120
 "you are with me."

447
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,720
 The shepherd is with you.

448
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,040
 God is with you.

449
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:03,120
 So as we close, why don't we pray together

450
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,160
 and invite Jesus to come into our lives again,

451
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:10,000
 to walk with us, no matter what we are experiencing.

452
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,440
 Let's all pray.

453
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,160
 Father, thank you.

454
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:20,240
 Thank you that you sent your Son

455
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:25,520
 who laid aside His majesty, His glory

456
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,080
 to come into our midst,

457
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:32,320
 into our lives, into our hearts.

458
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,360
 So as we close, as we reflect on

459
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,360
 the true story of Christmas,

460
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:42,960
 we want to open our hearts to invite you in.

461
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,560
 And Lord Jesus, we want to put our trust in you.

462
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:51,520
 And Lord Jesus, we want to invite you to come to our place.

463
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,600
 And thank you for your grace

464
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,200
 that you don't mind how messy our life is.

465
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,320
 You don't mind how broken we are.

466
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,840
 Yet you came.

467
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:09,520
 So we invite you to come in to be our Lord and our Savior

468
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:14,000
 and help us to open our eyes to see

469
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,000
 the true light that brings hope to all people,

470
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,160
 brings hope to us,

471
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:25,520
 can be a reality to our lives.

472
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,600
 So again, we invite Jesus to come into our lives

473
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,120
 to be a leader, to guide us,

474
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,800
 to walk alongside with us.

475
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:41,280
 Even though we may experience some tough times

476
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,720
 and challenging times,

477
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,640
 yet we know that you are with us.

478
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,440
 Thank you for being our Lord and our Savior.

479
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:54,640
 And again, help us to reflect on the true meaning of Jesus,

480
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,760
 to thank you, to give you praise,

481
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,360
 because you love us so much in Christ and pray.

482
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:05,440
 Well, once again, thank you for coming.

483
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,200
 And next week, as Kelly said, it's going to be 11.

484
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,200
 Yes, all right.

485
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,120
 And thanks again for Patrick and Kelly

486
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,520
 for preparing refreshment for us.

487
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,440
 Please enjoy the refreshment

488
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,600
 and stay for a little bit time of fellowship together.

489
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,800
 Okay, God bless.
