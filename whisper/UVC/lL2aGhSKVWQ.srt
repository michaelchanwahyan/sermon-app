1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,340
 Pastor Mark for our seminar today.

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,380
 - Welcome, morning.

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,560
 And we have some special guests here.

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,840
 Let me welcome them again.

5
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,640
 They were in the 10 o'clock Kennedy service.

6
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,220
 They are joining us in this worship service as well.

7
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,820
 And those are some of the special students

8
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,560
 from Moody Bible Institute.

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,000
 Let's welcome them, all right?

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,840
 Let's welcome them.

11
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:21,940
 (audience applauding)

12
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,340
 They're here for class assignments.

13
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,100
 They will ask some questions,

14
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,620
 so don't give them a hard time.

15
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,140
 Yeah, okay.

16
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:30,280
 Let's be friendly to them.

17
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,000
 Okay, they are Moody Bible Institute.

18
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,920
 Okay, they're from Moody, all right?

19
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,280
 Name we can trust.

20
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,680
 They're from Moody, all right?

21
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,800
 So let's see.

22
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,800
 We start a new sermon series on Good Friday and Easter.

23
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,120
 I think it's appropriate because as you can hear

24
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,800
 from the announcement, the Good Friday is approaching.

25
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,920
 And I think it's appropriate and it is the best time

26
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,360
 to reflect on the last week of Jesus,

27
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,380
 the last days of Jesus.

28
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,960
 So we turn to some of the episodes in the Gospels,

29
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,640
 Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,

30
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,120
 and think about and reflect on what Jesus has done

31
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:11,120
 and what he's doing to our lives.

32
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,560
 So as we begin the service, as we begin the sermon,

33
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,520
 I would like to do some quiz, all right?

34
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,800
 So again, some pop quiz, all right?

35
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,840
 Since we have some Moody students here,

36
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,280
 all the church people, you are not going to Moody.

37
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,100
 This is the time to show them.

38
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,440
 We know the Bible without going to Moody, okay?

39
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,280
 All right?

40
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,100
 (congregation laughing)

41
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:32,940
 This is the time, okay?

42
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,040
 This is the time we're gonna show them.

43
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,840
 We don't have to go to, well,

44
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,080
 we don't have to go to Moody

45
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,160
 and we know well the Bible, all right?

46
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,920
 So, okay, all right.

47
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,960
 So let's do it, okay?

48
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,680
 Question one, which Gospel recorded the birth of Jesus

49
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,640
 like Christmas, which Gospels?

50
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,040
 A, Matthew and Mark, B, Luke and John,

51
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,280
 C, Matthew and Luke, D, the Gospel of Mark.

52
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,360
 Which one?

53
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,920
 Well, talk to your neighbors.

54
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,820
 C, who said that?

55
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,300
 Moody students?

56
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,020
 I want, yeah, yeah, I want a non-Moody student, okay?

57
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,020
 To answer this question.

58
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:04,860
 Just show them.

59
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,460
 You know, we know the answer.

60
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,940
 Yeah, Matthew and Luke.

61
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,140
 We know the Bible, all right?

62
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,620
 So it's getting tougher, okay?

63
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,940
 Quiz two, all right?

64
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,660
 Question two, which Gospel recorded childhood

65
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,740
 and years before Jesus' pulpit ministry?

66
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,820
 Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.

67
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,260
 Which one?

68
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,260
 Huh?

69
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,220
 Can I have the,

70
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,540
 can I have the non-Moody student answer this question?

71
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,940
 Come on.

72
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:32,900
 Come on, guys.

73
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,780
 Well, no, no, no, no, no.

74
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,260
 He went to Moody.

75
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,100
 He went to Moody.

76
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,920
 James is not qualified to answer the question.

77
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,760
 Okay, here we go.

78
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,700
 C, it's Luke.

79
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,700
 Yes, yes, give her a hand, give her a hand.

80
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,340
 (audience cheering)

81
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,300
 All right, all right.

82
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,380
 She answered all the questions.

83
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,140
 No way, no way, all right?

84
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,980
 So, question three, which Gospel recorded crucifixion,

85
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,660
 death, burial and resurrection of Jesus?

86
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,860
 Which Gospel?

87
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,220
 Matthew, Mark, Luke and John or all four Gospels?

88
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,420
 What's your answer?

89
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,260
 What's your answer?

90
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,080
 Huh?

91
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,920
 Are you sure?

92
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,040
 That's your final answer?

93
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,620
 All right.

94
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,500
 Yes, it's all four Gospels, okay?

95
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,900
 All four Gospels talk about the death

96
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,980
 and resurrection of Jesus Christ, okay?

97
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,460
 So pretty good, guys.

98
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,580
 Pretty good, all right?

99
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,300
 Pretty good, but you can still go to Moody.

100
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,140
 You get better.

101
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,140
 Now, think about it.

102
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,900
 There are some important days

103
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,140
 in the calendar of Christianity.

104
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:33,060
 The Christian calendar will mark some dates

105
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,380
 as more important than others.

106
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,700
 Either in practice or in theory,

107
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,140
 Christmas is one of them.

108
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,420
 So that's why most of the churches

109
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:44,700
 will celebrate Christmas in one way or the other.

110
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,820
 Good Friday, of course,

111
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:49,540
 Easter and some church traditions

112
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:54,420
 will celebrate, will emphasize Pentecost as well.

113
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:59,060
 So these important Christian calendar events

114
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,740
 remind us what Jesus has done, right?

115
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:04,660
 The life of Jesus, the birth and his life

116
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,740
 and his death and resurrection.

117
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:11,740
 And think about what modern people

118
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:15,180
 would like to hear about the story of Jesus.

119
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,820
 How many of you have watched "Chosen"?

120
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,200
 "Chosen."

121
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,580
 Yeah, pretty good, right?

122
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:23,860
 Pretty good interpretation or rendering

123
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,220
 of Jesus' life.

124
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,540
 And think about some other Jesus movies.

125
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,860
 We modern people, modern audience,

126
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,380
 are most interested in some of the stuff

127
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,900
 that is not recorded in the Bible.

128
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,340
 Like when Jesus went to kindergarten,

129
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:48,980
 did he study or he did miracle, right?

130
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,780
 And got all A's.

131
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,460
 How did he relate to like Joseph and Mary,

132
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:58,780
 you know, his early parents.

133
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,300
 Things like this really interests us.

134
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:05,780
 In fact, in the last two verses of the Gospel of John

135
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,020
 says this, listen,

136
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:11,780
 this disciple, which is the author of the Gospel of John,

137
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:16,480
 is the one who testifies to these events of Jesus,

138
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,380
 has recorded them here in the Gospel.

139
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,460
 And we know his account of these things

140
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:25,220
 is accurate, reliable.

141
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:30,220
 Jesus also did many other things, many other things.

142
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:33,300
 He said, "If they were all written down,

143
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,980
 "I suppose the whole world, the whole cosmos,

144
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,140
 "the whole universe, the vast universe,

145
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,900
 "could not contain the books written

146
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,980
 "about all the things about Jesus."

147
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,460
 He said that.

148
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,420
 John is one of the disciples.

149
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:54,260
 He probably heard of what Jesus did when he was young, right?

150
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:58,260
 What Jesus did before his public ministry, right?

151
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,780
 All the funny things that he did

152
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,540
 or he experienced and all that stuff.

153
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,900
 You know, rabbi and students,

154
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:10,020
 they live together 24/7.

155
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,820
 So there has to be a lot of different stories, you know,

156
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:18,460
 a lot of different things that can be said of Jesus.

157
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:21,420
 But, you know, it's very interesting.

158
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:25,020
 When we go to the Bible, the content,

159
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:28,700
 majority of them has to do with Good Friday,

160
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,700
 the death of Jesus and his resurrection.

161
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,540
 Nothing else.

162
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,780
 No more speculations.

163
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:40,980
 Only focus or emphasis is right on his death,

164
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,440
 his dying and resurrection.

165
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:49,360
 Now that sets apart Jesus from all other religious leaders,

166
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,840
 all other leaders in general.

167
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,280
 You know, all the leaders, human leaders,

168
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:01,280
 they came to live a life so that we can see as an example.

169
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,640
 We can follow their example.

170
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,120
 They're good examples.

171
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,320
 Think of the heroes of the country, of the nation,

172
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,440
 the founding fathers, right?

173
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,640
 The cultural heroes, all these great stories about,

174
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,940
 you know, human, you know, inspiring figures.

175
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:22,640
 They're all, you know, living the life

176
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,640
 so that we can follow as example.

177
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:30,640
 Only Jesus came to die so we can live.

178
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:34,880
 That sets apart Jesus from all the other people.

179
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,880
 That sets apart biblical faith, Christianity,

180
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,120
 from all other faiths.

181
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,640
 And let's take a look at today's passage.

182
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,400
 It's taken from the Gospel of John,

183
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,120
 and the story has to do with preparation

184
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,000
 for nothing but Jesus' death.

185
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,400
 Again, the focus is on the death of Jesus.

186
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,560
 Chapter 12.

187
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:06,800
 Six days before the Passover celebration began,

188
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,440
 Passover again is around the time Jesus was crucified.

189
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,240
 So it's one week before the Good Friday.

190
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,800
 Jesus arrived in Bethlehem.

191
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,880
 That is the home of Nazareth,

192
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,040
 the man he had raised from the dead.

193
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,440
 Remember John, in the previous chapter, chapter 11,

194
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,440
 talk about the last miracle of the Gospel of John

195
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,400
 is raising Nazareth from the dead.

196
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:37,080
 Verse two, a dinner was prepared in Jesus' honor,

197
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,120
 and Martha was there serving,

198
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,320
 and Nazareth was among those who ate with him.

199
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,440
 He was just raised from the dead,

200
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,040
 and Nazareth was one of them joining the dinner.

201
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:53,040
 Again, Martha, Mary, and Nazareth, they are siblings.

202
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,440
 All right, so they are very close to Jesus, this family.

203
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,640
 A big dinner is there,

204
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,640
 and then Mary took a 12-ounce jar of expensive perfume

205
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,720
 made from essence of nard.

206
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,760
 Where's the nard from?

207
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,640
 It's from India, okay?

208
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,060
 It's not curry.

209
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,600
 It's from India.

210
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,520
 All the way from India and transport all the way

211
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,720
 through commerce in the Middle East.

212
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,040
 It's a very rare product,

213
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,600
 very expensive product.

214
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,600
 And Mary annoyed Jesus' feet with it,

215
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,480
 wiping his feet with her hair,

216
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,560
 and the house was filled with the fragrance.

217
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:44,040
 "But Judah is a currier, the disciple,

218
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,560
 "who would soon betray," Jesus said.

219
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:51,200
 "That perfume was worth a year's wages.

220
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,100
 "It should have been sold,

221
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,640
 "and the money given to the poor."

222
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,720
 Not that Judah cared for the poor.

223
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,960
 He was a thief,

224
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,200
 and since he was in charge of the disciple's money,

225
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,960
 he often stole some for himself.

226
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,800
 Jesus replied, "Leave Mary alone.

227
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:16,360
 "She did this in preparation of my death, my burial,"

228
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,740
 and following resurrection.

229
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:24,860
 "For my burial, you will always have the poor among you,

230
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,840
 "but you will not always have me."

231
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,600
 When all the people heard Jesus' arrival,

232
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,800
 they flocked to see him and also to see Nazareth,

233
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,960
 the man Jesus had raised from the dead.

234
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,960
 Then the leading priest of Jerusalem

235
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,340
 decided to kill Nazareth as well,

236
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:45,720
 because many people had deserted,

237
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,920
 back then Judaism, deserted the synagogues,

238
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,760
 and they believed in Jesus.

239
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:55,380
 So there's a short story, 11 verses.

240
00:10:55,380 --> 00:11:00,340
 It talks about the beginning of the final week of Jesus,

241
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,140
 and you can imagine, you know,

242
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:06,300
 Jesus was preaching the kingdom of God

243
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,820
 in the north of Israel, in Galilee,

244
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:13,480
 and slowly, step by step, he's moving away from Galilee,

245
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,820
 going down to Jerusalem in the south,

246
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:20,660
 and day after day, Jesus is talking to his disciples.

247
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:24,480
 What is his purpose of approaching Jerusalem?

248
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,440
 And now, Jesus finally, almost there,

249
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,580
 almost there, approaching Jerusalem,

250
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,740
 and he was in Bethany.

251
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:36,740
 And Bethany is a small village on the crest of Mount Olives,

252
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:41,440
 which is about maybe two miles away from Jerusalem.

253
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,300
 So it may take about, you know, 15 to 30 minutes

254
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,900
 to walk from Bethany to Jerusalem.

255
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,060
 And you can imagine the scene.

256
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:54,140
 Many people from the villages,

257
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:58,420
 they jam into the little house of Mary, Martha, and Nazareth,

258
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,780
 and they wanna see Jesus.

259
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,620
 Of course, they wanna see Nazareth as well,

260
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,620
 because they heard news of he's being raised from the dead.

261
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:08,340
 And by the way, you know,

262
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:11,460
 and here is a big dinner was prepared,

263
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,580
 and right in the middle of the dinner,

264
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:16,140
 right in the middle of this huge banquet,

265
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:21,140
 Mary, she takes the most expensive perfume,

266
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:25,260
 the most valuable thing in her house, probably,

267
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,260
 and she breaks it.

268
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:30,620
 And the perfume, the fragrance,

269
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:33,260
 permeates the entire house.

270
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:37,180
 You know, you can imagine, this is a beautiful picture.

271
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,860
 It's a beautiful scene.

272
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,260
 And in this short story,

273
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,340
 there are at least two main characters,

274
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:47,180
 Judas and Mary.

275
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,740
 Well, let's talk about Judas first.

276
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,740
 Verse four, what did he say?

277
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:55,220
 In this beautiful scene, he said,

278
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:59,820
 "That perfume worth a year's wages,

279
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,180
 "and it should be so,

280
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:07,180
 "and the money we gain can be offered to the poor."

281
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:10,980
 And there's a footnote there.

282
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,140
 He didn't really care about the poor.

283
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:16,060
 He was a thief, and he was in charge of the church money.

284
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,820
 He was in charge of the offering.

285
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:22,140
 You know, when Jesus go from village town into city,

286
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:25,940
 preaching the gospel, preaching the kingdom of God,

287
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:29,540
 many people supported Jesus, right, men and women,

288
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:33,060
 and they offered the resources, and sometimes food,

289
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,860
 sometimes money, to support the ministry

290
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,700
 of the disciples and Jesus.

291
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:42,340
 And Judas was, I think, the elected court team

292
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,100
 to take care of the finance, right?

293
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,620
 Maybe he was gifted, maybe he was an accountant.

294
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:50,940
 I don't know, yeah, maybe different reasons,

295
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,300
 he was in charge of the money of the disciples.

296
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,140
 And you can imagine, you know, with all the people there,

297
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:02,900
 this is something worth recording.

298
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:08,580
 The gospel of John recorded this conversation, this dialogue,

299
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,540
 and Judas said, you know, these things.

300
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:16,220
 Now, imagine with me a spectrum, a spectrum.

301
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:22,980
 All the way to our left is someone or some people

302
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,540
 who oppose or reject the gospel.

303
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:30,340
 And then slowly, you move to the right.

304
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:33,380
 There may be doubters, right?

305
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:37,140
 They question about the faith, and probably sincerely,

306
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,740
 they wanna find out what Jesus is all about.

307
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:43,220
 And then there are seekers, more serious about learning

308
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,060
 about the faith, and then finally,

309
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,260
 they became so-called believer.

310
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,220
 Now, this is a simplistic spectrum, right?

311
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,860
 I'm not saying there's a difference between believers

312
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,580
 and disciples or servant, right?

313
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,340
 They are all the same.

314
00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:00,380
 In this scheme, however, you can imagine someone's moving

315
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:03,220
 from seeking the faith and then believing,

316
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,940
 and then being his disciples,

317
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:09,700
 and then being his followers, even serving, right?

318
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:14,220
 Now, in this scheme, where do you put Judas?

319
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,500
 Where do you put him?

320
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:21,300
 Where do you put him, the betrayer?

321
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:29,500
 Somewhere from the right all the way to the left, right?

322
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:35,980
 As time go by, he moves from the right

323
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,060
 all the way to the left.

324
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:43,420
 And very interesting, right?

325
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,260
 Very interesting.

326
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:47,700
 How does one, how does a person move

327
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:51,780
 from the right to the left, right?

328
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:55,700
 How does someone who has been a disciple for three years,

329
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,620
 he was personally called by Jesus himself, right?

330
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,780
 Judas was called to be one of the 12,

331
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:05,140
 personally called by Jesus when he began his ministry.

332
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:08,700
 And Judas, among the 12,

333
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:13,700
 he actually experienced the power of the kingdom, right?

334
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:17,620
 The relationship with Jesus firsthand.

335
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:22,780
 And he was initially trusted by the group

336
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,140
 to take care of the money.

337
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:30,020
 And then eventually, Judas moved slowly to become a doctor.

338
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:35,900
 And then finally, someone who rejects Jesus and betray him.

339
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,580
 What is going on?

340
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:42,020
 And I think the root of it may not be money.

341
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:47,140
 I think the root of it is self-interest, self-interest.

342
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:52,380
 Now, Judas may be called a tip of the iceberg

343
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,260
 in the Jewish population of the day.

344
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:58,740
 You know, the context of Jesus' story

345
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,940
 is Roman military occupation.

346
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,580
 The Jewish people were suffering

347
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:07,020
 and they were being oppressed by the Roman empire.

348
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:10,380
 So they were looking for some sort of Messiah.

349
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,940
 Now, everybody was looking for a Messiah,

350
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:15,300
 you know, in those days and in today, right?

351
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,220
 We are all looking for some sort of salvation.

352
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:20,180
 We are all looking for some solution

353
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:24,060
 to our supposed human problem.

354
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:28,420
 In those days, the Jews were looking for a political solution

355
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,420
 to kick out the Romans,

356
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,900
 people that they don't like, oppressing them.

357
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:38,340
 So this Messiah should come and to help us,

358
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,420
 you know, start a revolution or something

359
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:45,060
 and to do some change in our political situation

360
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,660
 so that we can have freedom, right?

361
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:50,900
 You know, most of the Jews would think

362
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:55,140
 that the immediate problem is the Roman empire.

363
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:59,300
 This is our problem and we want political change.

364
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,260
 Now, don't get me wrong, you know,

365
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:05,220
 there's so many social change,

366
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:09,060
 so many different political changes are good, all right?

367
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:12,660
 They bring about common good, you know, common grace.

368
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,540
 Don't get me wrong.

369
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:18,260
 I'm not saying, actually, you know, in recent history even,

370
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:21,220
 there were many social changes

371
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:26,220
 were initiated by Christian leaders, right?

372
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,260
 Like slavery.

373
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,540
 Now, some of the social changes are good,

374
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,860
 but they are not the ultimate good.

375
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,500
 They're not the ultimate good.

376
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,420
 And Jesus come along and say,

377
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:44,420
 "Yeah, you can change from one political power to another,

378
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:49,660
 "but you are simply changing the external, right?

379
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:53,740
 "The outside, the external configuration, right?

380
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:56,780
 "Because you topple one regime,

381
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:59,260
 "you replace it with another, right?

382
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:03,540
 "You take care of one system

383
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:06,700
 "and then you replace it with another system,

384
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,340
 "and then it will go corrupt."

385
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:13,380
 And we are in the same situation, right?

386
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,820
 And Jesus come along saying,

387
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,980
 "Yes, I'll do some changes.

388
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,940
 "I'll do some revolution,

389
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:21,380
 "but the revolution I'm bringing about

390
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,500
 "is not the external.

391
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,660
 "It's from the inside out.

392
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:28,980
 "The grace of God, the love of God, the kingdom of God."

393
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:33,060
 And this is what I'm coming to do.

394
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,820
 I am coming to atone your sin.

395
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,020
 This is the very root of a human problem,

396
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,580
 the heart of the problem, the heart of the issue.

397
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,940
 It's our heart, right?

398
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,180
 It's the human heart.

399
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,300
 We are corrupt and we are sinful,

400
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:49,180
 and we need God to redeem us.

401
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,700
 And that's why the cross is necessary.

402
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:57,900
 You know, I've searched in the church for some years.

403
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:03,540
 You probably experienced church for quite some time.

404
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:08,540
 And there are many different people that I encounter.

405
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:12,700
 They come to the church, they come to faith

406
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:15,940
 with different reasons.

407
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:20,300
 But my general conclusion is that most of the people,

408
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:24,940
 they don't ask enough questions.

409
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:30,700
 They don't struggle with the cross enough.

410
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:35,180
 They look at the church or look at Jesus from the outside.

411
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:38,620
 Oh, he's such a good moral teacher

412
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:42,100
 and such a good example we can follow.

413
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,700
 And I come to church, most of the people,

414
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,100
 with some other reasons than coming to faith.

415
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,380
 There are some benefits coming to church, right?

416
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,940
 Don't you think?

417
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,620
 Maybe I can get connected with someone

418
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,860
 and then I'll get a new job, right?

419
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:00,060
 I come to church with some benefit too, right?

420
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:04,020
 Recently I hurt my knee and there are two PTs here,

421
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:08,660
 physical therapists, and then I get the service for free.

422
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,660
 (audience laughing)

423
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,220
 Just a little bit, right?

424
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,660
 Not to take advantage.

425
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,660
 I mean, there has to be some benefit

426
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,620
 when we come to church or come to faith.

427
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,460
 However, Jesus is challenging us,

428
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:22,260
 or the gospel is challenging us,

429
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,460
 to look at the real emphasis,

430
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:27,300
 which is the necessity of the cross.

431
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,740
 Why is the cross necessary?

432
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:34,580
 Now we come to the second character, which is Mary.

433
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,940
 Now Mary is also a disciple.

434
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:39,580
 Jesus did something really extraordinary

435
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,340
 when he was preaching the kingdom of God.

436
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:45,740
 As a rabbi, he actually had female disciples, right?

437
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:49,180
 All the women following him and supporting his ministry,

438
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:51,420
 and Mary was one of them.

439
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:57,340
 So Mary, like Judas, she had witnessed the power of Jesus.

440
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:03,900
 Remember before chapter 12, it was chapter 11.

441
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,500
 That was the greatest miracle in the gospel of John.

442
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:11,060
 Jesus raised Nazareth from the dead,

443
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,980
 brought his brother back to life.

444
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,940
 So Mary has experienced God firsthand as well,

445
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,420
 experienced Jesus firsthand.

446
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,980
 So she knew Jesus had come into the world for some purpose.

447
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,660
 And that's why we have the story.

448
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:30,540
 She broke the jar of perfume to wipe those on Jesus' feet.

449
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:33,860
 To do what?

450
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:39,940
 Because she realizes Jesus comes to die, to die for us.

451
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:47,740
 That's the only way to bring us back to God.

452
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:50,500
 Jesus dies to save us.

453
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:52,660
 Look at verse three.

454
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,740
 It's a short verse,

455
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:58,620
 but it's like the camera zooming in

456
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:01,540
 to what Mary is doing to Jesus.

457
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:04,380
 She did not hold back anything.

458
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:10,740
 She gave the best gift, a costly gift, a perfume.

459
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:18,460
 In those days, it probably could be sold for 300 denarii.

460
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:23,700
 It's about 300 silver coins.

461
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,780
 No, it's 300 silver coins.

462
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:29,580
 It's equivalent to almost a year's salary,

463
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,940
 your whole year's salary.

464
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:33,620
 What is your whole year's salary?

465
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,780
 What is yours?

466
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,820
 Well, tax day is coming.

467
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:40,500
 So you should know, right?

468
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,380
 How much do you earn a year?

469
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:45,660
 A lot.

470
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:48,220
 Well, maybe for some people a little poor.

471
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,300
 A lot.

472
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:54,780
 So she broke it and offered it to Jesus.

473
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:58,300
 Now, in those days, when people had dinner,

474
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,740
 they did not sit up straight, right?

475
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,020
 They reclined on couches.

476
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,460
 That's why their feet are sticking out, right?

477
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:08,020
 So you can imagine this crowded house,

478
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:10,700
 a cozy dining table,

479
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:15,060
 and then Mary came and she annoyed Jesus,

480
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,780
 his feet with the perfume.

481
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:21,460
 And look at how the camera zoom in.

482
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:25,140
 He not only annoyed it with the perfume,

483
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:28,780
 she was wiping his feet with her hair.

484
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:34,300
 In those days, a lot different from today,

485
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:37,740
 women don't unbind their hair in public.

486
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:40,820
 It is a disgrace.

487
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:43,540
 It is humility, humiliation.

488
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:46,740
 So you see what Mary is doing is

489
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:51,740
 she is taking the lowest, lowest, lowest possible place,

490
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:57,260
 humble herself to love Jesus.

491
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:01,340
 You know, consider the entire story of the Gospel of John.

492
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:05,020
 Jesus begins ministry in chapter one, all the way.

493
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,780
 And there were seven miracles.

494
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,620
 There were different teachings of Jesus.

495
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:12,540
 And it goes on for some years, for almost three years.

496
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,820
 And Jesus moved from Galilee in the North

497
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,700
 to Jerusalem in the South.

498
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:19,220
 And he told his disciple many times

499
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:22,980
 that he came to die,

500
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,020
 to be betrayed,

501
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:25,860
 to be condemned,

502
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,180
 to be crucified.

503
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:33,420
 And he said also on the third day, he will rise again.

504
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:36,460
 Now, why do we need the cross?

505
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:38,660
 Why do we need the cross?

506
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,460
 The disciple didn't understand, right?

507
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,820
 They debate about it.

508
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:44,180
 In fact, before Jesus went to the cross,

509
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:47,100
 they were fighting among themselves, right?

510
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,340
 Who's gonna be the highest?

511
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:52,500
 Who's gonna be the king when the kingdom comes, right?

512
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,220
 They thought Jesus was the political Messiah

513
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,940
 to solve their own perceived problem,

514
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:02,260
 the political problem, not the heart problem.

515
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,620
 So the disciple didn't understand

516
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:06,060
 why the cross was necessary.

517
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,740
 So here it is.

518
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:12,740
 We need to think and struggle more about the cross.

519
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,060
 About the cross.

520
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,900
 Why is the cross necessary?

521
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:21,020
 For modern years, we as modern readers,

522
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:25,020
 sometimes we think of the cross like blood,

523
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:27,020
 very painful.

524
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:33,340
 It's not according to our taste, right?

525
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:38,340
 And we often think that if God is all loving,

526
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:42,140
 why can't he just forgive, right?

527
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,860
 Why can't he just forgive and forget, right?

528
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:47,020
 And then we move on, right?

529
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,220
 We often think that way.

530
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:51,780
 Just like your computer crashed, right?

531
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:55,020
 We format your drive, right?

532
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,220
 You buy a new computer and you start all over again.

533
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:59,900
 Why can't, what's up with God, right?

534
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,260
 Why can't he just forgive and forget, right?

535
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,780
 And we often think in this terms.

536
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:09,500
 Now I want you to struggle with me.

537
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:14,860
 Why the Bible says the cross is necessary.

538
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:20,780
 Jesus has to die, has to come to the cross.

539
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:25,780
 Imagine if someone really, really wrong you,

540
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:28,580
 if someone really, really wrong you,

541
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:33,260
 the perpetrator, the oppressor,

542
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:38,180
 the one who sinned against you,

543
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:41,580
 can he just come to you and say, "I'm sorry,

544
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,020
 can we start all over again?"

545
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:46,140
 Would you take that?

546
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:49,580
 I mean, someone really wrong you, okay?

547
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,060
 Someone really wrong you.

548
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:53,260
 It's not trivial stuff, right?

549
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:56,700
 For trivial stuff, we can just forget and go on, right?

550
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,140
 If someone really wrong you,

551
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:01,940
 you know, took away your, maybe your name, your future,

552
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:06,060
 your happiness or your reputation,

553
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:09,900
 something really wrong has done to you, you know?

554
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:13,100
 There has to be a cost.

555
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:16,380
 There has to be a debt, right?

556
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,460
 Either you pay for the cost,

557
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,940
 or the perpetrator pays for the cost,

558
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:24,220
 or you both share the cost, right?

559
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,820
 When my kids were younger,

560
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:29,220
 when they were, you know, they sit in the car

561
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,900
 and, you know, we driving,

562
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:34,340
 and I remember one day, they don't remember anymore,

563
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:38,420
 but they asked, you know, "What if we crash the car,

564
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,940
 right, damage the car,

565
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:43,460
 or somebody else damage our car, what will happen?"

566
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:46,100
 I said, you know, "The insurance will pay for it."

567
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,340
 And then, back then, they were so much younger,

568
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:51,660
 they didn't understand, they were so happy.

569
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,220
 "Oh, because somebody is paying for it,

570
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:56,980
 so that's cool, that's cool," right?

571
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,540
 What you don't understand is

572
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:01,740
 if there was some damage done to you,

573
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,580
 there has to be a debt that has to be paid for.

574
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,900
 Someone has to pay for it.

575
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:09,460
 Right?

576
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:14,700
 And again, if you think about most of the wrongs

577
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:19,700
 done to people, cannot be calculated in terms of dollars.

578
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:25,460
 No matter how much compensation is being fought for,

579
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:28,460
 it's just not eloquent, right?

580
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,620
 Someone may have hurt you,

581
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:32,140
 or robbed you of something that is important.

582
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:35,620
 You can't put a price tag on those things, right?

583
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:38,500
 Now, in this situation, imagine with me,

584
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:42,820
 you know, there are two options.

585
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:48,340
 The first option is retaliate, right?

586
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,020
 You do the same thing to the person

587
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:52,580
 who did the same thing to you, right?

588
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,940
 But is that a good option?

589
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,900
 Maybe not, right?

590
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,300
 Because it's a vicious cycle, right?

591
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,620
 Evil, and then evil, and then evil.

592
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:04,700
 Hurt people, hurt people, right?

593
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,700
 You heard about that?

594
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:09,660
 Hurt people, always hurt people.

595
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:11,580
 That's the first option.

596
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:15,260
 The second option, what may be called the redemptive option.

597
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:21,140
 The redemptive option is going after justice and forgiveness.

598
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:25,900
 Justice and forgiveness.

599
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:30,500
 And this option is redemptive, is sacrificial,

600
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:35,500
 because the price has to be paid, right?

601
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,860
 Think about in very simple human term, right?

602
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:41,020
 Someone has done something wrong to you,

603
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:44,300
 someone has to pay.

604
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,580
 Even you say, you know, I'm not gonna retaliate,

605
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,860
 I'm gonna forgive, you know, right away.

606
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,980
 I'm gonna forgive, but you know, think about it,

607
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:53,940
 dynamic is that you take the pain,

608
00:30:53,940 --> 00:31:00,180
 someone take the cost, someone pay for the cost.

609
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:04,220
 That's why people said forgiveness is suffering.

610
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:10,060
 It is suffering, because we suffer and take the cost.

611
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:17,420
 You know, all of those redemptive elements

612
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:21,180
 in this kind of dynamics is sacrificial.

613
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,740
 And think further,

614
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:31,180
 all redemptive actions are sacrificial and life-changing.

615
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:36,700
 We parents, we know that, right?

616
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:40,220
 I don't know how many times I sacrificed

617
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:45,900
 in order to give life to somebody else, right?

618
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:49,540
 I reorder my life priority

619
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:52,180
 in order to give life to the other person.

620
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:57,180
 If I don't do that, their life will be in ruin, right?

621
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:01,980
 Parents do that, lovers do that, friends do that.

622
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:05,780
 Now imagine with me, you know,

623
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:09,380
 those things times a factor of infinity.

624
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:15,700
 That God himself, who is totally holy and pure,

625
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:21,140
 and we violate evil, we did evil.

626
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:22,900
 We sin.

627
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:29,180
 This is what amazing about the cross,

628
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:32,660
 that God himself chooses to love us.

629
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:36,140
 And that's why Jesus had to sacrifice himself

630
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,780
 to pay for the debt of sin.

631
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:42,220
 The debt of sin incurred by us

632
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:45,260
 sinning against the holy, eternal God.

633
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:47,500
 It's an eternal relationship being ruptured.

634
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:52,340
 Jesus has to come and pay for the debt on the cross.

635
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:56,300
 And when you truly believe that,

636
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:59,060
 when you really take this love into your heart,

637
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:02,340
 you should change from the inside out.

638
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:08,380
 You should gradually change your perspective on things,

639
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,940
 your relationship with God, your serving,

640
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:13,740
 all that you do and all that you make

641
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,980
 in terms of decisions.

642
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:18,940
 You will orient yourself toward the cross,

643
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:21,940
 you're toward the God who loves you.

644
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:25,020
 Mary does this.

645
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:28,820
 She realized the cross, the sacrificial death,

646
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:33,420
 the substitutionary atonement,

647
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:35,980
 someone paid for your debt.

648
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,180
 That's the only way we can come back to God.

649
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:44,060
 And this is her last chance to honor this death,

650
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:48,420
 to honor what Jesus has done for her.

651
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:52,980
 Anoint his body, his feet with perfume.

652
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:56,300
 Respond with love and sacrifice in a generous way.

653
00:33:56,300 --> 00:34:01,100
 When you respond to God, the love of God,

654
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,820
 with the same love,

655
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:06,380
 your life will be changed inside out.

656
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:11,100
 We're gonna sing our last song, our response song.

657
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:14,340
 I'll invite the praise team to come back up here.

658
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:19,580
 I want you to, as we sing the song again,

659
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:24,540
 imagine what is going on in Bethany,

660
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,980
 what Mary did.

661
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:32,420
 And think with me, and struggle with me,

662
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,140
 why the cross is necessary.

663
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:36,540
 Why is it necessary for you?

664
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:40,580
 And you respond appropriately.

665
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,660
 To the cross.

666
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:47,060
