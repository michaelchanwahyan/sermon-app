1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
今日嘅中文講完係Mark Sir 而家將時間交畀佢

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
大家好 今日好高興見到大家

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
我知道今日係打世界盃

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
而家打下下半場

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
後面工作人員話畀我聽

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
2比0 阿根廷係贏緊

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
ok 大家好安心

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
可以聽到

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
都唔使睇

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
點都好

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
我哋繼續去迎接張琳琦

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
張琳琦的Advent Season

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
聖誕節就嚟到

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
我哋思想一下聖誕節

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
我哋可以有好多問題問

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
譬如聖誕節 啲舊嘢

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
即係有啲唔同嘅symbol

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
唔同嘅記號

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
唔同嘅蠟燭等等

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
喺邊度嚟嘅呢

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
譬如有啲問題係聖誕老人

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
呢舊嘢係邊度嚟

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
唔知

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
聖誕老人係主後大概

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
二百幾年 大概三百年

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
有個人叫聖尼克勒斯

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
呢個主教

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
係一個基督徒嘅主教

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
聽講佢就係

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
喺傳記裏面講

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
就係一個好樂意去

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
行善嘅一個人

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
去對其他有需要嘅人

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
好盡心去幫助

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
正因為咁嘅緣故

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
所謂聖誕老人就係從

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
聖尼克勒斯慢慢慢慢

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
嚟到去

39
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
演變出嚟

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
個燈有少少壞

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
等間下午我哋就會

42
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
掉咗佢個燈

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
另外一個問題

44
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
我去問 除咗聖誕老人之外

45
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
就係呢個聖誕節

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
日子

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
係點樣嚟嘅呢

48
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
咁

49
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
十月廿五號 聖誕節

50
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Christmas day

51
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
都幾distracting

52
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
不過唔緊要

53
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
聖誕嘛

54
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
有少少斬燈係ok嘅

55
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Thank you

56
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Anyways 聖誕日子

57
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
係邊度嚟㗎呢 有一個嘅說法

58
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
就係話喺

59
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
早期嘅教會

60
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
嗰陣時

61
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
以前嗰個羅馬帝國

62
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
羅馬帝國

63
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
就有一個慶祝太陽神

64
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
嘅一個節日

65
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
而嗰個太陽神嘅節日呢 就係啱啱

66
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
係呢一個嘅時間

67
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
咁所以到呢個嘅教會

68
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
開始喺歐洲

69
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
或者西方嘅世界

70
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
去到受到人

71
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
重視嘅時候 佢哋就攞咗呢個

72
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
節日呢 嚟到去取締咗

73
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
將耶穌嘅降生

74
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
取締咗呢一個

75
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
嘅太陽神嘅節日

76
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
咁當時佢哋就會送禮

77
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
咁然之後呢 教會嘅傳統

78
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
將佢取締咗之後 又會將

79
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
一啲民間裏面

80
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
有嘅

81
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
呢啲嘅

82
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
做法 佢哋會攞咗佢出嚟

83
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
所以呢 如果係咁樣睇法嘅話

84
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
聖誕節呢 係一個

85
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
counter cultural

86
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
celebration 嚟嘅

87
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
即係話呢 世界點樣去

88
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
慶祝 慶祝嘅就係太陽神

89
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
假嘅神 但係呢

90
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
基督教嘅教會

91
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
就攞咗呢個嘅節日呢

92
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
嚟到去

93
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
慶祝真正嘅

94
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
救主 耶穌嘅理能

95
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
呢個係另一個說法

96
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
另外一個嘅說法

97
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
點解會有聖誕節呢個節日

98
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
就係

99
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
初期教父

100
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
或者初期嗰啲嘅church fathers

101
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
佢哋去計呢 耶穌

102
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
出世嗰日

103
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
係幾時呢 佢當時就諗呢

104
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
一定係passover嘅時候

105
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
係童貞女瑪利亞

106
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
感人

107
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
所以一數就係

108
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
九個月 佢當時係計九個月

109
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
唔係十月懷胎 九個月懷胎

110
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
所以十二月廿五號

111
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
就係耶穌正式出世嘅時候

112
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
咁所以有啲著作

113
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
就講到討論到Christmas day

114
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
係幾時 佢由passover

115
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
一路計就計九個月

116
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
因為咁嘅緣故

117
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
所以就有十月廿五號

118
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
但係當然

119
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
另外一個問題就係 到底個passover係幾時

120
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
咁所以有唔同嘅說法

121
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
就講話passover前前後後

122
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
爭少少

123
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
咁所以今日就唔係淨係十月廿五號

124
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
係某啲教會嚟到慶祝Christmas

125
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
譬如東方嘅教會

126
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Orthodox Church 佢哋就會係一月嘅時候

127
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
先會慶祝

128
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
呢個Christmas day

129
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
因為大家計個passover嗰日開始

130
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
就係有啲唔同

131
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
但我哋可以用呢啲咁嘅問題

132
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
嚟到去討論一下聖誕節

133
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
但係一樣嘢一定要做嘅

134
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
就係睇下聖誕

135
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
聖經係點講

136
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
你諗起聖誕節 諗起乜嘢

137
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Christmas day

138
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
好似一啲童話故事咁

139
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
即係有啲好可愛嘅嘢

140
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
或者有啲

141
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
好安詳嘅

142
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
衣景咁

143
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
聖經裏面係點講

144
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
你越睇嘅時候

145
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
你就越發現

146
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
唔係一個咁簡單嘅故事

147
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
我哋睇幾節經文

148
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
路加福音第一章

149
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
路加福音第一章

150
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
第二章就係講到聖誕

151
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
你記得喺聖經裏面

152
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
只係得兩本書

153
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
兩本福音書

154
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
係講到Christmas

155
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
第一本

156
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
係邊本呀

157
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
馬太福音

158
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
第二本就係路加福音

159
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Gospel of Luke

160
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
第一章第五節

161
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
當希律作猶太王嘅時候

162
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
亞比亞班裏面

163
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
有一個祭司

164
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
叫做撒加利亞

165
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
佢嘅妻子

166
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
係亞倫嘅後代

167
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
就叫做Elizabeth

168
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
伊利沙伯

169
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
佢哋兩個人在神嘅面前

170
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
都是二人

171
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
進行主一切嘅

172
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
誡命同埋條例

173
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
會有可指責的

174
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
指示佢哋會有孩子

175
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
因為Elizabeth係畢生奴

176
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
兩個人呢亦都係年紀老邁

177
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
呢度第一次

178
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
嚟到去講聖誕節嘅故事

179
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
就介紹嗰個嘅場景

180
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
呢度講到大希律

181
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Hell the Great

182
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
佢作王嘅時候

183
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
就發生咗一件事

184
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
就係有兩個夫婦

185
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
係年紀老邁嘅

186
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
係沒有兒子嘅

187
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
呢個係第一個嘅介紹

188
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
第二個介紹呢就係第二章第一節

189
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
嚟到講開呢個嘅

190
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
聖誕節附近發生嘅

191
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
一啲事蹟

192
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
第一節

193
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
當那斯人子

194
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
凱撒奧古斯督

195
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Augustus

196
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
有意旨下來

197
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
叫天下人民都報名上策

198
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
呢個時候呢

199
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
亦都係居里紐

200
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
作Syria

201
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
敘利亞巡撫嘅時候

202
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
係頭一次去到行

203
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
報名上策嘅事

204
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
眾人就各歸各城

205
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
報名上策

206
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
我睇咗兩節經文

207
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
兩節經文就提到

208
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
當時一啲歷史嘅人物

209
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
歷史人物唔係聖經提過

210
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
當然 聖經以外

211
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
好多歷史著作

212
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
或者傳記都會提到

213
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
有邊幾個

214
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
有大希律第一章第五節

215
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
有奧古斯督

216
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
有居里紐

217
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
呢三個

218
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
都係當時嘅歷史人物

219
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
唔單止係咁

220
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
亦都係當時有權有勢嘅人

221
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
好大power嘅人

222
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
甚至係有absolute power

223
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
大希律

224
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
當然就係管猶大地

225
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
即係巴勒斯坦

226
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
以色列呢個地方

227
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
即係當時

228
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Roman Empire嘅

229
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
東面嘅防線

230
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
另外就係

231
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
奧古斯督

232
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
就係整個地中海世界統一天下嘅

233
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
emperor

234
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
第三個就係居里紐

235
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
居里紐就係

236
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
管 頭先提到

237
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
以色列巴勒斯坦地

238
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
一個大啲嘅省份叫做敘利亞

239
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Syria

240
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
呢一個嘅官就係居里紐

241
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
三個

242
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
都係歷史人物

243
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
三個都係有權有勢

244
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
可以呼風喚雨嘅人

245
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
當以前

246
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
去到提到

247
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
某啲人出世嘅時候

248
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
特別係

249
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
一啲歷史著作

250
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
特別係名人

251
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
先會有啲所謂birth story

252
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
可以講

253
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
即係佢出世嘅時候幾巴閉

254
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
出世嘅時候有人提過

255
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
出世嘅時候發生啲乜嘢事

256
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
呢啲所謂birth story

257
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
都係畀一啲hero

258
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
或者畀當時係最重要

259
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
最重要嘅

260
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
譬如奧古斯督

261
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
當時有absolute power嘅嘢

262
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
係管理

263
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
整個嘅地中海嘅世界

264
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
係佢嗰啲嘅

265
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
出生嘅

266
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
記載

267
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
嗰啲嘅birth story

268
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
講到佢邊年邊月出世

269
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
講到佢出世嘅時候

270
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
佢就帶嚟福音文

271
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Gospel

272
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
講到佢出世嘅時候就帶嚟

273
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
有大嘅喜樂

274
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
joy

275
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
good things

276
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
佢出世嘅時候

277
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
亦都係

278
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
眾民 整個嘅天下

279
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
裏面嘅人民

280
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
嘅救主

281
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
saviour

282
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
亦都係當時帝國嘅主宰

283
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
甚至有一啲嘅

284
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
文獻話佢就係son of gods

285
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
即係眾神嘅

286
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
兒子 天子

287
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
奧古斯督

288
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
亦都係嗰一位帶嚟

289
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
新嘅peace

290
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
佢哋叫做Roman peace

291
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Pax Romanum

292
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
帶嚟一個新嘅kingdom

293
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
一個新嘅國度

294
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
所以奧古斯督嘅生日係每年都會慶祝

295
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
等於一個今日

296
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
名人

297
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
我哋每年都會去到

298
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
記得 某年某日

299
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
就係佢嘅birthday

300
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
就係佢嘅生日

301
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
係一啲世界舞台上面嘅主角

302
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
兩節經文

303
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
我哋睇咗呢啲

304
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
重要嘅人物

305
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
但好奇怪 路加介紹嘅時候

306
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
呢啲人呢

307
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
就有咩地位呢

308
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
佢哋就唔喺舞台嘅中間

309
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
佢變成咗舞台嘅背景

310
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
唔係foreground

311
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
係background

312
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
當時人人聽見呢個名

313
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
都會諗起佢嘅事蹟

314
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
諗起佢嘅故事

315
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
佢哋係世有權嘅男人

316
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
有absolute power嘅人

317
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
每每睇到佢哋嘅時候

318
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
佢哋世界上面 梗係舞台嘅中間

319
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
foreground

320
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
路加福音

321
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
去到介紹

322
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
耶穌出世嘅事蹟

323
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
講到施洗約翰

324
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
作為佢嘅前鋒

325
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
嘅pioneer 講到耶穌嘅出世

326
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
都係

327
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
將到佢哋調返轉

328
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
路加福音第一章

329
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
頭先我講過

330
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
大希律作為背景

331
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
有咩人

332
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
有伊利沙伯

333
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
伊利沙伯

334
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
係

335
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
兩夫婦同埋撒加利亞

336
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
兩夫婦都係

337
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
畢生慾同埋係年紀老邁

338
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
如果你將聖經

339
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
你去查嘅時候

340
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
你當呢啲咁嘅statement係social statement

341
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
即係話畀你聽

342
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
一啲描述

343
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
係講到佢哋社會嘅地位

344
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
你就知道

345
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
畢生慾同埋年紀老邁

346
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
並非係一啲註腳

347
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
其實就係講清楚

348
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
佢哋係社會

349
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
係世界係一種點樣嘅人

350
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
小人物

351
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
呢個of course

352
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
但同時

353
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
年紀老邁

354
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
甚至係畢生慾

355
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
近東嘅社會

356
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
古代嘅社會

357
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
係受咒助

358
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
cursed

359
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
甚至係今日我哋可以叫佢低端人口

360
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
嗰啲人

361
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
無權無能嘅

362
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
但係佢哋喺

363
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
上帝面前

364
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
作為二人

365
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
即係上帝面前

366
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
佢哋

367
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
係去依靠佢

368
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
去信靠佢

369
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
反而唔係一啲background嘅人

370
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
喺路家嘅筆下就變成

371
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
係主角

372
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
神居然

373
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
係向佢哋

374
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
顯現去啟示

375
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
你睇到呢個故事

376
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
繼續落去我哋唔睇好多細節

377
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
就係薩加利亞本身

378
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
係一個祭祀

379
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
輪到佢輪班

380
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
佢能夠入到去聖所裏面

381
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
去公職嘅時候

382
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
無論係點

383
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
登台

384
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
或者打理聖所裏面嘅事務

385
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
輪到佢班節嘅時候

386
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
佢就入咗去

387
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
聖所

388
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
然後佢裏面就上帝向佢顯現

389
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
就係天使向佢顯現

390
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
同佢話畀佢聽

391
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
而家有說話

392
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
嚟到佢臨到你

393
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
有咩咁特別

394
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
你記得我上個禮拜講過

395
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
喺舊約完結之後

396
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
到新約未開始

397
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
有幾多年時間

398
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
大概有三百幾四百年時間

399
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
三百幾四百年時間

400
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
嗰段時間叫乜嘢

401
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
我哋叫silent period

402
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
因為舊約最尾個先知係

403
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Malachi

404
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
最尾嗰個

405
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Malachi

406
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
中文係咩

407
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
係馬拉記

408
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
馬拉記

409
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
完咗之後到新約未開始嘅時候

410
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
有大概三百多年嘅時間

411
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
係冇有上帝嘅啟示

412
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
甚至你睇下當時嗰幾百年

413
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
猶太人嘅著作

414
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
佢哋都認定上帝好似冇講嘢

415
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
上帝冇錯之前有promise嗰啲嘢

416
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
但係呢幾百年呢好似靜咗落去

417
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
沉默嘅時期

418
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
所以到路加福音第一章

419
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
天使突然間顯現嘅時候

420
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
上帝講說話

421
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
佢就講話

422
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
佢就講話

423
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
上帝講說話

424
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
然後佢出到嚟嘅時候

425
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
其他嘅人民

426
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
見到佢入咗好耐

427
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
返出嚟嘅時候佢就啞咗

428
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
講唔到嘢

429
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
換句話講上帝對佢有啟示

430
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
對佢再有說話

431
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
呢件係好大件事

432
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
所以路加福音第一章

433
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
一開始就話上帝有啟示圖

434
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
上帝嘅計劃繼續

435
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
開展

436
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
繼續去advance繼續向前

437
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
雖然有沉默嗰時候

438
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
但上帝而家又開始講嘢

439
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
所以你睇第一章嘅時候

440
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
你有咩背景你就發現

441
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
原來好大好大嘅事

442
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
冇講嘢好耐突然間

443
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
而家又再講嘢

444
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
並且係同救主降生

445
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
係有關

446
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
路加福音第一章

447
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
到第二章

448
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
我哋睇呢個故事嘅時候

449
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
佢就講咩呢

450
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
講咗施西若汗嘅出生

451
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
第一章

452
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
第二章就交代耶穌嘅出生

453
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Christmas嘅story

454
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
第二章第四節

455
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
約瑟

456
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
就從加里

457
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
嘅那沙勒城

458
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
上猶太去

459
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
到了大衛的城

460
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
叫做伯利恆

461
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
因他本是大衛一族

462
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
一家的人

463
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
要和他所聘之妻瑪利亞

464
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
一同報名上閘

465
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
那時瑪利亞嘅新人

466
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
已經從遼

467
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
瑪利亞嘅產期已經到

468
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
生咗頭胎嘅兒子

469
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
用布包起嚟

470
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
放在馬槽裏面

471
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
因為客店裏面冇地方

472
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
前前後後第二章

473
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
第一節到而家

474
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
有好幾次講到報名上閘

475
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
四次

476
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
講到報名上閘

477
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
咩回事

478
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
當時羅馬帝國

479
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
要求那些人

480
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
下聖旨

481
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
然後回到他們原居地

482
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
回到他們的家鄉

483
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
去報名上閘

484
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
和我們今日不同

485
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
IRS就要報稅

486
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
三四月的時候

487
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
他們都是一樣

488
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
十四年左右

489
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
就來一次要去報名上閘

490
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
所以我們發現呢個故事

491
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
佢哋呢啲嘅

492
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
小民

493
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
約瑟瑪利亞

494
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
本身係喺拿撒勒

495
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
然後佢哋因為

496
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
接納咗聖旨

497
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
聖旨落咗之後

498
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
佢哋就要返返去自己屋企

499
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
換句話講約瑟係咩人

500
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
佢係伯利恆嘅人

501
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
佢鄉下係伯利恆

502
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
所以佢就返返去報稅

503
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
但係羅馬帝國

504
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
一講到報名上閘

505
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
報稅嘅時候

506
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
就好大件事

507
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
報稅嘅時候就係加稅

508
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
好似我哋最近芝加哥

509
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
我哋成日話地稅加

510
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
地稅加大唔大件事

511
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
好大件事

512
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
所以個個都要去投票

513
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
想去搏返

514
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
低少少地稅

515
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
當時你諗下

516
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
今日嘅地稅再加多十倍

517
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
就係當時羅馬帝國

518
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
要下聖旨

519
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
每人要報名上閘

520
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
嘅policy

521
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
好大件事

522
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
所以呢每逢

523
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
十年半載

524
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
佢哋要報名上閘嘅時候

525
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
好多地方就會有暴動

526
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
因為一種強制嘅加稅

527
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
其實跟之前所謂

528
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
即係一啲好強硬嘅

529
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
政策

530
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
同之前

531
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
中國

532
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
動態清零

533
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
差唔多都係夾硬嚟

534
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
佢要你點

535
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
你就要點

536
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
不相伯仲

537
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
每逢報名上閘嘅時候

538
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
就係一啲好政治上

539
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
社會上好不安嘅一段時間

540
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
各地都會有暴動

541
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
喺個小故事裡面

542
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
瑪利亞同埋約瑟

543
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
就趕路從納沙

544
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
喺北邊

545
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
落到去野口山附近

546
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
嘅百里行

547
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
趕路去到嗰度嘅時候

548
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
佢哋就返返去佢哋祖家

549
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
到咗百里行

550
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
佢話黑店沒有地方

551
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
我哋諗起

552
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
就係airbnb

553
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
去到嗰度我哋

554
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
冇酒店

555
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
但係其實要check下

556
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
真正嘅原文

557
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
路加

558
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
唔係講緊酒店

559
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
路加如果要寫酒店

560
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
佢有另外一字可以用

561
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
你記得有個比喻叫做好撒瑪利亞

562
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
有個人經過

563
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
嗰個地方

564
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
見到一個人畀人打到半死

565
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
然後佢就去照顧佢

566
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
帶佢去邊

567
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
黑店

568
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
真係有路上面

569
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
一啲所謂holiday inn或者motel 6

570
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
咁嘅嘢

571
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
佢就帶咗嗰個畀人

572
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
打到半死嘅人

573
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
然後就畀錢你都去照顧佢

574
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
嗰個叫做黑店

575
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
呢度用嘅字其實唔係

576
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
黑店嘅意思

577
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
其實應該係客房嘅意思

578
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
客房

579
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
即係話約瑟瑪利亞返返

580
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
去自己祖家嘅時候

581
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
當然就係搵咩

582
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
搵返自己親戚

583
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
下個禮拜我會

584
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
飛加州返返去

585
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
所謂我嘅home town

586
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
咁我哋使唔使住酒店

587
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
我哋唔使住酒店

588
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
點解

589
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
因為我in law係嗰度

590
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
我應該成閘嗰度

591
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
換人住一晚都得

592
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
所以我就係咁嘅緣故

593
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
我就返返去home town

594
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
我就唔需要租地方

595
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
約瑟瑪利亞都係一樣

596
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
返返去自己home town

597
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
可能係返返去自己

598
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
一啲親戚嘅祖屋等等

599
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
喺嗰處就去

600
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
投靠佢哋住住先

601
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
因為報名上冊就要排長龍

602
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
或者

603
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
有好多嘅手續要做等等

604
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
當時嘅房屋

605
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
好多時兩層

606
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
兩層嘅平房

607
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
等於好似以前香港嘅丁屋

608
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
上面就係客房

609
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
下面就係馬棚嘅地方

610
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
或者廚房

611
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
紡織嘅地方

612
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
生產嘅地方

613
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
如果你咁樣睇嘅時候

614
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
客房沒有地方

615
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
嘅guest room not available

616
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
換句話講

617
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
有新人擁埋一齊

618
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
佢哋可能冇地方畀佢住

619
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
於是乎有新人嘅瑪利亞

620
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
就落咗下面

621
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
馬棚嘅地方

622
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
係咪好陰公

623
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
有啲陰公

624
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
但都唔差嘅

625
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
因為嗰啲兩房嘅設計

626
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
下面

627
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
有啲牛羊等等

628
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
其實就令到嗰個嘅屋企

629
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
會亂啲嘅

630
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
以前就冇暖氣

631
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
所以嗰啲馬牛羊

632
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
佢就放咗下面

633
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
然後暖氣就會上升

634
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
所以下面都係ok

635
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
去到馬棚呢個地方

636
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
佢哋就喺嗰度

637
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
生產

638
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
可能我諗咁想像

639
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
大老婆都爬唔到上去

640
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
喺樓下

641
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
佢哋可能執個地方

642
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
然之後就畀佢哋喺嗰度

643
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
生仔

644
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
因為咁睇嘅時候

645
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
呢個聖誕故事

646
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
並非好似

647
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
唔一定係好似

648
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
我諗馬尼亞同埋

649
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
約瑟

650
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
冒住風雨冇人理佢哋

651
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
搵唔到Motel 6

652
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
然之後就去咗

653
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
一個馬棚

654
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
然之後生咗耶穌出嚟

655
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
未必係咁

656
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
可能呢個故事其實係一個

657
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Welcome嘅故事

658
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
即係佢哋去到伯尼行呢個地方

659
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
客房上面冇地方

660
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
然之後主人家

661
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
或者佢嘅親戚

662
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
執咗個地方

663
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
然之後畀佢哋喺嗰處

664
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
能夠安睡

665
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
產其到日

666
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
耶穌就出世

667
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
如果係咁睇

668
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
路加方第一二章

669
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
就係講緊一個Welcome嘅故事

670
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
有啲乜嘢人

671
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
能夠Welcome咗耶穌

672
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
進入佢心靈

673
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
有啲咩人可以接受到上帝嘅

674
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
福音 接受到上帝嘅

675
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
話語

676
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
唔係嗰啲大名鼎鼎上面嘅

677
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
而係嗰啲

678
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
真正嘅小角色

679
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
撒加尼亞

680
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
伊尼撒伯

681
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
約瑟 瑪利亞

682
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
當時社會裏面

683
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
最低端嘅

684
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
最無能嘅

685
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
佢哋卻係

686
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
見到耶穌

687
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
見到上帝嘅

688
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
工作

689
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
每年到年尾嘅時候

690
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
時代雜誌

691
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Time Magazine

692
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
都會選Person of the Year

693
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
或者Icon of the Year

694
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
你知唔知

695
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
今年佢哋選咗Icon of the Year係邊個

696
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
楊紫瓊

697
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
楊紫瓊 Michelle Yeoh

698
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
你知唔知

699
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
都ok

700
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
因為我哋亞洲人

701
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
選咗佢為我哋爭光都好

702
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
即係楊紫瓊都幾歲

703
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
都好老

704
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
60歲

705
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
佢都打咗江山好耐

706
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
喺電影界

707
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
喺一啲動作片

708
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
等等

709
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
得到呢個獎

710
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Icon of the Year

711
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Person of the Year

712
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
即係今年

713
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
所謂風雲人物

714
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
烏克蘭總統

715
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
烏克蘭總統

716
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
點解

717
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
因為俄羅斯入侵烏克蘭嘅時候

718
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
佢帶領佢嘅人民去反抗

719
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Keep住嗰個Spirit

720
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Ukrainian嘅Spirit

721
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
呢啲都係一啲好重要嘅

722
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Icon of the Year

723
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Person of the Year

724
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
我哋中間邊個可以選到

725
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Icon of the Year

726
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
有冇

727
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:56,000
如果我哋係任何一個人

728
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
係Person of the Year 或者 Icon of the Year

729
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
就巴閉囉係咪

730
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
可惜唔係呀

731
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
冇乜人理我哋

732
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
可能你嘅你嘅你最近嘅感受都係咁

733
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
冇人理你

734
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
社會裏面可能唔係咁多人

735
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
重視我哋

736
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
In fact我哋就係一種咁樣嘅人

737
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
但係路加

738
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
話接受福音嘅

739
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
上帝嘅恩典

740
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
臨到嘅呢啲生命

741
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
就係呢啲咁嘅小國蟲

742
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
若瑟瑪利亞

743
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
撒加利亞

744
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
伊利沙伯

745
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
一啲冇人理嘅上帝

746
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
就臨到佢哋

747
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
等於我哋唔使去崇拜嗰啲

748
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
有權有勢嘅

749
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
相反聖誕故事

750
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
就話畀我哋聽縱使我哋係小角色

751
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
上帝

752
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
仍然喺我哋

753
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
身上可以共同

754
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
你喺上帝嘅眼中

755
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
係一個好重要嘅人

756
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
喺社會裏面

757
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
可能係低端

758
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
喺社會經歷上面

759
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
可能你覺得冇人理你

760
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
但係你見到呢啲

761
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
小角色第一二章出現嘅時候

762
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
都係一啲

763
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
默默去侍奉

764
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
默默去忠心

765
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
去謹守

766
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
冇乜地位

767
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
冇乜影響力

768
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
上帝嘅恩典

769
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
居然係臨到佢哋

770
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
如果你拍電影

771
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
你就唔會搵呢啲咁嘅人拍

772
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
你搵咩人拍

773
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
戴希倫

774
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
奧古斯都

775
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
去做佢哋嘅故事

776
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
呢啲叫做Epic Story

777
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
我哋冇Epic Story

778
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
但聖誕故事

779
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
老家就話

780
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
佢係呢啲咁嘅minor嘅character

781
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
可以見到

782
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
耶穌神嘅恩典

783
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
拯救

784
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
能夠嚟到

785
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
寂寂無名嘅係呢啲小角色

786
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
能夠見到上帝嘅共同

787
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
我哋嘅救主

788
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
亦都係寂寂無名嘅

789
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
佢可以見到呢個世界

790
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
我記得好幾年前

791
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
我聽

792
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
德蘭修女

793
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
你知到邊個係德蘭修女

794
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
德蘭修女都好出名

795
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
其實本身佢一啲名都冇

796
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
只不過英國BBC

797
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
有個記者

798
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
走咗去嘉義國塔Calcutta

799
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
嚟到去訪問佢

800
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
訪問一播出去之後

801
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
成個英國西方世界就知道

802
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
原來有個咁嘅人

803
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
就係服侍嗰啲垂死嘅人

804
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
喺街垂死嘅人

805
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
佢就執佢哋返去

806
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
洗乾淨佢個身體

807
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
以至佢能夠有尊嚴去世

808
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
德蘭修女Margaret Theresa就做呢樣嘢

809
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Margaret Theresa講咗一句說話

810
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
今日印象仍然好深

811
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
佢講乜嘢呢

812
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
佢話Not all of us can do great things

813
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
But we can do small things

814
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
But we can do small things

815
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
With great love

816
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Not all of us can do great things

817
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
But we all can do small things

818
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
With great love

819
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
佢就係咁直直無名

820
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
喺嘉義國塔

821
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
做修女去服侍

822
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
喺佢身上就見到上帝嘅工作

823
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
上帝嘅恩典

824
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
唔係我哋個個都未必可以做到偉大嘅事

825
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
佢就係咁直直無名

826
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
喺嘉義國塔

827
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
做修女去服侍

828
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
喺佢身上就見到上帝嘅工作

829
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
上帝嘅恩典

830
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
唔係我個個都未必可以做到偉大嘅事

831
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
但我可以做小事

832
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
但我可以做小事

833
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
With great love

834
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
喺聖誕節

835
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
平平無奇嘅人

836
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
平凡嘅人

837
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
先係主角

838
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
佢喺社會裏面

839
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
上頭嘅

840
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
有權有勢嘅人

841
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
佢哋反而係背景

842
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Do small things with great love

843
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Do small things with great love

844
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Do small things with great love

845
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
喺聖誕節裏面諗一諗

846
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
有啲咩可以默默嘅

847
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
去繼續耕耘去做

848
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
花少少時間

849
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
可能為一啲有需要嘅人祈禱

850
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
可能寫張問候嘅卡

851
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
可能寫張問候嘅卡

852
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
去慰問一個有需要嘅人

853
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
去慰問一個有需要嘅人

854
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
一個可能孤獨嘅人

855
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
你去幫助佢

856
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
你去幫助佢

857
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
幾個禮拜前

858
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
我入嚟教會

859
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
weekday 時候入嚟教會

860
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
有時我哋收到信

861
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
個個巡禮就

862
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
啲信就放咗喺出面

863
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
咁我就開嗰幾封信

864
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
有封卡嚟嘅

865
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
外州寄嚟

866
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
外州會有人寄嚟嘅

867
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
唔係芝加哥寄嚟嘅

868
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
芝加哥唔使寄嚟啦

869
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
外州寄嚟

870
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
嗰張卡

871
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
我打開用英文寫

872
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
佢寫畀我哋教會

873
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
佢寫畀我哋教會

874
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
好多謝我哋教會

875
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
好多謝我哋教會

876
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
因為教會最近幾年

877
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
因為教會最近幾年

878
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
我哋去接納咗佢嘅義子

879
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
我哋去接納咗佢嘅義子

880
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
一對老夫婦

881
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
年紀老邁嘅夫婦寫信嚟畀我哋

882
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
好多謝你

883
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
因為接納咗我個仔

884
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
我為咗我個仔祈禱好多年

885
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
希望佢能夠返返去上帝嗰度

886
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
一個腐鹿撞棍咁

887
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
一個腐鹿撞棍咁

888
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
佢就嚟咗呢度教會

889
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
成為我一份子

890
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
成為我一份子

891
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
嗰對老夫婦去到感謝教會

892
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
嗰對老夫婦去到感謝教會

893
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
睇完之後我就發現

894
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
呢個就淨係教會應該要做嘅

895
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
呢個就淨係教會應該要做嘅

896
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
唔係大新聞係咪

897
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
但係佢喺呢個人嘅生命裏面

898
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
但係佢喺呢個人嘅生命裏面

899
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
去做咗一啲上帝嘅工作

900
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
呢個就係聖誕嘅故事

901
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
呢個就係聖誕嘅故事

902
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
聖誕嘅意義

903
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
諗一諗

904
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
你身邊有咩嘅人

905
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
你係需要去到關心佢

906
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
可能一個小嘅動作

907
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Do small things with great love

908
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
但係最大嘅問題就係

909
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
到底我哋有冇邀請耶穌

910
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
到底我哋有冇邀請耶穌

911
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
進入我哋嘅生命

912
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
我哋可唔可以見到耶穌

913
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
可唔可以讓耶穌進入我哋嘅生命

914
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
呢個聖誕節我希望你唔係淨係

915
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
過一個好忙嘅節期

916
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
可能又要去探親

917
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
或者去做好多唔同嘅嘢

918
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
要買禮物 要包禮物等等

919
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
要佈置等等

920
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Welcome 耶穌

921
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
進入你嘅生命

922
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
近期

923
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
你知聖誕節好多聖誕歌

924
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
其中一首

925
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
我特別被提醒

926
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
一首

927
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
細路仔嘅歌

928
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
細路仔嘅歌

929
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
聖誕節有好多細路仔唱嘅歌

930
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
其中一首

931
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
我最近記起

932
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
叫做張心給主

933
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
中文翻譯叫張心給主

934
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
英文係

935
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
What can I give him

936
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
我可以畀耶穌啲乜嘢

937
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
我可以畀耶穌啲乜嘢

938
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
我一個咁平凡嘅人

939
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
可以為佢貢獻啲乜嘢

940
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
奉獻啲乜嘢

941
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
張心給耶穌

942
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
張心給耶穌

943
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
我等下會播呢首歌

944
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
我希望呢首歌成為你嘅提醒

945
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
成為你嘅禱告

946
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
記住乜嘢

947
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Not all of us can do great things

948
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
But we can do

949
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
We can all do small things

950
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
With great love

951
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
但係要讓耶穌

952
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
進入我哋嘅生命先

953
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
要讓我哋嘅生命裏面有空間

954
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
