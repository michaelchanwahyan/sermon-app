[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240]   And right now we'll have past Mike for a message.
[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.360]   - Hey guys, if you want to find one word
[00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.440]   that would sum up the Bible, Old Testament and New Testament,
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.360]   one word, okay, what would that be?
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.160]   Sum up the entire Bible, right?
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.560]   How many of you say God?
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.480]   That's kind of lame, right?
[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.620]   But what I'm going to suggest to you
[00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.360]   in the ultimate sense is resurrection.
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.560]   It's this word, resurrection.
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.960]   It's the victory of death over sin
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.200]   and over death over Satan in the empty tomb of Jesus Christ.
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.120]   And that's why we are trying to think about,
[00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.600]   trying to apply what this teaching is all about,
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.680]   the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.520]   I know it's not Easter, it's Easter behind our back
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.400]   and we celebrate Easter Sunday some time ago,
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.320]   but I want to argue and I want to suggest to you
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.960]   that the doctrine of resurrection,
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.880]   the teaching of resurrection, the reality of it
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.300]   is the core, the foundation of our faith.
[00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.360]   From Old Testament to New Testament,
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.360]   this is the word, resurrection, the victory of Jesus Christ.
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.280]   You know, I am preparing for our Israel trip
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.240]   at the end of May.
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.120]   We have 26 people joining us.
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.560]   10 of them are from this church
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.480]   and 16 of them are from all over the place,
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.400]   from Hong Kong, from West Coast or East Coast, anyways.
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.880]   So 26 of us.
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.560]   So I'm preparing some materials
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.160]   and I just stumble upon some of the books I've read before
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.480]   and I didn't pay attention to it
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.160]   when I talk about resurrection.
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.440]   And these are the two books,
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.560]   written, both of them, written by Jewish scholars.
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.800]   And they are Jewish, they are not Christians.
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.460]   So there's no intention for them
[00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.300]   to promote the Christian faith,
[00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.040]   to promote the fact that Jesus' tomb is empty.
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.480]   The first one on top is a top-notch Jewish scholar,
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.880]   a historian, he passed away not too long ago,
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.800]   Gisela Vermers.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.280]   Gisela Vermers has been a historian for a long, long time
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.520]   and well-respected in the Jewish world,
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.760]   in fact, in the world.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.520]   And he specialized in early century
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.000]   of the land of Israel.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.800]   And he said there's no way that the disciples
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.960]   would make up a story of empty tomb.
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.720]   There's no way psychologically, historically,
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.720]   there's no way that they would expect a resurrection,
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.880]   expect an empty tomb.
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.200]   So there was no purpose for them to fake one.
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.760]   And down below is Shimon Gibson.
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.760]   He's also a historian, not a Christian,
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.360]   and that's why I quote them, right?
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.480]   That's why I quote them.
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.320]   These are not Christians.
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.360]   These people do not believe Jesus is the Son of God.
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.360]   But however, in their investigation,
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.840]   in their historical studies,
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.680]   they find that the tomb is indeed empty.
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.960]   And how do you explain that?
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.840]   There's no way you can explain that by science
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.840]   or by history unless you adopt the biblical explanation.
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.880]   The biblical reason for the empty tomb is,
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.680]   unless we adopt, look at the quote below,
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.080]   we adopt a theological one, which is the biblical reason,
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.120]   the resurrection of the Son of God.
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.480]   And Shimon Gibson is very interesting.
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.400]   He end this book by saying,
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.320]   I'll leave it to you guys, all right?
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.200]   This goes beyond our human proofs.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.520]   But do you want to accept what the Bible says?
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.860]   That is faith, right?
[00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.600]   So it's not blind faith.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.480]   It is based on historical reality.
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.880]   And that's why in the Bible, it tells us
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.520]   resurrection is the core and foundation
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.340]   of everything that we believe, the entire Bible.
[00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.440]   Paul said, if Christ has not been risen,
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.400]   all our preaching is useless and your faith is useless.
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.240]   I like the SV translation, in vain, you know?
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.360]   Everything, every single thing that we do,
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.120]   that we talk about, that we believe in, is in vain.
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.680]   It's useless, it's stupid.
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.540]   It's just nonsense if Christ has not been risen.
[00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.840]   But he has been raised.
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.080]   He was resurrected from the dead.
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.080]   And give us new chapter, give us new hope.
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.760]   And I have been trying to focus on the fact
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.840]   that God is trying to bring the new heaven
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.220]   and new earth to us.
[00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.260]   And he began the new creation project
[00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.400]   in the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.680]   Not someday in the future,
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.280]   but already it has broken into our lives
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.920]   if we accept Christ.
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.320]   That's why the Bible keeps on talking about,
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.700]   in Christ, the old is gone, the new has come, right?
[00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.380]   Speaking of new chapter, speaking of new beginning,
[00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:25.040]   you know, I hope you feel that way recently,
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.900]   'cause spring has finally come to Chicago, right?
[00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.440]   The long-awaited spring has already come.
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.980]   And for my personal life, it has also come,
[00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.200]   a new chapter, a new, sort of a new beginning,
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.320]   and it feels good about it.
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.600]   You know, I'll tell you what,
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.200]   in the past term, a few months,
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.040]   has been really, really tough.
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.860]   You know why?
[00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.240]   Because Rachel has come back to Chicago
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.520]   for student teaching,
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.160]   and she has to go to Healy School to do the teaching.
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.920]   And then she has to show up 7.30 in the morning,
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.600]   on time, right?
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.520]   And, you know, being a good father,
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.440]   I give her a ride every single morning,
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.480]   every single, well, one or two,
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:14.960]   I give them by mom, right?
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.520]   Okay, all right, good for her.
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.480]   You know, if you know me enough,
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.200]   I'm not an early riser.
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.020]   I've never been.
[00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.440]   You know, the most efficient hours of my day,
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.760]   I don't know about you.
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.620]   How many of you are early riser?
[00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:30.800]   Kelly, you are?
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.500]   What time do you wake up, usually?
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.400]   - [Kelly] I'm a fatherly.
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.640]   - Okay, okay, adult, right?
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.000]   So, she is early riser.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.640]   Make you one.
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:45.800]   And, you know, I've never been.
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.640]   The most efficient hours for my day
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.560]   is 9 p.m. to 2 a.m.
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.000]   Anyone amen to that?
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.380]   There you go, right?
[00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:55.880]   That's my most efficient hour.
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.320]   I can get so much done at night, right?
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:59.160]   Night hour.
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.920]   So, when she came back, when Rachel came back,
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.440]   I had to drive her every single morning.
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.040]   It's killing me.
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.880]   It's killing me.
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.400]   I'm sure it's killing her as well.
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.240]   But finally, last week, last Friday,
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.080]   it was the last day of her work.
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.680]   So, praise God.
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.200]   Hallelujah, hallelujah.
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.160]   So, I feel kind of good.
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.360]   I don't have to, you know, think about this anymore,
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.000]   or at least for the time being.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.560]   I don't have to do it anymore.
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.080]   So, you know, I'm so glad to drive her to Starbucks
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.960]   to get some, you know, bonus, right?
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.840]   Some sandwich and some coffee in the last week,
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:37.880]   and that's good.
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.720]   So, that's a new beginning.
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.160]   A new attitude, right?
[00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:45.100]   New attitude of morning, to at night, to my life, right?
[00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:49.200]   That is what the resurrection should bring us.
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.640]   A new beginning.
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.960]   The new creation has begun
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.880]   in the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.840]   That's why the Bible talks so much about resurrection.
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.760]   Many, many times, all four Gospels,
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.320]   all the New Testament letters,
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:03.960]   at least they talk about it explicitly,
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:08.480]   or they stress on it as the foundation of our faith.
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.920]   Why do we follow Jesus?
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.040]   Because we are not following a dead man.
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:15.720]   We are following a living God, a living person,
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.080]   Jesus Christ himself.
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.720]   And today, we would like to take a look
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:23.720]   at one of the stories of the encounter of the risen Christ,
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:28.440]   and Paul's, the apostle Paul's own encounter
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:29.800]   of the risen Christ.
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.000]   Now, according to the timeline of the Bible,
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.840]   Paul seems to be, the apostle Paul,
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.120]   seems to be the last person
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:40.080]   who has witnessed the risen Christ.
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.720]   And we found this record in the chapter nine
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:46.360]   of the book of Acts.
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.400]   We're gonna read through some of the verses here,
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.080]   the story, the historical record,
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.320]   and then there are a couple of questions
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.240]   I want to quiz on you.
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.680]   All right, nine one.
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.720]   Meanwhile, Saul was uttering threats.
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:00.720]   With every breath,
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.240]   and was eager to kill the Lord's followers.
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:07.120]   So Saul, Saul is Paul, Paul is Saul,
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.320]   two different languages.
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.600]   He went to the high priest,
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.760]   and he requested letters addressed to the synagogues
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.760]   in Damascus, asking for the cooperation
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.760]   in the arrest of any followers of the way,
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:21.400]   the way of Jesus, the way of the Lord.
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:22.520]   He found there.
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.640]   He wanted to bring them, both men and women,
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:26.480]   back to Jerusalem in chains.
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:30.600]   As he was approaching Damascus on this mission,
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:34.320]   a light from heaven suddenly shone down around him.
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.000]   He fell on the ground and heard a voice saying to him,
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.680]   Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.960]   Who are you, Lord, Saul asked.
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:45.720]   The voice replied, I'm Jesus, the one you are persecuting.
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.040]   Now get up and go into the city.
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.320]   You will be told what you must do.
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:55.040]   The man with Saul stood speechless,
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.400]   for they heard the sound of someone's voice,
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.280]   but saw no one.
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:02.140]   Saul picked himself up off the ground,
[00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:04.720]   but when he opened his eyes, he was blind.
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:09.720]   So his companions led him by the hand to Damascus, the city.
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:14.720]   He remained there blind for three days
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:18.160]   and did not eat, did not drink.
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.080]   Now this is a story, and it's such a dramatic story,
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.960]   and there are two points here.
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.880]   And first of all, two questions first.
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:28.280]   What was Paul planning to do in Damascus?
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:31.800]   To write a letter or to persecute Christians
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.160]   or to meet the high priest?
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.000]   What is it?
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.560]   To be, right?
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.360]   To persecute Christians.
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.600]   All right, that's easy, right?
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.780]   The harder one here.
[00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:48.080]   Where did the raising Christ appear to Paul?
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:52.220]   On the way to Jerusalem, to Samaria, or to Damascus?
[00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:54.700]   Which one?
[00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:55.540]   See, right?
[00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:56.620]   Damascus, right?
[00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:57.700]   Damascus.
[00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:59.780]   Not Jerusalem, away from Jerusalem,
[00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:03.520]   away from the hill country of Samaria,
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:08.520]   coming on his way, approaching Damascus.
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.180]   The two points here.
[00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:13.540]   First, this story, we see the raising Christ
[00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:16.180]   in an unworthy place.
[00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:19.300]   Unworthy place, unexpected.
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:24.380]   Second, Christ, who is resurrected,
[00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:28.200]   for an unworthy person.
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.800]   Two points.
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.920]   Now I think we need to understand this passage.
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:36.040]   We first need to understand the background of Paul.
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.560]   Who is this guy?
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:40.360]   Who is this Paul or Saul, right?
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:43.120]   Now I think one of the ways we can understand him
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:47.620]   is that he is kind of like the super orthodox Jew,
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:51.360]   in his days, right?
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:54.840]   Super orthodox, super kosher, right?
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:59.280]   And following the law straightly,
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:03.180]   following the traditions of Judaism straightly.
[00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:05.700]   And today we can kind of picture him
[00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:09.320]   as some of the ultra orthodox people, right?
[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:12.800]   These are called the ultra orthodox Jews, right?
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.000]   Where can you find them?
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.500]   Some in Skokie, right?
[00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:20.700]   Some in Brooklyn.
[00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:24.440]   And of course, many of them in Jerusalem, right?
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:28.560]   And they are the super conservative communities,
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:32.220]   especially they are following straightly the Shabbat,
[00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:35.200]   the Torah, going to synagogues on time,
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.140]   wear black and white all the time.
[00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:39.840]   Isn't that nice, black and white all the time?
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.460]   You don't have to worry about your outfit
[00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:42.780]   every single morning.
[00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:46.620]   You just open your closet, everything is the same, you know?
[00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:49.560]   'Cause they put the energy in
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:53.960]   following the way of the Torah, right?
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:58.960]   And Paul is 100% or even 200% of orthodox Jew.
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:02.960]   Now, if you go to Jerusalem today,
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:07.880]   say, I usually drive my own car, rental car.
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:12.880]   If I drive at the wrong time,
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:17.220]   in the wrong neighborhood, in one of those neighborhoods,
[00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:19.380]   on the wrong time, like Shabbat,
[00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:23.360]   I can get stoned easily
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:28.200]   'cause you are violating the most sacred law, right?
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.360]   So, you know, we got to know our way, right?
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:35.020]   We can't just drive into the religious orthodox community
[00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:37.160]   without knowing the timing, right?
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:38.740]   So you can get stoned, you know?
[00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:40.500]   You got to be very, very careful.
[00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:42.620]   These are the people like Paul.
[00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:45.060]   And Paul in his day, you need to understand,
[00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:49.700]   he was one of the super Pharisees, right?
[00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:50.920]   Super Pharisees.
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:54.160]   And the Pharisees trying to do their best
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.120]   to follow the letters of the Torah.
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.960]   Now, sometimes we got it wrong.
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:01.300]   Sometimes we thought, okay, these people,
[00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:03.500]   they are doing some work righteousness.
[00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.380]   They're trying to follow the Torah and fulfill the Torah
[00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:10.120]   so that they can get so-called saved in Christian terms,
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:13.920]   so that they can be considered the chosen people.
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:15.900]   No, I think we got it wrong.
[00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:17.880]   It's the other way around.
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:19.920]   In Paul's day, Judaism means
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:26.140]   some of the people, the Jews, the orthodox Jews,
[00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:28.460]   they consider themselves as chosen people.
[00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:30.940]   And because of this identity,
[00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:34.340]   that's why they show you who they are.
[00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:36.140]   That's why they observe the law.
[00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:38.860]   That's why they do the law,
[00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:43.140]   not because they want to be counted as the people of God.
[00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:44.940]   Oh, there are one or two laws I violate,
[00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:46.620]   so I'm not the people of God.
[00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:47.980]   I have to fulfill those.
[00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:49.520]   No, it's the other way around.
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:50.820]   They are chosen people.
[00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:52.260]   That's their identity.
[00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.180]   So they don't want to compromise their identity.
[00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:55.900]   That's why they want to do the law.
[00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:58.460]   They set up different boundaries around them,
[00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:01.580]   time boundaries, geographical boundaries,
[00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:04.940]   to not to compromise their identity.
[00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:06.780]   Who do you eat with?
[00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:07.800]   That's one of the boundary,
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:10.420]   one of the cultural religious boundary.
[00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:14.220]   How to worship, what time to go to worship.
[00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:17.100]   In Paul's days, Pharisees like Paul,
[00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:21.420]   believe that if everyone observe the law completely,
[00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:23.820]   then the kingdom of God will arrive.
[00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:27.540]   That's why they want to follow the law.
[00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:29.780]   That's why they're zealous and enthusiastic
[00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:31.200]   about doing the law.
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:34.980]   Because this is not an individual thing to do.
[00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:39.440]   Everyone, every Israelites, Jew,
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:41.840]   if we all follow the law,
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:46.340]   then the kingdom of God will be ushered in.
[00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:49.640]   There's only one way.
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.520]   We follow the law together.
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:52.800]   So not only I follow the law,
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.860]   I want to make you to follow the law.
[00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:56.720]   And you are zealous about following the law,
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.480]   me zealous about following the law,
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:01.720]   all of us, the entire community, the entire people,
[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:03.360]   then the kingdom of God will come.
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.600]   That is our hope.
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.080]   That is the means.
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.880]   Now this explain, this kind of background will explain
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:13.260]   why Saul or Paul would persecute the Christians.
[00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.200]   The early Christians in the first century, who were they?
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:19.180]   Ethnically speaking, who were they?
[00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:21.360]   Jew.
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.040]   They were Jewish people.
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:26.200]   They were Jewish people 100%, ethnically speaking, right?
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:30.380]   And they recognized Jesus as the Messiah.
[00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:35.740]   Now to Paul as the Pharisee, this is troubling.
[00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:37.520]   That's not good, right?
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:40.120]   For one thing, you believe in Jesus the Messiah
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:41.900]   being crucified on the cross.
[00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:44.060]   That is a shameful thing, right?
[00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:45.900]   That's a stumbling block.
[00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:50.900]   And secondly, there's no way that he rose from the dead.
[00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:56.020]   There's no way that this man being crucified on the cross
[00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:58.340]   and his tomb was empty.
[00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:00.620]   There's no way you can get around that.
[00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:05.620]   That's why Paul was trying to stop this Christian church,
[00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:08.860]   you know, Jewish Christians,
[00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:11.420]   or what we call today Messianic Jews.
[00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:13.980]   Those people who are Jewish
[00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:16.300]   and recognize Jesus as the Messiah.
[00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:19.660]   And Paul was trying to do his best as a Pharisee
[00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:24.660]   to stop this so-called virus from spreading out, you know?
[00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:28.300]   Remember the outbreak of COVID, right?
[00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:31.060]   Everyone go to the computer, check what?
[00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:32.740]   Check the world map, right?
[00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:35.820]   And see the red dots, you know, spreading around,
[00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:38.780]   you know, different countries and different regions.
[00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:40.300]   And, "Oh, it's coming to my place.
[00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:41.380]   "It's coming to our region."
[00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:42.900]   And we are scared, right?
[00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:44.620]   You know, most of us are Asians.
[00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:47.180]   We are scared.
[00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:53.380]   Well, Asians are easily being scared, right?
[00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:54.760]   We are free of death.
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:56.860]   That's why we pay attention to those dots, right?
[00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:58.900]   And the spread of the virus.
[00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:01.380]   And Paul in his day as a Pharisee,
[00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:06.020]   as a super culture rabbi, he was so concerned about this.
[00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:09.820]   That's why the story of chapter nine happened.
[00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:13.220]   What is Paul trying to do?
[00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:14.860]   You look at this map.
[00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:16.060]   Where is Paul going?
[00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:20.820]   He begins from Jerusalem, he goes north.
[00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:22.540]   And then most likely he avoid,
[00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:24.940]   not the most straightforward path to go north
[00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:28.780]   because who are those people in the north?
[00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:29.860]   Samaria, right?
[00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:31.580]   The Samaritans, right?
[00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:32.780]   You know, Samaritans and Jews,
[00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:33.980]   you know, a little bit background,
[00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:35.620]   you know, they are like,
[00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:38.460]   they don't like each other, right?
[00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:39.860]   They don't eat with each other.
[00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:42.420]   They're actually hostile to one another.
[00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:44.220]   So he probably scroll around
[00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:46.820]   the northern Samaria kill country,
[00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:48.900]   and then go up north to that, you know,
[00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.260]   little lake there, the Sea of Galilee,
[00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:55.220]   and then go northeast and climb the plateau
[00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:57.980]   of what we call Golan Heights today,
[00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:01.860]   and go into a Gentile, totally Gentile territories.
[00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:05.780]   And the foothill of Mount Hermon, can you make it out?
[00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:10.420]   Mount Hermon, he is on his way to Damascus.
[00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:14.540]   It's, that is a total of 150 miles
[00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:17.260]   and six days of walking nonstop.
[00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:19.620]   Now, if I were Paul, I have super culture,
[00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:24.620]   you know, Orthodox Jew, super culture Rabbi,
[00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:28.960]   I would be so, I'd probably not be walking.
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:33.300]   I'll be running, you know, I'll be running.
[00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:36.340]   I'll be running for a few, you know, marathon races.
[00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:39.100]   Let's try to get to Damascus.
[00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:42.580]   But your question is, why Damascus?
[00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:43.820]   Why Damascus?
[00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:44.660]   Why not other cities?
[00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:46.500]   Why not Chicago, right?
[00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:48.580]   Why Damascus?
[00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:52.340]   Now, remember, when the early church begins to be persecuted
[00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:56.260]   by the authorities, Roman authorities
[00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:57.860]   or Jerusalem authorities,
[00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:01.380]   the Christians were scattered everywhere
[00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:03.260]   'cause they are trying to, you know,
[00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:05.100]   run away from troubles, right?
[00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:08.180]   And bringing with them the gospel, right?
[00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:10.180]   That's what the book of Acts is all about.
[00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:12.540]   When persecution came to Jerusalem,
[00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:16.040]   to the Jewish Christians, they scattered off
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:18.900]   to different towns and villages or cities.
[00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:23.900]   And Damascus is at the crossroad of civilizations.
[00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:30.920]   It's the international center of the day.
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:35.760]   If you go to Damascus, then you can go right,
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:39.040]   you go to today's Iraq, Mesopotamia,
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:43.420]   a lot of Jews over there since exile of Babylon.
[00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:46.120]   And then if you turn left from Damascus,
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:49.960]   you go to what they call Turkey, Asia Minor,
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:51.280]   and then Europe, right?
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.780]   And a lot of Jews in Diaspora,
[00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:57.260]   they're scattered into different synagogues.
[00:20:57.260 --> 00:21:02.000]   And you know, they said Damascus is like New York.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.680]   It's today's New York.
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:05.120]   It's a crossroad of everything.
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:07.280]   It's an international crossroad.
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.160]   That's why the apostle Paul,
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:11.000]   well, back then he was not the apostle,
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.260]   the super-cultural rabbi Paul.
[00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:17.880]   He went to Damascus, that's why he went there.
[00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:19.440]   Because he wanted to do,
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:22.720]   probably he wanted to engage with some preemptive strike
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.200]   against the early Christianity, right?
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:29.240]   That is how you stop Christianity from spreading, right?
[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:34.040]   That's how you stop the so-called virus from spreading.
[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:37.520]   You go to the frontier and try to persecute them
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.840]   and bring them back to Jerusalem.
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:41.440]   That is the mindset of Paul.
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:44.480]   Now, you need to also understand
[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:48.120]   the Jewish super-cultural rabbi's mindset.
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:50.620]   Paul, what was Paul thinking?
[00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:55.360]   And in some way, in the first century,
[00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:57.780]   Judaism, what Paul believed in,
[00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:03.680]   he was advocating some sort of, you know,
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:08.200]   Second Temple Judaism or First Century Judaism.
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:12.560]   And there are three T's in Judaism, in Paul's day.
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:17.560]   The first T is time, second is Torah, third is temple.
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:20.920]   Time, Torah, and temple.
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:22.840]   Now, what do I mean by that?
[00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:25.920]   If you follow the law, you need to observe the time.
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:29.460]   Time of Shabbat, especially, right?
[00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:30.880]   It's time to worship,
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:33.100]   and you have to follow the law, straightly.
[00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:36.360]   Torah, of course.
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:39.920]   And then, most importantly for this story, is temple.
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:44.920]   The most sacred place on the planet Earth,
[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:48.080]   the entire universe, is one place,
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:51.160]   and you can find it on the map.
[00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:54.000]   You can point it to a GPS coordinates.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.880]   That is where the temple is.
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:59.140]   That's where the holy of holy is.
[00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:03.000]   Even today, Orthodox Jews,
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.560]   they pray toward some direction, right?
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:07.660]   Not to Chicago.
[00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:12.960]   They pray facing Jerusalem, right?
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:15.280]   They pray and praise,
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:18.360]   they live their life toward that direction.
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:19.480]   You go to Western Wall,
[00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:24.400]   why do the Orthodox Jews would go to Western Wall
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:26.080]   more than any place else?
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:30.440]   You know, Western Wall is simply an open air synagogue.
[00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:32.240]   It's like open air church.
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:35.480]   So people just go there to read scripture,
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:38.640]   to read Torah and pray.
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:39.920]   That's why they go to the wall,
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:43.860]   because the wall is closest that they can get today,
[00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:46.440]   to the holy place, the most holy place,
[00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:51.300]   you know, where the golden dome of the rock has mark.
[00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:53.700]   That's why they wanna go to Western Wall, right?
[00:23:53.700 --> 00:24:00.440]   For Paul, the most sacred place on Earth,
[00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:03.300]   the sacred spot is Jerusalem.
[00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:05.920]   Now with that in mind, you can understand,
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:08.720]   Paul is not simply a Roman citizen
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:11.920]   traveling from one region to another, right?
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:16.920]   It's not like us traveling from Chicago to San Francisco,
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:19.880]   or Chicago to Indianapolis.
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:22.580]   It's not from one region to another region.
[00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:24.520]   Nothing is neutral for them.
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:26.600]   Jerusalem is the most sacred place.
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:29.600]   And the further away from Jerusalem,
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:31.440]   the secular you get.
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:35.280]   So there is a sacred and profane difference.
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:40.440]   For Paul traveling from Jerusalem to Damascus,
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:42.680]   he's actually traveling from a sacred place,
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:47.120]   the most sacred place, to the territory of the enemies.
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:49.860]   Where is Damascus?
[00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:55.960]   Damascus is in what we call Golan Heights or beyond, Syria.
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:59.360]   In the Old Testament, it's Aram.
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.840]   If you know a little bit about the Old Testament history,
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:06.300]   you know Arameans, people from that region,
[00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:09.400]   and the Israelites in Israel or in Judah,
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:12.880]   they were always enemies.
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:16.120]   So for Paul, for this super-kosher rabbi,
[00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:19.760]   he was actually going from a friendly place
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:22.300]   to the enemy's territory.
[00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:25.480]   And that's why it is totally unexpected
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:30.760]   for Paul to meet and encounter the living God.
[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:35.760]   On his way to Damascus, there was no way.
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:37.600]   And that's why for three days he did not eat
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.140]   or he did not drink.
[00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:42.320]   It's just earth-shaking for him.
[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:44.320]   It shake up his whole world.
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:47.620]   And he was dumbfounded and silent for three days.
[00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:50.220]   He's trying to figure out what the heck is going on.
[00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:54.520]   I did not expect God to show up on the way to Damascus
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:57.000]   in the territory of the enemies.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.880]   I expect God to show up where?
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:01.480]   In the temple, right?
[00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:05.160]   In Jerusalem, in the most sacred place on earth, right?
[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:07.720]   And the resurrected Christ is telling us
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:11.220]   that he is no longer bound by territories.
[00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:14.720]   He is no longer bound by geographical boundaries.
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:18.000]   Everywhere he is, because he has ascended
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.800]   to the right hand of the Father.
[00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:21.720]   He is the resurrected Christ.
[00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:22.920]   He is the living God.
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:26.540]   He is not bound by anything else on the Google map.
[00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:28.960]   You can meet God here,
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:32.560]   as well as you can meet God in Jerusalem.
[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:39.020]   I remember some people who joined my Israel trip.
[00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:41.500]   Sometimes we go to the Western Wall, right?
[00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:43.360]   Everyone wants to go to the Western Wall, right?
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:46.200]   At least you need to take a picture there.
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:49.560]   And they kind of find themselves in a situation.
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:52.160]   Oh, this is the temple.
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.040]   And they say, "Hey, Pastor Mark, please,
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:54.880]   "this is the temple.
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:56.800]   "This is the most holy place."
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:01.800]   And I said, "No, no, this is not the holy place.
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:05.960]   "The holy place is in the person of Christ, amen?
[00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:09.800]   "You no longer worship Christ on the GPS coordinate.
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:13.680]   "You worship Christ in the living person.
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:18.680]   "The dead, once dead, and now risen, Christ himself."
[00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:20.920]   And that's why in this story,
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:23.560]   the risen Christ is showing up
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:26.240]   in an unworthy, unexpected place.
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:29.280]   And second point is that the risen Christ
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:35.600]   show himself, demonstrate himself to an unworthy person.
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:40.040]   Now, if you ask your friends,
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:43.000]   you know, if you have some neighbors,
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.520]   you may be able to, well, most likely,
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:50.520]   you can kind of put them on a kind of spectrum.
[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:54.680]   How close are they to God?
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:56.640]   How close are they to the gospel?
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:58.080]   Some of your friends or some of your people
[00:27:58.080 --> 00:27:59.480]   that you know or neighbors,
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:02.040]   you may, at least in human speaking,
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:05.200]   they're so far away from the gospel, right?
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:07.440]   Maybe they're even hostile to the gospel.
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:10.240]   And some of them may be more interested in faith
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:11.360]   and asking you questions
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:13.080]   and you answer some of the questions.
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:16.200]   You know, you could put them on a spectrum.
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.480]   You know, humanly speaking.
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:20.400]   And then you think about it.
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:24.160]   Paul is actually the least expected person
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:26.080]   to come to Christ, right?
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:31.080]   He's again, super culture rabbi, right?
[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:34.720]   Super culture, orthodox Jew.
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:37.200]   How would you expect him to come to Christ?
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:41.320]   And this story, quite unexpectedly and surprisingly,
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:47.280]   telling us the persecutor of the church coming to faith
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:50.040]   because the power of the risen Christ.
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:51.480]   And there is a second point.
[00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:54.920]   God's saving grace in an unworthy person.
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:58.720]   Essentially, you think about it,
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:01.760]   that applies to all of us, right?
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:06.760]   We're not more worthy than other people to come to Christ.
[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:08.640]   It's all about saving grace.
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:13.640]   If you track the story of the book of Acts,
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:15.240]   you can start with chapter seven,
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:17.480]   a little bit before the story that we read.
[00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:21.880]   Paul's conversion, the way to Damascus, chapter nine.
[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:25.800]   Chapter seven already talks about God showing himself,
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:30.400]   his glory to many different people.
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:35.920]   And that is the long sermon of Stephen, the first martyr.
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:38.440]   And in that long sermon in chapter seven,
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:41.840]   he's actually doing something like a summary
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:43.480]   of the entire Old Testament.
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:45.120]   So we start with Abraham,
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:48.840]   that the glory of God showed to Abraham
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:51.680]   in a foreign place, in Mesopotamia.
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:53.960]   Where was Abraham from?
[00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:56.520]   Where was he from?
[00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:59.800]   Country of birth.
[00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:03.720]   Mesopotamia, Iraq.
[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:05.680]   In some sense, Abraham is Iraqi.
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:10.240]   He was not straightly an Israelite.
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:13.280]   He's a foreigner, but God showed himself to him.
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:17.080]   And then Stephen surveyed the Old Testament story
[00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:19.240]   and saying that in wilderness,
[00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:23.840]   God showed himself to Moses and to the Israelites.
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:25.880]   And he talks about different episodes
[00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:27.240]   of the Old Testament story,
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:30.400]   and God will show them the glory
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:32.640]   and be present with his people.
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:35.240]   And interestingly, what is not mentioned
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:39.560]   in Stephen's sermon was Jerusalem.
[00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:42.080]   He never talked about Jerusalem, the first temple,
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:44.960]   the glory of God filled the temple
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:47.960]   when it was devastated in the time of Solomon.
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:49.640]   He never mentioned that.
[00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:53.800]   At the end of his sermon, his punchline here,
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:56.920]   the most high God does not live in temple
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:58.960]   made by human hands.
[00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:03.000]   He was probably, he was speaking this sermon in Jerusalem.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.960]   He was probably pointing to the temple.
[00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:11.040]   And that's why the Jews wanted to kill him, right?
[00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:16.200]   You speak bad words about our temple.
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:17.480]   Are you kidding me?
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:18.360]   Right?
[00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:19.560]   And then they stone him.
[00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:25.960]   And then chapter eight, Philip sent to Samaria.
[00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:30.760]   Samaria, the enemy's territory.
[00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:32.720]   Samaritans, unworthy of Christ.
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:34.360]   And they came to Christ.
[00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:35.960]   And then the end of chapter eight,
[00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:38.600]   he was being sent to a eunuch
[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:41.680]   and somebody with defect in his body.
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:44.200]   And he's unworthy to go into the temple,
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:46.840]   going to the presence of God to see God.
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:51.840]   But God show himself to this unworthy man.
[00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:54.240]   And then chapter nine is Paul's conversion.
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:59.240]   Chapter 10, Peter is being sent to Caesarea Militima.
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:04.000]   Caesarea was the Las Vegas of the first century.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.880]   And he met a guy called Cornelius, a Roman,
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:11.560]   someone who is enemy to the Jews.
[00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:13.120]   And he came to faith.
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:14.760]   He was unworthy.
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:16.720]   And everyone is unworthy.
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:19.920]   But the living Christ show himself to them.
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:23.040]   And story after story proves one point,
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:25.880]   that God's glory, God's grace is extended to all,
[00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:29.040]   is not bound by human boundaries.
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:31.360]   And God's resurrection power can be displayed
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:34.760]   in every single one of us, even you and me.
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:37.520]   And that's why Paul and his chapter,
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:39.000]   chapter 15 of first Corinthians,
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.080]   he says, "I am not the worthy one to receive this grace,
[00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:44.800]   "special favor on me.
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:49.760]   "I work harder than anyone because I feel unworthy,
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:54.760]   "because I sense, I feel this grace is so real to me."
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:58.000]   The living Christ showing himself to me.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.920]   And made me a new man, a new beginning.
[00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:03.720]   In Christ, we do have new beginning.
[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:06.160]   Paul is the proof.
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:08.280]   And you are the proof.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.360]   We are the proof.
[00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:14.720]   In Christ, we should be new,
[00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:16.440]   in some foundational way.
[00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:19.520]   I'll close with one story.
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:25.360]   I know a sister, a sister in Christ in Israel,
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:26.760]   some years ago.
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:30.640]   And she has been coming to church for worship
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:32.480]   very faithfully.
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:35.120]   And she is married to a Jewish man.
[00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:36.280]   And as you know, most of the Jews,
[00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:37.880]   they don't accept Jesus as Messiah.
[00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:39.280]   This is, you kidding me?
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:41.680]   This is a joke, right?
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:43.400]   This is something block.
[00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:44.440]   But eventually, you know,
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:48.040]   I spent some time in Israel, in Jerusalem,
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:50.320]   and I often go to that church every single week.
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:53.560]   And then eventually, her husband comes to the church.
[00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:57.400]   And according to her husband,
[00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:00.520]   why is he attracted to the church?
[00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:01.440]   He's a Jewish man.
[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:04.280]   And he said, "Very simple.
[00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:08.360]   "Because I see the differences
[00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:12.360]   "the gospel makes in my wife's life."
[00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:15.960]   And he said, you know, every single week
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:19.280]   after she goes to church,
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:23.880]   the husband feels like she's different.
[00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:26.680]   She's like some sort of new person.
[00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:32.040]   Joyful, more positive, you know,
[00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:33.880]   dealing with life issues, you know.
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:38.440]   A foundationally different way.
[00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:42.680]   And, you know, cooking is better, at least for the day.
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:46.080]   So he says the difference, you know.
[00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:49.680]   I see, you know, that's the whole point of the story.
[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:51.360]   Sometimes we come to church, we feel like,
[00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:52.800]   oh, this is such a burden, right?
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:55.360]   A checkbox, okay, I'm done, okay?
[00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:58.400]   Okay, I go on my way Monday to Saturday, right?
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:00.640]   Okay, you know, forget about it.
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:04.280]   This is what the difference should make in our lives.
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:07.640]   A new beginning, right?
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:08.600]   A new pursuit.
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:12.480]   Back in our old self, back in our old days,
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:13.880]   what do you pursue about?
[00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:15.720]   What do you think about most of the time?
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:20.400]   You know, lust, material things?
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:21.880]   What do you concern about?
[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:23.200]   What do you worry about?
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:28.000]   You know, the living Christ who died and rose again
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.760]   should give us a new start
[00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:33.520]   so that we can work toward the new world,
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:35.440]   which is the new heaven and new earth.
[00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:41.160]   We pray that we can do that and make that decision today.
[00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:45.040]   Think about what resurrection will make
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:49.360]   a foundational difference in your life,
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:52.560]   your attitude, your direction, right?
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:53.920]   The object of your pursuit.
[00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:57.920]   Everything will be ruled by Christ
[00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:00.680]   and we are working toward that goal, right?
[00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:02.480]   Let's all pray and close.
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:04.240]   And we're gonna sing our last song,
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:07.160]   "You Are My No No,"
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:10.040]   and I ask that you praise Him to come up here.
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:10.880]   Let's all pray.
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:15.480]   Father, as we close,
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:20.160]   we ask that your Spirit will remind us
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:24.440]   the old things that are still, you know,
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:26.960]   putting a hose on our lives,
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:30.840]   making us to look back all the time.
[00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:35.080]   And I pray, I pray that you will make us new.
[00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:38.920]   In Christ, who has died and rose again,
[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:41.320]   He is the one who give us hope.
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:43.400]   He is the one who give us a new chapter
[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:47.640]   and help us to be in Christ.
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:50.920]   The old has gone and the new has come.
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:53.920]   And praise you, Father,
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:56.920]   because we believe and we follow a living Christ.
[00:36:56.920 --> 00:37:00.600]   Show yourself, show your glory
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:03.440]   in this place, this unworthy place.
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:08.360]   Show your glory and your grace to this unworthy person.
[00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:10.400]   And thank you for your grace.
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:12.560]   In Christ, we pray.
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:22.560]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
