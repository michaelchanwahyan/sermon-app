1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
 And right now we'll have past Mike for a message.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,360
 - Hey guys, if you want to find one word

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:12,440
 that would sum up the Bible, Old Testament and New Testament,

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,360
 one word, okay, what would that be?

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,160
 Sum up the entire Bible, right?

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,560
 How many of you say God?

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,480
 That's kind of lame, right?

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,620
 But what I'm going to suggest to you

9
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,360
 in the ultimate sense is resurrection.

10
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,560
 It's this word, resurrection.

11
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,960
 It's the victory of death over sin

12
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,200
 and over death over Satan in the empty tomb of Jesus Christ.

13
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,120
 And that's why we are trying to think about,

14
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,600
 trying to apply what this teaching is all about,

15
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,680
 the resurrection of Jesus Christ.

16
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,520
 I know it's not Easter, it's Easter behind our back

17
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,400
 and we celebrate Easter Sunday some time ago,

18
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,320
 but I want to argue and I want to suggest to you

19
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,960
 that the doctrine of resurrection,

20
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,880
 the teaching of resurrection, the reality of it

21
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,300
 is the core, the foundation of our faith.

22
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,360
 From Old Testament to New Testament,

23
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,360
 this is the word, resurrection, the victory of Jesus Christ.

24
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,280
 You know, I am preparing for our Israel trip

25
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,240
 at the end of May.

26
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,120
 We have 26 people joining us.

27
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,560
 10 of them are from this church

28
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,480
 and 16 of them are from all over the place,

29
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,400
 from Hong Kong, from West Coast or East Coast, anyways.

30
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,880
 So 26 of us.

31
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,560
 So I'm preparing some materials

32
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,160
 and I just stumble upon some of the books I've read before

33
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,480
 and I didn't pay attention to it

34
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,160
 when I talk about resurrection.

35
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,440
 And these are the two books,

36
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,560
 written, both of them, written by Jewish scholars.

37
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,800
 And they are Jewish, they are not Christians.

38
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,460
 So there's no intention for them

39
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,300
 to promote the Christian faith,

40
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:05,040
 to promote the fact that Jesus' tomb is empty.

41
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,480
 The first one on top is a top-notch Jewish scholar,

42
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,880
 a historian, he passed away not too long ago,

43
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,800
 Gisela Vermers.

44
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,280
 Gisela Vermers has been a historian for a long, long time

45
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,520
 and well-respected in the Jewish world,

46
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,760
 in fact, in the world.

47
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,520
 And he specialized in early century

48
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,000
 of the land of Israel.

49
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,800
 And he said there's no way that the disciples

50
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,960
 would make up a story of empty tomb.

51
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,720
 There's no way psychologically, historically,

52
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,720
 there's no way that they would expect a resurrection,

53
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,880
 expect an empty tomb.

54
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,200
 So there was no purpose for them to fake one.

55
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,760
 And down below is Shimon Gibson.

56
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,760
 He's also a historian, not a Christian,

57
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,360
 and that's why I quote them, right?

58
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,480
 That's why I quote them.

59
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,320
 These are not Christians.

60
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,360
 These people do not believe Jesus is the Son of God.

61
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,360
 But however, in their investigation,

62
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,840
 in their historical studies,

63
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,680
 they find that the tomb is indeed empty.

64
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,960
 And how do you explain that?

65
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,840
 There's no way you can explain that by science

66
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,840
 or by history unless you adopt the biblical explanation.

67
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,880
 The biblical reason for the empty tomb is,

68
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,680
 unless we adopt, look at the quote below,

69
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,080
 we adopt a theological one, which is the biblical reason,

70
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,120
 the resurrection of the Son of God.

71
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,480
 And Shimon Gibson is very interesting.

72
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,400
 He end this book by saying,

73
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,320
 I'll leave it to you guys, all right?

74
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,200
 This goes beyond our human proofs.

75
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,520
 But do you want to accept what the Bible says?

76
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,860
 That is faith, right?

77
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,600
 So it's not blind faith.

78
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,480
 It is based on historical reality.

79
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,880
 And that's why in the Bible, it tells us

80
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,520
 resurrection is the core and foundation

81
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,340
 of everything that we believe, the entire Bible.

82
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:15,440
 Paul said, if Christ has not been risen,

83
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,400
 all our preaching is useless and your faith is useless.

84
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,240
 I like the SV translation, in vain, you know?

85
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,360
 Everything, every single thing that we do,

86
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,120
 that we talk about, that we believe in, is in vain.

87
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,680
 It's useless, it's stupid.

88
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,540
 It's just nonsense if Christ has not been risen.

89
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,840
 But he has been raised.

90
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,080
 He was resurrected from the dead.

91
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,080
 And give us new chapter, give us new hope.

92
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,760
 And I have been trying to focus on the fact

93
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,840
 that God is trying to bring the new heaven

94
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,220
 and new earth to us.

95
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:00,260
 And he began the new creation project

96
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,400
 in the resurrection of Jesus Christ.

97
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,680
 Not someday in the future,

98
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,280
 but already it has broken into our lives

99
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,920
 if we accept Christ.

100
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,320
 That's why the Bible keeps on talking about,

101
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,700
 in Christ, the old is gone, the new has come, right?

102
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:20,380
 Speaking of new chapter, speaking of new beginning,

103
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:25,040
 you know, I hope you feel that way recently,

104
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,900
 'cause spring has finally come to Chicago, right?

105
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:32,440
 The long-awaited spring has already come.

106
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,980
 And for my personal life, it has also come,

107
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:39,200
 a new chapter, a new, sort of a new beginning,

108
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,320
 and it feels good about it.

109
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,600
 You know, I'll tell you what,

110
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,200
 in the past term, a few months,

111
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,040
 has been really, really tough.

112
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,860
 You know why?

113
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:53,240
 Because Rachel has come back to Chicago

114
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,520
 for student teaching,

115
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,160
 and she has to go to Healy School to do the teaching.

116
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,920
 And then she has to show up 7.30 in the morning,

117
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,600
 on time, right?

118
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,520
 And, you know, being a good father,

119
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,440
 I give her a ride every single morning,

120
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,480
 every single, well, one or two,

121
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,960
 I give them by mom, right?

122
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,520
 Okay, all right, good for her.

123
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,480
 You know, if you know me enough,

124
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,200
 I'm not an early riser.

125
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,020
 I've never been.

126
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,440
 You know, the most efficient hours of my day,

127
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,760
 I don't know about you.

128
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,620
 How many of you are early riser?

129
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,800
 Kelly, you are?

130
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,500
 What time do you wake up, usually?

131
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,400
 - [Kelly] I'm a fatherly.

132
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,640
 - Okay, okay, adult, right?

133
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,000
 So, she is early riser.

134
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,640
 Make you one.

135
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,800
 And, you know, I've never been.

136
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,640
 The most efficient hours for my day

137
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,560
 is 9 p.m. to 2 a.m.

138
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,000
 Anyone amen to that?

139
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,380
 There you go, right?

140
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,880
 That's my most efficient hour.

141
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,320
 I can get so much done at night, right?

142
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,160
 Night hour.

143
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,920
 So, when she came back, when Rachel came back,

144
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,440
 I had to drive her every single morning.

145
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,040
 It's killing me.

146
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,880
 It's killing me.

147
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,400
 I'm sure it's killing her as well.

148
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,240
 But finally, last week, last Friday,

149
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,080
 it was the last day of her work.

150
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,680
 So, praise God.

151
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,200
 Hallelujah, hallelujah.

152
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,160
 So, I feel kind of good.

153
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,360
 I don't have to, you know, think about this anymore,

154
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,000
 or at least for the time being.

155
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,560
 I don't have to do it anymore.

156
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,080
 So, you know, I'm so glad to drive her to Starbucks

157
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,960
 to get some, you know, bonus, right?

158
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,840
 Some sandwich and some coffee in the last week,

159
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,880
 and that's good.

160
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,720
 So, that's a new beginning.

161
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,160
 A new attitude, right?

162
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:45,100
 New attitude of morning, to at night, to my life, right?

163
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:49,200
 That is what the resurrection should bring us.

164
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,640
 A new beginning.

165
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,960
 The new creation has begun

166
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,880
 in the resurrection of Jesus Christ.

167
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,840
 That's why the Bible talks so much about resurrection.

168
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,760
 Many, many times, all four Gospels,

169
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,320
 all the New Testament letters,

170
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,960
 at least they talk about it explicitly,

171
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:08,480
 or they stress on it as the foundation of our faith.

172
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,920
 Why do we follow Jesus?

173
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,040
 Because we are not following a dead man.

174
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,720
 We are following a living God, a living person,

175
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,080
 Jesus Christ himself.

176
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,720
 And today, we would like to take a look

177
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,720
 at one of the stories of the encounter of the risen Christ,

178
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,440
 and Paul's, the apostle Paul's own encounter

179
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,800
 of the risen Christ.

180
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,000
 Now, according to the timeline of the Bible,

181
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,840
 Paul seems to be, the apostle Paul,

182
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,120
 seems to be the last person

183
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,080
 who has witnessed the risen Christ.

184
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,720
 And we found this record in the chapter nine

185
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,360
 of the book of Acts.

186
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,400
 We're gonna read through some of the verses here,

187
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,080
 the story, the historical record,

188
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,320
 and then there are a couple of questions

189
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,240
 I want to quiz on you.

190
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,680
 All right, nine one.

191
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,720
 Meanwhile, Saul was uttering threats.

192
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,720
 With every breath,

193
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,240
 and was eager to kill the Lord's followers.

194
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,120
 So Saul, Saul is Paul, Paul is Saul,

195
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,320
 two different languages.

196
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,600
 He went to the high priest,

197
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,760
 and he requested letters addressed to the synagogues

198
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,760
 in Damascus, asking for the cooperation

199
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,760
 in the arrest of any followers of the way,

200
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,400
 the way of Jesus, the way of the Lord.

201
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,520
 He found there.

202
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,640
 He wanted to bring them, both men and women,

203
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,480
 back to Jerusalem in chains.

204
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,600
 As he was approaching Damascus on this mission,

205
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,320
 a light from heaven suddenly shone down around him.

206
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,000
 He fell on the ground and heard a voice saying to him,

207
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,680
 Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?

208
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,960
 Who are you, Lord, Saul asked.

209
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,720
 The voice replied, I'm Jesus, the one you are persecuting.

210
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,040
 Now get up and go into the city.

211
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,320
 You will be told what you must do.

212
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,040
 The man with Saul stood speechless,

213
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,400
 for they heard the sound of someone's voice,

214
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,280
 but saw no one.

215
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,140
 Saul picked himself up off the ground,

216
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,720
 but when he opened his eyes, he was blind.

217
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,720
 So his companions led him by the hand to Damascus, the city.

218
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,720
 He remained there blind for three days

219
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,160
 and did not eat, did not drink.

220
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,080
 Now this is a story, and it's such a dramatic story,

221
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,960
 and there are two points here.

222
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,880
 And first of all, two questions first.

223
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,280
 What was Paul planning to do in Damascus?

224
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,800
 To write a letter or to persecute Christians

225
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,160
 or to meet the high priest?

226
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,000
 What is it?

227
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,560
 To be, right?

228
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,360
 To persecute Christians.

229
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,600
 All right, that's easy, right?

230
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,780
 The harder one here.

231
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:48,080
 Where did the raising Christ appear to Paul?

232
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:52,220
 On the way to Jerusalem, to Samaria, or to Damascus?

233
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,700
 Which one?

234
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,540
 See, right?

235
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,620
 Damascus, right?

236
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,700
 Damascus.

237
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,780
 Not Jerusalem, away from Jerusalem,

238
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:03,520
 away from the hill country of Samaria,

239
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:08,520
 coming on his way, approaching Damascus.

240
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,180
 The two points here.

241
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:13,540
 First, this story, we see the raising Christ

242
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,180
 in an unworthy place.

243
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:19,300
 Unworthy place, unexpected.

244
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,380
 Second, Christ, who is resurrected,

245
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:28,200
 for an unworthy person.

246
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,800
 Two points.

247
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,920
 Now I think we need to understand this passage.

248
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,040
 We first need to understand the background of Paul.

249
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,560
 Who is this guy?

250
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,360
 Who is this Paul or Saul, right?

251
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,120
 Now I think one of the ways we can understand him

252
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,620
 is that he is kind of like the super orthodox Jew,

253
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,360
 in his days, right?

254
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,840
 Super orthodox, super kosher, right?

255
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:59,280
 And following the law straightly,

256
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:03,180
 following the traditions of Judaism straightly.

257
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,700
 And today we can kind of picture him

258
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,320
 as some of the ultra orthodox people, right?

259
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,800
 These are called the ultra orthodox Jews, right?

260
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,000
 Where can you find them?

261
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,500
 Some in Skokie, right?

262
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,700
 Some in Brooklyn.

263
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,440
 And of course, many of them in Jerusalem, right?

264
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,560
 And they are the super conservative communities,

265
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,220
 especially they are following straightly the Shabbat,

266
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:35,200
 the Torah, going to synagogues on time,

267
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,140
 wear black and white all the time.

268
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,840
 Isn't that nice, black and white all the time?

269
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,460
 You don't have to worry about your outfit

270
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,780
 every single morning.

271
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:46,620
 You just open your closet, everything is the same, you know?

272
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,560
 'Cause they put the energy in

273
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,960
 following the way of the Torah, right?

274
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:58,960
 And Paul is 100% or even 200% of orthodox Jew.

275
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,960
 Now, if you go to Jerusalem today,

276
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:07,880
 say, I usually drive my own car, rental car.

277
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:12,880
 If I drive at the wrong time,

278
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,220
 in the wrong neighborhood, in one of those neighborhoods,

279
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,380
 on the wrong time, like Shabbat,

280
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:23,360
 I can get stoned easily

281
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,200
 'cause you are violating the most sacred law, right?

282
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,360
 So, you know, we got to know our way, right?

283
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:35,020
 We can't just drive into the religious orthodox community

284
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,160
 without knowing the timing, right?

285
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,740
 So you can get stoned, you know?

286
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,500
 You got to be very, very careful.

287
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,620
 These are the people like Paul.

288
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:45,060
 And Paul in his day, you need to understand,

289
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:49,700
 he was one of the super Pharisees, right?

290
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,920
 Super Pharisees.

291
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,160
 And the Pharisees trying to do their best

292
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,120
 to follow the letters of the Torah.

293
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,960
 Now, sometimes we got it wrong.

294
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,300
 Sometimes we thought, okay, these people,

295
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,500
 they are doing some work righteousness.

296
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,380
 They're trying to follow the Torah and fulfill the Torah

297
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:10,120
 so that they can get so-called saved in Christian terms,

298
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,920
 so that they can be considered the chosen people.

299
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,900
 No, I think we got it wrong.

300
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,880
 It's the other way around.

301
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,920
 In Paul's day, Judaism means

302
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:26,140
 some of the people, the Jews, the orthodox Jews,

303
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,460
 they consider themselves as chosen people.

304
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,940
 And because of this identity,

305
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:34,340
 that's why they show you who they are.

306
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,140
 That's why they observe the law.

307
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,860
 That's why they do the law,

308
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:43,140
 not because they want to be counted as the people of God.

309
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,940
 Oh, there are one or two laws I violate,

310
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,620
 so I'm not the people of God.

311
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,980
 I have to fulfill those.

312
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,520
 No, it's the other way around.

313
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,820
 They are chosen people.

314
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,260
 That's their identity.

315
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,180
 So they don't want to compromise their identity.

316
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,900
 That's why they want to do the law.

317
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,460
 They set up different boundaries around them,

318
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:01,580
 time boundaries, geographical boundaries,

319
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,940
 to not to compromise their identity.

320
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,780
 Who do you eat with?

321
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,800
 That's one of the boundary,

322
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,420
 one of the cultural religious boundary.

323
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:14,220
 How to worship, what time to go to worship.

324
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,100
 In Paul's days, Pharisees like Paul,

325
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:21,420
 believe that if everyone observe the law completely,

326
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,820
 then the kingdom of God will arrive.

327
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:27,540
 That's why they want to follow the law.

328
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,780
 That's why they're zealous and enthusiastic

329
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,200
 about doing the law.

330
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,980
 Because this is not an individual thing to do.

331
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:39,440
 Everyone, every Israelites, Jew,

332
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,840
 if we all follow the law,

333
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:46,340
 then the kingdom of God will be ushered in.

334
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:49,640
 There's only one way.

335
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,520
 We follow the law together.

336
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,800
 So not only I follow the law,

337
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,860
 I want to make you to follow the law.

338
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,720
 And you are zealous about following the law,

339
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,480
 me zealous about following the law,

340
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,720
 all of us, the entire community, the entire people,

341
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,360
 then the kingdom of God will come.

342
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,600
 That is our hope.

343
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,080
 That is the means.

344
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,880
 Now this explain, this kind of background will explain

345
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,260
 why Saul or Paul would persecute the Christians.

346
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:16,200
 The early Christians in the first century, who were they?

347
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,180
 Ethnically speaking, who were they?

348
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,360
 Jew.

349
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,040
 They were Jewish people.

350
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,200
 They were Jewish people 100%, ethnically speaking, right?

351
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:30,380
 And they recognized Jesus as the Messiah.

352
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:35,740
 Now to Paul as the Pharisee, this is troubling.

353
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,520
 That's not good, right?

354
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,120
 For one thing, you believe in Jesus the Messiah

355
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,900
 being crucified on the cross.

356
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,060
 That is a shameful thing, right?

357
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,900
 That's a stumbling block.

358
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:50,900
 And secondly, there's no way that he rose from the dead.

359
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:56,020
 There's no way that this man being crucified on the cross

360
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:58,340
 and his tomb was empty.

361
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,620
 There's no way you can get around that.

362
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:05,620
 That's why Paul was trying to stop this Christian church,

363
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:08,860
 you know, Jewish Christians,

364
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:11,420
 or what we call today Messianic Jews.

365
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,980
 Those people who are Jewish

366
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,300
 and recognize Jesus as the Messiah.

367
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,660
 And Paul was trying to do his best as a Pharisee

368
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:24,660
 to stop this so-called virus from spreading out, you know?

369
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:28,300
 Remember the outbreak of COVID, right?

370
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:31,060
 Everyone go to the computer, check what?

371
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,740
 Check the world map, right?

372
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:35,820
 And see the red dots, you know, spreading around,

373
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,780
 you know, different countries and different regions.

374
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,300
 And, "Oh, it's coming to my place.

375
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,380
 "It's coming to our region."

376
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,900
 And we are scared, right?

377
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,620
 You know, most of us are Asians.

378
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:47,180
 We are scared.

379
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:53,380
 Well, Asians are easily being scared, right?

380
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,760
 We are free of death.

381
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,860
 That's why we pay attention to those dots, right?

382
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,900
 And the spread of the virus.

383
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,380
 And Paul in his day as a Pharisee,

384
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:06,020
 as a super culture rabbi, he was so concerned about this.

385
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:09,820
 That's why the story of chapter nine happened.

386
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:13,220
 What is Paul trying to do?

387
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,860
 You look at this map.

388
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,060
 Where is Paul going?

389
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:20,820
 He begins from Jerusalem, he goes north.

390
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,540
 And then most likely he avoid,

391
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,940
 not the most straightforward path to go north

392
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:28,780
 because who are those people in the north?

393
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,860
 Samaria, right?

394
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,580
 The Samaritans, right?

395
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,780
 You know, Samaritans and Jews,

396
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,980
 you know, a little bit background,

397
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,620
 you know, they are like,

398
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:38,460
 they don't like each other, right?

399
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,860
 They don't eat with each other.

400
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,420
 They're actually hostile to one another.

401
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,220
 So he probably scroll around

402
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,820
 the northern Samaria kill country,

403
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,900
 and then go up north to that, you know,

404
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,260
 little lake there, the Sea of Galilee,

405
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:55,220
 and then go northeast and climb the plateau

406
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,980
 of what we call Golan Heights today,

407
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:01,860
 and go into a Gentile, totally Gentile territories.

408
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:05,780
 And the foothill of Mount Hermon, can you make it out?

409
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:10,420
 Mount Hermon, he is on his way to Damascus.

410
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:14,540
 It's, that is a total of 150 miles

411
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:17,260
 and six days of walking nonstop.

412
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,620
 Now, if I were Paul, I have super culture,

413
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:24,620
 you know, Orthodox Jew, super culture Rabbi,

414
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:28,960
 I would be so, I'd probably not be walking.

415
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,300
 I'll be running, you know, I'll be running.

416
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,340
 I'll be running for a few, you know, marathon races.

417
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:39,100
 Let's try to get to Damascus.

418
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:42,580
 But your question is, why Damascus?

419
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:43,820
 Why Damascus?

420
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:44,660
 Why not other cities?

421
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,500
 Why not Chicago, right?

422
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,580
 Why Damascus?

423
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:52,340
 Now, remember, when the early church begins to be persecuted

424
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:56,260
 by the authorities, Roman authorities

425
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,860
 or Jerusalem authorities,

426
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:01,380
 the Christians were scattered everywhere

427
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,260
 'cause they are trying to, you know,

428
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,100
 run away from troubles, right?

429
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,180
 And bringing with them the gospel, right?

430
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,180
 That's what the book of Acts is all about.

431
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,540
 When persecution came to Jerusalem,

432
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:16,040
 to the Jewish Christians, they scattered off

433
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,900
 to different towns and villages or cities.

434
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:23,900
 And Damascus is at the crossroad of civilizations.

435
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:30,920
 It's the international center of the day.

436
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:35,760
 If you go to Damascus, then you can go right,

437
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,040
 you go to today's Iraq, Mesopotamia,

438
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:43,420
 a lot of Jews over there since exile of Babylon.

439
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:46,120
 And then if you turn left from Damascus,

440
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,960
 you go to what they call Turkey, Asia Minor,

441
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,280
 and then Europe, right?

442
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,780
 And a lot of Jews in Diaspora,

443
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:57,260
 they're scattered into different synagogues.

444
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:02,000
 And you know, they said Damascus is like New York.

445
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,680
 It's today's New York.

446
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,120
 It's a crossroad of everything.

447
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,280
 It's an international crossroad.

448
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,160
 That's why the apostle Paul,

449
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,000
 well, back then he was not the apostle,

450
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,260
 the super-cultural rabbi Paul.

451
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:17,880
 He went to Damascus, that's why he went there.

452
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,440
 Because he wanted to do,

453
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,720
 probably he wanted to engage with some preemptive strike

454
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,200
 against the early Christianity, right?

455
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,240
 That is how you stop Christianity from spreading, right?

456
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:34,040
 That's how you stop the so-called virus from spreading.

457
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,520
 You go to the frontier and try to persecute them

458
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,840
 and bring them back to Jerusalem.

459
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,440
 That is the mindset of Paul.

460
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,480
 Now, you need to also understand

461
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,120
 the Jewish super-cultural rabbi's mindset.

462
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,620
 Paul, what was Paul thinking?

463
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:55,360
 And in some way, in the first century,

464
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,780
 Judaism, what Paul believed in,

465
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:03,680
 he was advocating some sort of, you know,

466
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:08,200
 Second Temple Judaism or First Century Judaism.

467
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:12,560
 And there are three T's in Judaism, in Paul's day.

468
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:17,560
 The first T is time, second is Torah, third is temple.

469
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,920
 Time, Torah, and temple.

470
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,840
 Now, what do I mean by that?

471
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,920
 If you follow the law, you need to observe the time.

472
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:29,460
 Time of Shabbat, especially, right?

473
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,880
 It's time to worship,

474
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,100
 and you have to follow the law, straightly.

475
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:36,360
 Torah, of course.

476
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,920
 And then, most importantly for this story, is temple.

477
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:44,920
 The most sacred place on the planet Earth,

478
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:48,080
 the entire universe, is one place,

479
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,160
 and you can find it on the map.

480
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,000
 You can point it to a GPS coordinates.

481
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,880
 That is where the temple is.

482
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,140
 That's where the holy of holy is.

483
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:03,000
 Even today, Orthodox Jews,

484
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,560
 they pray toward some direction, right?

485
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,660
 Not to Chicago.

486
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:12,960
 They pray facing Jerusalem, right?

487
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,280
 They pray and praise,

488
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,360
 they live their life toward that direction.

489
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,480
 You go to Western Wall,

490
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:24,400
 why do the Orthodox Jews would go to Western Wall

491
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,080
 more than any place else?

492
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,440
 You know, Western Wall is simply an open air synagogue.

493
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,240
 It's like open air church.

494
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,480
 So people just go there to read scripture,

495
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,640
 to read Torah and pray.

496
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,920
 That's why they go to the wall,

497
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,860
 because the wall is closest that they can get today,

498
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,440
 to the holy place, the most holy place,

499
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:51,300
 you know, where the golden dome of the rock has mark.

500
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,700
 That's why they wanna go to Western Wall, right?

501
00:23:53,700 --> 00:24:00,440
 For Paul, the most sacred place on Earth,

502
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,300
 the sacred spot is Jerusalem.

503
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,920
 Now with that in mind, you can understand,

504
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,720
 Paul is not simply a Roman citizen

505
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,920
 traveling from one region to another, right?

506
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:16,920
 It's not like us traveling from Chicago to San Francisco,

507
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,880
 or Chicago to Indianapolis.

508
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,580
 It's not from one region to another region.

509
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,520
 Nothing is neutral for them.

510
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,600
 Jerusalem is the most sacred place.

511
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,600
 And the further away from Jerusalem,

512
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,440
 the secular you get.

513
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,280
 So there is a sacred and profane difference.

514
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:40,440
 For Paul traveling from Jerusalem to Damascus,

515
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,680
 he's actually traveling from a sacred place,

516
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:47,120
 the most sacred place, to the territory of the enemies.

517
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,860
 Where is Damascus?

518
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:55,960
 Damascus is in what we call Golan Heights or beyond, Syria.

519
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,360
 In the Old Testament, it's Aram.

520
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,840
 If you know a little bit about the Old Testament history,

521
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:06,300
 you know Arameans, people from that region,

522
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:09,400
 and the Israelites in Israel or in Judah,

523
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,880
 they were always enemies.

524
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,120
 So for Paul, for this super-kosher rabbi,

525
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:19,760
 he was actually going from a friendly place

526
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,300
 to the enemy's territory.

527
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:25,480
 And that's why it is totally unexpected

528
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,760
 for Paul to meet and encounter the living God.

529
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:35,760
 On his way to Damascus, there was no way.

530
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,600
 And that's why for three days he did not eat

531
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,140
 or he did not drink.

532
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:42,320
 It's just earth-shaking for him.

533
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,320
 It shake up his whole world.

534
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,620
 And he was dumbfounded and silent for three days.

535
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:50,220
 He's trying to figure out what the heck is going on.

536
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:54,520
 I did not expect God to show up on the way to Damascus

537
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,000
 in the territory of the enemies.

538
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,880
 I expect God to show up where?

539
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,480
 In the temple, right?

540
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:05,160
 In Jerusalem, in the most sacred place on earth, right?

541
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,720
 And the resurrected Christ is telling us

542
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:11,220
 that he is no longer bound by territories.

543
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:14,720
 He is no longer bound by geographical boundaries.

544
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,000
 Everywhere he is, because he has ascended

545
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,800
 to the right hand of the Father.

546
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,720
 He is the resurrected Christ.

547
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,920
 He is the living God.

548
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:26,540
 He is not bound by anything else on the Google map.

549
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,960
 You can meet God here,

550
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,560
 as well as you can meet God in Jerusalem.

551
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:39,020
 I remember some people who joined my Israel trip.

552
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:41,500
 Sometimes we go to the Western Wall, right?

553
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,360
 Everyone wants to go to the Western Wall, right?

554
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,200
 At least you need to take a picture there.

555
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,560
 And they kind of find themselves in a situation.

556
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,160
 Oh, this is the temple.

557
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,040
 And they say, "Hey, Pastor Mark, please,

558
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:54,880
 "this is the temple.

559
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,800
 "This is the most holy place."

560
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:01,800
 And I said, "No, no, this is not the holy place.

561
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:05,960
 "The holy place is in the person of Christ, amen?

562
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,800
 "You no longer worship Christ on the GPS coordinate.

563
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:13,680
 "You worship Christ in the living person.

564
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:18,680
 "The dead, once dead, and now risen, Christ himself."

565
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,920
 And that's why in this story,

566
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,560
 the risen Christ is showing up

567
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:26,240
 in an unworthy, unexpected place.

568
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,280
 And second point is that the risen Christ

569
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:35,600
 show himself, demonstrate himself to an unworthy person.

570
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:40,040
 Now, if you ask your friends,

571
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:43,000
 you know, if you have some neighbors,

572
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,520
 you may be able to, well, most likely,

573
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:50,520
 you can kind of put them on a kind of spectrum.

574
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,680
 How close are they to God?

575
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,640
 How close are they to the gospel?

576
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,080
 Some of your friends or some of your people

577
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,480
 that you know or neighbors,

578
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,040
 you may, at least in human speaking,

579
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:05,200
 they're so far away from the gospel, right?

580
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,440
 Maybe they're even hostile to the gospel.

581
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,240
 And some of them may be more interested in faith

582
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,360
 and asking you questions

583
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,080
 and you answer some of the questions.

584
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:16,200
 You know, you could put them on a spectrum.

585
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,480
 You know, humanly speaking.

586
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,400
 And then you think about it.

587
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:24,160
 Paul is actually the least expected person

588
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,080
 to come to Christ, right?

589
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:31,080
 He's again, super culture rabbi, right?

590
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:34,720
 Super culture, orthodox Jew.

591
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,200
 How would you expect him to come to Christ?

592
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,320
 And this story, quite unexpectedly and surprisingly,

593
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:47,280
 telling us the persecutor of the church coming to faith

594
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,040
 because the power of the risen Christ.

595
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,480
 And there is a second point.

596
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,920
 God's saving grace in an unworthy person.

597
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:58,720
 Essentially, you think about it,

598
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,760
 that applies to all of us, right?

599
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:06,760
 We're not more worthy than other people to come to Christ.

600
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,640
 It's all about saving grace.

601
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,640
 If you track the story of the book of Acts,

602
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,240
 you can start with chapter seven,

603
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,480
 a little bit before the story that we read.

604
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,880
 Paul's conversion, the way to Damascus, chapter nine.

605
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,800
 Chapter seven already talks about God showing himself,

606
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:30,400
 his glory to many different people.

607
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:35,920
 And that is the long sermon of Stephen, the first martyr.

608
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,440
 And in that long sermon in chapter seven,

609
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,840
 he's actually doing something like a summary

610
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,480
 of the entire Old Testament.

611
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,120
 So we start with Abraham,

612
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,840
 that the glory of God showed to Abraham

613
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,680
 in a foreign place, in Mesopotamia.

614
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,960
 Where was Abraham from?

615
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,520
 Where was he from?

616
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,800
 Country of birth.

617
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:03,720
 Mesopotamia, Iraq.

618
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,680
 In some sense, Abraham is Iraqi.

619
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:10,240
 He was not straightly an Israelite.

620
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,280
 He's a foreigner, but God showed himself to him.

621
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:17,080
 And then Stephen surveyed the Old Testament story

622
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,240
 and saying that in wilderness,

623
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:23,840
 God showed himself to Moses and to the Israelites.

624
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,880
 And he talks about different episodes

625
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,240
 of the Old Testament story,

626
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:30,400
 and God will show them the glory

627
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,640
 and be present with his people.

628
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,240
 And interestingly, what is not mentioned

629
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:39,560
 in Stephen's sermon was Jerusalem.

630
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,080
 He never talked about Jerusalem, the first temple,

631
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,960
 the glory of God filled the temple

632
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,960
 when it was devastated in the time of Solomon.

633
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,640
 He never mentioned that.

634
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:53,800
 At the end of his sermon, his punchline here,

635
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,920
 the most high God does not live in temple

636
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,960
 made by human hands.

637
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,000
 He was probably, he was speaking this sermon in Jerusalem.

638
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,960
 He was probably pointing to the temple.

639
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:11,040
 And that's why the Jews wanted to kill him, right?

640
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:16,200
 You speak bad words about our temple.

641
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,480
 Are you kidding me?

642
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,360
 Right?

643
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,560
 And then they stone him.

644
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:25,960
 And then chapter eight, Philip sent to Samaria.

645
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:30,760
 Samaria, the enemy's territory.

646
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,720
 Samaritans, unworthy of Christ.

647
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,360
 And they came to Christ.

648
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,960
 And then the end of chapter eight,

649
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,600
 he was being sent to a eunuch

650
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,680
 and somebody with defect in his body.

651
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:44,200
 And he's unworthy to go into the temple,

652
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,840
 going to the presence of God to see God.

653
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:51,840
 But God show himself to this unworthy man.

654
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,240
 And then chapter nine is Paul's conversion.

655
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:59,240
 Chapter 10, Peter is being sent to Caesarea Militima.

656
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:04,000
 Caesarea was the Las Vegas of the first century.

657
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,880
 And he met a guy called Cornelius, a Roman,

658
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,560
 someone who is enemy to the Jews.

659
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,120
 And he came to faith.

660
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,760
 He was unworthy.

661
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,720
 And everyone is unworthy.

662
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,920
 But the living Christ show himself to them.

663
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,040
 And story after story proves one point,

664
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,880
 that God's glory, God's grace is extended to all,

665
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:29,040
 is not bound by human boundaries.

666
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,360
 And God's resurrection power can be displayed

667
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,760
 in every single one of us, even you and me.

668
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,520
 And that's why Paul and his chapter,

669
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,000
 chapter 15 of first Corinthians,

670
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,080
 he says, "I am not the worthy one to receive this grace,

671
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,800
 "special favor on me.

672
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:49,760
 "I work harder than anyone because I feel unworthy,

673
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:54,760
 "because I sense, I feel this grace is so real to me."

674
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:58,000
 The living Christ showing himself to me.

675
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,920
 And made me a new man, a new beginning.

676
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,720
 In Christ, we do have new beginning.

677
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,160
 Paul is the proof.

678
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,280
 And you are the proof.

679
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,360
 We are the proof.

680
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:14,720
 In Christ, we should be new,

681
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,440
 in some foundational way.

682
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,520
 I'll close with one story.

683
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:25,360
 I know a sister, a sister in Christ in Israel,

684
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,760
 some years ago.

685
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:30,640
 And she has been coming to church for worship

686
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,480
 very faithfully.

687
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,120
 And she is married to a Jewish man.

688
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,280
 And as you know, most of the Jews,

689
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,880
 they don't accept Jesus as Messiah.

690
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,280
 This is, you kidding me?

691
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,680
 This is a joke, right?

692
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,400
 This is something block.

693
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,440
 But eventually, you know,

694
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:48,040
 I spent some time in Israel, in Jerusalem,

695
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,320
 and I often go to that church every single week.

696
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,560
 And then eventually, her husband comes to the church.

697
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:57,400
 And according to her husband,

698
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,520
 why is he attracted to the church?

699
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,440
 He's a Jewish man.

700
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,280
 And he said, "Very simple.

701
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,360
 "Because I see the differences

702
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:12,360
 "the gospel makes in my wife's life."

703
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,960
 And he said, you know, every single week

704
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,280
 after she goes to church,

705
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:23,880
 the husband feels like she's different.

706
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,680
 She's like some sort of new person.

707
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:32,040
 Joyful, more positive, you know,

708
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,880
 dealing with life issues, you know.

709
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,440
 A foundationally different way.

710
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:42,680
 And, you know, cooking is better, at least for the day.

711
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:46,080
 So he says the difference, you know.

712
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:49,680
 I see, you know, that's the whole point of the story.

713
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,360
 Sometimes we come to church, we feel like,

714
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,800
 oh, this is such a burden, right?

715
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,360
 A checkbox, okay, I'm done, okay?

716
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,400
 Okay, I go on my way Monday to Saturday, right?

717
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,640
 Okay, you know, forget about it.

718
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,280
 This is what the difference should make in our lives.

719
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,640
 A new beginning, right?

720
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,600
 A new pursuit.

721
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:12,480
 Back in our old self, back in our old days,

722
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,880
 what do you pursue about?

723
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,720
 What do you think about most of the time?

724
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:20,400
 You know, lust, material things?

725
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,880
 What do you concern about?

726
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,200
 What do you worry about?

727
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:28,000
 You know, the living Christ who died and rose again

728
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,760
 should give us a new start

729
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,520
 so that we can work toward the new world,

730
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,440
 which is the new heaven and new earth.

731
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:41,160
 We pray that we can do that and make that decision today.

732
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:45,040
 Think about what resurrection will make

733
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:49,360
 a foundational difference in your life,

734
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,560
 your attitude, your direction, right?

735
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,920
 The object of your pursuit.

736
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,920
 Everything will be ruled by Christ

737
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,680
 and we are working toward that goal, right?

738
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,480
 Let's all pray and close.

739
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,240
 And we're gonna sing our last song,

740
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,160
 "You Are My No No,"

741
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:10,040
 and I ask that you praise Him to come up here.

742
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:10,880
 Let's all pray.

743
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,480
 Father, as we close,

744
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:20,160
 we ask that your Spirit will remind us

745
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:24,440
 the old things that are still, you know,

746
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,960
 putting a hose on our lives,

747
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,840
 making us to look back all the time.

748
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:35,080
 And I pray, I pray that you will make us new.

749
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:38,920
 In Christ, who has died and rose again,

750
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,320
 He is the one who give us hope.

751
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,400
 He is the one who give us a new chapter

752
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:47,640
 and help us to be in Christ.

753
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,920
 The old has gone and the new has come.

754
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,920
 And praise you, Father,

755
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,920
 because we believe and we follow a living Christ.

756
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:00,600
 Show yourself, show your glory

757
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,440
 in this place, this unworthy place.

758
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:08,360
 Show your glory and your grace to this unworthy person.

759
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,400
 And thank you for your grace.

760
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,560
 In Christ, we pray.

761
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:22,560
