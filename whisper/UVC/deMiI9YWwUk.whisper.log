[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   [Music]
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Hello, everyone!
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Welcome back to Family Sunday School.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   I'm Ms. Rebecca.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   Today is the 7th episode.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   Have you noticed anything different about Ms. Rebecca today?
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   Her hair is different, right?
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   She's wearing a pony tail.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   Do you know what a pony tail is?
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   "Ma" is horse. "Mei" is tail.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   So what is a pony tail?
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   Pony tail!
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   Ma is pony tail.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   Ma Mei!
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   Pony tail.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   And what color is Ms. Rebecca wearing?
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   You can't see it now, but her top is black.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   Her bottom is also black.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   All black.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   Why?
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   Why?
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   Why is Ms. Rebecca wearing all black?
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   We'll find out in today's story.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   But first things first.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Let's talk about the last episode.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   Let's repeat.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   We talked a lot about crowns in the last episode, right?
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Did you make a crown?
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Is it full of gold and jewelry?
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   It's shining.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   But our Savior Jesus decided to wear what crown?
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Yes, it's very painful and tight.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   It's like a new crown.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   It's all thorns.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Thorns poking at his forehead.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   It's bleeding.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   He's even holding his own cross.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   What does the sign say?
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   King of Jews.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   He's being mocked.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   He's being nailed to the cross.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   That's what we're going to talk about in today's episode.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   What happens after being nailed to the cross?
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Can you guess why Ms. Rebecca is wearing all black?
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   You can't or you don't know?
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   It's okay.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Ms. Rebecca will smile after the Bible story.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Or you'll know in the middle of the story.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   But before we talk about Bible study,
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   we're going to play a game.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   What's the game?
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Ms. Rebecca will pretend to be a game.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   You have to guess.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Get ready.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Game time.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Activity time.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   It's game time.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Ms. Rebecca will focus on feelings today.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   You have to guess what Ms. Rebecca is feeling.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   I'm going to cover my face.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   You can guess.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   We're used to wearing masks.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   You can tell by the mask.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   If you cover your face,
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   you can tell by the eyes.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Let's get started.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Ready?
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   What are you feeling?
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Yes.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Angry.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   What are you feeling?
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Yes.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Ready?
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Number two.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   That was a practice.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Ready?
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Number two.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   What is it?
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Confused.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Next one.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Just with my eyes?
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Ready?
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Next one.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   Confused.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Confused.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Ready?
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Next one.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   What is it?
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Sneaky.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Feeling sneaky.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   Next one.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Can you guess?
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   Yes.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   Sad.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   What is it?
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   Disgusting.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   That's gross.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   Did you get it?
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   Happy.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Mr. Becker is happy.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   I hope you can learn facial communication.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   You can express yourself by talking.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   Your face, body language, and attitude can tell a lot.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Today we will focus on feelings.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   Let's see what Mr. Becker is wearing.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   What do you want to express?
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Happy.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   Sad.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Angry.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   Surprised.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   I want to wear black.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   Story time.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   Get ready.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   Story time.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   Hello everyone.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   It's Bible story time.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   Where did we leave off last time?
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   We left off in the middle of two statues.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   I want you to notice where the sun is.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   Yes, it's here.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   Where did we start?
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   Last supper.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   We prayed in the garden.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   Jesus was caught.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   Peter denied him three times.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   The rooster crowed.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   It was sunrise.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   After doing so many things, he was nailed to the cross.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   Mourning.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   Do you know when Jesus died?
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   When did he die?
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   Between 12 and 3pm.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   The sky was dark.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   12pm is usually lunch time.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   Lunch time is high noon.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   Why?
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   Because the sun was so high.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   It was very hot.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   Why was the sky like this?
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   It was dark.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   What does it mean?
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   Jesus died in the middle of nowhere.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   Huge deal.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   Jesus will die.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   The time of waiting was also in the middle of nowhere.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   The whole world knew.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   Of course, this is God's plan.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   Of course they knew.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   But there were many other things.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   Who was there when Jesus was nailed to the cross?
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   John, John, Mary, and other friends.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   There were also soldiers.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   Those who helped the government.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   Those who watched him and made sure he died.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   There were two criminals.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   They knew Jesus was innocent.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   They knew Jesus was God's son.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   He was innocent.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   Remember me in heaven.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   Jesus said to John,
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   "Because you have accepted me,
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   I will give you a place in heaven."
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   This means,
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   "Hey, this criminal knows.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   Can't other people see it?
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   Don't other people know?"
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   I don't know.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   And one other thing happened too.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   Jesus asked God,
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   "Have you forsaken me?"
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   "Do you really want me to die like this?
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   Do you really want me to suffer like this?"
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   "Yes, I do."
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   But do you remember how Jesus prayed in heaven?
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   "If you don't need this plan,
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   if you don't need me to die,
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   if you don't need me to suffer,
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   please take this cup away."
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   But this plan must be fulfilled.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   Jesus has to die.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   Before he died, he had a throat.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   Under the cross,
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   there was a soldier who brought vinegar.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   Who drank the vinegar?
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   It was very sour.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   He gave it to him.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   After he drank it, he said,
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   "God, forgive them.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   They don't know what they are doing."
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   He didn't know what he was doing.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   Okay.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   Jesus suffered so much.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   Before he died, he called God,
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   and put a cross on himself.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   Wow, what a big heart, right?
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   Super big.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   And then later,
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   Jesus breathed his last breath.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   And he died.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   And then more happened.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   You know what happened?
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   The whole earth was shaking.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   A huge earthquake.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   Do you know what happened next?
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   A Jewish man had a huge temple.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   He had a curtain there.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   He tore it apart.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   Wow, not only the earthquake,
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   the curtain was also torn.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   And those who died for God
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   started to come back to life.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   They started to come out of their graves.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   Wow.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   What do you think people who see this will do?
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   What is good?
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   Surprise, right?
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   That's a feeling.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   Wow.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   They were surprised.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   They would say, "This is really the Son of God."
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   "He is not an ordinary person."
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   "This Jesus is definitely very special."
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   "He must be the Son of God."
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   "Look what's happening."
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   But there are other feelings.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   Are there other feelings?
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   Marley, John, so many friends are down there.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   Jesus died.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   The cross on the cross is dead.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   The sky is dark.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   They feel so sad.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   You see these two people.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   These two men next to him.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   They are wearing black.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   One is called Joseph.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   A very rich Jew.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   He is also a council member.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   He is also a leader.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   The other is Nicodemus.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   He is a leader.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   In the previous story,
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   Nicodemus sneaked out to find Jesus.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   Because he believes Jesus is the Son of God.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   He believes Jesus is the Son of God.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   Nicodemus even called Jesus a teacher.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   They asked,
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   "Can you give us Jesus' body?"
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   "We will bury him."
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   They buried him in the Jewish way.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   But the Jewish way requires a lot of oil and money.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   Without this rich man, Joseph,
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   they would not be able to do it.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   Many of the Marley are there.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   Lots of Marys.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   Mary of Magdalene.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   Mary, Jesus' mother.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   And other women who love Jesus.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   They helped to find Jesus.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   They found a tomb back here.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   Back here.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   In the past, rich people dug a hole.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   They said, "After I die, I will be buried there."
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   They found a person who had not been buried yet.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   They said, "We will put Jesus in there."
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   Look at their faces.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   Do they want to cry?
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   They put Jesus in there.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   They put a stone in front of him.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   They said, "Don't use the paper to steal his body."
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   "We will show you that he will not come out."
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   "He will die."
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   This stone is very heavy.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   It covers the entrance and the exit.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   I can go in.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   Because this tomb is like a cave.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   There is no door behind.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   There is only one door.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   This door is covered by a stone.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   Think about it.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   How did they feel?
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   How did the 12 disciples feel?
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   John, Peter, and all the others.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   They were with Jesus.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   But now they are waiting.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   But do you think the disciples remember
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   Jesus once told them,
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   "I will die.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   It doesn't matter.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   I will be resurrected in a few days."
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   This is God's plan.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   God has said this many times.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   But I don't know if the disciples and Jesus' friends
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   remember that moment.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   Because a lot of things happened.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   How did they feel?
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   Confused.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   Everything was very confusing.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   There was a lot of mixture of emotions.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   Right?
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   This story is about Good Friday.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   This is the day Jesus died.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   It was a dark and gloomy Friday.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   It was sad.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   It was gloomy.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   It was gloomy.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   I don't know what happened.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   I don't know what I could do.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   But I don't know what I could do.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   But I don't know what I could do.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   But I don't know what I could do.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   But I don't know what I could do.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   But I don't know what I could do.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   But I don't know what I could do.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   But I don't know what I could do.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   But I don't know what I could do.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   But I don't know what I could do.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   But I don't know what I could do.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   But I don't know what I could do.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   But I don't know what I could do.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   But I don't know what I could do.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   But I don't know what I could do.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   But I don't know what I could do.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   In three days, what will happen?
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   He rises.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   That's what makes it good.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   It's good for you.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   And it's good for me.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   It's good for everybody.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   Jesus' death is good for everyone.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   Because his death is good for everyone.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   Because his death is good for everyone.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   Because his death is good for everyone.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   Because his death is good for everyone.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   Do you know why Mr. Buckethead
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   is wearing a full body suit?
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   Why is he wearing a full body suit?
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   Why is he wearing a full body suit?
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   Because we usually celebrate
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   Good Friday.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   We celebrate Jesus' death.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   We celebrate Jesus' death.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   In many cultures,
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   people wear dark or dark suits
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   to funerals.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   People wear all black or all dark.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   People wear all black or all dark.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   Because dark or dark suits
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   often represent what?
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   Which feeling?
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   This feeling?
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   Or
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   this feeling?
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   Yes.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   Sadness.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   We cry and be sad
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   for the lost person,
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   the dead person,
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   the lost Jesus,
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   the dead Jesus.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   There is one point
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   I want to mention to everyone.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   Jesus' death
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   Jesus' death
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   is a huge deal.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   is a huge deal.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   Not just because
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   other people are watching.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   Mary,
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   Jesus' earthly mother,
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   watching her son
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   being crucified.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   Jesus called John,
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   John, remember to take care of my mother.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   John, remember to take care of my mother.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   Those feelings.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   What's the good of having a son?
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   Maybe confused?
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   What happened?
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   Jesus is God's son.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   Why did this happen?
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   Why did he die?
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   Mary was very sad.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   Mary was very sad.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   So sad.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   Or some people were happy.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   Yes!
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   Getting rid of Jesus, crucify him.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   Yes!
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   Some people
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   were angry.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   What?
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   What?
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   Crucify Jesus?
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   Or the two sinners
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   next to him
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   would think,
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   I know I made a mistake.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   Jesus is not wrong.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   I know I made a mistake.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   Jesus is not wrong.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   What?
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   What?
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   What?
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   There are many different feelings.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   Many different feelings.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   Right?
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   But Heaven
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   also has feelings.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   Remember?
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   Boom! Boom! Boom!
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   Heaven is dark.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   There is one more thing.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   In the Great Hall,
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   the Great Holy Temple,
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   there is a bowl,
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   a curtain,
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   like this.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   A thick curtain.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   It is removed.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   Do you know what this curtain
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   was used for?
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   In the past,
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   the Great Holy Temple
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   had a curtain
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   to block out
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   who could approach God
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   and who could not.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   Can you go behind the curtain?
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   It means you can go.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   It means you are
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   being excluded from the Great Hall.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   Not everyone
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   can go.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   So,
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   in the story,
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   it is said that the curtain was removed.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   It means
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   it no longer blocks you
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   from going in.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   Let's try. How hard is it to remove the curtain?
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   Here is a piece of paper.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   Remove.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   Super easy, right?
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   You can keep removing it.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   You can remove
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   both layers.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   Here is a piece of paper.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   Remove.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   You can't remove it.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   I can't remove it with this much strength.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   Try to remove it.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   You can't cut it.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   The story does not say
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   you have to cut the paper.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   It is the curtain itself that is torn.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   What does it mean?
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   The curtain separates
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   God from others.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   Not the select few.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   Not the chosen few.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   Yes.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   That's right.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   What does it mean?
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   Jesus' death
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   is for everyone.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   Now, everyone
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   can accept Jesus and approach Him.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   No longer a barrier.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   Barrier no more.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   No more blocking.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   Wow.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   Huge deal.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   But also sad.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   Right?
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   Sigh.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   Especially
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   Jesus' good friend.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   When a good friend
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   is gone,
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   when a good friend dies,
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   of course you will be sad.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   So Good Friday
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   is the cost
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   of salvation.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   Wow.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   The cost of
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   washing away my sins.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   Tear this cloth away.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   That cloth.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   It is worth it.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   But the question is
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   does Jesus die worth it?
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   This is God's plan.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   Of course
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   He thinks it is worth it.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   That,
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   my friends,
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   is a lot of love.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   It is worth it.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   It is worth the sacrifice.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   But you know what?
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   Jesus has said it will happen.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   He also said
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   He will be resurrected.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   But sometimes
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   we may not remember
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   or be clear.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   Many disciples
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   may be very confused.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   What is going on?
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   But you and I
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   because it is this side of the story
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   we can know
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   what will happen.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   Next time
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   continue the story.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   Chinese time!
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   OK.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   When I was in the game
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   I said
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   many different sounds
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   or feelings.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   Phew.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   In English
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   we may not know many feelings.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   Happy
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   and sad.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   But happy and sad
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   there are many
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   feelings in the middle.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   I will teach you a few.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   OK.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   So next time
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   how are you doing?
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   I am fine. I am happy. I am sad.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   But there are many
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   feelings in the middle.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   Next time
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   when someone asks you in Chinese
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   how are you?
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   You can answer many different things.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   Happy
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   and sad.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   You know what?
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   Often
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   my kids will say
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   not happy or sad
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   but a little annoyed.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   Bothered.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   Irritated.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   That's one.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   Annoyed.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   Another one
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   which sounds like
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   a
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   food.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   Like vinegar.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   Have you ever had vinegar?
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   Have you ever had vinegar?
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   Sour.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   A little sour.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   Black vinegar is sour. White vinegar is sour.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   Anyway, it's sour.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   If your feeling
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   is sour
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   you feel sour.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   You would make that face.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   Very sour.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   Why?
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   Irritable.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   Very irritable.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   Usually
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   if I feel
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   very annoyed
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   and then maybe
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   I am irritable
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   people would say
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   Mr. Becker, you are very annoying.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   Annoyed.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   Annoyed.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   You know what that is put together?
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   Annoyed.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   The stresses
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   of life. Stress.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   Wow.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   Chinese, so efficient.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   Just a syllable.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   Just a syllable.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   Irritated.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   Bothered.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   Irritated.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   Bothered.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   Irritable.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   Irritable.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   Irritable.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   Sour.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   Sour.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   Stressed.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   Stress.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   So much meaning.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   So rich.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   Learn your Chinese.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   Bye.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   Hello, everyone.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   Hello, everyone.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   At home extension time.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   We talked about a lot of different feelings in this story.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   Right?
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   Why am I wearing black?
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   For basically Good Friday.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   Basically, it's Jesus' funeral.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   Right?
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   Or maybe you went to a funeral
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   and wore black or
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   white.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   Depends on the culture.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   Depends on the funeral.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   How can you extend this learning at home?
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   Why does color matter?
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   Color can express
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   the feeling.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   Right?
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   We talked about a lot of different feelings today.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   Let's think about
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   different paintings.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   Art.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   Painting.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   What does red
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   mean?
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   Maybe danger.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   You can ask your child,
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   "What is red?"
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   Look around.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   "What is red?"
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   Stop sign.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   Red light. Right?
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   Caution.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   Feeling.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   See the color?
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   Next color.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   Maybe something is yellow.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   That's pretty
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   uplifting. Happy.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   Why?
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   Let's see what is
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   naturally yellow.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   Sunshine.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   Yellow sunshine.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   Right?
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   We can talk about these things.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   Blue is a
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   cooler color.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   A cooler color.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   Not a warm color.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   What feeling?
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   Maybe peaceful.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   Maybe calm.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   Or a calm feeling.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   You can ask your child.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   Ask your child
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   and connect
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   why Mr. Rebecca wore black today.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   Why did he wear
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   this color at the funeral?
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   What is the connection
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   between color and feeling?
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   Rainbow color.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   There are many colors.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   But look again.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   What does grey
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   mean?
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   What does grey mean?
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   It's more somber.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   Right?
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   What does black
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   mean?
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   What does black mean?
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   It's more mysterious.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   Or
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   it's more scary.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   Or sad.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   So,
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   when you can use these colors
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   to help your child
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   to express
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   their feelings,
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   the attachment
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   to the Bible story
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   will be deeper.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   But the ability to express
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   will be stronger.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   We have another
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   at-home extension.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   Draw what you hear.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   We talked about different
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   feelings today.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   Different facial expressions.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   Different looks.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   Different colors.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   How to connect colors and feelings.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   Like I wore black.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   It means sadness
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   or sadness.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   Using colors and feelings
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   to tell a story.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   This Bible story
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   is for children to draw.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   Draw what you hear.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   There are many ways to do it.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   Children can use any colored pen
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   to draw.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   But when they are drawing,
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   they are drawing to listen.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   Either to the story told by parents
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   or to the story read in the Bible.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   Jesus dies and was buried.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   Or they can rewind
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   to the story I told.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   They can listen,
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   not watch.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   Listen, listen, draw.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   I will show you.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   I don't have to do the whole story.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   But you will get the picture.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   You can give them
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   many different words.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   There are many different scenes.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   You will have a story
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   maybe 3, 4, 5 versions.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   You can write
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   the writing
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   and text together.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   You will have your own story.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   Just one way.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   I will use this crayon effect.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   I will say
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   Oh, you need to use yellow.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   Because
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   when Jesus was nailed to the cross,
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   what is it?
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   It is mourning.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   The cross of Jesus.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   The cross of Jesus.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   There is also
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   a time.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   But when Jesus was nailed to the cross,
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   the time passed.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   It was 12 o'clock.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   High noon.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   The time passed.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   It became
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   3 o'clock.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   But what happened
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   at 12 o'clock to 3 o'clock?
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   Wow, it was a big deal.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   The whole sky
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   was black.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   It was black.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   It was black.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   Black.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   Why?
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   Because Jesus was nailed to the cross
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   to die.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   It was a big deal.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   That's why.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   Not only was it black.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   It was bright and black.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   But
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   Wow, it was
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   an earthquake.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   During this time,
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   children can draw
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   and make a paper earthquake.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   They can also
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   shake the paper.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   Or crumble the paper.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   If there is a next scene,
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   they can use the second paper.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   Right?
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   Let them draw
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   until
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   they can't draw anymore.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   The story is over.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   You have your story.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   You can continue.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   You can also repeat
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   the previous episodes.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   Or the next episodes.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   You can have
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   your own story.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   You can write and draw.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   Your own story.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   Self-written, self-illustrated.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   Okay? Give it a try.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   [music]
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   [music]
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   [music]
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   [music]
