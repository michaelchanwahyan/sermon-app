1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,160
 Good morning family. It's good to be with you again virtually. We're going to be back in Matthew

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,760
 chapter 6 this morning and continuing to talk about what Jesus is focusing on at the beginning

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:20,000
 of this passage and that is this theme of hypocrisy and how we as his followers, as subjects of the

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,920
 kingdom, as believers in Jesus should seek to avoid hypocrisy in our lives. And Jesus gives us some

5
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:34,880
 very challenging and convicting illustrations to help us see how we fall into hypocrisy.

6
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:42,400
 And he lays out in the first half of this chapter three different illustrations and he points out

7
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:50,240
 how we can fall into religious hypocrisy in our giving or our good works, in our prayer,

8
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:56,000
 and in our fasting. And so he really covers a wide range of what we would think of as our

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,160
 devotion to God and how it shows us that it has to be from a right heart, from a right motivation,

10
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,680
 or it can become hollow and it can become something that is empty and something that is even

11
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:14,400
 full of hypocrisy, something that's pretending to be something that it's not. Last week we kind of

12
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,320
 just did an introduction. We looked at Matthew chapter 6 verse 1 where Jesus says, "Beware of

13
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,360
 practicing your righteousness before other people in order to be seen by them, for then you will

14
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,480
 have no reward from your Father who is in heaven." And we just kind of introduced this concept of

15
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:37,120
 hypocrisy and what it can look like in our lives. And we began to define hypocrisy in a biblical

16
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:43,280
 sense as the act of pretending to be something that we're not or acting as if we're something

17
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:49,200
 that we're not. We're pretty familiar with that definition. Actually the word hypocrisy that we

18
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,440
 use in English has roots all the way back in a Greek word that was the word for an actor or someone

19
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:03,840
 on stage. And so it carries that connection, that meaning of pretending or acting to be something

20
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:10,560
 that you are not. And that's a part of the word. But the other way we defined it biblically is that

21
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,480
 hypocrisy is when we deceive ourselves into thinking that we are meeting God's standards

22
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:23,760
 when we aren't and we can't and we don't. And hypocrisy is when we begin to think that we are

23
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,240
 satisfying God's standards, that we are righteous on our own, that we are right with God on our own,

24
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:35,600
 that we are doing everything that we should be doing in life apart from God. And we cannot do

25
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:41,440
 that. We cannot live rightly with God apart from God's help. We've talked about that so much over

26
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,480
 the past few weeks that Jesus wants to live through us and that's the only way that we can

27
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:52,000
 live rightly before God is when Jesus is living through us. And when we forget that and begin to

28
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,680
 think it's us who are going to make ourselves right with God, that we're going to earn something or

29
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:03,360
 that we're going to be full of good works on our own, then we begin to walk in hypocrisy. We begin

30
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,280
 to deceive ourselves into thinking we can meet God's standard when we can't and we don't.

31
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,320
 Today we're going to continue on and look at verses two to four that kind of fill out this

32
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:22,240
 first illustration that Jesus gives us of hypocrisy. We'll read verse one again. He says,

33
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,000
 "Beware of practicing your righteousness before other people in order to be seen by them, for

34
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,040
 then you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven. Thus, when you give to the needy,

35
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,480
 sound no trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they

36
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:43,760
 may be praised by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. But when you

37
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:49,600
 give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving

38
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:57,360
 may be in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will reward you." Jesus is calling out

39
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:04,720
 our hypocrisy here and calling out the fact that we do so many things to be seen of others and to

40
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:11,600
 impress others. We discussed that a little bit last week that Matthew 5, 16 talks about letting

41
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:17,200
 our light shine before men. But what is the focus in that verse? It's so that others may see our

42
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,720
 good works and glorify our Father which is in heaven. That verse is talking about that light

43
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,600
 that shines. That is Jesus living through us. It's saying that as Jesus lives through us,

44
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,760
 it will draw people's attention to us and it will cause them to see God and to glorify Him.

45
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:39,120
 But these verses are describing something totally different where we do what we think are good works,

46
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,000
 but they're selfishly motivated and they're selfishly focused and they ultimately put the

47
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,880
 focus on us. When people look at our selfish good works, they don't see Jesus, they see us. God is

48
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,800
 not glorified, we are glorified. And that's what Jesus is pointing out here when He says

49
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,880
 that in verse 1 that if we do things just to be seen by others, that that's not going to honor

50
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:08,000
 God. There's not going to be any reward from God. He says that in verse 2 that the hypocrites do

51
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,800
 things so that they'll be praised by others, so that other people will recognize them and say

52
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,520
 good things about them. And He says that they've received their reward, that the only reward

53
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:23,120
 they're going to get is the hollow praise of other people. And He says when you're giving,

54
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:30,240
 just to remove that temptation, do it in secret. Don't even let others know what you're doing to

55
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:36,240
 give away or what you're doing to care for someone else or what you're doing to share with someone

56
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,600
 else, because it's not about what other people see and perceive and think about you, it's about

57
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,880
 your heart before God. That's what Jesus is calling us to. We're going to be talking more and

58
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,760
 more about hypocrisy over the next few weeks because Jesus gives us so much time in this passage, so

59
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:57,040
 much time in this Sermon on the Mount. So as we talk about it, we're going to kind of break it

60
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:03,040
 out into a few different sections. And the topic that I want us to think about this week is how

61
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:10,640
 hypocrisy, and specifically religious hypocrisy, how maybe that has affected us and how maybe that's

62
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:16,400
 hurt us and how we can deal with that in our lives. So I want us to consider that today.

63
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:23,600
 And I think when we consider religious hypocrisy and hypocrisy that we've encountered,

64
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,960
 maybe if we grew up in church or even if we didn't, just in some connection that we had to

65
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:35,200
 church or to people of faith, maybe we saw something that didn't quite line up where

66
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:40,800
 someone's words and their actions didn't agree. Maybe we saw something where someone asked us to

67
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,600
 live up to a standard that they weren't living up to. Or maybe we saw an even worse form of hypocrisy.

68
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:52,080
 But the point is, those things may have hurt us, may have affected us in some way. And probably

69
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,440
 all of us have dealt with that in our heart on some level or another. And when we think about

70
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:04,800
 those things, we have to see that it starts with a misplaced standard. That humans, we misplace

71
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:12,400
 our standards of righteousness. We misplace what the source of truth in our lives is. And that can

72
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:19,520
 lead to really dangerous and disastrous consequences. You know, some people do practice a self-righteous

73
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,840
 and dishonest religion. And that's what the Pharisees were doing. They were practicing a

74
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,480
 religion that was not honoring to God. And I'm using the word religion intentionally because

75
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:33,680
 the Pharisees were not living out a relationship with God. They were practicing a ritualistic

76
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,400
 religion. And it was not honoring to God and it was self-focused and it was ultimately

77
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,440
 self-righteous. It was a way for them to make a distinction between themselves and others and to

78
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,920
 try to show people that they were righteous and somehow better than other people. And to try to

79
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:54,240
 earn favor with God and to try to do good works that they felt like would get them into God's

80
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:01,200
 favor and also ultimately into heaven. And that's not what Jesus calls us to in the scripture.

81
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:08,320
 And unfortunately, a lot of people and even people in the church still try to relate to God in that

82
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:14,560
 same way. They try to live out a self-righteous ritualistic religion whereby they try to do a

83
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,120
 bunch of good works that they think will please God and do good works that they think will make a

84
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,920
 distinction between themselves and someone else and make them better than someone else and give

85
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:29,920
 them a sense of pride and righteousness in their goodness. And that's not what Jesus calls us to.

86
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:36,160
 Jesus actually tells a story about this and it's recorded in Luke chapter 18. In verse 9, it says

87
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:42,400
 this, "He also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous

88
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:47,760
 and treated others with content." That verse right there could be a great definition of religious

89
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,480
 hypocrisy. Trusting in ourselves that we're righteous and treating others with content.

90
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:58,960
 Jesus goes on to say this, "Two men went up into the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other

91
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:04,480
 a tax collector. The Pharisee standing by himself prayed thus, 'God, I thank you that I'm not like

92
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:10,880
 other men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week,

93
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,640
 I give tithes of all that I get.' But the tax collector standing far off would not even lift

94
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:23,920
 up his eyes to heaven but beat his breast saying, 'God, be merciful to me, a sinner.' I tell you,

95
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:29,280
 this man went down to his house justified rather than the other. For everyone who exalts himself

96
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:36,160
 will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted." Jesus gives us a perfect picture

97
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:42,400
 of religious hypocrisy here. He gives us this picture of this man who is doing a lot of

98
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:49,840
 external good works. From the outside he seems like the perfect guy. He's praying, he's fasting,

99
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:55,600
 he's giving tithes, but it's all for his own pride. It's all for the image that he puts forward to

100
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:01,760
 other people. It's not because his heart is in a place of humble devotion to God. And then there's

101
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:08,480
 this other man, this tax collector. In the first century Jewish culture, the tax collectors were

102
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:15,040
 hated people because they were people who were cooperating with the Romans to oppress their own

103
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:20,880
 people. So they were some of the most hated people in the society. They were considered

104
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:27,280
 totally corrupt and totally bad people. Jesus is saying, 'This guy who everybody thinks of as one

105
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:33,920
 of the worst people in culture and in society, he is being honest before God and he's saying, 'God,

106
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:39,600
 I can't even lift my eyes to look at you. I know how guilty I am. I know how broken I am. I know

107
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:46,880
 how much I need you.' And he's crying out in humility and that God actually hears and responds

108
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:55,680
 to this prayer and this cry of humble brokenness instead of this show of spiritual pride and

109
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:02,720
 self-righteousness that the Pharisee gives. And that still happens today. There are still people

110
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,440
 in the church, and maybe we've been those people at different times, who think that we've done

111
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,960
 something good and we've done a few right things in our life. And whether it's our church attendance

112
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:17,600
 or whether it's something that we've been a part of, we feel like it makes us better than someone

113
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:23,840
 else and we begin to operate in a hypocritical, self-righteous way. And that's wrong. That is not

114
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:30,320
 what Jesus wants for us. That is a misplaced standard. God's standard of holiness is a standard

115
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:36,800
 that applies to our heart, not a standard that applies to our external good works. Yes, when our

116
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,200
 heart is in the right place, beautiful good works flow out of that. It's not that our works don't

117
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:47,040
 matter, but it doesn't start with our works. It starts with our heart. And as humans, we can so

118
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:53,760
 easily fall into a self-righteous religion where it's all about the works. It's all about keeping

119
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:59,840
 the law. It's all about ticking the boxes. It's all about the external things that we do and say

120
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:05,760
 and don't do and don't say. And that's not what Jesus is calling us to. Another area that we see

121
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:12,320
 our misplaced standards is sometimes there are people put forward hurtful standards, impossible

122
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,600
 standards that are not God's standards. And we see that in the Pharisees. Clearly, that was one of

123
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,760
 the things that they were very good at. And Jesus calls them out for that multiple times in the

124
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:28,320
 Gospels. They were telling people to keep certain laws and customs and rituals and traditions that

125
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:34,320
 God never asked anyone to keep. And yet they were getting onto people for not keeping those laws or

126
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,680
 those customs or those traditions. And that happens today sometimes in the church. Sometimes people in

127
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,800
 the church choose to put a really strong emphasis on things that God never put an emphasis on.

128
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:50,640
 And they call people out for maybe the way they dress or some type of other cultural influence.

129
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:56,240
 They say, "Oh, you can't be a Christian and do this." Or, "You can't be a Christian and do that.

130
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,360
 You can't be a Christian and listen to this music or that or whatever." And people get really caught

131
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:07,440
 up in these external emphasis. And they ask people to adhere to standards that are not God's

132
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:13,120
 standards. And that's another misplaced standard. We need to go to Scripture to find out what God

133
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:20,800
 says are the standards of His kingdom and not take standards from the culture around us and not allow

134
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:27,840
 even good and well-intentioned things in our lives to become standards that we try to enforce on

135
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:32,880
 someone else. God may call us to a standard of holiness or righteousness or to a specific

136
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:39,360
 action or to avoiding a specific thing in our life in order to be right with Him. But if that

137
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,920
 standard is not in the Scripture and if He didn't call everybody else to it, then we don't need to

138
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,400
 try to enforce it in other people's lives. And that's another way that we sometimes have misplaced

139
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:53,200
 standards in the church is trying to make people keep standards that are not God's standards.

140
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,960
 And sometimes in the church, maybe we've experienced hurt from trying to keep an impossible

141
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:03,600
 standard. We talked about that a few weeks ago, Matthew 5, verse 48, where Jesus says we're to

142
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,880
 be perfect as our Father is perfect. We cannot keep that standard. And if we try to live up to

143
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:14,880
 that in our own strength, if we try to just be perfect and good and do everything right through

144
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:20,880
 trying really hard and through working at it as hard as we can, we will ultimately be disappointed

145
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:26,480
 and frustrated and crushed because we will not be able to do it. And yet some of us have done that.

146
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,600
 And that's a part of the hypocrisy that sometimes happens in the church. People misunderstand and

147
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,040
 they forget about God's grace. Or maybe they never understand God's grace in the first place.

148
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:42,880
 And they think that they're actually supposed to attain holiness through effort and through

149
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:49,920
 trying hard and through being something that they think they can be. And that was never what Jesus

150
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,960
 called us to. It's always been about God's grace. And Jesus made that clear in the beginning,

151
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:59,920
 that we couldn't keep that impossible standard of holiness, that it was only through Him,

152
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:05,040
 through His sacrifice, we can be forgiven, we can be cleansed. And as He lives through us,

153
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:11,440
 as we've been talking about, we can begin to live out the good works of the kingdom. And that's how

154
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:17,680
 the gospel works in our lives. But sometimes we forget that or we misunderstand it, and we try to

155
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,720
 live up to a standard that we cannot meet. And we get so frustrated and so hurt. Sometimes that

156
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,440
 leads to us walking away from faith or from church or from God and saying, "It's impossible.

157
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:33,440
 It's too hard. It can't be done. I'm done with it." Jesus never asked us to live up to an impossible

158
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:39,920
 standard. He asked us to repent and be forgiven and let Him live through us. Sometimes our misplaced

159
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,960
 standards are in our understanding of God. Sometimes we're hurt because we misunderstand

160
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:52,160
 God. Maybe we think God is just some angry deity that is just looking to judge and condemn and

161
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:58,480
 hurt us. That's a misunderstanding of who God is. And obviously, that will cause us to behave in a

162
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:04,320
 way towards other people that is hypocritical and out of balance. Or maybe we think God is just some

163
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:10,080
 type of Santa Claus God that He just rewards good behavior. And if we just do the right stuff, then

164
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:15,600
 we get what we want in life. And He gives us the relationship we want and the job we want and the

165
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:21,200
 house we want and the financial situation we want. That's a wrong perspective of God. And if we start

166
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:28,000
 to believe that, even in small ways in our mind, then we fall into hurt because we say, "Wait a

167
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:35,600
 second. I did what I thought I was supposed to do. I lived out the 'good behavior,' and then I didn't

168
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,680
 get the present that I wanted. I didn't get the present I wanted for Christmas. I didn't get the

169
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,520
 relationship I wanted. I didn't get the job I wanted. I didn't get into the school I wanted

170
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:50,080
 to get into. I didn't get the house I wanted." But that's not who God is. And if we thought that was

171
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:56,320
 who God was or someone else told us that was who God was, if someone told us that God was just

172
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,280
 rewarding good behavior, if someone told us that God was just all about health and wealth and

173
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:08,640
 prosperity, if someone told us that God was just trying to give us everything we want, then that

174
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:14,880
 hypocrisy can hurt us. Because we could say, "Well, I thought God said my life was going to be easy.

175
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:20,000
 I thought God said nothing bad would ever happen to me if I followed Him." That's not what God said.

176
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,960
 Jesus said that He came that we would have life and have it to the full. And having life to the

177
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:30,880
 full sometimes means experiencing joyful blessing from the hand of God. But having life to the full

178
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:37,680
 sometimes also means experiencing loss and adversity and difficulty and allowing that to

179
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:43,360
 shape us and to grow us and to form us and to mold us. And God uses those things in our life.

180
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,600
 And so sometimes the misplaced standard is that we have gotten some weird idea of God. And maybe

181
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,720
 we got it from someone in the church, maybe from a preacher or from a leader in the church who

182
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:58,320
 said something or taught something that wasn't really true to the scripture, and it caused us

183
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:05,600
 to get this wrong idea about God. And that form of hypocrisy caused us to be hurt. There are so

184
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,000
 many different ways that we can be hurt by hypocrisy in the church, by religious hypocrisy.

185
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,560
 Another one maybe is just spiritual abuse. Maybe there was a leader in the church that we observed

186
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:25,440
 or that we were a part of or someone that we read something that they had written or we heard some

187
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,640
 of their teachings online or whatever that they were just wrong and they were abusing people.

188
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:37,200
 Maybe they were manipulating people or maybe they were using people for financial gain or

189
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:43,520
 something else. There are those terrible things that happen in the church. There's stories of

190
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:48,640
 sexual abuse even in the church. And those things are terrible and they're completely wrong and they

191
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:54,240
 totally dishonor Jesus. But they do happen. First of all, there are people in the church who don't

192
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,760
 actually know Jesus. They're not actually followers of Jesus. They're not subjects of

193
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:02,400
 the kingdom. The Bible talks about that, that there are wolves among the sheep. There are

194
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,880
 people in the church who aren't truly in a relationship with God. And obviously people

195
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,960
 like that are going to abuse people and they're going to take advantage of things and they're

196
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,400
 going to try to take money from people or manipulate people. That's going to happen.

197
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,320
 But there are even people in the church who are followers of Jesus but they're

198
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,560
 misunderstanding God's word or they're misinterpreting scripture in some way and

199
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:29,760
 that's causing them to do things that are damaging to others. Or there are people in the church who,

200
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,920
 maybe they're a follower of Jesus but they are in bondage to sin and they haven't gotten free

201
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:40,400
 from sin the way they should have. And because of their captivity to sin, they are taking actions

202
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:47,280
 that are wrong. And that happens in the church. There is hypocrisy in the church and it doesn't

203
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:53,920
 help us as believers to try to hide it or to try to cover up or to try to ignore it or to try to

204
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:58,560
 pretend it doesn't exist. That actually makes it worse. We need to be honest about it and we need

205
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:04,320
 to do what Jesus did and say, "Hey, this is not right. This is not the heart of the gospel for

206
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,720
 people to do things to be seen by others, for people to hide who they really are, for people

207
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:14,080
 to pretend to be something they're not, for people to stand up one day and act righteous and tell

208
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,640
 other people to be righteous and then turn around and do sinful or hurtful things to people. Those

209
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,600
 things are wrong and we need to be clear about that in the church. We need to call those things

210
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:28,720
 out. We need to lament over those things and mourn over those things and repent and turn away and

211
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:35,120
 turn our eyes back towards Jesus and towards following Him. Hypocrisy is so damaging and

212
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:42,080
 that's why Jesus is calling it out. So I want to encourage you if you've encountered hypocrisy in

213
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,800
 the church and if it's been hurtful to you, I want to encourage you. I want to say sorry. I

214
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:51,760
 want to apologize for that. I want to say as I just did that those things are real. They do happen

215
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:57,120
 in the church and it's wrong and it shouldn't happen and I'm sorry if that's happened to you.

216
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:03,360
 But I also want to point you towards Jesus. You know, one of the things that we can have misplaced

217
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,680
 when we encounter hypocrisy is misplaced expectations. Sometimes we have an expectation

218
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:14,640
 of a leader or another person in the church and we kind of put them on a pedestal because we think

219
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,640
 they're going to do everything right. We think they'll never let us down and we think they're

220
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:24,640
 really close to perfect. And when we do that, when we have misplaced expectations, we will at some

221
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:31,920
 point encounter disappointment. People will always fall off of those pedestals that we put them on

222
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:37,440
 and so we shouldn't do that. We should understand that even followers of Jesus who are genuine and

223
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,240
 who love God with all their heart and are seeking to follow Him, they are still human and they're

224
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:48,320
 still going to make mistakes too. We shouldn't put them on a pedestal. Only Jesus is perfect. Only

225
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:54,080
 Jesus is never going to disappoint us. Only Jesus is always going to be with us and never leave us

226
00:21:54,080 --> 00:22:01,360
 or forsake us. Humans cannot take that place, cannot take that role that only Jesus can be in.

227
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:07,440
 And so we shouldn't put other people on a pedestal. Another way that our misplaced expectations

228
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,800
 express ourselves is sometimes we get caught up in the hypocrisy, right? Sometimes we maybe

229
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:18,480
 drink some of the Kool-Aid that someone else is drinking about how righteous they are and we start

230
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:24,320
 to drink some of our own Kool-Aid and say, "Yeah, I'm pretty righteous too. I think I'm really

231
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:30,880
 getting this figured out and I think I'm really becoming a really great Christian and I'm doing a

232
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:36,080
 fantastic job. I know I'm doing way better than the people around me so I'm in pretty good shape."

233
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:43,360
 We can start to feel that way and we can misplace expectations in ourselves. And when we do that,

234
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:49,360
 we're going to experience deep hurt and frustration because sooner or later we are going to fall off

235
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:54,240
 that pedestal and we're going to see our own brokenness and our own sin. And we can't hide it

236
00:22:54,240 --> 00:23:00,080
 from ourselves because it's in our heart. We may hide it from someone else. We may act and pretend

237
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,800
 in front of others that we don't have any struggles but we know our own struggles and

238
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:10,640
 we'll feel ourselves falling away from God and we'll say, "I'm not who I want to be." And we'll

239
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:16,720
 be crushed by that misplaced expectation in ourselves. We were never supposed to expect

240
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:22,960
 ourselves or anyone else to live the perfect life. Jesus is the only one who can do that.

241
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:28,240
 What we should expect of ourselves and others, including leaders in the church, is to live a

242
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,280
 life that is surrendered to the rule and reign of God. To live a life that is surrendered to Jesus

243
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:38,480
 and to let Jesus live through them. That's what we can expect. And to be someone who is willing

244
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,120
 to repent when they make mistakes and who is willing to be forgiven by Christ and to be

245
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:48,720
 cleansed. That's what we can expect. But we should not expect ourselves to be on some pedestal of

246
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:55,360
 perfection because if we do, we will fall off and we'll be hurt by that fall. So how do we deal

247
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:03,200
 with the pain of hypocrisy? If we have been hurt in some way by self-righteous religion and we've

248
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,080
 experienced the pain of that, how do we deal with that? And how do we deal with that in a way that

249
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:14,160
 allows us to continue to have a soft heart towards God and a soft heart towards relationship with God

250
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:19,840
 and a soft heart towards God's church? I think one of the first things that we need to think about

251
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:28,560
 and understand is that hypocrisy often causes us to have a misplaced pain. What I mean by that

252
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:33,200
 is that sometimes we are hurt by things that happen in the church. We are hurt by things that

253
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:39,920
 other Christians or people who profess to be Christians may inflict on us. And we misplace

254
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:46,240
 that pain onto Jesus or onto God and assume that we've been hurt by God or we've been hurt by Jesus.

255
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:52,960
 And that's simply not true. Jesus is not the source of self-righteousness and hypocrisy.

256
00:24:52,960 --> 00:25:00,960
 Jesus is not the source of our pain. Jesus loves us and desires good for us. But so often in our

257
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:07,520
 culture and in our own minds, we create these caricatures of Jesus where we think Jesus is

258
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:12,560
 something that he's not. We have an image of Jesus that's different from the reality of who Jesus is.

259
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:20,960
 You know, in our culture, people blame Jesus and Christianity and God for basically every evil of

260
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:27,040
 our culture, right? People sometimes think Jesus is some type of agent of European imperialism,

261
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:33,200
 or they think Jesus is a source of discrimination, or that Jesus didn't care about women, or that

262
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:40,800
 Jesus promotes tribalism, or that Jesus promotes conflict between people groups. And people accuse

263
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:46,240
 Jesus of all these different things. Those are caricatures of Jesus. Those are images that are

264
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:52,640
 created that are not true to the reality of who Jesus is. And if we want to know the true Jesus,

265
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:58,640
 we need to look at the Word of God and see who Jesus actually was and what he actually said.

266
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:06,240
 And when we do that, we see something very different from the caricatures of Jesus that

267
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:13,840
 we see in our culture and that sometimes exist in our mind. Jesus was not European. He was Jewish.

268
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:19,760
 He was from the Middle East. Jesus was not pursuing political power in any way. He was

269
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:25,600
 full of spiritual power and he was pursuing the healing of human hearts. Jesus deeply cared about

270
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,560
 women and elevated them to the place that God originally gave them, which is equal in worth

271
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:37,840
 and essence and value to men. Jesus was clear about that. Jesus actually called people out for

272
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:43,600
 their prejudice and their racism and their discrimination. Jesus spoke against it. Jesus,

273
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:49,280
 as he is in this very passage we're looking at today, called people out for their hypocrisy

274
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:54,400
 and their pride and the distinctions that they made between themselves and other groups of people.

275
00:26:54,400 --> 00:27:00,880
 Jesus called people out for their ethnocentrism. Jesus did all of these things. Jesus was not who

276
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:08,560
 we often make him out to be in our mind. And Jesus was certainly not some type of angry or unkind God

277
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:15,120
 that wanted to inflict pain on people or condemn them or kick them out. That's not who Jesus was.

278
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:19,600
 But sometimes when we've experienced that in the church or we've experienced that from

279
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:25,680
 other people who are Christians or profess to be Christians, we think that that came from God or

280
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:31,920
 it came from Jesus. And that's simply not true. If we go back to the Word and examine who Jesus is,

281
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:38,560
 what he said, what he did, we find that he loves us and his message was one of grace, forgiveness,

282
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:44,720
 and calling us to live in right relationship with God, with the one who created us.

283
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:50,800
 Now, yes, God has standards and those standards are clear in the Bible, but it's also clear in

284
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:55,200
 the Bible throughout the Bible, but especially in the ministry of Jesus, that those standards

285
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:02,160
 are for our own good. Those standards are not to hurt us or to restrict us. They are to protect us

286
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:09,120
 and to care for us. Jesus is the good shepherd. He is caring for us and he loves us. And it's clear

287
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:16,160
 throughout the ministry of Jesus that the grace of Jesus is the only hope that we have for meeting

288
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:22,320
 God's standard. We are never supposed to try to be perfect and work it out and try hard enough and do

289
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:30,080
 it all on our own. That was never the emphasis. We are supposed to come to Jesus in humility and say,

290
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:35,680
 "God, I can't do this. I ask you to forgive me. I ask you to cleanse me. I ask you to live through

291
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:40,960
 me and make me into something better than what I am." That's the design from the very beginning.

292
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:46,240
 That's the gospel. We were never supposed to turn into some self-righteous super person who's better

293
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:52,000
 than someone else. That's a caricature that we've made in our own minds. John 1 is clear that Jesus

294
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:59,200
 is full of grace and truth. And I love that about Jesus. Jesus never lied to us and told us we were

295
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:05,360
 any better off than we actually are, but he also never offered anything less than complete redemption

296
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:11,920
 and restoration to a perfect relationship with our Father in heaven. That's who Jesus is. He always

297
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:18,320
 loves. He always cares. He always heals. And so if you've experienced hurt and you felt like maybe

298
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:24,400
 that was coming from God, it wasn't. If you felt like that was coming from Jesus, it wasn't. Jesus

299
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:29,520
 cares for you. He wants to heal you and he loves you. So I would encourage you, if you have

300
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:34,960
 experienced that hurt, to understand that that wasn't coming from God. It was probably coming

301
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:40,480
 from an imperfect person who inflicted that hurt on you, probably because of some hurt in their own

302
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:45,840
 life. Or maybe because they completely misunderstood God's grace. Or maybe they completely

303
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:52,240
 misinterpreted God's truth in the scripture. And their own confusion, their own hurt, and their own

304
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:59,040
 pain caused them to communicate something to you that simply wasn't true. That did not come from

305
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:05,680
 God. And then I would encourage you also to seek to practice forgiveness. Forgiveness is a totally

306
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:10,960
 radical kingdom value that Jesus taught us. And if you've experienced hurt because of hypocrisy,

307
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,280
 it can be really hard to forgive someone who has been a hypocrite, who has pretended to be

308
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:19,200
 something that they're not, and pretended that they were better than someone else. That can be

309
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:25,200
 really hard to forgive. But that's what Jesus calls us to. Jesus calls us away from the old

310
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:32,320
 human way of vengeance and getting people back, and calls us to forgiveness and to love. And so

311
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:37,280
 I would encourage you to seek that. Even if you've experienced something difficult, like spiritual

312
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:42,640
 abuse in some way, or some other type of abuse at the hand of a hypocritical person, that's

313
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:47,920
 something that you can seek forgiveness for. You may need to do some counseling and deal with that,

314
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:53,040
 especially if it was something serious. And there may be consequences of that. Maybe that

315
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:57,040
 relationship with that person will never be repaired. Or maybe that person, if it was serious

316
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:02,080
 enough, may actually suffer other consequences in some way. Some people have to actually suffer

317
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:08,320
 legal and civic consequences because of the wrong things that they've done. But that doesn't mean

318
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:13,760
 that you can't forgive someone. And that's what Jesus calls us to. To understand that that pain

319
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:20,000
 was not inflicted by God. It was not inflicted by Jesus. And that even the person who inflicted that

320
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:26,240
 pain was full of their own brokenness and their own sin. And we need to forgive. And that can be a

321
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:33,600
 difficult thing. It can be hard for us to do, but it gives us freedom as we forgive hypocrisy in

322
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:41,360
 others. Let's pray. God, thank you that you are so honest with us about our brokenness as humans.

323
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:48,320
 And God, I pray for anyone who has been hurt by hypocrisy in the church, God. God, I pray that

324
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:55,440
 you would help us not to ignore it or to act like it didn't happen or to try to explain it away. God,

325
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:01,360
 help us to be honest about how wrong it is and how devastating it can be. And God, if we've been

326
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:06,160
 hurt by it, God, I pray that you would help us to see that that did not come from you. It came from

327
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:14,800
 another human who was hurt and broken in their own life. And God, help us to not place that pain on

328
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:20,960
 you and understand that you love us and you want healing for us. God, help us to take that pain to

329
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:28,080
 you. It is real pain. Help us to take it to you and let you heal and restore in our heart. And God,

330
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:33,840
 help us to find forgiveness. Give us the power to forgive. Even if someone has hurt us deeply,

331
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:39,600
 God, even if there are consequences of that hurt that may not change, help us to forgive

332
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:48,800
 and be free of that load of bitterness or hurt or frustration or pain that we carry around. God,

333
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:55,760
 God, I pray that you would help us to more and more move away from pretending to be something

334
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:00,960
 we're not, pretending that we meet your standards when we don't, and move towards a place of

335
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:07,040
 honesty over our own brokenness, our own need for you. Move us towards a place of poverty of spirit

336
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:12,400
 where there is no hypocrisy in us, where we are transparent and open and honest, and where we let

337
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:19,280
 you live through us in a way that shares your love and your grace with the people around us.

338
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,440
 In Jesus name, Amen.
