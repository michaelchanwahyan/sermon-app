1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
 - Thank you, Phoebe.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:05,820
 Yeah, one more reminder is that we have a few workers,

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:10,820
 interns among us, and I wanna personally introduce them

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:15,080
 and wanna appreciate their work and ministry in the summer.

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,200
 The first one, of course, is Phoebe.

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,320
 So Phoebe is one of our summer intern.

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,960
 She is finishing off her master's study

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,940
 at Lagos Evangelical Seminary,

9
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,280
 so she's doing some intern here.

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,520
 And also Wendy, is Wendy around here?

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,360
 Back there, right?

12
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,760
 Yeah, Wendy.

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,280
 Wendy is another intern, so we wanna thank her

14
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,280
 for doing all the background and backstage ministry for us.

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,040
 And also Lucy, Lucy right there.

16
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,360
 And thank you for joining us for this summer intern,

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,320
 and she is studying as Wendy as well

18
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,200
 at Moody Bible Institute,

19
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,480
 and she is music composition major.

20
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,800
 So if you want some new songs, go to Lucy.

21
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,140
 She will be helping us with the instrument

22
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,080
 and all the music as well.

23
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,860
 So do pray for our interns, all right?

24
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,560
 We're going to put them to work,

25
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,520
 and they will work very, very hard, okay?

26
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:23,520
 So they will have a very, very busy month in the summer.

27
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,040
 So let's pray together.

28
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,280
 Father, give thanks as a community of faith,

29
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,400
 as your believers, we come before you.

30
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,040
 We know that we are born in the spirit.

31
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,200
 Thank you for the privilege and the blessing.

32
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,040
 We can praise you, we can worship you,

33
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,660
 we can draw close to you.

34
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,320
 Thank you for inviting us into your presence,

35
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,040
 and may your spirit speak to us

36
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,280
 and lead us into true worship.

37
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,040
 And may all that we do, all that we think,

38
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,640
 and all that we say be pleasing to you.

39
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,880
 We again come before you.

40
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,300
 We ask that you will cleanse our sins,

41
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,000
 and you will forgive us.

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,480
 You will help us to come before you,

43
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,840
 knowing that in Christ we are righteous,

44
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,080
 because all that your son has done for all of us.

45
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,440
 Pray for our church as well.

46
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,040
 During the summer, there are people in now,

47
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,760
 especially there are some brothers and sisters

48
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,600
 who are out of town, and I just pray

49
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,640
 that you will grant them safety.

50
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,040
 I also wanna pray for those who are sick,

51
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,640
 who are going through some challenges and struggles.

52
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,520
 Pray that you will grant them peace and healing.

53
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,200
 As we open the scripture,

54
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,440
 we ask that your spirit will lead us into your truth,

55
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,000
 and let your truth set us free,

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,080
 and build up your church, and build up our life.

57
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,000
 In Christ, we pray.

58
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,960
 Well, we will continue our series on worship,

59
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,200
 and this is a seven-part series.

60
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,360
 We are in part number six.

61
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,720
 So we began this series asking the question,

62
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,160
 how can we be better worshipers?

63
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,240
 How can we be better worshipers?

64
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,600
 How can we become better worshipers as a group,

65
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,560
 as a church, as a community?

66
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,240
 And there are many questions we need to ask ourselves,

67
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,160
 or confront ourselves,

68
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,640
 because God is pleased when his people worship him.

69
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:22,640
 And we have reminded all of us that from the Bible,

70
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,560
 from cover to cover, from the first chapter

71
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,840
 to the last chapter, in some sense,

72
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,840
 worship is all that the Bible is all about.

73
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,320
 And what God is doing in humanity is that to rescue us,

74
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,120
 and to live in us, and to dwell in us.

75
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,000
 And today, we're going to talk about

76
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,880
 some of the aspects of worship.

77
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,680
 And we try to do something like a summary.

78
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,240
 Try to find from the pages of Scripture

79
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,680
 what worship is all about,

80
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,040
 and what are those elements happen in corporate worship.

81
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,120
 When we worship together, what are the elements,

82
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,880
 what are the things that we do,

83
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:07,880
 or things that the people in the Bible do when they worship,

84
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,840
 and to reflect upon how we can prepare ourselves,

85
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,040
 how we can become better worshipers.

86
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,640
 So I have summarized some of the aspects

87
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,720
 or elements of worship from the Bible,

88
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,360
 especially from the New Testament,

89
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,560
 or also from the Old Testament as well.

90
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,440
 From the whole Bible, try to summarize

91
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,240
 what are the main aspects of worship.

92
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,760
 When we come before God to worship together,

93
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,020
 or when we call upon the name of Jesus to gather together,

94
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,160
 the New Testament reminds us

95
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,480
 whenever there were two or three people,

96
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,240
 calling in the name of Jesus,

97
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,060
 gathering in the name of Jesus,

98
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,800
 God is in the midst,

99
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,840
 God is dwelling among them in his presence.

100
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,120
 So what did they do, right?

101
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,960
 What did they do?

102
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,000
 What do we do?

103
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 And there are eight elements I have tried to summarize.

104
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,260
 So in this part and the last part next week,

105
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,280
 we're going to go through this list

106
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,880
 and see what the Bible says

107
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,680
 about all these aspects of worship.

108
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,920
 And first of all, it's about songs, right?

109
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,000
 We sing songs, right?

110
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,080
 We sing songs and we sing praises to our God

111
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,480
 when we gather to worship together.

112
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,120
 No matter we gather in a church like this,

113
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,380
 like this kind of setting,

114
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,560
 or we gather into small group,

115
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,400
 or we even go to retreat, right?

116
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,340
 We get together as a small group.

117
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,200
 We get together to worship.

118
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,760
 And of course, the first thing that we do

119
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,960
 is that we sing songs, right?

120
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,840
 There are general principles from the Bible

121
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,440
 about using songs in worship.

122
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,260
 However, the Bible never dictate the details, right?

123
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,440
 You agree?

124
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,200
 Does the Bible dictate what kind of songs that we sing?

125
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,960
 You think so?

126
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:02,180
 You know, I used to go to a reform seminary,

127
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:07,680
 and in the seminary, there were chapels every week.

128
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,280
 There were about two chapels every week, morning chapels.

129
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,560
 So we joined the morning chapels,

130
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,640
 and because it's a reform seminary

131
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,240
 and it's on the traditional side,

132
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,560
 and we always use the same hymn book.

133
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,960
 And the hymn book, if you pick up the hymn book

134
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,200
 and you flip the pages, there are only 150 songs.

135
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,520
 There are only 150 songs, right?

136
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,800
 That makes it easier, right?

137
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,760
 If you're leading worship,

138
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:39,160
 you don't have to go Google some of the songs, right?

139
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,240
 You don't have to go to YouTube

140
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,680
 and listen to some of the songs,

141
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,600
 because there are no new songs.

142
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,860
 There are only 180 songs,

143
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:49,240
 because they are directly taken out

144
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,280
 from the bowl of salt, right?

145
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,420
 There are 150 songs only.

146
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,000
 So that's the philosophy.

147
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,320
 They only sing 150 songs, right?

148
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,160
 You agree with that kind of practice?

149
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,840
 Yes, no?

150
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,240
 Well, I don't think the Bible really dictates us

151
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,400
 exactly what kind of songs that we sing, right?

152
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,840
 The songs that we use are contemporary songs, right?

153
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:21,320
 They are not applicable,

154
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,880
 or they are not being used in other culture,

155
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,240
 in other setting.

156
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,780
 Did I tell you last year I tried to learn some Hebrew songs?

157
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,760
 I did, right?

158
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,600
 Yeah.

159
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,720
 Did I tell you last week?

160
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,720
 I'm losing my memory, yeah.

161
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,800
 Right, and my children don't like Hebrew songs, right?

162
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,280
 The Hebrew songs are pretty much minor songs, right?

163
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,640
 But they're beautiful, right?

164
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:48,960
 But to some of the contemporary audience,

165
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,960
 don't speak to them, right?

166
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,040
 So we use some of the songs that are contemporary to us.

167
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,600
 So we use those songs,

168
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:00,120
 and they are new songs compared to the bowl of psalms.

169
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,980
 However, they are totally applicable.

170
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:06,360
 It's biblical to use new songs,

171
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,720
 because the psalms, the Bible tells us

172
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,080
 whenever God does something new,

173
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,220
 we have to sing new song, right?

174
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:17,860
 So people will compose new songs to be used in worship,

175
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,700
 right?

176
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,680
 We have a major in music composition.

177
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,660
 They're using her gifts, using our gifts,

178
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:28,660
 to compose entirely brand new songs for worshiping God.

179
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:32,940
 So I don't think God will dictate

180
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,540
 what kind of songs we have to use.

181
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,420
 No.

182
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:39,060
 However, most of the songs that we use in corporate worships

183
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,320
 are what I call upward songs.

184
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,860
 We sing those songs directly to God,

185
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,700
 directly to the Lord,

186
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:51,380
 and those are legitimate songs or poems that we can use,

187
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:54,140
 or lyrics singing directly to God.

188
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:57,260
 Most of the songs that we use in worship are like that.

189
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:02,260
 However, I don't think the Bible has ever dictated us

190
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:06,620
 what kind of songs or which songs that we use.

191
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,380
 As you step into this church,

192
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:12,900
 you find that our setting is a little bit different.

193
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:16,660
 I used to go to traditional churches.

194
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:21,200
 This is not quite traditional setting for church buildings.

195
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,500
 I wanna give you a quiz.

196
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,600
 You know what is this?

197
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,080
 You know what this is?

198
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,880
 What kind of furniture item is this?

199
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,760
 Anyone?

200
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:38,360
 They are actually hymnal or hymn book holder.

201
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:42,720
 You know, if you walk into a traditional church setting,

202
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,720
 you find those hymnal holder

203
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,820
 at the back of the church pillars, right?

204
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,600
 They are used for not your books.

205
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,360
 You know, you don't bring your books and put it there.

206
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,720
 It is for public worship.

207
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,720
 So they use a particular hymnal, particular book of hymns.

208
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:06,760
 And I used to go to a traditional Baptist church

209
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,740
 in California, and when I was younger,

210
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:12,200
 I always joined the worship service

211
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,260
 and the Wednesday evening prayer meeting.

212
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:19,040
 And what we do is we gather together,

213
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,920
 and the host or the worship leader

214
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,260
 will tell us the number of the hymn.

215
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,780
 So let's turn to our hymnal, 126.

216
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:32,000
 And then we will turn to the hymn, hymn book, 126,

217
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 and we sing together.

218
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,500
 And all the songs that we use are all compiled

219
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,000
 in that book, right?

220
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,440
 But culture has changed, right?

221
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,280
 And we need to consider the local culture

222
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,920
 and language and tradition.

223
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,600
 And there were flexibility,

224
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,960
 how we use or what songs that we use

225
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,380
 in corporate worship.

226
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:58,220
 However, the main thing is there,

227
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,460
 the focus is to sing songs to God,

228
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,540
 it's to praise him with songs and poems.

229
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,980
 And that's one of the aspects of public worship.

230
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,960
 The second aspect is prayer.

231
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,120
 Now, this is a no-brainer, right?

232
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,900
 Because in scripture, the people of God

233
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,580
 get together to worship.

234
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,540
 There are many different prayers,

235
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,460
 or many types of prayers.

236
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,800
 There are praises, there are petition,

237
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,920
 there are supplications, there are laments,

238
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,920
 there are also confessions of sin,

239
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:33,320
 expressions of repentance, expressions of thanksgiving.

240
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:38,240
 All this wide variety of prayers are found in the Bible,

241
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,960
 and they are legitimately being used in corporate worship.

242
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,160
 So sometimes when we pray together,

243
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,960
 or pray silently, or pray together,

244
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:53,220
 we confess our sin, and we ask God for his forgiveness.

245
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,660
 Sometimes we give thanks to God.

246
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:00,500
 We give thanks to God because God answered our prayer,

247
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,220
 and God has been good to us.

248
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:05,660
 And sometimes we do petitions, right?

249
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:09,300
 We pray for our church, we pray for our community.

250
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,460
 And this is one of the reminders that we have,

251
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:15,700
 is we summarize what worship is all about in the Bible,

252
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,380
 that we need to prepare ourselves, right?

253
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,600
 We come before God in the presence of God,

254
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,260
 we want to worship, we need to prepare ourselves,

255
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:28,260
 we learn the songs, and we prepare our heart for prayers.

256
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,300
 Did you do that today?

257
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,320
 You walk into this hall, this auditorium,

258
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,000
 you prepare yourself to be prayerful.

259
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,220
 You pray to God, you speak to God, right?

260
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,480
 Either you have thanksgiving,

261
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,440
 or you have some confessions to make,

262
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,440
 or some praises you want to sing, right?

263
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,080
 We need to prepare ourselves, right?

264
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,540
 Not only you prepare your body,

265
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,360
 but you prepare your spirit

266
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,280
 so that you can focus on worshiping God.

267
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,860
 Speaking of prepare on body,

268
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:04,980
 I have not been sleeping so well in the last two weeks.

269
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:08,760
 Especially about three weeks ago,

270
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:13,760
 I tried one of those over-the-counter sleeping pills,

271
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,380
 because I have trouble sleeping.

272
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:21,940
 So I tried some new sleeping aids three weeks ago.

273
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:25,280
 I took one on Tuesday, and of course I slept,

274
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,180
 but I collapsed, I actually collapsed.

275
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:31,160
 And then I woke up Wednesday morning,

276
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,540
 I feel so bad, feel so bad.

277
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:38,540
 I felt like I never slept last night, the night before.

278
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:42,960
 And then it lingered for a few days, actually.

279
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,880
 I've been just sleeping all day, sleepy all day, right?

280
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:51,800
 If you tell me, you ask me,

281
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:56,460
 if I took the new sleeping pill,

282
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:01,260
 like Saturday night, it would not be wise, right?

283
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,300
 Because I want to prepare my body

284
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,180
 so that I can worship God.

285
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:08,160
 So I ditched those new sleeping pill,

286
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:13,360
 and I go back to my, the old ones, the prescribed one.

287
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,320
 And it helps me to rest,

288
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:20,320
 help me to prepare our physical body to worship God.

289
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,780
 And this sort of thing reminds us

290
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,880
 we need to prepare ourselves to worship.

291
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,960
 We cannot just bump into a worship service,

292
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,560
 and then, okay, all right, we're worshiping.

293
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,860
 Right, God wants us to prepare ourselves,

294
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:35,840
 our spirit, our mind, and our body to worship Him.

295
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,660
 That's how we become better worshipers, right?

296
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:43,840
 Number three is confession of faith.

297
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,700
 Now, this sort of things sometimes we do

298
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,780
 in corporate worship.

299
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,920
 And what does it mean, confession of faith, or creed?

300
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,720
 It's from Latin, credo.

301
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,000
 It means I believe.

302
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,540
 You know, throughout the entire church history

303
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,420
 of the last 2,000 years,

304
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:08,580
 there are generations of theologians and believers,

305
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:14,260
 they summarize the basic doctrines

306
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,720
 of the Bible.

307
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,740
 As they summarize it, they will write some of the creeds.

308
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:25,000
 Now, one of those creeds that we use in the past

309
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,600
 is called the Apostles' Creed, right?

310
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,140
 I actually preach about it

311
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:34,100
 in a sermon series on Apostles' Creed.

312
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,300
 And Apostles' Creed has been around

313
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,820
 for more than 1,000 years.

314
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:43,060
 And it's a very, very valuable and ancient summary

315
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,620
 of Christian faith.

316
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:50,580
 And it summarizes our basic doctrines in 12 articles.

317
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:55,040
 And we recite the Apostles' Creed

318
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,100
 to remind us what we believe, what we stand on.

319
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:03,460
 And that is called the creed or confession of faith.

320
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:07,500
 Actually, those creeds we can find from the Bible.

321
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,500
 If you pay attention to some of the scripture

322
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,020
 or some of the passages in the Bible,

323
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,180
 they are actually being incorporated

324
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,020
 into the New Testament writing,

325
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:19,220
 into the New Testament Bible.

326
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:23,780
 For example, the book of Matthew, Matthew 6.

327
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:28,620
 The Lord's Prayer, right?

328
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,580
 Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.

329
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,500
 Be thy name.

330
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,260
 Thy kingdom come, thy will be done

331
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,320
 on earth as it is in heaven.

332
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,580
 Give us today our daily bread.

333
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,860
 Forgive us our debts.

334
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,620
 And we also have given our debtors.

335
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,660
 And lead us not into temptation,

336
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:47,220
 but deliver us from the evil one.

337
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,420
 For thine is the kingdom, the power,

338
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,660
 and the glory forever, amen.

339
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:55,540
 As I read this, I used King James words

340
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,820
 because that's how I grew up.

341
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:00,460
 I recite this Lord's Prayer from time to time

342
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,980
 in worship service, right?

343
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,620
 This is the confession of faith.

344
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,220
 Now, how do we know?

345
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,620
 You know the last line I highlight here?

346
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:14,620
 If you read the details of the English Bible, for example,

347
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:18,180
 you find a footnote there,

348
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:21,340
 and the footnote tells you the early,

349
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:25,020
 early Christian manuscript of Matthew 6

350
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:28,940
 does not have the sentence highlighted.

351
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:34,980
 Only the later manuscript contains the highlight,

352
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,940
 a second part of verse 13.

353
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,260
 Now, you know, there are many manuscripts of New Testament,

354
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,460
 and what the scholar's doing is trying to summarize

355
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:50,020
 what the original text actually is.

356
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:54,740
 So if you go to the earlier or the best manuscript,

357
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,540
 it doesn't have the yellow highlight verse.

358
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:01,020
 It stops at the evil one.

359
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:04,980
 Deliver us from the evil one, and then it stops.

360
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,220
 And that's the Lord's Prayer.

361
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,380
 That's the original Lord's Prayer.

362
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:11,260
 That's how Jesus taught His disciples to pray, right?

363
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,820
 It's a series of petition.

364
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,200
 Leads us not into temptation, forgive us,

365
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,860
 and deliver us from the evil one.

366
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:22,860
 The last line is being added in the early Christian church,

367
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:28,180
 and that's why those who copy the Bible

368
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:31,960
 from generation to generation, the Christian scribes,

369
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,440
 they incorporate this last verse,

370
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,160
 this last second part of verse 13 into the Lord's Prayer.

371
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,260
 And why?

372
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:44,260
 Because the early churches, when they met in house churches,

373
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:49,460
 they add this phrase at the end of the Lord's Prayer.

374
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,700
 And this is how they use it,

375
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,540
 use the Lord's Prayer in their worship service.

376
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:59,220
 So end with some sort of doxology, some sort of praise.

377
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,740
 Yours is the kingdom and the power

378
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,580
 and the glory forever, right?

379
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,340
 So as one of the example, you find that, you know,

380
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:10,140
 this kind of confession of faith using the Lord's Prayer,

381
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,140
 it's a legitimate use of scripture,

382
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:18,140
 and it happens to be used in worship service.

383
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,580
 That's why sometimes we do that too, right?

384
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,980
 A brother just remind me,

385
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:26,140
 why don't we do something like that in our worship service?

386
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,180
 You know, recite some of the scriptures,

387
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:31,160
 like the Lord's Prayer, and memorize it, right?

388
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,500
 Because when we memorize the Word of God,

389
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:37,780
 the Word of God will take effect in our own life, right?

390
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:42,380
 That's a great idea, and we will continue to do that, right?

391
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,820
 So there's confession of faith.

392
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:47,820
 There's also another aspect called vows,

393
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,380
 or some sort of response or a commitment

394
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,500
 that we make before God in worship.

395
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,120
 In the Old Testament and New Testament,

396
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:00,300
 we find many, many different vows or promises,

397
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,500
 commitments that people make to God

398
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,580
 to fulfill those promises.

399
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:09,160
 Don't you experience that?

400
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:13,220
 Sometimes you're in your spiritual walk with God.

401
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,900
 You pray for a certain thing,

402
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:18,260
 and then God answer your prayer,

403
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:21,860
 or God open a way for you, right?

404
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:24,060
 And you made some sort of promise to God.

405
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:27,460
 You pray a certain thing in front of God,

406
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,220
 and you say, "God, if you answer me,

407
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:34,700
 "if you do this for me, for your glory,

408
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,780
 "then I will fulfill my vow, right?

409
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,660
 "I will give you thanks.

410
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,940
 "I will give you offering," or something like that, right?

411
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:47,580
 I have done so many times in my Christian walk, right?

412
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,540
 God provide me, you know?

413
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:54,540
 If you answer my prayer, I will recommit myself to you,

414
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,620
 and that is what vow means.

415
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:59,140
 That is what commitment means.

416
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:04,460
 I remember years, years ago, I was in seminary,

417
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:07,100
 and I finished the first two terms,

418
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,160
 and then I ran out of money.

419
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:13,960
 I just didn't have money to pay for tuition,

420
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,860
 so I prayed.

421
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:22,540
 Right at that moment, I was in a really, really big struggle

422
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:25,100
 because I probably have to quit,

423
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,980
 have to find a job, right?

424
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:31,340
 And to save up more money so that I can pay for tuition.

425
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,120
 So I prayed, I prayed.

426
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,580
 So as I prayed, and I went to prayer meeting,

427
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,860
 and we prayed together.

428
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:44,020
 Now I remember the following week,

429
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,340
 I went to a prayer meeting.

430
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:49,860
 I went to a worship service, and I came home,

431
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:54,860
 and I find a white envelope in my mailbox.

432
00:21:55,860 --> 00:22:00,860
 I was kind of curious, okay, who put it there, right?

433
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:06,220
 So I grabbed the envelope, and I went to my bedroom,

434
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:10,820
 and I opened the envelope, and there was a check,

435
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:15,180
 and that check has the amount just enough

436
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:18,560
 for me to pay for the next term, right?

437
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:24,100
 At that moment, I fell on my knees.

438
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,300
 I said, "God, thank you.

439
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:30,160
 "Thank you for answering my prayer.

440
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:35,160
 "Thank you for accepting me because I was of little faith,

441
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,820
 "right, and God, you are the great provider,

442
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:41,580
 "and you are so faithful to me," right?

443
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:45,780
 So I fell on my knees, and I prayed, I vowed.

444
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,540
 You know, "If God, you are so faithful,

445
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:52,260
 "help me in my faithlessness, right?

446
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,560
 "Help me with my lack of trust.

447
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,460
 "Help me to trust in you."

448
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:01,220
 So there we go, I fulfilled my vow, right?

449
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,420
 In my years of ministry, there were up times,

450
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,980
 there were many down times.

451
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:08,580
 There are mountain tops, a few mountain tops.

452
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:12,980
 There are many valleys, but I remember this experience.

453
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:16,860
 I made a vow to God that God is faithful,

454
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:20,140
 and I need to continue to trust in him, right?

455
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:23,860
 Whether the times is good or the time is difficult.

456
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:28,340
 That should be part of our journey as well, right?

457
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:33,620
 God grant me this prayer.

458
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:36,860
 I will make a vow to you, right?

459
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:39,700
 I will recommit myself, and that's part of our worship too.

460
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:44,700
 And in the Old Testament, there was a story about Hannah,

461
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,340
 right, the woman who was barren.

462
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:52,340
 She didn't have any child, and she was suffering nobility.

463
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:56,340
 She was being locked down upon.

464
00:23:56,340 --> 00:24:01,340
 And Hannah prayed to God in the tabernacle,

465
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:04,780
 and prayed that God grant me a child, right?

466
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:08,380
 And lo and behold, God grant her a child, Samuel.

467
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:14,260
 And the next year, she went back to the temple,

468
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,940
 the tabernacle, with her husband, Elkina,

469
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:23,300
 and his family, went on their annual trip

470
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:28,300
 to offer worship sacrifice to the Lord, and keep his vow.

471
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,140
 And there you go, vow right there.

472
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:34,180
 The vow actually is Hannah's own vow.

473
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:37,100
 So Hannah prayed to God, grant me a child.

474
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,940
 If you really grant me a child, I will offer this child

475
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:45,020
 for your service, for the Lord's ministry.

476
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,620
 And she did that.

477
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:50,940
 She brought Samuel, the boy, to the temple, or tabernacle,

478
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:55,060
 and offered Samuel as a minister to God.

479
00:24:55,060 --> 00:25:00,940
 So vows and promises is part of our worship service.

480
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:07,180
 Now, we will continue this list next week.

481
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,300
 Preaching and teaching and sacraments,

482
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,540
 and we will explain what sacraments are,

483
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,940
 and then offerings and fellowship.

484
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:17,380
 Now, I want to close this sermon by saying,

485
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:20,180
 all of these aspects and all of these elements

486
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,420
 are part of legitimate worship.

487
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:27,180
 And God is pleased when His people gather

488
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:30,380
 in His presence to worship Him, right?

489
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:36,500
 Remember this, worship is about God, it's all about God.

490
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:41,100
 And worship in the Bible has two dimensions.

491
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,460
 The first dimension is a vertical dimension.

492
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:47,860
 We worship and we respond to what Jesus has done

493
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,220
 in our own lives.

494
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:52,220
 He save us for the purpose of worshiping Him.

495
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,980
 And that's a vertical dimension.

496
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:58,100
 And the other dimension is horizontal dimension.

497
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:03,100
 Worship is to edify, is to build up others in the community.

498
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:06,580
 Worship is not for me to have fun.

499
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:09,420
 I come here, I am present here,

500
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:12,100
 so that I can practice community.

501
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,980
 I can build up the body of Christ.

502
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:17,580
 I can have fellowship and share life with other people.

503
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:21,980
 And our worship can be a witness to the world outside.

504
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,820
 Let's remember that, right?

505
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:26,380
 We're gonna close in prayer.

506
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,940
 And let's pray before God.

507
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:31,140
 How can we become a better worshiper?

508
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:34,620
 All right, to glorify Him.

509
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,460
 Let's all pray.

510
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:39,620
 I'll give you some seconds and you can pray to God

511
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,540
 in silence.

512
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:46,660
 If God has led you to repent,

513
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:50,060
 ask for forgiveness.

514
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:52,180
 No, God's grace is always sufficient.

515
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:55,340
 If God is calling you to recommit,

516
00:26:55,340 --> 00:27:00,180
 do so, because God is good, worthy of our worship.

517
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:04,380
 (gentle piano music)

518
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:07,460
 (gentle piano music)

519
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:22,220
 Father, thank you for being our loving God.

520
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:26,420
 Thank you for loving us so much.

521
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:30,220
 And call us into your presence,

522
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,620
 so that we can be your people.

523
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,740
 So we pray that you will help us

524
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:39,340
 to become better worshipers,

525
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,020
 to honor you and to glorify you.

526
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:44,540
 Forgive our shortcomings.

527
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:47,620
 Sometimes we don't prepare.

528
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:51,380
 If we don't prepare our hearts and our body

529
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,260
 to serve you, to worship you,

530
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,700
 may you forgive us

531
00:27:55,700 --> 00:28:00,660
 and help us to put you as our life's pyrode.

532
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:04,140
 To worship you is to bring you glory.

533
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:08,020
 Ask your people, ask your church,

534
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,580
