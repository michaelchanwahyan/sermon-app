[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600]   our time to John.
[00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:02.600]   Let's welcome John.
[00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.760]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.040]   - Everybody again at Urban Voice.
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.640]   And in fact, this is, you know,
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.320]   since I've been coming out monthly since August,
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.240]   this is the most of Urban Voice I have seen since August.
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.960]   So thank you for choosing to come on out today
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.800]   and join with your brothers and sisters in worship
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.080]   and in the hearing of God's word.
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.080]   With that, let's begin with just a quick word of prayer
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.160]   as we go into God's word, okay?
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.680]   Heavenly Father, thank you so much.
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.680]   We do thank you because not just 'cause it's Thanksgiving,
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.640]   but because this is an occasion to remind us
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.800]   to pause for a moment.
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.120]   Perhaps it's in the midst of a season of grumbling,
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.000]   of discontent.
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.680]   In a season where we're longing for more or better,
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.560]   help us now to stop and just recall
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.640]   all the great things you have done.
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.120]   And then to think about the great things
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.440]   you have done for us.
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.600]   And make those recollections cause us to draw near to you,
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:33.020]   to take a step forward, inch forward.
[00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.400]   And knowing as we're reminded today in the word
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.160]   that we are going to be looking into,
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.600]   that God, you have made a way through your son
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.320]   for us to draw near to you and to do it boldly.
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.440]   And we wanna do that today.
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.480]   And it's in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.680]   So brothers and sisters, you know,
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.800]   as already been mentioned a few times,
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.800]   this is a cause for great celebration today.
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.800]   A wonderful thing is happening today.
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.900]   I will call, you don't have to call it this,
[00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.040]   I will call it the new Urban Voice, okay?
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.600]   Don't change your signs, don't do anything like that,
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.760]   don't change your website, but the new Urban Voice,
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.080]   a new chapter for Urban Voice is starting today.
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.040]   You know, the Peniel Multiethnic Church
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.380]   is joining forces with Urban Voice Community Church.
[00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.040]   Two, what I believe genuinely,
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.840]   two great works that God has been doing.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.720]   And you know, the world might call this a merge
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.240]   or a merger, but you know, let's face it,
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.160]   it's really more like two families that are coming together.
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.960]   It's like a marriage.
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.320]   It's two becoming one.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.960]   And so praise the Lord for doing this great thing, amen?
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.040]   So I don't have a whole lot of time,
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.520]   'cause I know everybody is like, there's a luncheon today?
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.720]   So probably like, please, keep it short.
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.960]   And I will do my very best.
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.000]   In fact, I am gonna do more than my best.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.360]   I'm actually gonna keep it short today.
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.480]   So there's a lot to say,
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.700]   but I'm gonna let the Holy Spirit speak to us
[00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:16.640]   through His word.
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.240]   So if you'll turn in your Bibles,
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.760]   or turn your Bibles on on your phone apps,
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.900]   to Hebrews chapter 10, verses 19 through 25.
[00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.760]   Hebrews 10, 19 through 25, and I'll read that for you.
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.360]   And it says, "Therefore, brothers and sisters,
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.040]   "since we have confidence to enter the most holy place
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.780]   "by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way
[00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.520]   "open for us through the curtain that is His body,
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.820]   "and since we have a great priest over the house of God,
[00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.760]   "let us draw near to God with a sincere heart
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.820]   "and with the full assurance that faith brings.
[00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.420]   "Having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us
[00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.580]   "from a guilty conscience,
[00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.380]   "and having our bodies washed with pure water,
[00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.360]   "let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess,
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.260]   "for He who promised is faithful."
[00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.880]   Then verse 24, "And let us consider
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.980]   "how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds,
[00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.700]   "not giving up meeting together
[00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.660]   "as some are in the habit of doing,
[00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.900]   "but encouraging one another,
[00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.020]   "and all the more as you see the day approaching."
[00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.100]   So there are three let us statements,
[00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.940]   three invitations, three exhortations
[00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.660]   that the author of Hebrews gives us.
[00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.660]   First, we see in verse 22, "Let us draw near to God."
[00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.840]   Then in verse 23, "Let us hold unswervingly
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.220]   "to the hope we profess."
[00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.880]   And then third, "Let us consider
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.160]   "how we may spur one another on
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.120]   "towards love and good deeds."
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.080]   But before we get to these invitations,
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.320]   let's stop for a moment,
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.320]   looking starting at verse 19 at the foundational conviction.
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.360]   You know, we're pointed to this in verse 23, right?
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.200]   What is this hope we profess?
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.520]   What is the foundation of this invitation?
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:28.360]   And it is this, the gospel of Jesus Christ
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.080]   is the foundation of the church's
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.400]   intimate relationship with holy God,
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.320]   and with one another.
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.040]   The gospel of Jesus Christ is the shared foundation
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.640]   of the church's intimate relationship
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.640]   with God and with one another.
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:53.680]   The church, we're told in verse 19, just by the address,
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.460]   "Who is the author talking to?"
[00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.360]   And he says, "Brothers and sisters."
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.040]   If you don't know who your brothers and sisters are,
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.560]   just look to the left, look to the right,
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.720]   look behind you, go ahead, you can do that,
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.320]   it's all right, look around.
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.160]   These are your brothers and sisters
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:17.160]   who share this foundational conviction
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.200]   in the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:24.800]   Is the writer of Hebrews writing to a bunch of strangers
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.480]   who don't know each other, or some,
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:27.760]   just kind of like group of people
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.040]   that happen to be together one day?
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.520]   No, of course not, he's specifically addressing
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.120]   a known and exclusive, and I'll say it,
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.440]   an exclusive group of people.
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:39.880]   We hear a lot of people say about like,
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.720]   "Our church is inclusive, we want everybody to come."
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.040]   But the reality is, is the church is exclusive.
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.000]   You know why?
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.680]   Because you are not really a member of the church,
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.980]   the body of Christ, unless you are in Christ.
[00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:59.600]   And you have to have the gospel to be in Christ.
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.760]   You have to believe who Jesus is,
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:07.440]   believe in him and what he has done on the cross,
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.380]   to lay down his life for sinners like us.
[00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:16.460]   And then to rise again in victory on the third day.
[00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:21.840]   To give us new life, eternal life,
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:25.360]   to guarantee the forgiveness of our sins,
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.800]   and a relationship with holy God.
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.520]   I mean, who do we think we are?
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.400]   We know how messed up we are.
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.520]   We know how weak and flawed we are.
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:38.240]   Who do we think we are that we think
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.880]   we should have a relationship?
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:43.240]   And yet you know what the gospel writer John says?
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:48.360]   That we have the right, the right.
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:52.260]   We have the audacity because of Jesus
[00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.960]   to claim to be children of God.
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.720]   Let that sink in for just a second.
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.680]   That ought to just blow your mind.
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:06.680]   Who do we dare to be to say we are children of God?
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:13.720]   That we would have the right to be called children of God?
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:19.280]   Formally we might call one another members of a church
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.480]   or the church.
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.880]   Says therefore brothers and sisters,
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:27.760]   we have confidence to enter the most holy place.
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:29.960]   Here's the foundation, the gospel.
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:31.620]   It's probably maybe explained in a way
[00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:33.120]   that you haven't thought of it.
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.680]   But it says we have confidence to enter
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:36.840]   the most holy place.
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.860]   It's a picture of the temple.
[00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:43.220]   In the temple is the smallest room.
[00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:46.160]   It's called the Holy of Holies or the most holy place.
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.260]   And it's a place where one person once a year,
[00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:53.040]   the high priest gets to go in.
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:53.960]   Once a year.
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.960]   And if he's not worthy, if he has done,
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.680]   if he has not prepared himself to go into the presence
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:06.680]   of God, then he is to be killed.
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:09.880]   Killed.
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.840]   He would die.
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:17.680]   But it says we have confidence, not just the one person,
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:22.640]   but we have confidence to enter the most holy place
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.720]   by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:29.000]   open for us through the curtain that is his body.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.600]   Whose body?
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.040]   Jesus Christ.
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:38.040]   And since we have a great priest over the house of God,
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:43.080]   so Jesus is the high priest with a capital T,
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:47.040]   the capital H, capital P.
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.360]   He is a superior high priest.
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.440]   He's not like one of those of old.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.400]   He is even better.
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.100]   You could say he is the super priest.
[00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:03.000]   He says because Jesus is our high priest,
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.080]   he says let us draw near to God with a sincere heart
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.520]   and with the full assurance that faith brings.
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:11.280]   And that's where the gospel comes in again.
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:14.160]   We don't claim this because we're good enough.
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.960]   We don't claim the right, this boldness,
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:19.240]   this confidence to enter into God's presence
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.300]   because we did enough, we measured up.
[00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:26.920]   No, it's because the high priest, Jesus,
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:31.000]   did everything necessary so that by faith
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.120]   in what he has accomplished for us,
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:37.760]   by faith in who he is, we ride on his coattails
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.720]   and we have confidence because the high priest
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.100]   has done what's necessary.
[00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:48.100]   So we boldly, confidently enter into this holy of holies,
[00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:53.780]   this most sacred place where even when the high priest
[00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:57.880]   doesn't do it right, he's at risk of losing his life.
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.260]   We go in confidently.
[00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:02.560]   And why?
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.880]   Because we're told our hearts have been sprinkled
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:08.660]   to cleanse us from a guilty conscience
[00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:12.520]   and having our bodies washed with pure water.
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:15.280]   Because the church has this great high priest
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:18.400]   in Jesus Christ, let us draw near.
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.240]   Here's the first invitation.
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.720]   Let us draw near to God.
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:26.160]   How many in this room have been away at college
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.560]   and you're back for Thanksgiving break?
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.720]   There's about a half dozen people in the room.
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.560]   My daughter's back from college too.
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:36.360]   I know what college is like.
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:37.520]   I was at college.
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:44.540]   And if you have gotten real busy with studying,
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:49.800]   playing, sleeping, whatever it is,
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.660]   and it has drawn you away from God,
[00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:55.520]   let me call you back.
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:58.120]   Let me invite you.
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:01.640]   Draw near to God with a sincere heart
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:05.760]   and with the full assurance of faith,
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:07.820]   absolute trust in Jesus.
[00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:13.920]   On that day of atonement when the high priest
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:17.820]   goes into the temple, the people of God together
[00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.980]   experienced a national revival.
[00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:27.660]   They had confidence to say, now we can face another year
[00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:30.360]   and we can expect God to bless us.
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:32.960]   We can expect God to be present.
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:37.960]   We can expect God to show us favor and prosperity.
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:43.120]   We can expect, on the other hand, God will not kill us.
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:47.640]   For our sin, he's forgiven us.
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:51.760]   They could collectively breathe a sigh of relief
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:54.380]   like, oh, it's all good with God.
[00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:58.680]   And what does this passage tell us?
[00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.800]   If you read this whole section of Hebrews,
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.800]   it's just this whole explanation of,
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:08.320]   look at all that the Old Testament prophets
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.680]   and priests have done.
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:12.200]   All the animals that were sacrificed,
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:15.360]   and it had to be done every year over and over again
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:20.080]   because sin became a problem over and over again.
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:24.440]   But now we have this high priest who does it once and for all
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:27.680]   and his sacrifice is so superior,
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:29.580]   he never has to do it again.
[00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:33.540]   Once and for all, Christ has died for his church.
[00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:38.240]   Once and for all.
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:45.840]   That's as long as there's a high priest
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:46.960]   who has done it right.
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:52.360]   A high priest that was acceptable to God,
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:56.940]   who followed every law,
[00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:59.880]   obeyed every command to the utmost.
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:05.560]   But the church, as I said,
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.740]   has an even greater high priest,
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:11.880]   the Son of God, the Son of Man.
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:17.000]   The superior high priest, the super priest.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   For sinners, we cannot move forward.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   We cannot move forward in a relationship with God.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.880]   We cannot go boldly into God's presence
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.400]   without great danger.
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:39.440]   We just cannot unless we have a great high priest.
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:44.640]   And for those who don't know, I'm here to tell you,
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:49.520]   there is a great high priest and his name is Jesus.
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.520]   If you have not trusted in him,
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:55.640]   don't you dare even think about approaching God.
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:15:00.140]   It's nothing but danger.
[00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:04.300]   But if you have Jesus as your high priest,
[00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:08.680]   your Savior, who didn't slaughter a lamb,
[00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:13.360]   he himself was slaughtered.
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:17.360]   He shed his own blood, his own body broken for us.
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:23.560]   Trust that high priest 'cause he has made us a way.
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:31.380]   He's made us guilt-free and he has purified us from sin
[00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:36.380]   so that the righteous judge might declare us righteous.
[00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:38.920]   Righteous.
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:44.480]   And that's what he does when we have put our faith
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.820]   in the righteous one, Jesus.
[00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:53.040]   He has made us new, or he has made a new and living way
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:56.240]   for sinners to have intimate relationship with holy God.
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:58.560]   This is the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:02.280]   that he has secured God's forgiveness for us,
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:07.280]   that he has secured for us on the cross a birthright.
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:10.540]   As I said before, the birthright that we would dare
[00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:14.880]   to claim to be sons and daughters of God.
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:18.480]   Sons and daughters of God.
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:24.860]   This is the gospel of Jesus and this is that foundation
[00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:26.840]   that we share together.
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:31.840]   So let us draw near to God with a sincere heart
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:34.800]   and the full assurance of faith.
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:37.720]   When you have trusted Jesus,
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:40.520]   you don't have to walk carefully,
[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:44.960]   you don't have to walk sheepishly shy, afraid.
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:49.560]   No, we can approach him as our God and father.
[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:56.160]   Second, in verse 23, let us hold unswervingly
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:57.440]   to the hope we profess.
[00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:01.880]   That same gospel, for he who promised is faithful.
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:04.780]   The church is holding unwaveringly
[00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:06.360]   to the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:09.320]   her hope and her conviction and her claim.
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:12.360]   The church is unshakable trust in the faithful one.
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:16.280]   We trust the Lord Jesus Christ, that he has done enough,
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:18.400]   that he has done it right.
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.480]   We trust his finished work on the cross.
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:24.360]   There's no one else that we trust, is there?
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:28.840]   There's nothing we can add to perfectly finished work,
[00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:29.840]   is there?
[00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:36.680]   Whose gospel is the power of salvation
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:37.780]   for those who believe?
[00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:41.200]   It's the gospel of Jesus.
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:45.500]   It's the gospel of Jesus, amen?
[00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:48.240]   Do we really believe that?
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:53.040]   Do we really believe that without this gospel,
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:55.820]   we are doomed, we are hopeless?
[00:17:55.820 --> 00:18:01.880]   So then we are able to spur each other on.
[00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:04.640]   We are called to push and to press,
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:08.020]   to encourage and to inspire, to provoke each other,
[00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:13.020]   to move forward because we share this fundamental commitment
[00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:16.580]   to Jesus Christ and his gospel.
[00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:21.820]   How many times in recent days have you heard somebody
[00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:24.240]   call people to unity?
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:27.640]   We have to stop being so divided.
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:30.880]   I just heard it recently.
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:34.860]   You know, when the Kyle Rittenhouse verdict was read,
[00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:37.680]   there was a call for peace and unity.
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.000]   Let's not fight about this.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.760]   Let's be united.
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:44.360]   Let's hold together.
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:45.200]   And you know what?
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.800]   No matter who makes that call, whether it's the president,
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:52.220]   whether it's somebody influential in your life,
[00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:57.220]   a celebrity, no matter who makes that call, it's hopeless.
[00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:01.140]   We can't be united.
[00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:03.700]   There's too much that divides us.
[00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:07.320]   Being a Chicagoan doesn't unite us.
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:09.440]   Being an American doesn't unite us.
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:11.620]   Being Chinese doesn't unite us.
[00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:15.020]   A person, a citizen of the world doesn't unite us.
[00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:17.260]   It all divides us.
[00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:20.000]   But you know what unites us?
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.200]   Our hope, the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:29.180]   It's the only thing that unites the church.
[00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:32.320]   So here's a little warning.
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:35.620]   I'm not a prophet, so later on don't say,
[00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:37.360]   "Man, that John Yee was a prophet.
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:40.100]   "He knew what was coming."
[00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:42.260]   I just know, and you know human nature.
[00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:45.980]   There is going to be things that will come up
[00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:47.620]   that will divide us.
[00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:52.700]   There are gonna be things that will happen
[00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:54.740]   that will cause us to say,
[00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:57.260]   "I don't wanna be with that person anymore.
[00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:58.300]   "I don't wanna have anything to do
[00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:00.560]   "with those people anymore."
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:05.860]   But the question we need to ask ourselves is,
[00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:08.460]   but do we agree?
[00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:12.280]   Are we united in the gospel?
[00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:17.020]   Are we all one in Christ?
[00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:20.820]   Are we?
[00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:29.820]   Only the gospel of Jesus Christ can unite people.
[00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:36.620]   Only Jesus is worthy of such commitment,
[00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:39.440]   loyalty, and devotion.
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:43.080]   Only Jesus.
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:47.080]   So when division appears again and it's imminent,
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.920]   let's hold together.
[00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:54.640]   Hold on to the hope we profess, the hope we claim.
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:58.420]   I know the gospel is preached here at least once a week.
[00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:06.200]   Hold to that hope we profess.
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:11.600]   Hold on to the promises of God in Jesus Christ
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:14.080]   to give us that new life, eternal life,
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:18.520]   to forgive us for our sins, to declare us righteous,
[00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:21.620]   and to say, "You are my children.
[00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:24.460]   "You are my son, you are my daughter."
[00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:27.320]   Let us hold together to the one faith,
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:30.240]   Jesus, our superior high priest.
[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:31.360]   Let's hold on to him.
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:34.080]   Third, let us consider in verse 24
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:37.820]   how we may spur each other on towards love and good deeds,
[00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:39.600]   not giving up meeting together
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:41.200]   as some are in the habit of doing,
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:43.120]   but encouraging one another,
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:46.200]   and all the more as you see the day approaching.
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:48.680]   Mark, I'm about to say something
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:50.240]   that is probably gonna,
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:53.000]   that could potentially lead to saying,
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.960]   we wanna cancel your December visit.
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:22:02.880]   Folks, what excuses are we making?
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:10.720]   People at home, what excuses are you making
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:14.680]   that seem like a good enough excuse
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:17.020]   to forsake meeting together?
[00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:28.760]   There are people all around the world,
[00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:33.480]   COVID or not, who have imminent threats to their life,
[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:38.720]   and they are still meeting together.
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:42.720]   I think it's time that a lot of people,
[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:47.720]   the church needs to repent for all the excuses
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:50.560]   that they make for not meeting together.
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:23:01.400]   I'm gonna say it right here, enough is enough.
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:10.120]   Mark, people need to just give up their membership
[00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:12.480]   and say, you know what, I'm not coming back.
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:13.640]   Stop making excuses.
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:15.240]   Stop saying it's gonna be next month,
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:18.520]   or when the next wave of COVID is passed,
[00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:22.680]   or whatever it is, when my toe doesn't hurt anymore,
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:24.840]   or when I get a new pair of pants
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:26.520]   that I can wear to church.
[00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:28.460]   Let's stop making excuses.
[00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:31.440]   Gather together.
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:35.080]   Let's stop forsaking the meeting together.
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.920]   How are we gonna spur each other on
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:39.940]   when we are not together?
[00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:45.640]   How?
[00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:50.280]   How are we gonna encourage each other
[00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:52.660]   when we're not meeting together?
[00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:59.720]   The church faced all kinds of dangers.
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:02.720]   And you know, I always find it interesting
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:05.720]   when I speak to my friends who come from places
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:09.280]   where the church was severely persecuted,
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:12.600]   and you're one of them, people who come from China,
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:15.960]   people who come from Vietnam, Romania,
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:20.360]   and so many other countries around the world.
[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:25.120]   You know when it's the most dangerous to be a Christian?
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:27.640]   When you're meeting together.
[00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:29.880]   It is.
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:35.880]   And yet they still do everything possible
[00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:38.380]   to meet together.
[00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:44.880]   Because they know that there is a day coming
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:47.880]   when the Lord will return,
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:50.400]   and he will set all things right.
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:53.920]   The earth will be his footstool.
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:57.000]   He will sit on his throne as the righteous judge,
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.460]   and all will be well.
[00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:02.980]   And those who are members of his body,
[00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:06.420]   those whose names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life,
[00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:07.820]   have nothing to worry about.
[00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:13.020]   We encourage each other towards that day.
[00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:16.340]   I know it's hard right now, I know you're suffering right now
[00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:20.580]   but the day is coming when Jesus will make all things right.
[00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:26.900]   Let's hold firm to our hope together.
[00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:29.920]   Let's hang on to his promises together.
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:33.740]   Let's spur each other on to good works.
[00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:37.100]   Let's spur each other on towards love,
[00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:41.220]   not giving up meeting together.
[00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:50.900]   You know in Acts chapter two, verse 42,
[00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:54.180]   there's this description of the church.
[00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:57.260]   They devoted themselves to the apostles' teachings
[00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:00.660]   and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer.
[00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:04.140]   Everyone was filled with awe at the many wonders
[00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:06.620]   and signs performed by the apostles.
[00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:10.480]   All the believers were together and had everything in common.
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:12.460]   They sold property and possessions
[00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:16.140]   to give to anyone who had need.
[00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:19.040]   Every day they continued to meet together
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:20.320]   in the temple courts.
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:23.340]   They broke bread in their homes
[00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:26.460]   and ate together with glad and sincere hearts,
[00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:29.940]   praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people
[00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:32.740]   and the Lord added to their number daily
[00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:34.600]   those who were being saved.
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:38.980]   Until the Lord returns,
[00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:43.000]   the church is encouraged by being united.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.540]   They encourage each other when they are united
[00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:50.220]   by being together.
[00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:55.020]   Don't forsake gathering as some are in the habit of doing.
[00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:57.220]   Yes, worship together on Sundays
[00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:59.900]   and yes, study the word together on Mondays
[00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:03.580]   and then yes, break bread and pray together on Tuesdays
[00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:07.300]   and let's make sure that every day of the week
[00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:11.020]   we are sharing and caring, then breaking bread again.
[00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:17.460]   Let's make sure that we keep worshiping together,
[00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:20.100]   encouraging each other, spurring each other on
[00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:23.420]   towards love and good works.
[00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:26.500]   Do this until the day of the Lord.
[00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:28.740]   The gathering of believers,
[00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:33.500]   which is what the word church literally means,
[00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:35.880]   ecclesia means gathering,
[00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:41.280]   it should give us a taste of heaven.
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:45.780]   I'm not overstating that,
[00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:48.720]   it should give us a foretaste of heaven.
[00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:51.260]   Gloria and I, my wife and I,
[00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:54.540]   we experienced that when we were in seminary.
[00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:58.300]   Wow, how amazing it is to be in a place
[00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:02.060]   where everybody's kind of running in the same direction.
[00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:06.540]   And then we've experienced that in churches
[00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:08.680]   we've been members of.
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:11.500]   We've experienced that when we're surrounded
[00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:13.540]   by like college students,
[00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:15.180]   when we were going to college together
[00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:18.220]   and all the different things that college students go through
[00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:21.700]   and we're all running together because of Jesus.
[00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:27.860]   An urban voice, 2.0,
[00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:32.400]   can and does experience this foretaste of heaven too.
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:39.500]   Experience Jesus and all his benefits.
[00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:47.260]   And so many of those are right here in the body of Christ.
[00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:53.020]   Right here in the body of Christ.
[00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:55.820]   I'm gonna ask you to bow your heads with me and pray.
[00:28:55.820 --> 00:29:06.020]   I wanna give you a chance to just tell God
[00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:12.620]   how thankful you are for the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:18.700]   And if you don't know Jesus,
[00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:21.900]   then you don't yet have that to be thankful for.
[00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:31.140]   But if you wanna experience the power of the gospel
[00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:35.860]   to change your life, to give meaning to your life,
[00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:39.460]   have you been wondering about your own identity?
[00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:42.400]   Who am I and why am I here?
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:44.180]   What's the meaning of all this?
[00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:47.820]   Jesus has that answer.
[00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:49.280]   He is the answer.
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:53.180]   And I'm inviting you to come,
[00:29:53.180 --> 00:30:00.100]   come, taste and see how good Jesus is.
[00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:12.780]   And you can pray something like this.
[00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:18.280]   God, I don't need that preacher to tell me I'm a sinner.
[00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:24.460]   I know there's so much wickedness in my heart.
[00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:26.840]   There is rebellion in my heart.
[00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:29.980]   There is hate in my heart.
[00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:35.160]   There's jealousy in my heart.
[00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:41.060]   There are all these things that I wish were not there,
[00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:42.200]   but it's true.
[00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:45.380]   There's so much sin in my heart.
[00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:50.500]   And I cannot carry it anymore.
[00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:53.820]   I cannot carry that guilt anymore.
[00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:58.420]   And I'm asking you, Jesus, I'm trusting you by faith
[00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:02.900]   that you will relieve me, you will save me from that guilt.
[00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:06.740]   And that's not all.
[00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:13.460]   That you will unite me with the creator of the world,
[00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:17.980]   the one who knit me together in my mother's womb,
[00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:21.060]   the one who has fearfully and wonderfully made me,
[00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:25.580]   that I can know my creator, the God of the universe.
[00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:31.800]   Lord Jesus, I want to know you.
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:37.940]   I want to be a child of God.
[00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:42.140]   Forgive me for my sin.
[00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:44.380]   Forgive me for my offenses.
[00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:50.620]   And declare me by faith, declare me righteous,
[00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:53.200]   pure, and holy.
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:59.600]   And God, would you show me the new life that you promise?
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:03.080]   The new life today and tomorrow,
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:05.300]   but also the new life that comes
[00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:07.840]   when the day of the Lord comes,
[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:09.840]   when all things are made right,
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:14.420]   that on that day I will be counted
[00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:17.360]   among the children of God too.
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:28.500]   Thank you for Jesus, the perfect high priest
[00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:32.980]   who laid his own life down on the cross for me,
[00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:38.280]   paying the penalty for my sin,
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:41.580]   although he was without sin.
[00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:46.360]   And thank you that he proved
[00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:49.440]   that he even has power over death
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:52.940]   when he rose again on the third day.
[00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:59.560]   And I join the body of Christ, the church,
[00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:02.960]   the people who are around me, my brothers and sisters,
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:06.080]   in longing and waiting for that day,
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:09.580]   the day of the Lord, when you will return.
[00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:13.140]   And you will claim me as your own.
[00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:20.840]   God, as Urban Voice Community Church continues forward,
[00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:24.880]   I pray that you will bring them
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:28.100]   into a new season of fruitfulness,
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:34.760]   a season where many, many hear the good news
[00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:36.680]   and come to faith.
[00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:41.680]   People who speak English and Mandarin and Cantonese
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:46.340]   speak all manners of languages
[00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:49.280]   that are around us in Chicagoland,
[00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:52.480]   so many, too many to count,
[00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:54.880]   that they will hear the good news
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:57.520]   and they too will be saved.
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:01.760]   Lord, protect this church
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:08.120]   because there is an evil one who roars
[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:13.480]   and he is like a lion looking for whom he might devour.
[00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:19.860]   But we know that we have Jesus.
[00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:24.860]   The Bible calls him the Lion of Judah, a greater lion.
[00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:30.120]   And we ask you, Lord, hold your church together.
[00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:33.820]   Unite us under Jesus.
[00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:37.960]   Lord, as we go to lunch today,
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:39.440]   I'm just gonna pray it right now.
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:43.400]   Let us have a great meal together and great fellowship.
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:46.440]   Thank you for the bounty that will be on the table.
[00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:52.320]   Thank you for the bounty that is around the table,
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:53.640]   the family of God.
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:58.080]   Lord, we praise you, we celebrate you.
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:00.320]   We thank you for the cross.
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:03.640]   We thank you that because of Jesus,
[00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:06.980]   we are a family, the Urban Voice family.
[00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:10.240]   And it's in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
