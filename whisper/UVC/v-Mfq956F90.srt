1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
 Hey brothers and sisters, good to see you guys again.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,200
 Especially the college adults,

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,800
 it's good to see you guys back.

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:13,780
 Oh yeah, I have been cutting my hair for the last two years

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,380
 and I kinda messed it up, so I gotta start over again.

6
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:20,680
 Yeah, so I did save a lot, but I appreciate it.

7
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:25,560
 Let's bow our heads, let's get ready for God's message.

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,120
 Father, we thank you

9
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,220
 that you are the everlasting God,

10
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,560
 that you have so much

11
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,800
 that you probably need to take care of, Lord.

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,940
 But yet, you would spend Sunday,

13
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,940
 a day that you command us,

14
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,000
 where we need to pay attention to you, Father.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,380
 Lord, it's for our own good and it's for your glory, Lord.

16
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:53,140
 And we pray that everyone here,

17
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,480
 may your spirit be with us,

18
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,380
 may you open our hearts, Lord, to receive your message.

19
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,120
 In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

20
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,820
 Well, a couple of time ago,

21
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,800
 I probably told you guys that I had a family feud

22
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,540
 between my uncles, you know, who, over some inheritance,

23
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:12,940
 it's not like 100 million or anything,

24
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,500
 it's like, it's like child change, you know.

25
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,340
 Because of my grandmother died, you know.

26
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,140
 It's feel like these relationships are broken right now,

27
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,640
 because of greed and pride.

28
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,320
 They're still not on talking terms as of now,

29
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,160
 as I know.

30
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,520
 But I just want you guys to think about the church.

31
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:37,100
 How are relationships broken or strained in the church?

32
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,560
 Think about that.

33
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,400
 What caused these broken relationships?

34
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,800
 What caused these strains?

35
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:48,280
 Well, I can tell you, I mean, based on my experience,

36
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,420
 probably a lot of you guys have been through it too.

37
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:55,480
 A lot of things could be like gossiping, you know,

38
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,380
 being arrogant, being prideful of yourself,

39
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:03,260
 or even it could get to a point like being unable

40
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:06,560
 to share power between the leaders and the congregants,

41
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,120
 right, how things should be done.

42
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,220
 These could cause a lot of disunity.

43
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,840
 But the reality is that, as we are in the fallen world,

44
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,260
 I mean, the way how we do things,

45
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,540
 I mean, a lot of times it leads to our,

46
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,780
 I mean, prideful arrogance, which leads to sin, you know,

47
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,080
 which cause friction among the body of Christ.

48
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,840
 That God, I mean, that God,

49
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,920
 he did everything he could to establish this church,

50
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,760
 this body.

51
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:39,520
 Therefore, do we just accept the way it is?

52
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,960
 Well, the world is broken, right, it's fallen.

53
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:46,740
 The way how we act, is this the way we should accept

54
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:47,740
 this reality?

55
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,840
 Absolutely not.

56
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,000
 Because God expects more of us than this.

57
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,460
 So today, I want to

58
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:01,940
 talk about the relationship in the church.

59
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,640
 How do we conduct ourselves?

60
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,780
 In the past semesters, I talked about how did Jesus Christ

61
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,540
 establish this church, right?

62
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:12,880
 How, at the end, we have to be united

63
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,240
 and be mature inside the church,

64
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,720
 but how do we relate to each other?

65
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,380
 Today, I want to talk about that.

66
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:21,220
 (papers rustling)

67
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:28,380
 This is the thought, yeah, how we conduct ourselves.

68
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,060
 Okay, the first point I want to talk about is like,

69
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,320
 do not give the devil a foothold.

70
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,420
 Do not give him a stronghold in your life.

71
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:41,820
 So, starting on Ephesians chapter four, verse 25 to 28,

72
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,700
 it says, "Therefore, each of you must put off falsehood

73
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,000
 "and speak truthfully to your neighbors.

74
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,380
 "For we are a member of one body.

75
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,500
 "In your anger, do not sin.

76
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,180
 "Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry.

77
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,780
 "And do not give the devil a foothold.

78
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:05,820
 "Anyone who has been stealing must steal no longer,

79
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,620
 "but must work together, do something useful

80
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:12,060
 "with their own hand, that they may have something

81
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,660
 "to share with those in need."

82
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,960
 Now, right here, Paul starts with,

83
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,960
 "Therefore," that means there's a relationship

84
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,460
 from a previous passage to this one right here.

85
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,340
 Yes, the previous passage, which is chapter four,

86
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:27,040
 verse 17 to 24, talks about the general principle

87
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,780
 of the difference between the old man,

88
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:33,380
 which is your old identity, your pagan identity,

89
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:36,740
 comparing it to the new identity, which is in Christ.

90
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,260
 So, it's a very general comparison, telling us

91
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:43,380
 we must put on our new man, our new person,

92
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,300
 get rid of the old person.

93
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,160
 Right here, Paul is giving us some specific guidelines

94
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,060
 of how we should conduct ourselves among brothers

95
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,900
 and sisters in the church.

96
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,200
 So, let's take a look at this.

97
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,640
 Here, Paul gives a list of actually,

98
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,740
 a list of vice and virtues, of what we shouldn't do

99
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,380
 and what we should do.

100
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:07,480
 So, virtues are things that kinda like unite us,

101
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,860
 and in contrast, vice are things that disrupt

102
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,220
 the unity of the community.

103
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,420
 So, the first thing that you see in verse 25

104
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:19,220
 is basically, it says, you gotta put off falsehood.

105
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,620
 The first vice is lying.

106
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,220
 This is the mark of the old person,

107
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,600
 which is corrupted by sin.

108
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,200
 But, Paul says, this is not enough.

109
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,400
 We can't just stop lying.

110
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,440
 You have to replace it with a virtue,

111
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,340
 and that virtue right here is that we must speak truthfully.

112
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,980
 But, why?

113
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,020
 I mean, the motivation is that because we,

114
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:46,020
 as the second part, it says, we are all members of one body.

115
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,560
 We are part of the body of Christ.

116
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,420
 We have to put on this new person here.

117
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:55,020
 So, besides that, speaking the truth to each other

118
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:58,560
 is also a direct quote that Paul uses from Zacharias.

119
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,960
 It's a old, Zacharia, the book of Zacharia

120
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,800
 is a Old Testament book.

121
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,000
 It talks about what God's promised about the new Jerusalem.

122
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,340
 So, these are, this is what happened.

123
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,540
 During that time, they were allowed to come back

124
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,980
 during the Persian Empire.

125
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,880
 They have been exiled for 70 years.

126
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,180
 They came back, and God's telling them,

127
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,120
 you guys will inherit Jerusalem again, right?

128
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,120
 Since Paul is using this quote here,

129
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,220
 it seems like he's talking to us.

130
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,100
 We're the recipient of that promise.

131
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:34,440
 And, these are the promises that the prophets

132
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,000
 and apostles are making known to us right now.

133
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,100
 I mean, us in terms of what I'm talking in their context

134
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,300
 to the first generation Christians

135
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,740
 that no one knows until they reveal it to them right now.

136
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,220
 So, it is significant for us.

137
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,440
 It's just that we are the recipients of this.

138
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:56,880
 We have to behave accordingly to who we are.

139
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,860
 Therefore, speaking the truth is a sign of this new person

140
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,700
 because God is truthful.

141
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:07,600
 As we move on to verse 26,

142
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:12,600
 the second thing is sinning in your anger.

143
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,040
 That's the thing Paul wants us not to do.

144
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,100
 We should stop sinning when we're angry.

145
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,840
 Paul is also quoting, actually, from Psalms 4.

146
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,780
 You know, he's quoting about Psalms David wrote,

147
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:27,680
 claiming that he is being slandered

148
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,320
 because of crimes that he did not commit.

149
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,520
 He is sure of that.

150
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,560
 Therefore, what does he do?

151
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,760
 He cries out to the Lord,

152
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,560
 and his anger turned to joy and peace.

153
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,560
 Now, this peace and joy,

154
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,760
 despite the situation you're in,

155
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,360
 is a mark of a new person.

156
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,560
 Now, as we continue to take a look,

157
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,580
 it seems like anger, seems like it's permitted.

158
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:56,380
 So, is anger in general okay, we're asking?

159
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:00,880
 Well, I would tell you being angry for the wrong reason,

160
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,920
 of course, is obviously not right.

161
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,880
 However, can we be angry for a righteous cause?

162
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,420
 Like, if you see oppression,

163
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:14,500
 or you see injustice, of course we can.

164
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,560
 There's such thing as a righteous anger, right?

165
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,160
 God has righteous angers.

166
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:24,300
 But I could tell you, rarely our angers are righteous.

167
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,740
 Even if it is, do not let it boil.

168
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:32,420
 So, because as the second part says, right,

169
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,920
 do not give the devil a foothold, right?

170
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,720
 Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry.

171
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,460
 So, you gotta get rid of it quickly.

172
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,960
 So, because our natural,

173
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,060
 we still have our old person within us, you know?

174
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,700
 It's suddenly kinda like, let us feel like,

175
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,740
 oh, whatever we always experience, our anger,

176
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,240
 must be righteous, but other people's anger

177
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,440
 is always like a tantra, bad temper, right?

178
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,860
 So, they must be wrong, I must be right.

179
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:05,800
 But I'm telling you guys, brothers and sisters,

180
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,100
 better assume the worst in us.

181
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,680
 When you have anger, I mean, better assume

182
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,740
 it might mostly not be righteous,

183
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,020
 because it could be damaging to relationship.

184
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,940
 Let me give you an example.

185
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:21,480
 For me and my son, right, I told you guys,

186
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,320
 I mean, my son is here, but you know.

187
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:27,660
 During this time, I feel like he's in a terrible three,

188
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,960
 right, whatever I tell him to do, he does not do.

189
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,900
 If I tell him not to do it, he will do it.

190
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,500
 Even when I feel like I have to talk to him,

191
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,800
 I yell at him, whatever, I feel like I'm right.

192
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,000
 But in the heated moment, I could tell you,

193
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,300
 my discipline will not be the best,

194
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,140
 because I'm very emotional at the time.

195
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,420
 Like, it's quite personal, right?

196
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,520
 Let's talk a little bit about more

197
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,720
 that we could relate to the body of Christ.

198
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,320
 Like, I remember, not remember,

199
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,080
 it's still happening right now, right?

200
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,680
 The last couple years in Hong Kong,

201
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,380
 there's some social unrest, right?

202
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:03,320
 I'm not talking about commenting

203
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,560
 on anything political right here,

204
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,520
 but more of like, during that unrest,

205
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,960
 during these couple years,

206
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:14,500
 I mainly look at how we respond as Christians, right?

207
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:18,600
 Especially, they kinda, what I saw,

208
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,140
 is that there became two factions, right?

209
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,940
 One has a different, has one viewpoint,

210
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,740
 the other has a different viewpoint.

211
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,780
 The thing is that, what I saw is that,

212
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:33,320
 despite that emotion, that anger,

213
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,580
 at the end, they were at each other's throat,

214
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,720
 and they did not talk to each other, right?

215
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,020
 I even see that from some of my own brothers and sisters,

216
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:45,420
 and man, that was tough to see.

217
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,400
 What I'm trying to tell you is that,

218
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,700
 even with the best intention,

219
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,000
 our emotion will cloud our judgment.

220
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:57,380
 So, as I said, if you continue to look at verse 27,

221
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:00,520
 it seems to suggest that anger is not caused by the devil,

222
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,880
 but Satan will use it against you

223
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,360
 to disrupt the body of Christ.

224
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,420
 But let's come back to this issue in a moment.

225
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,960
 Let's go to verse 28.

226
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:14,800
 The third vice is stealing,

227
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,760
 and the virtue is not just to not steal anymore,

228
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,340
 that's not enough, Paul is saying.

229
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,540
 We need to work in order to have something

230
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,100
 to share with others in our community,

231
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,500
 that's what he's saying.

232
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,700
 Instead of having something that you have negative,

233
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,780
 we just don't turn it to zero,

234
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:35,380
 we don't just neutralize it, as a Christian.

235
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:38,340
 A lot of things, we have to have a plus,

236
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:41,260
 from negative, not just a zero, but a plus.

237
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:45,060
 And right here, as you see the word work,

238
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:48,620
 in this context, it means to labor extremely hard

239
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,160
 to the point of fatigue.

240
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,260
 So we have to do our best with our abilities,

241
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,660
 with our mind, to work, so why?

242
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:01,760
 It says so we can have something to present to others,

243
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,160
 especially the ones in need.

244
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,040
 Why?

245
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,740
 Because we have to make contribution to the body of Christ,

246
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,240
 for the sisters.

247
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,240
 Now, this letter didn't address any specific problems

248
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,520
 towards the Ephesian church, mainly,

249
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,180
 but it's also a circulating letter.

250
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,080
 I mean, other churches will read this.

251
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:27,560
 These vice might be like a general practice

252
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,820
 that Christians, during that time,

253
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,260
 after they have been converted to the new person,

254
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,920
 they might continue to be engaging

255
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,900
 in some of these activities.

256
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,740
 I mean, stealing, along with other things,

257
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:41,760
 are probably still acceptable during that time.

258
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,440
 Why?

259
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,700
 They don't have social programs

260
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,200
 during that time in the Roman world.

261
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,640
 I mean, you have to make a living somehow, right?

262
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,640
 But the thing is that, what Paul is saying,

263
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,640
 but we have to get rid of those things.

264
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,140
 If you are gonna be a new person,

265
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,480
 you have to get rid of these things.

266
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,740
 These are not acceptable.

267
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:04,480
 Because these things are causing harm

268
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,180
 to brothers and sisters, right here.

269
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,680
 Now, let's get back to verse 27.

270
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,880
 This kind of summarizes the points right here.

271
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:14,160
 Giving a foothold, right?

272
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,320
 I could tell you, right,

273
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,460
 Satan do not want anyone to be Christians

274
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,860
 or to live in a Christian manner.

275
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:24,100
 It means when we give him a foothold,

276
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:29,780
 that means we do not reflect the new person.

277
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,900
 We do not reflect Christ-like behavior.

278
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:36,880
 Our lies, our angers, our stealing, you know.

279
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,920
 This is what the devil needs.

280
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,380
 He need you to do these things

281
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:43,920
 in order for him to infiltrate the church.

282
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:48,620
 I mean, one of the reasons why relationship is so difficult,

283
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,420
 because Satan attacks them.

284
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:55,320
 He wants to undermine what God has created.

285
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,700
 So, what in the world is really a foothold?

286
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,960
 Take a look.

287
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,760
 Imagining yourself being chased by a bad person,

288
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,440
 and you get to a point, you get to your house,

289
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,680
 and you close the door and shut 'em off.

290
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,780
 But no, this person is able to stick one foot in the door.

291
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:13,480
 And think about it, when his foot is here,

292
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,880
 you can't close that door completely.

293
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,220
 So, basically, this is what the devil is doing every time.

294
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,380
 When you can't close the door,

295
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,920
 he's able to come in, give you a whisper.

296
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,420
 Hey, do this, this is good, stealing is good.

297
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,800
 You're just doing a little stealing, it's okay.

298
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,760
 It's nothing, you're not gonna hurt anyone.

299
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,060
 He's continuing to influence your life right here

300
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,000
 with that foothold.

301
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,200
 So, in conclusion, brothers and sisters,

302
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,280
 we need to get rid of the devil's foothold

303
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,280
 at the church door.

304
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:51,080
 Therefore, we gotta produce these virtuous behavior

305
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,280
 that will serve others in the community.

306
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,720
 This is a practical step to continue

307
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,460
 to maintain this unity in Christ.

308
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:01,900
 The second point I wanna talk about

309
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,840
 is don't grieve the Holy Spirit,

310
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,300
 which consists of verse 29 to 32.

311
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:11,640
 Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouth,

312
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,000
 but only what is helpful for building others up

313
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,780
 according to their needs.

314
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:18,580
 That it may benefit those who listen,

315
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,420
 and do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God,

316
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,780
 with whom you were seated for the day of redemption.

317
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:28,860
 Get rid of all bitterness, rage, and anger,

318
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:32,860
 brawling and slander, along with every form of malice.

319
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:36,000
 Be kind and compassionate to one another,

320
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.

321
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,560
 Now in the second point,

322
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,060
 after talking about these lies, these angers, these stuff,

323
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:50,940
 Paul seems to returning to the first topic of speech.

324
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:55,080
 The first topic of speech is speaking the truth in love.

325
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,580
 Here, Paul's telling us not to engage

326
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:02,220
 in unwholesome or harmful speech.

327
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:06,120
 But the thing is, our culture makes that a norm.

328
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,020
 It kinda infiltrates into our church.

329
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,860
 Think about it, here's some examples.

330
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:15,420
 I always see, especially with ones with a consumer mindset.

331
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:19,100
 Wow, our church, look at that nursery, man, it's so small.

332
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,540
 You know, I wish there was a slide in there.

333
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,660
 It would make the nursery way better.

334
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,400
 You know those Sunday school teachers?

335
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,740
 It's not passionate at all.

336
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:30,140
 If they were more passionate, we have better curriculums,

337
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:33,240
 I think my kid would join, so I can't come to church.

338
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,520
 Oh, my church doesn't have a coffee machine, you know?

339
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,920
 I can't get free coffee, man, that sucks.

340
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,980
 Or come on, we need some sofa here, you know?

341
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:46,460
 I mean, it's always consuming, like what we don't have,

342
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,860
 what we don't have, this or that, you know?

343
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,560
 This is that consumer mindset.

344
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,700
 Another thing is that, I would say, I don't know,

345
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:58,000
 I hear this a lot from the Chinese churches.

346
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,940
 If I have a problem with someone,

347
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:02,000
 I have a problem with person A right here,

348
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,200
 I will not talk to them,

349
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,840
 I cannot confront them directly.

350
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:09,420
 It's always like, hey, do you know what person A did to me?

351
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,420
 Hey, do you know what person A did to me?

352
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,980
 But it's never confronted, face to face, you know?

353
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,580
 You never resolve the problem.

354
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:19,820
 And one more thing I wanna say is that

355
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:24,860
 we always like to criticize our leaders and pastors.

356
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:29,100
 Only if the pastor could do this or that, right?

357
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:32,160
 Only if the pastor could preach better.

358
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,740
 Dude, I'm telling you guys,

359
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,040
 the pastor is just a human being like us, right?

360
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,840
 He has his talent, he has his shortfall also.

361
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,480
 I can't expect a Pastor Mark to do everything perfectly

362
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,840
 and everything good.

363
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,780
 That's why you guys are here.

364
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,580
 That's why you guys are here.

365
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:51,980
 The body of Christ gave you guys give, right?

366
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,560
 We all have some special gifts,

367
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,060
 so you can't expect the leaders and the pastor

368
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,860
 to do everything and you're just sitting here

369
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,160
 complaining this and that.

370
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,000
 Now, instead of engaging in these harmful speech,

371
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,200
 engage in helpful speech, right?

372
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,800
 Speech that is beneficial.

373
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:14,940
 We need to build up our community according to our needs.

374
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,600
 Well, I would say this is what we should do.

375
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,580
 We gotta think about how we speak to each other,

376
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:23,640
 especially how we cannot harm other with these speeches.

377
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,440
 Watch out for our tones, for our demeanor,

378
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:30,060
 so as we talk to each other, be wise and sensitive.

379
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,360
 Learn when and where is the right place

380
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,420
 to say what you want to say.

381
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,980
 How about encouraging each other?

382
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:41,880
 I feel like we as Asians, we like to criticize,

383
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,720
 but how about saying good job?

384
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,360
 I'm glad you did a good job, right?

385
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,360
 Nice try.

386
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,220
 We are all ever asked,

387
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,860
 hey, how are you guys doing these days?

388
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,960
 How are you guys doing emotionally, right?

389
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,900
 I mean, these are things we have to do more,

390
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,040
 something more positive to lift up our brothers and sisters

391
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,480
 with our speech.

392
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,280
 I mean, in this case, if we look at this context,

393
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,780
 verse 29 flows well with verse 28,

394
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,180
 because both of these verse

395
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,880
 is to seek the benefit of others.

396
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,420
 Verse 28 is to seek the benefit of others with our actions,

397
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:20,100
 and verse 29 is to seek the benefit of others

398
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,720
 with our speech.

399
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,300
 These are really essential things

400
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,200
 for the good and the growth of the church.

401
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,400
 As we are obedient to scriptures,

402
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,180
 the concern of the growth and the good for the church

403
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,960
 should be natural to every one of us

404
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,920
 who profess faith in Jesus Christ.

405
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,820
 So think about it.

406
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:43,260
 Next time you see someone getting baptized,

407
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,740
 are you happy for that person?

408
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:48,740
 You're happy because that person

409
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:51,740
 pledged obedience to Jesus Christ,

410
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:55,240
 and Satan's kingdom is crumbling.

411
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,520
 Are we happy when someone else is shining up here

412
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,340
 besides us?

413
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,620
 Are we happy when we see someone

414
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,420
 is maturing in their Christian life?

415
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,560
 We should be happy.

416
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,660
 These are natural for us.

417
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,020
 It should be natural for us.

418
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,500
 Let's move on to verse 30.

419
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:15,400
 Besides trying to maintain this unity,

420
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,700
 verse 30 also gives us another motivation

421
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,400
 to achieve that,

422
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,340
 which is to not grieve the Holy Spirit.

423
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:26,840
 We should not make the Holy Spirit sad or feel sorrow.

424
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,080
 Now, the Holy Spirit of God right here

425
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,420
 is a link to Isaiah, the book of Isaiah,

426
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:34,940
 in Old Testament, chapter 63, verse 10.

427
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:38,420
 I mean, right here, the Israelites are constantly sitting.

428
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,180
 Isaiah is a prophet, he's trying to tell them,

429
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,420
 you better come back to God,

430
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,460
 if not, bad things are gonna happen.

431
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:48,200
 So right here in this chapter,

432
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,620
 he's reminding the Israelites,

433
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:53,440
 how God saved you guys from the Egyptians

434
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,100
 and brought you into the wilderness,

435
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,640
 yet you guys are unfaithful.

436
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:02,680
 And God became their enemy and told them,

437
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,380
 you guys, this first generation of Israelites,

438
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,540
 will not enter the promised land.

439
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:11,120
 Hey, this same idea is applied to this verse

440
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,480
 of God's new people, the body of Christ.

441
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,220
 Hey, we have been sealed with the Holy Spirit.

442
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,920
 It's dwelling within us.

443
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:22,820
 We have been blessed with every blessing from Christ,

444
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,900
 and we are on to full redemption

445
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,860
 when all things are under the authority of Christ,

446
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:30,940
 when God bring that to one day.

447
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:33,900
 No, this taste, the taste of this glorious day,

448
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,780
 theoretically, should be seen in the church.

449
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,600
 It should be.

450
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:42,720
 But Satan is doing everything to undermine it.

451
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,580
 But guess what, brothers and sisters?

452
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,880
 It's useless.

453
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,420
 Yes, we seem to be stumbling back and forth, right?

454
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:55,200
 We probably seem to be losing a battle there and here, right?

455
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,560
 But we didn't lose the war.

456
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,800
 Because the Spirit is greater than the devil.

457
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:04,000
 For the things that we still behave like the old person,

458
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,400
 the devil's foothold will still be on us.

459
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,880
 That grieves the Holy Spirit.

460
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,880
 So we need to behave like the new person.

461
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,740
 Build up the church, and when we build up the church,

462
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:19,020
 it simultaneously tears down the devil's stronghold.

463
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:22,980
 Let's move on and continue to verse 31 and 32.

464
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:26,020
 The next two verses is a summary of the way

465
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,480
 we should live by not grieving the Holy Spirit.

466
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,000
 If you take a look at 31, it gives a broad list of vice.

467
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,400
 It's talking about bitterness, rage, and anger.

468
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,940
 These are very internal and personal.

469
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:41,060
 And from there, it goes to brawling and slander,

470
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,200
 to verbal and outward.

471
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:49,000
 And this results to every form of malice, of wickedness.

472
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,620
 But in turn, Paul is saying right here in verse 32,

473
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:56,080
 we should be kind, compassionate to one another,

474
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,720
 forgiving one another.

475
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:02,960
 And Paul is saying, the motivation is found, right,

476
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,960
 at the end of verse 32, just as in Christ God forgave you.

477
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,560
 So basically, this is the higher order of command,

478
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,260
 of encouragement, you know.

479
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,040
 God demonstrate forgiveness,

480
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:19,080
 so you must also demonstrate forgiveness.

481
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,440
 Paul is referring back to his theology

482
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,380
 of what God has done for us in the first three chapters

483
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,580
 of Ephesians.

484
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:31,140
 What Christ has done for us,

485
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,680
 what God is currently doing in our lives,

486
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,180
 then we should be motivated to live the right way.

487
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:42,960
 So, if we're not motivated, this is how it would look like,

488
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,860
 I would say, if we grieve the Spirit.

489
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:49,940
 You're in a relationship, a lot of us are couples,

490
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:54,040
 if you're not in, probably you will have an idea.

491
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,380
 Relationships are complicated.

492
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:59,220
 As I know a person who lives in the state,

493
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,080
 recently, the wife

494
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:08,920
 found out that he was committing pornography

495
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,120
 since whenever, you know.

496
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,700
 And the wife found out,

497
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:18,160
 he told the congregation and the leaders,

498
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,860
 and this person had to step down.

499
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:24,860
 I'm so glad the wife did that,

500
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,960
 because it made this person, this friend,

501
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,340
 came to his sense.

502
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:33,740
 He still feel like, it did not hurt anyone,

503
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,200
 but myself, it's okay.

504
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,680
 But it hurt his wife,

505
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,080
 and other people in the congregation

506
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,380
 once they found out,

507
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,740
 because he deceived others in the church.

508
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:47,900
 So, the wife is obviously mad.

509
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:51,380
 I would say the main emotion is sad.

510
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,500
 But the thing is that,

511
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,640
 the wife is still there,

512
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,940
 but the wife says,

513
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,140
 "I don't trust whatever you're saying right now."

514
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,320
 You know?

515
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,920
 So, at nine o'clock,

516
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,080
 the computer is gonna be on a password.

517
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,280
 And they have to go to counseling, right?

518
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,020
 The wife is really mad.

519
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,820
 If I could tell you one good thing

520
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:14,060
 that comes out of this, brothers and sisters,

521
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:18,120
 if the wife or the husband is still grieving,

522
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,060
 that means they're still in it, you know?

523
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,720
 They're still in this fight with you.

524
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,100
 If the Holy Spirit is still grieving,

525
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,260
 they're still in this fight.

526
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,800
 If one day your wife or your husband

527
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,260
 or your girlfriend or a boyfriend said,

528
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,200
 or they don't have any emotion,

529
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,800
 "Oh, I don't care.

530
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,700
 "I don't care about that person anymore."

531
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,840
 Then you worry.

532
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,680
 Then I'm gonna tell you,

533
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,040
 your relationship is over.

534
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,380
 Do you wanna get to that point?

535
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:45,580
 I don't think the Spirit will get to that point

536
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:49,440
 in terms of our theology that we know.

537
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,420
 But grieving God's Holy Spirit is just like that, right?

538
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:57,820
 Let's not get to that point, right?

539
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:15,040
 And the last part I wanna talk to you about,

540
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,980
 the last point is point three, is imitate God.

541
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,620
 This is actually the conclusion

542
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:21,720
 Paul uses to end this passage.

543
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:26,620
 Now, after he's giving us

544
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:33,160
 Roddy's specific points of we should not steal,

545
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:37,200
 lie, or anger, he sums up his main point right here.

546
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,940
 He says, "Follow God's example.

547
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,940
 "Therefore, as dearly loved children,

548
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,640
 "and walk in the way of love,

549
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,880
 "just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us

550
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,820
 "as a fragrant offering and sacrifice for God."

551
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:58,880
 As we identify as God's children,

552
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,360
 we are to walk in love, Paul is saying.

553
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,620
 And where's that motivation coming from?

554
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,220
 In verse two, it says,

555
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:10,160
 "Just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us

556
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:13,040
 "as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God."

557
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:17,780
 We are to do the same, we are to have the same attitude.

558
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:19,700
 We are to imitate God.

559
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:25,440
 We are to walk by love by displaying sacrificial love

560
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,120
 to others, to our brothers and sisters.

561
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:32,420
 But you're saying, you might be thinking,

562
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,560
 it sounds impossible, right?

563
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,220
 But I want you to remember two things,

564
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,760
 my brothers and sisters.

565
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,560
 Number one, the Spirit is within us.

566
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:46,900
 He will complete the sanctification work within us.

567
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:49,980
 Therefore, we could speak truthfully to each other.

568
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:54,180
 Therefore, we can quickly subdue our anger.

569
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:56,280
 Therefore, we can supply others

570
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:01,280
 with our work to supply their needs.

571
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:05,280
 I mean, these are a couple of important virtues

572
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,960
 that Paul is talking about to build up the church.

573
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:12,860
 But the general principle Paul is saying is that

574
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:15,800
 the Spirit is greater than the devil.

575
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,540
 We can overcome any other sins

576
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:22,340
 that prevent us from maintaining this unity in Christ.

577
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:25,000
 The second thing I want you guys to understand is that

578
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,480
 this is the expectation of a normal church.

579
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,080
 This is what a church should look like, Paul is saying.

580
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,180
 And God commands it.

581
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:35,420
 If God commands it, that means it's doable.

582
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:38,360
 And God will give you the resource to complete the job.

583
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:45,320
 Now think about a guy tearing down buildings.

584
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:49,040
 In 2004, during Hurricane Katrina,

585
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,260
 I had a chance to go down to New Orleans.

586
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:56,040
 My main job of ministry is to tear down houses

587
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:59,500
 because it was flooded and they need to tear down the walls.

588
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,280
 All I do is need a sledgehammer.

589
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,640
 It's not like rocket science.

590
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,660
 I never majored in any sort of engineering.

591
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,860
 I know how to break stuff.

592
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,720
 It's so easy to break stuff, right?

593
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,820
 We're so natural.

594
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,260
 Breaking things is so easy.

595
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,560
 I've been breaking stuff.

596
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,200
 I have a good timeline.

597
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,660
 I can break things and not get in trouble.

598
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,500
 All right, good.

599
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:29,480
 But think about building something.

600
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:33,840
 Building something, you really need to go to school for.

601
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,320
 You really need to know what you're doing.

602
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,080
 Your measurement has to be correct.

603
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:42,020
 Even if you layer these bricks,

604
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:44,520
 these bricks have to be very careful in building.

605
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:49,260
 Exactly what it is.

606
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:52,960
 Satan, stronghold in our lives,

607
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,160
 we could destroy things so easily.

608
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:59,400
 But maintaining this unity in the body of Christ is hard.

609
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,400
 It's really hard, brothers and sisters.

610
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:05,100
 But I want you to do one thing today.

611
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:09,340
 I want you to think about behavior that you could improve

612
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:13,120
 and do better to maintain the unity within the church.

613
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,860
 One thing, I can't tell you to do a million things.

614
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:19,020
 I mean, we have a lot of work, but work on one thing.

615
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,480
 What is one thing that you could do better

616
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,020
 to contribute to the church to maintain this unity?

617
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:28,000
 Hey, since we know we are God's children

618
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,400
 and we know what he did for us,

619
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,160
 we therefore live like a princess

620
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,300
 or a prince of the king of king.

621
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:39,280
 Live like your truthful identity, brothers and sisters.

622
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,180
 We have to choose to imitate God

623
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,540
 by walking in love towards each other,

624
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:47,280
 towards our fellow brothers and sisters in Christ

625
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,280
 with our speech and actions.

626
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,020
 So we could maintain this unity

627
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,960
 and at the same time be in a manifestation

628
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,060
 of what the glory of God would look like

629
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:00,700
 when the church operates normally.

630
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,520
 Let's pray.

631
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,860
 Father, we thank you.

632
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:08,260
 We thank you for the job of unity

633
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,660
 is already done through you.

634
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:13,980
 Thank you for giving us some specific instruction

635
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:18,980
 of how we can continue to maintain this unity, Lord.

636
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:24,180
 Father, as you gave us all the tools already,

637
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,780
 the spirit is within us.

638
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:29,320
 Help us continue to tear down

639
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,980
 those strongholds from the devil.

640
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:35,460
 Those footholds are very damaging, Lord.

641
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:38,520
 I pray nothing more, Lord,

642
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:43,500
 that we do not demonize our brothers and sisters

643
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,240
 for any other reasons, Lord,

644
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:49,400
 because our main identity is in Christ,

645
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,340
 not because I am a Chicagoan

646
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:56,340
 or I am from Hong Kong, I'm Chinese, or whatever.

647
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,120
 That's secondary.

648
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,580
 Our citizen in heaven is primary, Lord,

649
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,320
 and help us hold dear to that,

650
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,520
 knowing that we might have differences,

651
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,760
 but help us love each other.

652
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,960
 Help us have that sacrificial love, Lord,

653
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,960
 toward each other even though we might not have,

654
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,700
 we have different points of view, Lord.

655
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:19,600
 Help us walk like Jesus, Lord.

656
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,500
 Help us be like Jesus.

657
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,420
 We thank you for today and the message.

658
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,860
 In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
