[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.500]   - Thank you, good morning to all of you guys.
[00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.460]   And for those who are sitting here,
[00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.620]   those who are watching, my name is Tommy Lee.
[00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.260]   It is always an honor to really be here
[00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.020]   with all of you guys.
[00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.500]   I graduated from business school,
[00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.620]   and then from that point, I spent about 10 years
[00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.140]   building cell towers, and that's what I thought
[00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.860]   I was gonna do all my life.
[00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.420]   Then from that point, I was a pastor for about three years,
[00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.060]   actually working in a Korean church.
[00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.060]   And I was there, I realized,
[00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.180]   and Pastor Mark does a great job as a pastor,
[00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.940]   I realized being called to be a pastor
[00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.540]   just wasn't something that God was calling me to do.
[00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.020]   I love the Lord, I wasn't called to be a pastor.
[00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.620]   And then after that, I got hired at this big Bible institute
[00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.040]   called Moody Bible Institute here in the city.
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.580]   So I worked for the president's office, Dr. Michael Easley,
[00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.580]   I said, "Okay, this is what you're calling me to do, Lord."
[00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.980]   And I realized, after spending about four years there
[00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.260]   working with the bigger ministry, it was very top-down,
[00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.220]   it probably wasn't for me as well, too.
[00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.180]   And so when Dr. Easley transitioned out,
[00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.900]   I transitioned out with him.
[00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.940]   So now these days, I get a chance, I realize,
[00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.740]   I fit in this thing where I could do multiple things.
[00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.620]   We started Resource Global that works
[00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.740]   with young Christian marketplace leaders
[00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.020]   in Singapore, in Malaysia, in Nairobi, in South Africa,
[00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.020]   and Austin, Texas, and also in Indonesia.
[00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.780]   Now I also then got hired to work with Northern Seminary,
[00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.140]   where I get a chance to partner with Pastor Mark
[00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.260]   under the Growth Center for Church and Missions,
[00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.060]   their executive director.
[00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.700]   Then I got hired by Family Foundation
[00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.860]   to run Together LA initiative over in Los Angeles,
[00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.740]   and most recently as the managing director
[00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.060]   of the Wheaton Center for Faith and Innovation
[00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.380]   at Wheaton College.
[00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.280]   And I realized I actually do better
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.260]   when I could run four different things versus one thing.
[00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.820]   And all of us are wired differently.
[00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.060]   All of us are in a journey.
[00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.700]   I think from what I heard from James last week,
[00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.220]   the speaker talked about what does it mean
[00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.200]   to give of your life, to give of your treasures,
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.920]   both financially as well as your time.
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.940]   Today, we're gonna talk about a story
[00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.600]   that I have loved and I've come to love,
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.140]   and it's the story of Gideon in Judges chapter six.
[00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.380]   I hope that you guys have not heard
[00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.740]   about this passage recently, and I'm repeating again,
[00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.740]   but man, I love diving in this story
[00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.420]   because it's a reminder of how God uses ordinary people
[00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.900]   like you and me to do extraordinary things.
[00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.380]   So let's dive in the story of Gideon.
[00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.940]   In Judges chapter six, verse one,
[00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.180]   it begins in verse one, "The people of Israel
[00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.340]   "did what was evil in the sight of the Lord."
[00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.060]   And you're gonna find in the book of Judges,
[00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.980]   that's a theme over and over again.
[00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.740]   The Israelites are always doing what was evil
[00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:58.660]   in the eyes of the Lord.
[00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.020]   They're always getting in trouble.
[00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.860]   They're always doing something that forces,
[00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.980]   no matter what God has done to them,
[00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.980]   from the days of Moses to the days of Joshua,
[00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.440]   and judge after judge, you see the same theme
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.780]   over and over again, that the people of Israel
[00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.420]   did what was evil in the sight of the Lord.
[00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.060]   "And the Lord gave them into the hand of Midian
[00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.660]   "for seven years," I'm reading out the ESV.
[00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.020]   "And the hand of Midian overpowered Israel.
[00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.620]   "And because of Midian, the people of Israel
[00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.220]   "made for themselves the dens that are in the mountains
[00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.100]   "and the caves and the strongholds."
[00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.500]   They had nowhere to turn, they just hid there.
[00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.820]   "For whenever the Israelite planted crops,"
[00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.220]   whenever it was harvest time,
[00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.900]   whenever they knew it was harvest time,
[00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.180]   "the Midianites and the Amalekites,"
[00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.340]   not just the Midianites,
[00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.060]   but they brought along the Amalekites,
[00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.300]   "and the people of the east will come up against them."
[00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.380]   So already they're scared, already they're hiding in caves,
[00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.060]   already they're hiding in all of these different things.
[00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.340]   Harvest time, they're invaded by the Midianites,
[00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.120]   the Amalekites, and all the people in the east.
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.840]   "They would encamp against them
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.740]   "and devour the produce of the land as far as Gaza,
[00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.940]   "and leave no sustenance in Israel,
[00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.160]   "and no sheep or ox or donkey.
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.500]   "For they would come up with their livestock in their tents.
[00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.740]   "They would," I love this description,
[00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.660]   "come like locusts in number,
[00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.380]   "both they and their camels could not be counted,
[00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.480]   "so that they laid waste the land as they came in.
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.460]   "And Israel was brought very low because of Midian,
[00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.460]   "and the people of Israel cried out for help to the Lord."
[00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.220]   In today's culture, we see a little bit of that, don't we?
[00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.900]   We see recently a lot of times the terror
[00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.860]   or the violence that's happening,
[00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:03.180]   and I am, here we go, in Russia and the Ukraine.
[00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:08.140]   You see the huge city or huge country that we see in Russia.
[00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.380]   You see tiny Ukraine that was once a part
[00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.100]   of the Soviet Union, the USSR back in the '80s.
[00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.740]   You see Russia trying to put together
[00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.340]   the former Soviet Union and trying to exert their power.
[00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:27.340]   They are already overrun and captured Georgia quietly.
[00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.420]   And now here, Ukraine, right before they became,
[00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.860]   they applied to be members of NATO.
[00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.340]   Here they are, and for the last month,
[00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.080]   they're bombing, they're bombarding all of these things.
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.080]   Take a look at this map here and there.
[00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.460]   Look at what they're trying to do.
[00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.740]   And for them, it's a show of power.
[00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.620]   And it reminds me of the Midianites.
[00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.540]   Here the Israelites are sitting there,
[00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.720]   hiding in their strongholds, hiding in their caves,
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.720]   and they are overrun by an enemy that's far larger to them.
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.020]   It is a show of power.
[00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.900]   We see this clearly here in Russia
[00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.780]   with these pictures here and there.
[00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.940]   It is Putin, their president,
[00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:16.740]   and that big table symbolizes how he perceives power,
[00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.500]   that there is a distance to how he sees power.
[00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.380]   And it shows that I am in charge
[00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.100]   and you have to submit to me.
[00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.380]   And when we look at this particular thing,
[00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:33.380]   God gave the Israelites into the hands of the Midianites.
[00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:34.640]   And why is that?
[00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:40.740]   Because God uses events in our lives to get our attention.
[00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:44.980]   There's sometimes in the midst of God calling us
[00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:49.200]   in our lives, we go in a misdirection, we get distracted.
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.740]   We start giving into our own personal agenda.
[00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:57.740]   We start doing the things we wanna do because it's my life.
[00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.740]   I've worked hard, it's my decision.
[00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.220]   No one could tell me what to do.
[00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.180]   I dictate, it's all about me.
[00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:06.340]   But when we become Christ followers,
[00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:08.100]   that rule is out the window.
[00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.860]   Our life is no longer ours.
[00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:15.300]   Our decisions are no longer ours.
[00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.860]   But we submitted to the gospel, we submitted to the cross.
[00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:22.180]   And along the way, God uses events in our life
[00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:25.180]   in order to get our attention, to bring us back to him.
[00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:29.100]   And we see this clearly when he gives them
[00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.700]   to the hands of the Midianites
[00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.140]   because they keep turning their life to the Lord.
[00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:37.220]   And sometimes in the midst of our life,
[00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:41.100]   God loves you so much.
[00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:44.100]   God loves and wants the best for you
[00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:49.100]   that he will use hard times and trials in your life
[00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:51.960]   to turn you over to him.
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:55.660]   All of us will deal with trials in our life.
[00:07:55.660 --> 00:08:00.100]   It is not a matter of if, but rather a matter of when
[00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:03.740]   that God uses those trials to turn our life.
[00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:07.460]   And for the Israelites, it had gotten to the point
[00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:09.860]   that they were so low because of Midian
[00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:15.660]   and the people of Israel cried out for help in the Lord.
[00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:18.780]   When the people of Israel cried out to the Lord
[00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:21.060]   on the count of the Midianites,
[00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:25.020]   the Lord sent a prophet to the people of Israel.
[00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:28.900]   And he said to them, "Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel.
[00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.100]   "I led you up from Egypt."
[00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:33.940]   This is what I did from you.
[00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:37.100]   "I brought you out of the house of bondage.
[00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:39.740]   "And I delivered you from the hands of the Egyptians
[00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:41.960]   "and from the hands who had oppressed you
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:46.960]   "and drove them out before you and gave you their land.
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:51.000]   "And I said to you, I am the Lord, your God.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.300]   "You shall not fear the gods of the Amorites
[00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.420]   "in whose land you dwell,
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:01.400]   "but you have not obeyed my voice."
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.760]   Here's a key one, verse 11.
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:04.840]   Pay attention to this one
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.640]   because I really want you to focus on this.
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:10.960]   "Now the angel of the Lord came and sat
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.560]   "under the terebinth at Opera,
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:17.860]   "which belonged to Joash the Abysserite,
[00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:21.640]   "while his son Gideon was beating out by impress
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.200]   "to hide it from the Midianites.
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:27.900]   "And the angel of the Lord appeared to him
[00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.800]   "and said to him, the Lord is with you.
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:34.720]   "Oh, mighty man of valor."
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:39.720]   If you have the NIV, it says mighty warrior.
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:43.440]   If you have a pen, if you highlight things in your Bible,
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:47.400]   you take this right away and you highlight it.
[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:50.680]   And you remember this verse because when you look at this
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:53.560]   and God calls him a mighty man of valor,
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:55.680]   already you're sitting there,
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.780]   wait, what in the world is this?
[00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:01.620]   That doesn't make any sense.
[00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:02.520]   Why is that?
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.160]   Let me show you something.
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.600]   Pastor Mark, let me just say this.
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.600]   You teach this class, right?
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.520]   All right, mighty warrior, look at this.
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:13.680]   When the angel of the Lord, NIV says mighty warrior.
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.220]   Take a look at this.
[00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:17.640]   Pastor Mark, you teach a class on archeology.
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.240]   He probably knows this a lot more.
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.160]   I've been to Israel once in my life,
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.500]   but it was through that experience,
[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.440]   I learned so much.
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.800]   So let me explain to you the situation
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.520]   that is happening, right?
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.760]   It is harvest time.
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.120]   And now when the wheat and grain
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.720]   and everything's ready to be harvested,
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.920]   you bring all of that, you use your sickle
[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:41.040]   and you cut out all of the wheat
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:46.040]   and you bring it to what they call as a threshing floor.
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:50.600]   As you could see, it is out in open air.
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.120]   It is usually on top of a hill.
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.840]   It's usually in an open area,
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:59.620]   in like a little hill area where the wind can blow
[00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:02.240]   and you lay everything out.
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.420]   If you look at the picture, you see some of the oxen
[00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:08.840]   or some people will use a little hammer called flail.
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.460]   And you're sitting there knocking
[00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:14.700]   or you have your oxen, your horses step all over it.
[00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:18.460]   At that point in time, it separates the husk
[00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:21.860]   as well as the grain and it just separates it.
[00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:23.140]   Then from that point on,
[00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:26.720]   you use what they call a windowing fork.
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.080]   It's a big rake.
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.520]   And you've seen pictures of this.
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:33.560]   You take it and you lift it up as high as you can.
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.280]   It's hard work.
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:38.900]   The chaff is blown from the wind and everything like that
[00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:41.340]   and it blows in the air.
[00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:44.820]   The husk, which is heavier, fall in one pile.
[00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:47.940]   The grain falls in another pile.
[00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:49.660]   And so as a result, you have to understand
[00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:54.300]   the threshing floor has to be out in the open air.
[00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:55.760]   But where is Gideon?
[00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:59.840]   Gideon is in a wine press.
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.280]   You're wondering, so what's wrong with that?
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:06.140]   Let me show you a picture of what the wine press looks like.
[00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:07.620]   This is the wine press.
[00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:10.540]   I get to the Garden of Gethsemane, right?
[00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:13.540]   And it's a garden, no, it is a tomb.
[00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:14.740]   The tomb where Jesus is buried.
[00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:18.860]   And there right in front is this wine press.
[00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:21.380]   And I didn't understand what a wine press is
[00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:23.860]   until I saw this picture.
[00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:28.700]   And the story of Gideon made so much sense.
[00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:30.600]   Here's what happens in the wine press.
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:36.660]   Right there on the top, they lay out all of the grapes.
[00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:38.700]   From that point on, you see that hole
[00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:40.580]   that leads all the way to the bottom.
[00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:43.420]   And that path then leads to another hole,
[00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:47.060]   which there's a bunch of jars or what they called cisterns.
[00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:50.900]   Once you lay out all the grapes, it's about waist high.
[00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:52.780]   Mark, I hope you're gonna have to correct me
[00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:54.740]   and let me know if I'm wrong later on.
[00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:56.860]   And from that point, you lay out all the grapes
[00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:58.380]   and you step on it.
[00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:01.460]   I've seen pictures where there's a contraption on top
[00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:02.300]   and you hold onto it,
[00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:05.860]   and you just keep stepping on all of the grapes.
[00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:08.660]   And then eventually all of the juice flows
[00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:13.420]   from down that corridor and into what they call a cistern.
[00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:16.480]   And so what's the picture of this?
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.340]   It is this.
[00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:22.300]   The angel of the Lord calls him a mighty warrior.
[00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:26.900]   He is not a mighty warrior.
[00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:29.180]   Because when you read this passage, you're sitting there,
[00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:34.180]   Lord, are you sure you have the right picture correct?
[00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:38.460]   Do you not know where Gideon is?
[00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:43.460]   He's threshing wheat, not on the threshing floor,
[00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:45.700]   but in the wine press.
[00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:49.460]   And you know why he's in the wine press?
[00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:51.480]   Because he's afraid.
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:54.300]   Because he's a coward.
[00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.620]   Because he's running away from the Midianites
[00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:58.620]   so that no one sees him.
[00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:03.820]   Are you sure you have the right person, Lord?
[00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:07.580]   Mighty warrior?
[00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:10.560]   Mighty man of valor?
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.440]   I'm seeing a coward here.
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.660]   And why is that?
[00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:19.660]   God's picture of me is different than the picture
[00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:24.660]   I have of myself or that others have of me.
[00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:28.600]   God's picture of me is different than the picture
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:31.320]   that sometimes I have of myself
[00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:34.680]   or the picture that I have, that others have of me.
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:36.640]   Let me give you an example of what I mean by this.
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:39.940]   All of you guys have probably watched this movie, right?
[00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:42.560]   All of us are familiar, Avengers Endgame,
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:45.040]   and we're sitting there and they go meet Thor
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:48.000]   and we're expecting the God of Thunder,
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.640]   the one that we were familiar with all of the movies
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.000]   coming out and what do we see?
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.160]   Fat Thor playing video games.
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.760]   And you're sitting there, what in the world happened?
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:01.600]   Because he had given up hope.
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.080]   He was done.
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:09.840]   But something saw Thor as the adventure that he was,
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:12.440]   the hero that he was.
[00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:15.520]   Because deep inside, and you saw that encounter
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:18.620]   with his mother, there was a hero,
[00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:20.760]   despite a person who gave up hope.
[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:26.260]   Sometimes we do feel like a fat Thor.
[00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.280]   Sometimes we are scared.
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:33.320]   Sometimes how we perceive ourselves
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:35.840]   is different than how others perceive us.
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:39.160]   Sometimes how others perceive us is different
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.240]   than how God perceives us.
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:44.020]   For us, we see fat Thor.
[00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:48.080]   God sees a mighty man of valor.
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:52.600]   God sees in Gideon, not someone who's scared,
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:54.520]   not someone who's a coward,
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:57.000]   not someone who's trying to escape.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.800]   What he sees in Gideon is a mighty warrior,
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.640]   the one who's gonna lead his people there,
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:08.560]   the one who's gonna battle against him.
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:10.320]   Let's keep going on.
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:13.880]   And so he calls them, and here's the next part that I love.
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:16.680]   And the angel of the Lord appeared to him and says to him,
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:19.400]   Lord is with you, almighty man of valor.
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:22.160]   And Gideon said to him, please serve.
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.040]   If the Lord is with us,
[00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:27.240]   then why then has all of this happened to us?
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:31.000]   And where are all his wonderful deeds
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.800]   that our fathers recounted to us saying,
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:37.000]   did not the Lord bring us up out of Egypt?
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.640]   But now the Lord has forsaken us
[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:42.160]   and given us into the hands of Midian.
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:47.120]   Underline this one as well too, verse 14.
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:50.440]   And the Lord turned to him and said,
[00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:53.480]   go in this might of yours,
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:57.480]   and Gideon, I want you to save Israel
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.600]   from the hand of Midian.
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:02.320]   Do not I send you.
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:07.120]   And he said to him, please, Lord, how can I save Israel?
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:10.120]   But behold, my clan is the weakest in man's sight.
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:14.360]   So out of all the clans, Lord, my clan is the weakest.
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:18.720]   And I am the least in my father's house.
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:21.360]   So pretty much what you're telling me, Gideon,
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:26.360]   is out of all the clans, your clan is the weakest,
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:29.600]   and you're the weakest one in your clan.
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.640]   That's what you're telling me, right?
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:34.360]   So you know where that makes Gideon?
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:36.440]   Dead last.
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:40.440]   He's the weakest person in the weakest clan.
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:41.280]   Not very good.
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:45.000]   And you're using him to lead the charge
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.600]   to battle the Midianites.
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:51.080]   Powerful statement, next thing.
[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:56.080]   And the Lord said to him, but I will be with you.
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:18:01.020]   And you shall strike the Midianites as one man.
[00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:06.020]   And he said to him, if now I have found favor in your eyes,
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:09.360]   oh wait, and I am the least in my father's house,
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:12.680]   and the Lord said to him, but I will be with you,
[00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:17.160]   and you shall strike the Midianites as one man.
[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:19.120]   So what the Lord is saying is,
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:22.960]   he comes to him and he says, okay, I am the weakest clan,
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:25.200]   and I am the weakest in the weakest clan.
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.920]   And you know what the Lord says to him?
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:31.280]   He doesn't disagree with him.
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:34.760]   He doesn't tell him, you know,
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:36.600]   no, you're not the weakest clan.
[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:38.680]   So-and-so is weaker than you.
[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:39.840]   Here's what you have.
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:42.000]   Well, your clan's not the weakest clan.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.720]   Your clan's pretty good.
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:48.720]   No, he doesn't disagree with him.
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:52.100]   In fact, he actually kind of agrees with him.
[00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:54.280]   It's like you and I are saying, right?
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:56.660]   A lot of times is we talk, you guys talked last week
[00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:59.760]   about what it means to give God our time and our treasures.
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.480]   It's like when you and I are sitting there,
[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:03.800]   Lord, I'm not sure if I could serve you
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:06.720]   because I'm not smart enough.
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:08.760]   That sometimes is our excuse.
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:11.880]   I'm not talented enough, right?
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:14.320]   I'm not as strong as that particular person.
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.360]   I can't be as charismatic.
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:18.840]   I'm not very good in public like that.
[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:20.300]   I'm very shy.
[00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:24.480]   And it's, God is saying, I know.
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:27.720]   I'm not disagreeing with you, I know.
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:31.200]   I know you're probably not the smartest person in the room.
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:33.480]   I know probably you're not the most talented person
[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:34.320]   in the room.
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:38.400]   I know so-and-so probably is better up front than you.
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.320]   I know you're probably shy.
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:41.400]   I know.
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:42.240]   I know all these things.
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:43.800]   You know why?
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:44.960]   Because I created you.
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:51.120]   And when I created you, I gave you those skills.
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:53.960]   And when I created you, I made you different.
[00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:56.080]   I made you unique.
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:57.640]   I know.
[00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:59.960]   Get in, I know you're the weakest clan.
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.880]   I know you're the weakest of the weakest clan.
[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:04.040]   I know all these things because I put you there.
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.280]   Because when you were born, before you were born,
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:10.080]   before any of us were born, I designed you
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:12.080]   and I mapped out your life.
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:15.400]   I know exactly what you're capable of.
[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:17.440]   But here's the thing, and underline this,
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:20.520]   but I will be with you.
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:22.400]   And that's the difference.
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:24.240]   I want you to do that.
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:27.320]   I know what your deficiencies are.
[00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:31.200]   But when I call you, I will be with you.
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:33.680]   And that becomes the key.
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:37.000]   It won't be easy.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   It's not gonna be always very fun to obey my will.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.080]   It's not always gonna be smooth sailing all the time.
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:52.240]   But I see you differently than how you see yourself
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:54.280]   and how others see you.
[00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:57.840]   I see you as a mighty man of valor, a mighty warrior.
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.640]   And I'm calling you to fight the Midianites.
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:03.240]   And I realize you're the weakest clan.
[00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:06.160]   I realize you're the weakest in your weakest clan,
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:09.840]   but I will be with you.
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:14.400]   And that's where all of us needs to stop and think,
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:18.080]   what does God want you to do in your life?
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:21.520]   And what is holding you back?
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:24.360]   Because all of us have insecurities.
[00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:26.160]   All of us have struggles.
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:28.040]   All of us have doubts.
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:31.400]   But what is God saying to us?
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:34.480]   And how do we begin to walk confidently?
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:38.160]   Knowing it may not be easy, but walk confidently
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:40.960]   because that's what God has called him.
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:44.280]   Which leads us to the next portion, all right?
[00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:46.120]   Next portion is this.
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:48.320]   And so later that night,
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:53.840]   he calls him and let's go over to verse 25.
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:55.720]   That night he prepares,
[00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:58.600]   and here's the, I think the most important part of it.
[00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:00.920]   That night the Lord said to him,
[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:04.120]   "I want you Gideon to take your father's bull
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:07.440]   and the second bull seven years old.
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:11.200]   And I want you to pull down the altar of bow
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.160]   that your father has
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:17.280]   and cut down the Asherah pole that is beside it.
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:22.200]   And I want you to build an altar to the Lord your God
[00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:25.400]   on the top of the stronghold here."
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:28.560]   And here's what it looks like with the Asherah pole.
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:30.320]   Asherah pole.
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:31.760]   And so what God is saying to this,
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:36.000]   "Lord Gideon, I see you threshing wheat in the wine press.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.360]   I want you to fight the Midianites.
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:39.400]   I want you to lead the charge.
[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:44.400]   But before you do, before I send you to battle,
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:47.400]   I need you to tear down that altar.
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:52.000]   I need you to put the proper altar in its place.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.440]   I need you to tear down that altar.
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:55.680]   I need to build a proper altar
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:58.120]   that honors the Lord in all that you do."
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:00.880]   That's what I want you to do before you go out to battle.
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:04.480]   If you were to apply it in our context today,
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:06.640]   I have a calling for you.
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:09.840]   I want you to do something.
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.000]   But before you do,
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   we're gonna have to do some business in your life.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.240]   I'm gonna need you to tear down some of the altars
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:21.160]   in our life, specifically in our hearts.
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:26.680]   And I'm gonna need you to put the proper altar in its place.
[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:29.560]   I'm gonna need you to make sure that things are right.
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:32.000]   A lot of times within the altar is within our hearts.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   There is no big altar that we have
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.960]   that we all go to like we have with the temple.
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:38.200]   That altar is in the life.
[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:41.240]   God establishes that altar in our life.
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:44.120]   And I have a plan for you.
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:50.440]   I need you to establish the proper altar in its place.
[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:52.040]   What do I mean about that?
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.440]   I love the fact that God has a plan for us.
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:04.120]   But frankly speaking, all of us struggles with heart issues.
[00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:06.080]   And I probably was shared a little bit
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:07.320]   about this in the past.
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:12.520]   All of us have heart issues in our life.
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:17.360]   All of us struggle with skeletons in our closet.
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:19.400]   The majority of the group here are Chinese.
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:22.720]   I see our two Caucasian friends in here.
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:25.640]   And I find that Caucasians are very vulnerable
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:26.480]   in their life.
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:30.400]   Asians tend to be very private for the majority,
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:32.200]   especially if you're older, you're very private.
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:35.440]   You don't let people hear, you don't show vulnerability.
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:38.920]   I find our Caucasian friends are more so vulnerable.
[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:41.840]   And we like things and we wanna have this appearance
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:42.680]   that we have.
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:47.480]   And so we live with what we call a shadow mission.
[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:51.120]   That our shadow and how we live our life
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:53.120]   are two separate things.
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:57.200]   Our shadow reflects who we truly are.
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:00.480]   But on the outside, we try to pretend
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:02.320]   like we're someone different.
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:06.160]   We try to show people the persona or personality
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:09.240]   we want them to see, which is so different
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:11.440]   than what we struggle on the inside.
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:15.080]   Some of the four or five basic heart issues
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:16.840]   that some of us have.
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:20.200]   Before God could use you,
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:24.120]   he wants you to deal with some of these issues in your life.
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:27.920]   That some of you are sitting here right now
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:31.280]   and you're dealing with the issue of guilt.
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:33.600]   That there are things in your life
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:36.960]   that nobody knows that you've done.
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:39.000]   And only you know.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.840]   You've hidden it pretty well from different people.
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:46.320]   Maybe a thought, maybe something you've done,
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:49.200]   something it is and it bothers you.
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:53.000]   God wants you to learn to deal with that guilt.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.120]   He wants you to learn the power of confessing your sin.
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:01.240]   The power of allowing him to take away that guilt
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:05.160]   that is eating up your life all the time.
[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:07.560]   For some, it's the power of anger.
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:13.080]   There is anger that you have because of a parent,
[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:16.240]   a sibling, a friend, something that happened
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:19.240]   at work, you got bypassed for a job, whatever it is.
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:21.400]   You feel like you got a short end of the stick,
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:24.600]   whatever it is, you're dealing with that anger.
[00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:27.840]   Maybe greed.
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:29.840]   Maybe it's greed that you're dealing with.
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:31.040]   It's all about me.
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:34.760]   I need my money, I want to be successful.
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:37.600]   I want to have lots of money, I want that Tesla.
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:40.720]   I want that home, I want that, maybe it's greed.
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:44.360]   I want my crypto to grow huge.
[00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:46.760]   And then once I get so much money,
[00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:50.440]   God, I'll come and satisfy you because I need to work life,
[00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:52.400]   I need to provide for my family.
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:54.960]   It's that greed that over, and when you're sitting there
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:58.040]   listening to sermons about giving of God
[00:26:58.040 --> 00:26:59.880]   or your story, you're sitting there, yeah, I'll do it,
[00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:02.440]   but I got to make sure I take care of myself first.
[00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:08.080]   Guilt, anger, greed, maybe it's jealousy.
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:12.640]   Why does so-and-so always get the benefit of doubt?
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:14.800]   (thuds)
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:18.080]   Why does so-and-so always seem to get
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:20.680]   the great opportunities and work?
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:23.240]   Why does so-and-so get this,
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:25.400]   or why does my sibling get this and that?
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:27.400]   Maybe it's jealousy.
[00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:29.560]   And you're struggling with that because you're sitting there,
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:31.920]   why do I get the short end of the stick?
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:34.240]   Or maybe it's judgment.
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:40.240]   Judgment of how you perceive people of different color,
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:44.520]   how you perceive different people that you struggle with,
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:47.480]   judgment toward other people that you see in your family,
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:48.880]   whatever it is.
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:51.620]   Which one is it?
[00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:54.400]   All of us struggle at one point with each one of these.
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:58.080]   For me in my life, I've watched this destroy my family
[00:27:58.080 --> 00:27:59.720]   in a great deal.
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:02.880]   I have a twin brother and I have a younger sister.
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:05.880]   I see my twin brother a lot, he lives in Phoenix, Arizona
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:10.220]   with his three kids and Sarah, his wife.
[00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:13.440]   My younger sister is two years younger than me.
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:16.320]   I haven't seen her in 15 years.
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:19.760]   She stopped calling our home 15 years ago.
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:24.040]   She got into it with my mom 15 years ago.
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:28.080]   And that anger between her and my mom never subsided.
[00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:30.800]   She walked away from home, never to come back.
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:33.080]   I haven't seen her in any Christmas gatherings,
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:34.560]   any holiday gatherings.
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:37.380]   When my two daughters were born, never got a note.
[00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:40.680]   When I was sick in bed with cancer, never heard from her.
[00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:43.520]   Because she can't let that anger go away.
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:44.900]   Because why?
[00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:47.040]   My mom deals with that anger.
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:51.080]   My mom growing up as a hardworking Chinese immigrant
[00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:55.520]   in 1972 came from China and when she came in here,
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:58.440]   she had nothing and she had to start all over.
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:02.960]   And there was so much anger and resentment that she had
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:06.320]   that she never can let go of that anger.
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:10.460]   And that anger, she took it out on us as kids growing up.
[00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:13.240]   She was always hard on us.
[00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:15.600]   It was never enough.
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:18.960]   That A that we got, you better make it A plus.
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:21.700]   That B you got, you're grounded.
[00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:24.580]   That belt or that hanger, pick one.
[00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:26.920]   We always had to do that.
[00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:30.840]   The anger and my sister was never able to let it go.
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:32.700]   I deal with that anger as well too.
[00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:35.520]   I struggle with that anger.
[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:38.560]   I could fool you people easily.
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:40.600]   I'm 44 years old.
[00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:42.700]   I look decently well.
[00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:47.360]   I dress nice, I have a successful career.
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:50.320]   But inwardly, I struggle with that anger.
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:55.100]   I grew up and we are in church here in the Bridgeport area
[00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:58.160]   where a lot of times there's a lot of diversity.
[00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:00.480]   I came here, I was born in '77,
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:02.840]   came to Chinatown and Bridgeport.
[00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:04.740]   And in my school at Robert Healy,
[00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:09.400]   I was probably one of only five Chinese kids in that school.
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:12.120]   For years, I was chased after,
[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:14.800]   I remember there was some Caucasian kids
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:17.800]   that would chase us down the block all the time.
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:20.120]   They would just beat us up all the time.
[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:22.520]   Everywhere I go and every street I turn,
[00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:24.360]   I still remember when I was in fourth grade,
[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:25.280]   there was this eighth grader
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:27.600]   who just wanted to pick on us all the time.
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:29.840]   I went to one street, he found the stair.
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:32.800]   Went to another street, found the stair.
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:35.960]   It was rough when you're the only Chinese kid
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:37.380]   in the community.
[00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:39.160]   I still remember there was just one guy
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:41.500]   who would ride on his bike
[00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:44.900]   and just pick on all the Chinese kids in the community.
[00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:46.540]   I grew up a little chubby,
[00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:49.460]   I grew up not always being very smart.
[00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:52.600]   And I heard the conversations, my sister was brilliant.
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:56.740]   Perfect SAT, perfect ACT, perfect grades,
[00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:58.180]   straight A's, never got a B,
[00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:00.500]   went to Yale, got perfect score there.
[00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:02.780]   I struggled with school.
[00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:05.740]   I had to work hard for my school.
[00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:06.980]   And I always heard people say,
[00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:09.940]   "Hey, you're not as smart as your older brother.
[00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:12.820]   "You're not as smart as your younger brother."
[00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:14.780]   And I was made fun of at school
[00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:18.200]   because I was kind of chubby at that point in time.
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:21.580]   And that made me live with self-esteem issues,
[00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:24.660]   which eventually became anger.
[00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:27.100]   And I always lived with that anger
[00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:29.980]   where I wanted to prove people wrong.
[00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:32.620]   I wanted to stick it to them
[00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:35.460]   and show them and do things.
[00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:37.760]   As I grew in my faith,
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:40.720]   I had to come before the Lord and say,
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:43.360]   "Lord, where's my heart?
[00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:49.060]   "Lord, what do I need to do to lay it before the cross?
[00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:53.180]   "Lord, what does it mean to have my heart come before you?"
[00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:57.140]   I had to learn slowly and slowly to lay it down.
[00:31:57.140 --> 00:32:01.880]   Every day in my life, I still remember all the voices,
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:03.460]   all the people who said I couldn't do it.
[00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:06.140]   I still remember their faces.
[00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:07.820]   That's still there.
[00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:10.380]   But it's a choice I have to make every single day to say,
[00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:13.560]   "Lord, give me the strength to do what is right.
[00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:16.640]   "Allow my heart to continue to honor you
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:18.140]   "in everything I do."
[00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:22.300]   Because God wants you to tear down that altar
[00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:27.180]   and put the proper altar in its place.
[00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:31.440]   God's picture of you is different
[00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:34.040]   than the picture you have of yourself
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:36.940]   and that others have of you.
[00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:39.480]   God's picture of you is different.
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:43.760]   He sees in Gideon a mighty man of valor, a mighty warrior.
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:47.200]   What does he see in you compared to what you see in yourself?
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:50.600]   Go in the strength that you have,
[00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:51.440]   whatever you are,
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:53.920]   because I designed you with your strengths
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:56.560]   and your weaknesses.
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:58.260]   Go in the strength that you have,
[00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:02.580]   and I will be with you.
[00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:03.800]   I'm gonna be with you.
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:05.560]   May not be easy, may not go smoothly,
[00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:07.260]   but I'm gonna be with you.
[00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:08.600]   But before you do,
[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:12.400]   put the proper altar in its place.
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:14.240]   Tear down the altar
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:19.560]   and put the proper altar in its place.
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:24.560]   God uses ordinary people to do his extraordinary work.
[00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:30.480]   God uses ordinary people to do his extraordinary work.
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:33.820]   Let's pray.
[00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:36.360]   Father, thank you for this church.
[00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:37.840]   Thank you for the people who are sitting here.
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:39.720]   Thank you for the people who are watching online,
[00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:41.920]   wherever they are in the world.
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:46.600]   Allow us to hear you, Father.
[00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:47.960]   Allow us to walk with you.
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:50.960]   Allow us to continue to understand the vision
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:51.800]   that you have for us,
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:53.840]   to listen, to hear the vision,
[00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:56.040]   and continue to follow you,
[00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:58.420]   to understand that you have a calling.
[00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:03.120]   Despite our inefficiencies, despite our baggage,
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:04.920]   you are there with us.
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:07.520]   But more so, Lord, I pray for our heart issues
[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:09.720]   that with people here in this room.
[00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:11.400]   We pray with some of them who are struggling
[00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:16.400]   with the guilt or the anger or the jealousy or the greed,
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:20.400]   I pray that you would do surgery in their lives.
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:22.360]   And allow us as we wrestle with those
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:24.800]   to have the courage, the strong strength from you
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:28.800]   to follow after you.
