[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Good morning family. Today, after a few months in Matthew chapter five,
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.440]   we are finishing out this chapter. Now it's not the end of the sermon on the
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.760]   mount. There's two more chapters of this sermon to go.
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.000]   And so we're going to continue on with looking at the kingdom values that are
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.600]   found in this sermon. But we're closing out this chapter today.
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.040]   And Jesus closes out this chapter with this amazing statement that he makes.
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.400]   So we're going to look at in Matthew chapter five, verse 48.
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.600]   It says this,
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.760]   you therefore must be perfect as your heavenly father is perfect.
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.440]   Okay, so wait just a minute here. I want to make sure we read this right.
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.120]   It sounds like this verse is saying that we're supposed to be perfect.
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.200]   Like God is perfect. We're supposed to imitate God in holiness.
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.120]   We can look at it again and that's pretty much exactly what it says.
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.600]   You therefore must be perfect as your heavenly father is perfect.
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.080]   Now what is going on here? This is an impossible command.
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.960]   This is an impossible ask. This is an impossible request.
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.720]   So what is Jesus saying in this verse?
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.840]   I want us to dig into this passage today and examine what Jesus is saying to us
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.360]   when he calls us to be perfect in the way that God is perfect.
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.880]   First of all,
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.880]   this word for perfect in Greek is a word that means complete and lacking nothing
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.960]   or in need of nothing and it could also mean mature,
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.120]   but it also does mean perfect. So when we read it, we could say, well,
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.120]   maybe God's just calling us to be mature.
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.280]   Maybe God's just calling us to be complete,
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.520]   totally equipped to serve him and follow him. Yeah, that's a part of it.
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.400]   That's there, but we can't escape the straightforward reading of this verse.
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.400]   It says we're supposed to be lighting holy lives and that is a really,
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.960]   really challenging statement for us.
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.760]   And as we look at the passage that surrounds it,
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.160]   we see that it gets even more challenging.
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.280]   Remember when we read verse 20 it says, for I tell you,
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.800]   unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees,
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.560]   you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.880]   That was the beginning of this section where Jesus talks about the old Testament
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.040]   law and our relationship to it. And in all these ways,
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.000]   when Jesus talks about our anger, when Jesus talks about our lust,
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.960]   when he talks about how we break our promises,
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.640]   when he talks about how we retaliate and take revenge on one another and all of
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.600]   these things that Jesus has listed for us in this section,
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.760]   he's demonstrated how we fall so short,
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.160]   how our righteousness is so short of God's standard.
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.680]   It certainly doesn't exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.720]   And those two statements,
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.720]   verse 20 and verse 48 that we read this morning kind of bracket this section.
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.680]   Jesus starts the section by saying, listen,
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.240]   if you think you want to be good enough to please God,
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.840]   then your righteousness has to exceed the righteousness of the scribes and
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.800]   Pharisees. As we talked about before,
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.400]   he's basically saying your righteousness has to exceed an external conformance.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.360]   It has to be more than something superficial.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.280]   It has to be more than something that is just outward and just for other people
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.360]   to see. It has to be something real.
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.160]   And then he closes out this section with verse 48,
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.480]   the last verse of chapter five where he says,
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.600]   you therefore must be perfect as your heavenly father is perfect.
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.520]   So Jesus is setting the bar impossibly high for us.
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.280]   He's setting the standard impossibly high for us,
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.800]   but he's doing that to help us see how much we need God's work in our life and
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:38.040]   to help us see that this is impossible without God's work in our heart and in
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.000]   our lives. Notice in this verse,
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.360]   Jesus doesn't call us to just be a little bit better than other people.
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.600]   Look at verse 47 and verse 46. He says,
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.760]   for if you love those who love you, what reward do you have?
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.560]   Do not even the tax collectors do the same? And if you greet only your brothers,
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.240]   what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same.
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.120]   Jesus isn't saying, Hey guys,
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.360]   if you can just do a little better than the tax collectors,
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.280]   if you can just do a little better than the Gentiles,
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.480]   if you can just do a little better than the people who don't know God and the
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.200]   people who don't love God, if you could just do a little better than them,
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.720]   then you're doing great. No, he says,
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.640]   I want you to be perfect in the way that God is perfect.
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.640]   That's the standard. Jesus also doesn't say, Hey,
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.200]   I just want you to be a little bit better than you were last week.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.160]   I want you to just improve a little bit and just become a little bit better than
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.480]   you were. If you can do a little bit better job than you were last week,
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.040]   then that's what I want from you as a, as a subject of the kingdom,
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.800]   as a disciple, as a, as a follower of Jesus,
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.360]   just be a little bit better than you were.
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.160]   But Jesus doesn't give us that either. Jesus says, no,
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.240]   I want you to be like God. I want you to be like me.
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.960]   I want you to live out the values of the kingdom and I want you to live them out
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.640]   in every area of your life. That's what Jesus calls us to.
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.040]   Now that's something that we cannot do. It's impossible.
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.600]   And the fact that it's impossible and the fact that Jesus calls us to it,
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.200]   even though it is impossible points to what Jesus wants for our lives.
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.680]   See, Jesus doesn't just want to improve us.
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.640]   He wants to live through us.
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.880]   And that's a central truth of Christianity.
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.040]   That's a central value of the kingdom.
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.800]   It's a central reality of following Jesus is that Jesus doesn't just want to
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.400]   improve us. He wants to live through us.
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.160]   A lot of times we get this wrong idea about our faith,
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.960]   about being a Christian and about the Bible.
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.200]   And we think that the Bible is kind of like a self help manual and it's a self
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.160]   improvement book and it's there to help us be a little bit better version of
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.480]   ourselves. It's there to turn us into me 2.0.
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.720]   That's a little bit better than I was last week or last year, whatever.
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.720]   Well, there's a little bit of truth in that. Yes,
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.640]   God is working in our life over time. Yes, it's a gradual process. Yes,
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:01.280]   we grow in small steps. And so it's a week at a time. It's a day at a time.
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.960]   It's a year at a time. Yes, that's true.
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.640]   But the reality is Jesus teaches us clearly in the scripture.
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.480]   He doesn't want us to be me 2.0.
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.560]   He doesn't want us to be a slightly improved version of ourselves.
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.480]   That's not what he's trying to grow us towards.
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:20.520]   He is trying to grow us towards his life in us.
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.320]   He wants us to go away.
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:27.200]   He wants us to disappear and he wants to live his life through us.
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:33.200]   In Matthew chapter 16 verses 24 and 25 it says this,
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.800]   then Jesus told his disciples, if anyone would come after me,
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.400]   let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.200]   For whoever would save his life will lose it.
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.440]   But whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.440]   And when we hear the word cross, we think of Jesus's death on the cross.
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.800]   And we think of something beautiful. We think of our redemption.
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.920]   But when Jesus said this to the disciples, the cross had not yet happened.
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.120]   So they didn't think of redemption. When they heard the word cross,
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.400]   they thought of what it meant to them.
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.400]   And to them it was an instrument of torture and death.
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:06.000]   They had seen people crucified by the Romans. They knew what the cross meant.
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.200]   And so when Jesus said, take up your cross to them,
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.080]   they understood that he was saying, listen,
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.960]   I want for your life to disappear.
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:19.200]   I want for those natural things, those sinful things,
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:24.200]   all those old pieces of you to die and to be gone so that I can live through you.
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:29.840]   That's what Jesus is calling us to. He doesn't just want to improve us.
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:34.160]   He wants to live through us. He wants all that old sinful stuff,
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:39.160]   everything from verse 20 down to verse 48 that Jesus called out in our lives,
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:44.360]   the anger, the hatred, the lying, the broken promises,
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:49.000]   the lust, the retribution and revenge, and the way we treat other people.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.760]   All of that. Jesus is calling all that stuff out and he says, Hey,
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.840]   I want that stuff to be gone. I want that stuff to die.
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.880]   I want it to encounter the cross,
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:01.440]   to encounter the instrument of death so that I can begin to live through you in
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:05.760]   the place of all your selfishness and all your sin and all your brokenness and
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:06.760]   all the ugly stuff,
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:10.240]   all the ways that you hurt one another and all the ways that you reject God.
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:13.880]   I want those things to be gone so that I can live through you.
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:17.840]   And that's what Jesus is pointing us to in this passage.
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:22.840]   He's helping us to see that our righteousness has to exceed this righteousness
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:27.840]   of the scribes and Pharisees and that he wants us to live and in a way that is
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.520]   imitating God, that is imitating Christ.
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:35.280]   It's not enough just to try to do a little bit better.
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.040]   It's not enough just to try to be better than someone else.
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:42.880]   Jesus wants us to completely disappear and he wants to live through us.
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:48.200]   God wants to see less and less of me every day and more and more of Jesus every
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:52.560]   day. And in your life, God wants to see less and less of you every day.
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.280]   Less and less of your pride. Less and less of your selfishness,
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:58.000]   less and less of your anger, less and less of your lust.
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:01.840]   And he wants to see more and more of Jesus in your life every day.
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:05.360]   More of Jesus's love, more of Jesus's care for others,
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:09.240]   more of Jesus's selflessness in your life,
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.920]   more of Jesus's self sacrificing love.
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.920]   That's what God wants in my life and in your life.
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:18.120]   Now, how does that happen?
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:22.920]   If we say, okay, that's what Jesus is telling us in this passage.
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.800]   How does that happen? When we see this standard,
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.960]   when Jesus sets the standard impossibly high,
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.720]   there's a few ways that we can react to it.
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:34.440]   One is to go to a place of despair and say,
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.840]   I can't meet that standard. I'm a bad person.
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.920]   I'm a failure and I'm just going to live in despair.
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.600]   That's not what God has for us.
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:45.080]   Jesus doesn't put the standard out there to make us feel bad and to discourage
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.760]   us and to put us in a place of despair.
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:50.400]   The other thing that we often do,
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:54.160]   and this is what Jesus actually talks about in Matthew chapter six,
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.800]   this is the last verse of chapter five.
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:59.120]   But when we start talking about chapter six, next week, we'll see this.
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:02.520]   Jesus begins chapter six by talking about hypocrisy.
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:05.840]   And that's the other response. When we see how high the standard is,
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.520]   sometimes we respond by saying, well,
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.840]   I'm going to go ahead and pretend that I meet the standard, even though I don't,
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:15.480]   I'm going to try to just do my best and act like I do and tell other people that
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:18.400]   I do. And when we do that, we become a hypocrite.
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.520]   We start acting like we're something we're not.
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:25.280]   We start acting like we're, we're perfect and we never could be perfect.
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.200]   That's hypocrisy.
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:32.960]   But the way Jesus wants us to respond to this is through surrender to him,
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:35.960]   through saying, God, I can't live this out.
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:39.280]   I can't exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees. God,
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:43.400]   there's certainly no way I can be perfect as my heavenly father is perfect.
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:48.200]   I cannot do this. And so I'm going to let myself disappear.
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:51.120]   I'm going to take all those old, selfish,
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:56.360]   sinful parts of me to the cross and let them die there and surrender to Jesus so
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:00.080]   that he can live through me.
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:03.760]   And surrender is a choice.
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:09.200]   I said that last week that nothing changes until you make a choice and we have
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.040]   to choose to surrender. We have to choose to say, God,
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:15.880]   I'm going to stop trying. I'm going to stop saying,
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.560]   maybe if I just try a little bit harder,
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:20.160]   maybe if I just figure out a few more things about the Bible,
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:25.120]   maybe if I just wrap my head around it or maybe if I just try to be a better
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:29.840]   person or maybe if I just work harder at hiding my sin from other people.
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:30.640]   No.
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:35.640]   When we stop all of that stuff and say, I'm going to surrender to you.
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.760]   God, I can't do this.
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:41.960]   I'm asking you to come and to live through me and to do this in my life.
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:46.160]   I really can't think of a better way to express what this surrender looks like
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:49.400]   than the words of Jesus in another sermon that he gave.
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.560]   And this is in the book of John in chapter 15.
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:56.600]   Jesus is talking about abiding in him,
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:00.920]   surrendering to him, giving up so that he lives through us.
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:04.600]   And he's talking about the peace and the rest and the joy that we find in that.
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:08.160]   So I'm going to read this. This is John chapter 15 verses one to 11.
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:12.960]   Jesus says, I am the true vine and my father is the vine dresser.
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:16.720]   Every branch in me that does not bear fruit, he takes away.
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:21.080]   And every branch that does bear fruit, he prunes that it may bear more fruits.
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:24.680]   Already you are clean because of the word that I have spoken.
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:29.680]   You abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit by itself unless it
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:34.920]   abides in the vine. Neither can you, unless you abide in me. I am the vine.
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:38.440]   You are the branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him,
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:42.520]   he it is that bears much fruit for apart from me, you can do nothing.
[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.880]   If anyone does not abide in me,
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:48.480]   he is thrown away like a branch and withers and the branches are gathered,
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:53.240]   thrown into the fire and burned. If you abide in me and my words abide in you,
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:56.560]   ask whatever you wish and it will be done for you. By this,
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:00.920]   my father is glorified that you bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples.
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:05.720]   As the father has loved me, so have I loved you abide in my love.
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.440]   If you keep my commandments,
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:10.760]   you will abide in my love just as I have kept my father's commandments and abide
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:15.320]   in his love. These things I have spoken to you that my joy may be in you and that
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:16.800]   your joy may be full.
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:22.480]   What a beautiful description of what it looks like to surrender to Jesus.
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:25.920]   And Jesus is clear here in verses three and four. He's talking to his followers.
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:29.040]   He's talking to his disciples. He's talking to the people of God,
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:32.200]   the subjects of the kingdom, those who already have relationship with him.
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:35.440]   He's talking to you and me. We see that in verse three. He says,
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.280]   already you are clean because of the word that I have spoken to you.
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:41.680]   He's talking to those of us who already know Jesus. We've already been cleansed.
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.440]   We've had our sins forgiven. And then in verse four, he says,
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:48.200]   abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit by itself unless it
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:51.960]   abides in the vine. Neither can you, unless you abide in me. I am the vine.
[00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:56.680]   You are the branches. Jesus is saying he's the main stock.
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:00.320]   He's the roots and the stock of the tree. And we're just the branches.
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:04.360]   We can't do it on our own. He says that in the passage, apart from him,
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:07.920]   we can do nothing. But if we will surrender to him,
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:10.040]   and let him live through us,
[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:13.000]   then beautiful things will start to happen in our lives.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.720]   Beautiful fruit will start to come. And that's what Jesus is calling us to.
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:22.160]   He says that if we're abiding in him, then we will keep his commandments.
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:26.920]   We will do what he has for us. So maybe you say, okay, what does that look like?
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:31.920]   If I believe that I can't be perfect, that's my heavenly father is perfect,
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:35.120]   that I have to surrender to Jesus in order to do that,
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:38.880]   that I have to start to disappear, that he has to start to live through me.
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:42.360]   But what does that look like? How do I even do that? Well,
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:45.680]   the first step is to pray, to talk to God and say, God,
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:50.040]   I want to turn it over to you. I want to surrender to you.
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:54.840]   I know I can't do it. I need you in my life. Please take control.
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:59.360]   Please begin to live through me. Please begin to bring about fruit in my life.
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:02.520]   That's the first step is just to, to ask and to,
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:04.720]   to confess your surrender to God.
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:09.400]   But then what does it look like in the day to day of our lives? Well,
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:13.240]   it begins to look like surrendering to these values of the kingdom that we've
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:16.280]   been talking about over the last few months. Instead of saying,
[00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:19.240]   I'm going to live out my life according to my own values.
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:22.000]   I'm going to live out my life in the ways that I think are best.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.720]   I'm going to surrender to the values of God's word,
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.920]   to the values that Jesus has taught me, to the values of the kingdom.
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:30.080]   And I'm going to seek to live those out.
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:35.280]   A great starting point is the ones that we've covered in the beatitudes.
[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:36.720]   Let's think about those for a second.
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:40.000]   Blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.360]   Surrendering to that saying, God,
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:46.320]   I'm not going to live from a place of pride or from a place of seeking my own
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.600]   righteousness. I'm, I want to be poor in spirit.
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:51.920]   I want to understand how much I need you. I want to live from that place.
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:56.680]   Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth. Surrendering to saying,
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:00.440]   God, I don't want to live from a place of thinking I'm better than someone else.
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:05.200]   I want my own understanding of my poverty of spirit to cause me to treat
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:08.600]   everyone else with love and respect because the rate made in your image.
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.800]   And I know I'm just as broken as anyone else.
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:14.680]   And I'm going to surrender to living out that value instead of trying to live
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:18.080]   from a place of pride and trying to assert myself and trying to give myself
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:20.000]   advantage over others. I'm going to be meek.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.280]   Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be
[00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:28.560]   satisfied. Saying, God, I'm, I'm going to surrender to that value. I'm,
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:33.600]   I'm going to stop hungering and thirsting after all the stuff of the world,
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:37.560]   all the stuff that I, that I crave because of my sin,
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:42.960]   all of the money or the power or the popularity or the lust or whatever those
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:43.640]   things are. God,
[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:47.560]   I want to stop living for those things and I want to hunger and thirst after
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.160]   righteousness. I want to surrender to that.
[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:53.440]   Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy. God,
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:58.240]   I want to live in a way that I see the brokenness of others and that it breaks
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.440]   my heart. God, I want to surrender to that value.
[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:03.440]   Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God. God,
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:08.440]   I want to surrender to having a single minded desire towards knowing you and
[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:11.720]   stop being distracted by everything else in the world and stop being
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:15.640]   contaminated by all these other desires and all these other things I want.
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.640]   But God, I want to surrender to only desiring you.
[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:22.960]   That's hard because our heart wants, our flesh wants everything else.
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:27.040]   We want this and that we want to achieve. We want to be comfortable.
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:29.520]   We want to have things. We want to be wealthy.
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:33.160]   We want all these different things. But can we surrender to saying, God,
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:37.240]   I want the purity of my heart to be found and only desiring you.
[00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:41.600]   Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the sons of God.
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.920]   Can we surrender to that and say, God,
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:48.800]   I want to live a life that brings Shalom into the lives of others and the verses
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:52.000]   10 to 12 that talk about being persecuted for righteousness sake. God,
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.080]   I want to surrender to that.
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.680]   I want to surrender to the fact that if I'm following you,
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:59.120]   there's going to be people who are uncomfortable with that,
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:03.160]   that it might bring about some persecution and I'm going to live it out anyway.
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:07.760]   And I'm, I don't want to give up when things are difficult and following you.
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:12.520]   That's a great starting point in surrendering to the values of the kingdom.
[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:13.880]   Start with the beatitudes.
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:17.960]   And then as you continue to know God's word and study the scripture,
[00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:21.880]   you'll see more and more values of the kingdom that God wants you to surrender
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:26.160]   to as you continue to follow Jesus and learn more about him and deepen your
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:27.080]   relationship with him.
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:31.400]   God will open up more and more of his truth and you'll see more and more things
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:34.560]   that you can surrender to more and more things about you and your,
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:38.720]   your selfishness and the old part of you that can pass away, that can die,
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:39.760]   that can disappear.
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:44.120]   And more and more of Jesus that can come in and live through you.
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:47.360]   And that's what Jesus is saying in this verse when he says,
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.520]   be perfect as your heavenly father is perfect.
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:54.160]   He's not saying that we're going to try hard enough to do this.
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:57.600]   He's saying there's no way you can do it. You've got to surrender.
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:01.800]   You've got to abide. You've got to let Jesus do it through you.
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:06.480]   You've got to let him live his life through your life.
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:09.160]   He doesn't want to improve us and make us a little bit better.
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:14.680]   He wants to radically transform us so that he is living in our place.
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:18.200]   He is living through us. So let's live into this.
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:24.240]   Let's be honest that we're not going to be good enough on our own,
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:29.040]   that we're not going to try hard enough to be all that God wants us to be or
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:32.400]   even to be all that we want to be ourselves.
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:36.600]   But we have got to have God's help. We've got to have God's work in our life.
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:41.040]   We've got to have the empowerment of the Holy Spirit in our life.
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:45.520]   And the reality is that that's what God wants all along.
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:49.480]   God never wanted us to do it. God never expected us to do it.
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:53.240]   God wants us to disappear, to fade away.
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:56.200]   He wants our selfishness, our pride,
[00:19:56.200 --> 00:20:00.160]   all the things about us that have driven our decisions and charted our course
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.440]   before we knew Jesus.
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:06.480]   God wants those things to fade away and he wants Jesus to begin living through
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:07.320]   us.
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:12.960]   God wants us to surrender to Jesus and let him live his life through us.
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:16.160]   God wants us to surrender to the values of the kingdom and say, God,
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:19.920]   I want to live out the values of the kingdom instead of just trying to live out
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:22.440]   the things that are important to me, the things that I value,
[00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:24.720]   the things that the culture around me values.
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:28.760]   I want to live out your values in my life. I want to prioritize those things.
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:32.520]   God wants us to surrender to relationship with him and say, God,
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:35.760]   I'm going to prioritize knowing you over everything else in my life.
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:40.040]   God wants us to surrender to abiding and saying, God,
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:42.840]   I can't do this on my own apart from you.
[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:44.320]   I really can't do anything.
[00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:49.080]   So I'm going to rest and I'm going to let you live through me so that I can be
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:50.120]   who you want me to be.
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:54.200]   That's what God calls us to and that's what Jesus is pointing us to in this
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:55.040]   chapter.
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:58.480]   And we have to cry out to God and ask God to help us to do it.
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:03.280]   And we have to ask God to give us the courage and the strength to surrender and
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:08.040]   the courage and the strength to step out of the way and let Jesus live through
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.400]   us. So let's do that. We'll do it right now,
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.600]   but let's continue to do that over this week.
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:16.760]   Let's continue to ask God to be at work in our life,
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:21.360]   to ask God to give us the strength and courage to surrender over and over to
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:22.520]   continue to surrender,
[00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:27.280]   to make that journey of surrendering to Christ and being closer to
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:31.800]   him and becoming more and more like Jesus and more and more of who God wants us
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:36.080]   to be. Let's pray. God, we do just profess our need for you. God,
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:40.800]   we know that we cannot be who you want us to be or even who we want to be
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:45.760]   on our own without your help. And so God, we just cry out for your help.
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:50.760]   We ask you to give us the strength to surrender to you and God,
[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:51.840]   I pray that we would do it.
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:56.400]   I pray that we would surrender to the values of your kingdom and that we would
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:58.280]   live out what's important to you,
[00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:01.800]   that we have prioritized the things that you prioritize. And God,
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:06.440]   I pray that we would surrender to orienting our lives around you and really
[00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:10.640]   focusing everything on you and focusing everything on our relationship to you,
[00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:14.680]   God. And as we do that, God, we ask for you to live through us.
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:18.720]   May your love shine through us. May your peace shine through us.
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:23.720]   May your unselfishness and your selflessness shine through us.
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:26.440]   May your humility shine through us. God,
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:31.280]   may you live through us so that we ourselves, but more importantly,
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:36.280]   the people around us see less and less of us and more and more of Jesus in our
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:39.640]   lives. God, our world needs that so bad.
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:43.800]   Our world so badly needs to see more and more of Jesus.
[00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:49.120]   May we be your people and may we be the people who,
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:54.640]   who live that out, who show more and more of Jesus to our friends,
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:59.000]   our families, our community, our city, and to the world around us. God,
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:01.320]   In Jesus' name, Amen.
