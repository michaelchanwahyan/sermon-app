[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   All right, and yeah, this is the address.
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.880]   So let's welcome Pastor Mark.
[00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:08.200]   - Good morning, everyone.
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.040]   Good to see you all.
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.040]   And today we're gonna continue our series on healthy church.
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.560]   What does the Bible say about church being healthy?
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.600]   All right, so one big question in my mind
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.880]   is that maybe you should ask yourself,
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.860]   is that the longer you have been to church,
[00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.200]   the longer you have been the question,
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.300]   does it mean that you know what the church is all about?
[00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.180]   Yes or no?
[00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.420]   Maybe.
[00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.500]   Maybe not, right?
[00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.020]   The longer you have been a Christians for years,
[00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.340]   sometimes we have our own concept or our own preferences
[00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.340]   that creep into our understanding
[00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.540]   of what the church is all about.
[00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.180]   So this whole series,
[00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.420]   I hope that we have the desire
[00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.260]   to return to the Word of God,
[00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.400]   return to the Bible and see what God has to say
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.160]   about being a church, becoming a church.
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.540]   It's not about your preference.
[00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.400]   It's not about my preference,
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.040]   although that may be important,
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.720]   but that is not the most important thing.
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.180]   The most important thing is for us
[00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.960]   to go back to the Word of God.
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.760]   That is our final authority.
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.380]   That is our highest authority,
[00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.800]   what the church is all about.
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.880]   And as I said before, in this series,
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.240]   church is one of the most vital expressions
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.520]   of the kingdom of God.
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.520]   If God comes to reign, reign in us, reign in our lives.
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.780]   One of the most vital expression is the local church.
[00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.020]   So you may have heard my story,
[00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.880]   how I was called to ministry, to church ministry.
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.620]   Back then, I was in California years ago,
[00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.420]   and I was in my local church.
[00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.500]   And my local church was without a pastor
[00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.860]   and without leadership.
[00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.160]   And it was in the lack of the leadership,
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.400]   the lack of teaching, that the church,
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.240]   you know, suffered from time to time.
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.880]   So that's how God moved me to this path of ministry.
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.840]   Maybe I was praying that if God is calling me
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.120]   to the ministry, then I'm willing to answer the call,
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.560]   because I wanna be part of the movement
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.320]   to build up and strengthen the local churches.
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.320]   And I will think that if the local church is strong,
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.720]   then God's name will be glorified.
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.580]   On the other hand, if the local church is weak
[00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.340]   and sick and not very healthy,
[00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.460]   then God's name is gonna take a dent, right?
[00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.180]   That's why we need to go back to the word of God
[00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.140]   and see what the word of God,
[00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.660]   what the Bible has to say about being a church,
[00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.380]   especially the New Testament.
[00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.700]   As you know, there are many, many letters
[00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.700]   in the New Testament that talks about how to be a church
[00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.060]   and what the church should look like, all right?
[00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.700]   So let our understanding of the church continue
[00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.700]   to be aligned with the word of God, the final authority.
[00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.540]   All right, so as we do this series,
[00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.820]   sometimes I give you a pop quiz, all right?
[00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:10.760]   Since we have some students
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.540]   from the mighty Moody Bible Institute.
[00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.820]   So yeah, so I'm sure you don't mind, right?
[00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.580]   So I prepared some pop quiz questions
[00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.460]   and hopefully these questions will get us thinking
[00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:30.460]   about what the church is all about in the Bible, all right?
[00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.420]   So first question, are you ready?
[00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.620]   What are your neighbors?
[00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.060]   All right, there are some trick questions here, all right?
[00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.340]   So let's warm up, okay?
[00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.180]   Are you ready?
[00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.180]   First question, what are your neighbors?
[00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.900]   All right, how many letters did Paul write
[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.060]   in the New Testament?
[00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.020]   Four, 13, or 27?
[00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.060]   All right, how many, how many?
[00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.780]   Think about it, talk to your neighbors.
[00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.140]   Talk to your neighbors.
[00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.300]   Hey, do you know?
[00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.580]   How many letters did Paul write in the New Testament?
[00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.060]   All right, how many?
[00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.220]   Okay, how many of you say four?
[00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.320]   How many of you say 13?
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.140]   All right, some hands here, okay.
[00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.100]   Looks like they're really good students.
[00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.220]   27, how, 27?
[00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.380]   All right, it's not 27.
[00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.020]   (laughing)
[00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.500]   Well, you know why, right?
[00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.420]   By the process of elimination, right?
[00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.020]   How many books in the New Testament?
[00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.780]   27, there's no way Paul wrote all of them, right?
[00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.340]   Come on, yeah, give it to some other authors, right?
[00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.480]   Yeah, Paul wrote 13 letters, right?
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.080]   Okay, you can find it from the table of content
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.300]   of your Bible, all right?
[00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.820]   So it's actually 13, all right?
[00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.580]   Second question, which of the following letters
[00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.180]   was not written by Paul, okay?
[00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.900]   Galatians, Ephesians, 1 and 2 Thessalonians,
[00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.460]   first letter of Paul, and Titus.
[00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.180]   Which one is not written by Paul?
[00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.700]   Which one is not written by Paul?
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.380]   Okay, how many of you say Galatians?
[00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.860]   - D. - D, right?
[00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.860]   Wait, but it's the first letter of Paul.
[00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.020]   You know, there's a first letter of John, you know that?
[00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.540]   It's written by John.
[00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.020]   And the second letter of John is written by?
[00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.300]   John, right, and the third epistle of John
[00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.820]   is written by?
[00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.100]   John, right?
[00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.340]   So what, no, no, so first letter of Paul
[00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.700]   is not in the Bible, okay?
[00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.060]   It's not in the Bible, it's not in anywhere else.
[00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.820]   So, all right, you got it?
[00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.580]   All right, these are easy questions, okay?
[00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.020]   Number three, all right?
[00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.780]   It's getting harder, getting harder.
[00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.220]   Ready?
[00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.260]   All right, the verse, "Love is patient, love is kind,
[00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.200]   "love is not jealous, not boastful, not proud,"
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.260]   can be found in which letter of Paul?
[00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.320]   How many of you say Galatians?
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.060]   It was a good saying, you know?
[00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.420]   It should be in the Bible, right?
[00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.220]   It should be in the Bible somewhere, right?
[00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.460]   How many of you say Galatians?
[00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.220]   How many of you say 2 Corinthians?
[00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.560]   1 Corinthians?
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.020]   All right, all right, it's 1 Corinthians, all right?
[00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.860]   1 Corinthians.
[00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.060]   This is an easy question, now it's a hard one, okay?
[00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.060]   Now it's a hard one.
[00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.020]   All right, ready?
[00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:05.140]   It's 1 Corinthians, the first letter written by Paul
[00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:06.620]   to the church in Corinth.
[00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:12.020]   It's 1 Corinthians, the first letter written by Paul
[00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.020]   to the church in Corinth.
[00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.140]   Okay, talk to your neighbors, talk to your neighbors.
[00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.740]   What do you think?
[00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:21.580]   Yes or no?
[00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.980]   How many of you say yes?
[00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.740]   First, it's 1 Corinthians, come on, guys.
[00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.060]   How many of you say yes?
[00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.660]   All right, some people are brave,
[00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.060]   and some of you say no.
[00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.160]   Then what did he write?
[00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.060]   Why is it called first?
[00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.860]   It's actually no.
[00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:45.580]   1 Corinthians is not the first letter
[00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:48.780]   he has ever written to the church in Corinth, no.
[00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:49.980]   Why, how do we know?
[00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:53.820]   From the letter of 1 Corinthians 5, 9,
[00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:59.200]   Paul said, when he was writing the letter to Corinth,
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.500]   after four chapters, 5, 9, he said,
[00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.540]   "When I wrote to you before,"
[00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:11.460]   before, so there's, I guess, Corinthians zero,
[00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:16.140]   right, beta, maybe, beta version,
[00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:18.680]   before what we call 1 Corinthians.
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.780]   So there are different letters Paul has written
[00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.220]   to churches in his time,
[00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.620]   and teaching them what the church should be like, right,
[00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:27.900]   correcting them, teaching them, and all that stuff.
[00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:31.700]   And what we have collect in our New Testament canon,
[00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.100]   the 27 books that we have in the New Testament,
[00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.540]   are just 27 of those.
[00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:39.060]   And you know, talking about Pauline letters,
[00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:40.860]   only 13 of those.
[00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:44.500]   So there are, there are maybe other different letters
[00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.680]   that Paul has sent to the church
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.300]   to teach them about doctrine,
[00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:54.240]   teach them about God, and teach them about church living.
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:57.180]   So this help us to think about
[00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:00.300]   what is the purpose of church letters?
[00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:02.660]   What is the purpose of the letters,
[00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:06.020]   after letters we found in the New Testament, 27 books,
[00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:10.340]   right, many of them are called epistles, letters.
[00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:13.260]   What is the purpose, and what are the purposes?
[00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.180]   It is actually for teaching and correcting,
[00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:18.540]   and addressing some of the issues, right?
[00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.900]   It's like your health report, you know?
[00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.740]   Anybody done a medical checkup lately?
[00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:25.820]   Huh?
[00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:27.420]   You're too young, right?
[00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:28.500]   Yeah. (audience laughing)
[00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:32.060]   I got my report, and the doctor warns me,
[00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:33.620]   you know, there are some food items
[00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:35.260]   you should not put in your mouth.
[00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:39.100]   Sugar, right?
[00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:41.780]   And you know, something you should not, you know,
[00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:43.980]   because, you know, my doctor said,
[00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:46.140]   you know, you, you, you, you, you,
[00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:47.840]   you know, you're not young anymore.
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:51.060]   You better watch out, right?
[00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:53.660]   So it's like a, it's like a medical report, right?
[00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.940]   So the church letters can be seen as a report
[00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:59.260]   of the church health,
[00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:02.340]   and Paul, one of the letters' author,
[00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:05.260]   is trying to correct some of the problems,
[00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.460]   and you know, let's dive into the letter
[00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.540]   of 1 Corinthians, and you can see
[00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:13.940]   that Paul is jumping from topic to another topic
[00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:15.900]   to address some of the questions.
[00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:17.580]   Now, the church letters can be called
[00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:19.580]   the occasional letters.
[00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:21.780]   Occasional letters meaning, being,
[00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:24.340]   that the letter is being written
[00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:28.900]   to respond to some of the issues or questions,
[00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:30.540]   especially in 1 Corinthians.
[00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:33.580]   As you can see, 7.1, regarding the questions
[00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:36.700]   you guys asked me in your letter.
[00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:40.460]   Hey, so there was an other letter sent by the Corinth,
[00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:45.100]   by the Corinthian Christians to Paul in the first place,
[00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:49.820]   and Paul is responding to some of their questions.
[00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:52.380]   So 7.1, 8.1, regarding the question
[00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:54.940]   about food offered to idols.
[00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:56.020]   You know, in their background,
[00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:58.100]   there's religious background, pagan temple,
[00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:01.500]   and all that stuff, and you go buy meat.
[00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:05.780]   The meat was already offered to the idols,
[00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:08.120]   so some of the people would not allow them
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:12.060]   to eat those meats because of conscience, right?
[00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:16.460]   They just don't feel comfortable, right?
[00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:21.460]   Kind of like some of us, we do have that background, right?
[00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:23.180]   I remember not too long ago,
[00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:25.780]   I received a call from a church member,
[00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:27.540]   and the church member asked me,
[00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:32.540]   because the Chinese Asian, pagan worship,
[00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:39.220]   and they have the chicken already offered to the idols,
[00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:44.420]   and then of course, after the idol is done with eating,
[00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:46.260]   and it's your turn to eat, right?
[00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:47.100]   It's your turn to eat.
[00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:48.600]   And the church member asked me
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.660]   whether I should eat that or not.
[00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:52.980]   What do you think?
[00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:53.820]   Should we eat it?
[00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.420]   Of course.
[00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:59.020]   If it's cooked well, if it's made well,
[00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:00.660]   of course I would take it, right?
[00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:05.660]   But because there's some conscience issues, right?
[00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:09.540]   Not feeling comfortable about partaking
[00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:13.380]   into that sort of ritual, and then so she has some concern.
[00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:15.180]   And these are some of the questions
[00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:18.100]   that the Corinthian Christians were asking Paul.
[00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:22.500]   11.2, Paul said, "You are following the teachings
[00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.900]   "I pass on to you, let me expand."
[00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:28.900]   So 11, chapter 11 is all about public worship,
[00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:33.900]   and then 11.17, yeah, 11.17.
[00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:36.420]   In the following instructions, Paul said,
[00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:41.420]   "I cannot praise you guys, for it sounds as if more harm
[00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:46.260]   "are being done than good in your public worship
[00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.540]   "when you meet together."
[00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:51.780]   So again, he's addressing some of the chaos
[00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:54.780]   that the Corinthian church was having.
[00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:57.740]   Again, it's a corrective measure.
[00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:59.820]   Paul is trying to correct them.
[00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.500]   12.1, now dear brothers and sisters,
[00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:05.380]   regarding the question, your question,
[00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:10.380]   about special abilities, or what we call spiritual gifts,
[00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:13.300]   that the Spirit gives us.
[00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:16.340]   So let me expand, let me teach you what it means.
[00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:21.340]   So for a few chapters, 12, 13, and 14,
[00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:23.660]   Paul is trying to address this issue,
[00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:28.660]   this question of special grace gifts, or spiritual gifts.
[00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:35.180]   And then 15.1, he talks about what he has preached to them,
[00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:41.620]   i.e., the doctrine, the belief of resurrection.
[00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:45.060]   So chapter 15 and on, Paul is talking about the doctrine
[00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:49.420]   of Christ, you know, raising from the dead, resurrection.
[00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:54.180]   So again, I want you to think with me
[00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:56.460]   that we need to return to the Word of God.
[00:12:56.460 --> 00:13:01.060]   This is, at the end of the day, this is what matters.
[00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:02.820]   It's not your preference or opinions
[00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:04.540]   about what church should look like,
[00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:06.420]   or whether I like this church,
[00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:09.980]   or like some aspect or dislike some aspect of the church.
[00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.020]   These are not important at the end of the day.
[00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:14.100]   The most important thing is the Word of God.
[00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:15.980]   So let's return to the Word of God.
[00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:18.060]   So today, as we go on to the series,
[00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:21.660]   let's take a look at the 12th chapter of 1 Corinthians.
[00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:25.300]   So he's talking about spiritual gifts or special abilities
[00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:27.340]   the Spirit has given the church,
[00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:31.620]   spiritual gifts or special ability of the Spirit.
[00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:33.980]   "I don't want you guys to misunderstand this,"
[00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:36.020]   Paul said, verse two.
[00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:38.860]   "You know that when you were still pagans,
[00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:40.860]   when you were worshipping the idols,
[00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:44.620]   no, the non-God, they don't exist,
[00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:49.940]   you were led astray and strapped along
[00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:52.940]   in worshipping speechless idols.
[00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:54.380]   Those are nothing.
[00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:56.780]   But you were worshipping the pagan idols,
[00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:59.820]   the Greco-Roman gods and deities.
[00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:01.380]   Those are speechless.
[00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:04.460]   They can't do anything, those idols.
[00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:07.180]   But now you're different," verse three.
[00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:10.460]   "So I want you to know that no one speaking
[00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:15.460]   by the Spirit of God will say, 'Jesus grants a curse.'
[00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:19.940]   And no one with the Spirit can say,
[00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:22.460]   no one can say, 'Jesus is Lord,'
[00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:24.820]   except by the Holy Spirit."
[00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:29.820]   Now, what Paul is saying is that if you're in Christ,
[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:32.820]   if you believe the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:36.340]   and you're genuine, born-again Christian,
[00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:39.980]   you have accepted Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior,
[00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:43.980]   your life has changed because the Spirit dwells within you.
[00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:46.260]   Now you have the life of the Spirit,
[00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.900]   and the life of the Spirit will enable you
[00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:50.900]   to say, "Jesus is Lord."
[00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:54.220]   And if you will have the Spirit,
[00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:57.140]   you would not say, "Jesus grants a curse."
[00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:59.220]   Now, that's my translation from the Greek,
[00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:02.420]   because there's no verb in those two words in Greek.
[00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:07.740]   No one speaking by the Spirit
[00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:09.140]   will say, "Jesus grants a curse."
[00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:10.140]   What does it mean?
[00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:11.460]   What does it mean?
[00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:14.820]   Now, remember, the Bible is not written to us, right?
[00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:16.380]   It's written for us.
[00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:18.540]   It's written to the first century Christians.
[00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:21.460]   Now, I explain a little bit the Corinthian Christians
[00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:24.540]   when before they came to Christ,
[00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:27.660]   they were in all sorts of pagan worship.
[00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:30.460]   That's why Paul said, "When you were still pagans,
[00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:32.060]   you worshiped idols."
[00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:36.860]   Now, in Corinth or in any other big cities of the day,
[00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:39.860]   people worship all kinds of false religions.
[00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:44.860]   And all the pagan religions have one common ground,
[00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:51.100]   one common element among all of the Greco-Roman religions
[00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:54.940]   is that people worship the idols
[00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:57.580]   because they want the idol to do something for them.
[00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:03.140]   People use religions to achieve their own purposes.
[00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:08.100]   So let's say you have a co-worker in your workplace,
[00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:11.380]   all right, you don't quite like the guy, all right?
[00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:14.420]   You know, in those days, in Paul's days,
[00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:16.980]   they go to the pagan temple, all right?
[00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:21.100]   You know, you talk to the pagan deity, the false deity,
[00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:24.380]   and say, "I don't like John, you know, I don't like John.
[00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:26.660]   Please grant a curse, okay?
[00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:29.060]   Please grant something, do something bad, okay?
[00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:31.140]   Maybe have him fired, right?
[00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:33.900]   So I have a better day, you know, to go through."
[00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:35.340]   So this is what you do.
[00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:36.940]   You go to the pagan temples
[00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:39.900]   because you use the name of the deity
[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:43.620]   to achieve your own end, right?
[00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:44.900]   In some of the temples,
[00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:49.900]   actually we found curse tablets, you know, documents,
[00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:54.540]   you know, left behind by pagan worshippers.
[00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:58.340]   And some would say, "So-and-so God, grant a curse."
[00:16:58.340 --> 00:16:59.740]   Grant a curse to whom?
[00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:01.940]   Someone you don't like, right?
[00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:03.220]   Maybe you don't like mother-in-law
[00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:06.340]   and you ask for a curse, right?
[00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:07.260]   It's really bad.
[00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:10.180]   Maybe you don't like somebody, you know,
[00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:12.180]   or you just don't like it.
[00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:14.060]   You know, you see what was going on
[00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:15.860]   in the popular religion of the day?
[00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:19.860]   Is that you use religion for your own end,
[00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:21.420]   for your own purposes.
[00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:23.060]   And as you can imagine,
[00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:25.620]   some of those people from the pagan worship background,
[00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:29.100]   they come to the church and now they accept Christ, right?
[00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:33.380]   Now they probably would carry the same mentality
[00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:36.380]   and they want Jesus to do the same thing for them, right?
[00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:40.140]   Don't we all do that sometimes?
[00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:42.100]   And we need to repent.
[00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:45.780]   Because we come to Jesus, we come to the true God,
[00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:49.020]   and we want this true God to be my servant,
[00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:51.220]   to do something for me, right?
[00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:53.300]   If he doesn't do something for me,
[00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:55.340]   then he must be false, right?
[00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:58.060]   This is the wrong mentality that we bring
[00:17:58.060 --> 00:17:59.580]   to the biblical faith.
[00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:02.420]   And Paul is saying, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:05.500]   "No, if you really have the spirit," Paul said,
[00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:08.860]   "you won't say, 'Jesus, grant the curse.'"
[00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:10.780]   That means you don't use the name of Jesus
[00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:12.700]   for your own purposes.
[00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:17.020]   You are not the Lord.
[00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:19.420]   Jesus is the Lord.
[00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:22.220]   Jesus is the Lord.
[00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:25.220]   You don't use Jesus for your own benefits.
[00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:28.780]   Whether you want to get some more money,
[00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:34.780]   a bigger house, a higher status in your society,
[00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:36.300]   all that stuff.
[00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:41.300]   Paul is correcting some of the wrong-headed mentality.
[00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:43.260]   He said, "If you have the spirit, you say,
[00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:46.460]   "'Jesus is the Lord,' that means you surrender yourself.
[00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:48.660]   "You surrender your will and your desire
[00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:53.060]   "to the true Lord, Jesus Christ himself,
[00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:55.300]   "and you are a servant."
[00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:02.620]   That's a totally different ballgame in the Bible,
[00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:04.020]   in biblical faith.
[00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:08.180]   You come to worship God, to call him Lord,
[00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:10.860]   and you acknowledge his lordship.
[00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:13.260]   And that's why we worship, right?
[00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:14.580]   That's why we worship.
[00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:18.780]   That's why we worship every day, especially on Sunday.
[00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:21.260]   We set aside this time because we want to acknowledge
[00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:26.260]   that God himself, Jesus, is the Lord, and I'm not.
[00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:29.060]   He is in charge, and I'm coming before him.
[00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:30.660]   I surrender myself to him.
[00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:36.900]   And that's how Paul started with this whole chapter,
[00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:39.740]   talking about spiritual gifts.
[00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:42.940]   He said, "There are different kinds of spiritual gifts,
[00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:45.900]   "but the same spirit is the source of them.
[00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:48.140]   "There are different kinds of service,
[00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:50.340]   "but we serve the same Lord."
[00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:52.860]   God works in different ways, and it is the same God
[00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:55.820]   who does the work in all of us in the church.
[00:19:55.820 --> 00:20:00.020]   A spiritual gift is given to each and every one of us
[00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:02.620]   so that we can help each other,
[00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:06.020]   or the common translation is for the common good.
[00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:12.100]   Verse 11, "It is one and only spirit.
[00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:15.700]   "He distributes all these gifts,
[00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:19.420]   "these special abilities to different members of the church.
[00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:24.420]   "He alone decides which gifts each person should have."
[00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:26.940]   That is spiritual gifts.
[00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:29.260]   And then, in the latter context,
[00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:30.660]   he talks about what kind of gifts.
[00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:34.140]   So Paul kind of gives us a list.
[00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:39.140]   First, the apostles, the gift of apostles,
[00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:43.340]   meaning planting churches or launching churches.
[00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:46.060]   In our UV network, we belong to the Southern Baptist
[00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:50.660]   church planting movement, so we launched 2016.
[00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:55.340]   And we got a lot of church planters in our network.
[00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:57.420]   They are in the city, they are in different areas,
[00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:58.940]   they are starting different churches,
[00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:02.060]   and these people are doing what the apostles did.
[00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:04.900]   You know, Apostle Paul, going from town to town
[00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:07.180]   and city to city to start churches,
[00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:11.620]   to begin churches, to launch church plants.
[00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:16.620]   First gift is the apostle, and second gift is prophets,
[00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:19.220]   prophetic words.
[00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:21.780]   Now again, prophetic words is not weather forecast.
[00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:24.780]   It's not our modern meaning.
[00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:28.580]   Prophetic, being prophetic, being a prophet,
[00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:31.060]   in Paul's days, in biblical terms,
[00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:35.340]   is speaking on behalf of the Word of God.
[00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:38.780]   Based on the final revelation,
[00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:41.340]   the final authority of the Word of God,
[00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:42.940]   he proclaims the Word of God.
[00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:45.580]   That's what the Old Testament or even New Testament
[00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:48.180]   in Paul's time still have prophets.
[00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:50.180]   What they're doing is proclaiming
[00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:53.980]   the authoritative Word of God to the people, teaching them.
[00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:56.700]   And the third gift is teachers.
[00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:59.700]   Teacher, correcting and teaching
[00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:02.020]   the right doctrines of the church.
[00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:06.140]   And then he lists out different kinds of gifts,
[00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:09.420]   but the whole point is, the whole point is,
[00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:12.340]   it's not an exhaustive, comprehensive list
[00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:13.300]   of spiritual gifts.
[00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:14.980]   You can find different lists of spiritual gifts
[00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:19.780]   from 1 Corinthians, no, 1 Peter,
[00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:21.700]   and other church letters.
[00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:24.780]   But the whole point is not giving you a comprehensive list.
[00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:29.780]   The whole point is tell you what spiritual gifts are for.
[00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:33.580]   The most important word in this passage
[00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:36.980]   is the word soul.
[00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:38.940]   In order that.
[00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:41.980]   The ultimate purpose.
[00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:42.980]   What is it for?
[00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:47.980]   In order so that we can help each other or common good,
[00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:50.960]   to increase the common good of the church community.
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:54.900]   That's what spiritual gifts are for.
[00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:58.100]   And what the problems with the Corinthian Christians,
[00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:00.160]   if you read the whole letter,
[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:02.620]   is that they regard spiritual gifts
[00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:05.340]   as something to build up their own
[00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:07.460]   high status in the community.
[00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:09.420]   So the people will speak the tongue,
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:15.600]   and they think because we have this kind of explicit
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:18.800]   expression of the Holy Spirit's work in our lives,
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:21.960]   and we can speak the language of angel and all that stuff.
[00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:25.060]   And that's why we are of higher status in the community.
[00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:26.840]   Paul flipped it around and say,
[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:28.800]   this is actually the last one.
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:30.720]   You check the list of spiritual gifts,
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:33.420]   speaking in tongue is the last one.
[00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:37.200]   The first one, or the first few spiritual gifts
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:39.560]   that Paul wanted to elevate,
[00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:43.480]   were actually has to do with communicating the word of God
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:45.580]   for the benefit of the whole church.
[00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:48.640]   So Paul is trying to correct this problem and say,
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:52.480]   look guys, what is spiritual gift?
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:55.960]   And he used this special word, charismatic,
[00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:58.160]   to describe spiritual gifts.
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.720]   What is it?
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:04.480]   Maybe the most simplest definition
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:07.900]   is freely given gifts, given without merit.
[00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:11.200]   It's not because of who you are.
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.080]   It's not because you're smarter.
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:16.360]   That's why you get this gift and that gift.
[00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:18.920]   It's not because you're better.
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:21.520]   It's not based on your merit
[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:25.520]   that the Spirit gives you certain kind of gifts.
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:26.540]   It's freely given.
[00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:29.240]   It's like salvation.
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:30.720]   It's like our redemption in Christ.
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:34.240]   It's freely given to all of us without merit.
[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:37.840]   I remember some years ago, I was reading this book
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:42.840]   and the author has a way to categorize,
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:47.600]   you know, grouping different spiritual gifts together.
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:52.320]   And he mentioned four big categories.
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:54.720]   The first one, he said there were different abilities,
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.280]   different spiritual gifts in the church
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:59.180]   that would celebrate the name of God.
[00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:03.120]   Well, one of the most clear examples
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:06.760]   is those who are musically gifted, right?
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:07.680]   Right?
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:11.080]   Any of you have learned a music instrument before
[00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:12.960]   and you gave up, right?
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:14.440]   (audience laughing)
[00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:15.280]   You do, right?
[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:17.640]   Yeah, many of you guys are Asians, right?
[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:22.640]   Must have learned some music talents, right?
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:26.760]   And then you finally give up.
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:28.520]   You know, nothing wrong with you.
[00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:30.800]   You're just not gifted.
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:32.800]   (audience laughing)
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:33.640]   Right?
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:34.940]   Maybe you're not disciplined enough.
[00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:36.720]   That's why you gave up, right?
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:38.400]   Some of you pick up the instrument,
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:40.400]   they really learned well, you know?
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.620]   They didn't spend a lot of time, right?
[00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:46.780]   But they are naturally or spiritually
[00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:48.120]   given with that gift, right?
[00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:50.960]   That's one of the clearest examples of gifts
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:54.840]   that can celebrate the name of God.
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:56.240]   Worship is one of them.
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.740]   And the second category is communicate,
[00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:01.920]   communicating the word of God.
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:06.920]   Some people are more gifted in teaching, right?
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:10.600]   Some of them are really gifted in, you know,
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:14.560]   doing study and clearly communicating, you know,
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:16.240]   the truth of God so that the church
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:20.240]   can get benefits out of it, right?
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:22.760]   Yeah, I know we have the open AI these days.
[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:26.420]   And, you know, one of my friends actually, you know,
[00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:29.240]   plop into the AI and ask the AI to,
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:31.920]   hey, can you write a devotional on this chapter
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:33.520]   or that chapter in the Bible?
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:37.760]   And the AI actually can spill out pretty good stuff.
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:41.800]   You know, as you know, I'm doing studies, right?
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:45.400]   Old Testament studies in seminary, part-time.
[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:48.080]   And some of you guys encourage me, you know,
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:50.880]   because you heard, you know, I have to write a paper, right?
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:52.440]   So I actually try.
[00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:55.600]   I actually try to, you know, plop into the AI and say,
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:57.280]   hey, I want this topic.
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:00.080]   You know, can you write me something?
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:02.760]   And then I try it a couple of weeks ago.
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:06.840]   Actually, the AI gave me some correct information
[00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:08.240]   with some wrong information.
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:10.280]   (laughs)
[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:11.680]   With some wrong information
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:13.200]   about the Old Testament background.
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.700]   So I correct the AI.
[00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:16.600]   I said, this is wrong.
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:18.640]   That's not from there.
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:20.640]   You know, it's from here, right?
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:22.720]   So, you know, we live in the new generation
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:24.280]   and it's kind of interesting, you know,
[00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:28.000]   how we can use, you know, this tools, you know,
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.840]   to minister.
[00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:35.820]   Although there's so much danger in it,
[00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:37.560]   but, you know, it's one of the tools, right?
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:39.400]   It's like computer, right?
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:40.920]   This morning I was talking to a brother
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:45.920]   who is in charge of all this IT tools of our church.
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:49.160]   You know, you walk into church,
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:52.680]   there's so many things have to do with IT, right?
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:55.400]   You know, this thing, this thing,
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:58.440]   and, you know, computer and all that stuff.
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:03.440]   Well, someone has to be gifted in also the IT stuff
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:07.640]   in order to make it work and make the church operate.
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:10.640]   And some of the brothers and sisters
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:13.040]   are gifted in such a way, you know,
[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:15.000]   that I'm not gifted in.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.640]   And they use it to build up the church.
[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.140]   The third category is caring.
[00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:23.120]   Some people are really good, really good.
[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:24.880]   In hospitality.
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:29.440]   You know, not, of course we need to love one another,
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:30.640]   right, no matter who, right?
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:33.040]   Sister or brother in Christ, we have to love one another.
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:35.460]   But some people are really gifted in caring.
[00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:38.540]   You know, go visit the sick and, you know, cooking.
[00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:44.440]   Just prepare good food, right?
[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:46.280]   You know, I'm not one of those.
[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:47.600]   You know, I cook.
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:52.300]   Yeah, but the stuff that I cook, it sucks.
[00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:54.580]   (audience laughing)
[00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:58.900]   'Cause I have the instrumental mentality to food, you know?
[00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:01.500]   I said food, I just devour it,
[00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:03.740]   and then I'll go on to do something else, right?
[00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:05.780]   So I really don't know how to enjoy it, right?
[00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:07.260]   My son does.
[00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:09.460]   Yeah, my son, Nathan, yeah.
[00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:11.380]   He is a very, very good cook.
[00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:12.780]   Sometimes I have to beg him.
[00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:15.500]   You know, can you make a little bit more?
[00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:17.940]   Yeah, so I can have a portion, you know?
[00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:20.860]   Some people are really good at caring, you know?
[00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:23.260]   Just making a loving environment,
[00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:25.820]   creating, you know, relationships,
[00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:29.340]   so that the church can be built up.
[00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:31.660]   Collaborating, leadership.
[00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:33.900]   Did I mention that?
[00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:37.700]   Yeah, Paul mentioned that, the gift of leadership, right?
[00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:39.200]   People can put things together
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:43.220]   so that we can, you know, operate as a team, right?
[00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:44.760]   It's not like a car.
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:46.380]   You know, you have different parts, right?
[00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:49.660]   The engine, the water pump, and the motor oil,
[00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:51.060]   the brakes, and all that stuff.
[00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:52.900]   Everything has to work together
[00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:56.740]   in order for the car to bring you from A to B, right?
[00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:58.540]   You walk into the church,
[00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:01.100]   maybe when you walk into church for the first time,
[00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:04.720]   what was your impression?
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:08.140]   You walk into church, our church, UV.
[00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:09.940]   - Cars, benches. - Yeah, okay, okay.
[00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:10.840]   The cars, okay.
[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:13.860]   So you walk in, there's six or seven, you know,
[00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:14.700]   toy cars out there.
[00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:15.740]   None of them is mine.
[00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:19.340]   It belongs to the owner of the building.
[00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:20.740]   This is toy car parking lot.
[00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:24.380]   So you walk through the cars, right?
[00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:26.980]   Some people thought, you know, we are car dealers.
[00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:29.940]   (audience laughing)
[00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:31.100]   That'd be nice.
[00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:33.260]   But, you know, you walk through, you know, all this stuff,
[00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:35.100]   and you come to our unit, right?
[00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:36.380]   What was your impression?
[00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:40.080]   It's a very nice place, right?
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:41.980]   The cafe is a very nice place.
[00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:42.860]   I want to tell you the story
[00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:46.440]   because, you know, it's not me who designed it.
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:47.980]   You know, if I design it,
[00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:52.060]   it's gonna be just folding tables, folding chairs, right?
[00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:53.660]   'Cause I'm a practical guy, right?
[00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:57.560]   When you find, you want coffee, here you go, you know?
[00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:58.400]   (audience laughing)
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:01.100]   I've, you know, it's not in my radar, you know,
[00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:03.620]   how it looks and the design.
[00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:07.260]   Because when we launched our church, Urban Voice, 2016,
[00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:10.240]   one of my core team members is a very gifted artist.
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:15.060]   So she told me, I still remember, she told me,
[00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:16.660]   "You step away, pastor."
[00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:17.980]   (audience laughing)
[00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:19.260]   You know, this sort of stuff, you know,
[00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:22.420]   it's you're not gifted, I'm gifted.
[00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:23.820]   So let me design it, right?
[00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:26.220]   So she actually designed a lot of different things,
[00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:30.580]   you know, all the looks and feel, it's all from her brain.
[00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:32.420]   It's all from her, right?
[00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:33.760]   It's not me.
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:36.620]   Now, this is the conviction
[00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:40.480]   that the Bible wants you to carry.
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:42.320]   It's that every single one of us
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:46.400]   needs to discover your own spiritual gifts.
[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:51.520]   You need to find out where you're gifted at.
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:54.560]   And you need to discover it, you need to develop it.
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:57.720]   You need to grow, right?
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:03.200]   I remember some time ago, I was reorganizing
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:07.440]   my study room, my home office.
[00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:11.840]   And I found some of the old sermons that I had, you know,
[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:13.840]   years ago, years ago.
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:17.960]   I look at the script and I said, "Dang, it sucks.
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:21.600]   "It's really bad sermon."
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:23.800]   You know, what was I doing, right?
[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:26.720]   Because I was just, you know, first year in ministry
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:29.080]   and I have so much to learn, right?
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:31.480]   Well, even today, I look at my sermons,
[00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:36.080]   sometimes I told myself, "That's not gonna be good."
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:36.920]   Right?
[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:38.320]   And why did I preach that, you know?
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:43.080]   But amazingly, you know, God used crappy sermons
[00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:45.440]   to accomplish his goal, right?
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:47.720]   It's not an excuse, but we need to study, right?
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:48.880]   We need to grow.
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.800]   I need to grow and you need to grow as well.
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:54.280]   Discover your gifts and use it, develop it, right?
[00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:59.840]   12.14, Paul continues to say,
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:02.960]   "Yes, the body has many different parts,
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:04.460]   "not just one part.
[00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:08.120]   "If the foot says, 'I am not part of the body
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:10.220]   "'because I'm not a hand,'
[00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:14.040]   "that does not make it any less a part of the body.
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:16.880]   "If the ear says, 'I am not part of the body
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.660]   "'because I'm not an eye,'
[00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:21.360]   "would that make it any less a part of the body?
[00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:24.160]   "No, every part is important."
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:28.800]   18, "But our bodies have many parts
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:32.200]   "and God, according to his sovereignty,
[00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:36.800]   "has put each and every part just where he wants it."
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:39.400]   Who's the subject here?
[00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:41.240]   God.
[00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:47.080]   He has the sovereign will to do whatever he desires
[00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:51.660]   to give different members with different things, right?
[00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:55.480]   It's like a football team, right?
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:58.120]   Those wide receiver go to the end zone
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:33:59.740]   and got the touchdown, right?
[00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:02.480]   How did he do that?
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:04.920]   Of course, he cut the ball, right?
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:06.920]   But the ball has to pass to him, right?
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:10.080]   And whose credit should that be?
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:14.440]   You gotta have the quarterback good enough
[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:15.880]   to pass the ball to him, right?
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:18.800]   And he's good enough to catch it, right?
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:19.640]   To score it.
[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:23.000]   It's like a team of people working together.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:28.400]   The Spirit gives us different things,
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:31.440]   abilities to build up the church, right?
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:33.080]   I'm going back to very beginning.
[00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:37.240]   I was called to ministry and I answered the call.
[00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:40.440]   Of course, I stumbled and fall.
[00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:44.040]   I learned a lot throughout these years.
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:49.040]   But there has to be a community working together, right?
[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:53.360]   Now, Paul is using the analogy of human body
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:57.520]   to teach what church should look like, right?
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:02.520]   And you understand the culture of Paul's day.
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:07.040]   Actually, the body image was often used
[00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:10.600]   by politicians in Paul's day.
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:14.260]   There was a story in Paul's time.
[00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:16.920]   The politicians were trying to appeal
[00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:19.640]   to workers who were on strike.
[00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:21.840]   So there were a lot of different workers and slaves
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:25.140]   that were on strike because of uneven pay
[00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:27.660]   or unequal pay, treatment, and all that stuff.
[00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:29.040]   So they were on strike.
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:32.520]   So the Roman politicians comes in and say,
[00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:34.640]   "Hey, think about it.
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:37.600]   "We are like a body, right?
[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:42.300]   "And we, the leaders, the governing class,
[00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:45.360]   "the upper class, we are the stomach."
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:47.520]   And the speech actually goes like this.
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:50.000]   "We are the stomach, we are the governing body,
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.040]   "and you workers are providing food for the stomach."
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:54.040]   Right?
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:56.720]   Using the body language to tell everyone,
[00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:58.660]   "Okay, don't go on strike.
[00:35:58.660 --> 00:35:59.680]   "Go back to work.
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:01.440]   "Because if you go back to work,
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:02.840]   "then we have something to eat."
[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:04.040]   Right?
[00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:08.120]   Now, as you can tell, the analogy is working
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:12.120]   for those who are oppressing the people.
[00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:13.080]   Right?
[00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:14.120]   The ruling class.
[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:19.280]   Paul is using the same image subversively.
[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:23.200]   He turn it around, turn the table.
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:24.400]   In fact, the whole analogy,
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:27.200]   if you read the 12th chapter of 1 Corinthians,
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:28.320]   stomach is not there.
[00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:30.640]   You know why?
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:32.880]   Because of the background of Paul.
[00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:34.620]   He's not like a politician.
[00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:35.980]   He's an apostle.
[00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:38.800]   He wants the church to grow and to be strengthened.
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:41.320]   And that's why Paul is saying, "No stomach."
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:43.720]   There's no ruling class.
[00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:46.160]   Every single one plays its part.
[00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:51.160]   And even the strong should value the weak, the despised.
[00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:53.080]   Read the chapter on your own time.
[00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:57.000]   That's how the church should be put together.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.080]   And the more I think about spiritual gifts,
[00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:00.680]   you know, sometimes we have the, you know,
[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:02.920]   not quite right mentality.
[00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:06.120]   We thought he has that ability.
[00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:07.960]   I don't have that ability.
[00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:09.240]   He got that tool.
[00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:10.880]   I don't have that tool.
[00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:12.080]   You know, it's not like that.
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:13.240]   The more I think about it,
[00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:17.740]   spiritual gifts are more like opportunities.
[00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:22.920]   Opportunities that we should seize
[00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:25.280]   and use for the glory of God.
[00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:31.260]   Spiritual gifts are more like opportunity
[00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:33.500]   God has given to us.
[00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:35.620]   So we talk about what are spiritual gifts
[00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:38.420]   and what are those spiritual gifts for?
[00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:39.900]   And what are they like?
[00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:41.500]   Opportunities.
[00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:43.740]   God given opportunities for you and me
[00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:45.420]   to build up the church.
[00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:46.380]   Now I told you last week,
[00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:49.580]   I went to my seminary for a whole week seminar
[00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:52.540]   and I present paper and some of the students present paper.
[00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:57.300]   You know, the school that I'm going to is Midwestern.
[00:37:57.300 --> 00:37:59.020]   I really like the slogan.
[00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:00.500]   Can you see that?
[00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:01.480]   For the church.
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:03.560]   For the church.
[00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:05.800]   Whatever we're doing,
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:09.420]   whatever lofty idea we're doing, you know,
[00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:12.740]   scholars, there's 30 different stuff in the Bible.
[00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:15.800]   The ultimate purpose is for the church.
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:20.820]   What a privilege we have the opportunities to do that.
[00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:25.740]   Yesterday, there was a funeral,
[00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:28.640]   a memorial service for a beloved brother.
[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:33.020]   He's not coming to UV, but he goes to CCC South
[00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:36.400]   and known him for years, Dr. Dominic Ho.
[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:40.700]   And in the entire service, you know,
[00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:44.180]   different people have different reflections on Dr. Ho.
[00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:49.180]   And I was really amazed by, you know, this man's humility.
[00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:52.680]   You know, he's a wonderful doctor
[00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:54.980]   and is accomplished in his field,
[00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:57.560]   but it's very humble.
[00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:01.080]   You know, I've known him for years and he's generous,
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:05.380]   he's humble, always there to help other people
[00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:09.400]   using his opportunities in his career, in the church,
[00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:12.780]   to honor the name of God.
[00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:14.380]   You know, what an example.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.900]   God is giving us here and there different opportunities
[00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:22.980]   to glorify his name.
[00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:26.140]   The beginning of a service,
[00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:30.940]   Miriam mentioned the revival at Ashbury University.
[00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:36.980]   What started as a chapel service scheduled on February 8th,
[00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:40.400]   not too long ago, 10 days ago,
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:44.060]   and the service prolonged
[00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:46.660]   and different people, you know,
[00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:49.400]   they gave different expressions, right?
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:53.120]   Radical humility, confession,
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:57.460]   consecration, surrounding themselves to God.
[00:39:57.460 --> 00:39:59.440]   You know, there are different people from, you know,
[00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:04.060]   distant community and travel all the way to Ashbury
[00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:07.080]   in order to experience the revival, right?
[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:09.660]   Now, who made it?
[00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:10.660]   Who made it happen?
[00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:14.620]   It's not a human created thing.
[00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:17.860]   It's a God sent.
[00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:19.620]   Nobody planned for it, right?
[00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:22.900]   If you study the history of revival in the church history,
[00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:27.900]   nobody actually manipulate and plan for revival.
[00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:29.660]   It's the spirit who sends it.
[00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:33.540]   The spirit is at work in different brother and sisters
[00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:39.020]   so that the glory of God can be magnified.
[00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:43.540]   And the most important thing
[00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:48.540]   is that the people are returning to God and His word.
[00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:51.700]   That's the most important thing.
[00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:54.900]   Yeah, the emotional, you know, experience,
[00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:57.100]   you know, those are valuable,
[00:40:57.100 --> 00:41:00.820]   but the most important thing is that we will return
[00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:04.140]   to God Himself and say, "Jesus is Lord.
[00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:07.300]   "Only Jesus is Lord."
[00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:10.180]   And I'll do away all the pagan practices.
[00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:13.660]   I'll do away all this non-biblical lifestyles,
[00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:17.700]   mentality, attitudes, and come to God Himself
[00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:21.300]   to experience this is the true revival.
[00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:23.900]   The true revival is the people will finally
[00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:26.940]   and ultimately return to God, right?
[00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:29.860]   And let us do that.
[00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:35.920]   Surrender our will to God Himself and say, "Jesus is Lord."
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:38.180]   Let's all pray together.
[00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:41.640]   Father, we praise you.
[00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:47.040]   We worship you because Jesus is our Lord,
[00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:48.980]   and He is the only true Lord.
[00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:52.940]   And thank you for the opportunity we can serve you.
[00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:55.880]   And thank you for the different abilities,
[00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:58.300]   different talents that we have
[00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:04.540]   so that we can use them to strengthen your community,
[00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:07.800]   your church family.
[00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:13.060]   We ask that once again, your spirit will come upon us
[00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:17.440]   to open our lives and our hearts
[00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:20.640]   so that we'll be surrounding our will to you
[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:22.980]   and be used by you, ready.
[00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:25.280]   We're ready to be your servants.
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:29.280]   We're ready to be touched and moved by your spirit,
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:32.620]   you know, to love and to serve and to worship you.
[00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:35.480]   And I pray that your spirit will be at work in our midst.
[00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:39.940]   Will be at work in our lives.
[00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:42.860]   Help us to repent and return to you,
[00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:47.140]   to live under your word, to live out the gospel,
[00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:49.500]   live out the life of the spirit.
[00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:51.500]   And I pray that you will help us to learn,
[00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:54.180]   to grow as a church community,
[00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:56.580]   that your body, the body of Christ,
[00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:59.860]   will continue to be strengthened
[00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:02.580]   and to give you glory.
[00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:04.180]   In Christ, we pray.
[00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:05.320]   Amen.
[00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:10.080]   But again, your homework this week is to discover and to develop.
