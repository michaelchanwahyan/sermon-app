[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760]   Wave hands to your friends, yeah.
[00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.840]   (laughs)
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:05.680]   Alright.
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:12.200]   Well, one last announcement is the registration, I think.
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.860]   Oh, okay, alright, we have our continuous daily devotion.
[00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.520]   Make sure you subscribe to it,
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.840]   join our social media group,
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.120]   and read a small portion of the devotional material
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.720]   to help you walk in the way of God, okay?
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.600]   So the theme is very interesting.
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.120]   It give us today our daily bread, okay?
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.960]   Eating is so important for many of us, right?
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.100]   Especially Asian and Chinese, right?
[00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.860]   We greet each other, "Have you eaten yet?"
[00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.840]   (laughs)
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.440]   "Have you eaten your lunch or your dinner?"
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.920]   We're so concerned about our own feast, right?
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.320]   Our own eating, our own stomach.
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.400]   But the Bible has a lot to say about eating, right?
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.000]   The Bible has a lot to say about our food.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.920]   And in fact, the food, the meals that we have,
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.760]   are often tests and temptations to all of us.
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.880]   So I hope this daily devotional
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.320]   will help you and challenge you.
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.340]   Today is the last day for registration
[00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.280]   to be the voting member.
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.020]   I have explained to all of you,
[00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.280]   the system at UV is kind of a system of democracy.
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.520]   Alright, so all the voting members registered to be active,
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.560]   and you can nominate each other,
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.960]   and then elect each other to be the new,
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.240]   to become the core team of the new term.
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.840]   Our Angus congregation, although it's smaller,
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.680]   we are not small, right?
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.240]   We are not small, as I can see.
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.940]   There are, I think five, right?
[00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.940]   Five nominees coming out of you guys, alright?
[00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.000]   Maybe 10 out of the 10 o'clock service,
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.040]   but five out of you guys.
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.920]   This is so important because our pastoral staff
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.200]   are working alongside with our elected
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.360]   core team members to lead the church.
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.640]   So for the next three years,
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.360]   we're gonna generate a new leadership team,
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.980]   and we're gonna meet on a monthly basis
[00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:12.800]   for one hour or so to discuss church business
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.680]   and church direction and a lot of things.
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.600]   We come to the church meetings,
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.320]   whether it's worship service or fellowship,
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.320]   or later you go to have your feast tonight at Mears.
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.440]   You know, you need to understand,
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.120]   sometimes we show up to eat, and then we'll be gone, right?
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.920]   But there are tons of things behind the scene.
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.680]   People are working so hard to make sure
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.600]   the schedule is right, and make sure all the tools,
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.740]   all the elements are there in order for us to enjoy.
[00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.400]   So you need to understand, church is not just
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.900]   what you can see, it's not just one hour
[00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.440]   or two hours a week.
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.960]   There are 24/7 behind the scene,
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.480]   people are doing things to prepare stuff for us.
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.160]   So the core team leadership is actually in charge
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.440]   of all, many of the ministry
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.080]   and all the works behind the scene.
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.200]   So this is so important.
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.060]   So register if you have not.
[00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.200]   If you have registered, praise God, okay?
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.380]   If you have registered, after today,
[00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.380]   we will enter into the second phase of our election,
[00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.580]   is the phase of nomination.
[00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.520]   So there will be three Sundays,
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.180]   October 9, 16, and 23.
[00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.460]   We're going to generate a list of nomination.
[00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:38.460]   So once you register, you will be able to nominate people
[00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:43.740]   from the list of qualified nominees, or potential nominees.
[00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.620]   You're gonna nominate among each one of us.
[00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:54.740]   Whoever got the highest number of nominations,
[00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.300]   will go into the third phase, which is election.
[00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.400]   All right, election is on the Sundays
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.320]   of November 6, 13, and 20.
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.820]   So for three Sundays, we're gonna cast our vote, all right,
[00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.500]   to the list of nominees.
[00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.660]   And then after the three Sundays of election,
[00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.180]   November 6, 13, and 20, we're gonna generate
[00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.540]   a new group of qualified members,
[00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.440]   and the results will be out on 20th of November.
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.980]   All right, got it?
[00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.780]   I like this system.
[00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.500]   I like this system, because we always have room
[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.140]   for new members, for new leaders, for new ideas.
[00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.700]   We need all of you to serve together.
[00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.820]   In fact, the Bible tells us we need to do
[00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:46.420]   our best to serve God, to use our time,
[00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:51.300]   to use our talent, and to use our treasure
[00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.980]   to serve God's kingdom, all right?
[00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.220]   So three Ts, your time, your talent, and your treasure.
[00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:03.620]   In my years in the past few churches, including this one,
[00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:08.100]   I'm so amazed by how God has raised up so many people,
[00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.820]   brothers and sisters, to do the little work behind the scene
[00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.820]   and to make the gospel possible, make the church possible.
[00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:23.500]   Each one of us is gifted in many different ways, all right?
[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.500]   I want to remind you, the church is composed
[00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.280]   of different members.
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.460]   All of us are different, totally different, right?
[00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.300]   You don't want a church that, you don't want a church,
[00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.620]   the church body that has only one guy,
[00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.980]   like everyone looks like Mark Chan.
[00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.860]   That would be the worst church in the world.
[00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:52.020]   Everyone is unique, everyone is different, right?
[00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:56.940]   So use our talents and discover our talents.
[00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:02.060]   We started our worship service 1130 until now.
[00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.660]   There were many people working behind the scenes.
[00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:04.860]   Some were doing the PowerPoint,
[00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:05.940]   some were doing the OBS,
[00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:10.940]   some were doing preparation and the worship team,
[00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.420]   they practice beforehand and come and set up
[00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.500]   and lead us into the presence of God.
[00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:17.980]   So there were a lot of things.
[00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:21.060]   We can use our gifts and use our talents, all right?
[00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:26.060]   So these three phrases, please remember today, September 11,
[00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.380]   you're going to register,
[00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.220]   this is the last Sunday to register, all right?
[00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:30.380]   All right?
[00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:31.540]   All right, so next one.
[00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.500]   Oh, courting position, yes, there you go.
[00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:39.020]   All right, so there will be a fellowship dinner today, right?
[00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:43.580]   Praise God, praise God, praise God for good food, okay?
[00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.140]   But I hope we have good time of fellowship as well, all right?
[00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:50.700]   It's not just about eating, it's about being together, right?
[00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:56.900]   And then what you do as giving, remember my three Ts?
[00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.900]   The third T is treasure.
[00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.700]   You are not just giving for something unknown,
[00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.380]   you're giving to the ministry.
[00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.700]   We are trying to build up our ministry,
[00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:10.020]   that our ministry is not just here and in the neighborhood,
[00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:10.980]   it's not just that.
[00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:13.900]   Of course, this is our first priority.
[00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:14.820]   As a community church,
[00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:18.420]   we wanna serve the people in our neighborhood,
[00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:23.420]   but our ministry goes to, I don't know, globally, right?
[00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.540]   Some of our YouTube videos, some of our teaching
[00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:29.420]   will go to somewhere else in the world
[00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:30.820]   and bless other people.
[00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.660]   So as you give, remember this,
[00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:37.660]   you are participating in the global work of Jesus Christ.
[00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:39.300]   All right?
[00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.060]   There was something I remember, I wanna remind you.
[00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:42.900]   I forgot, yeah.
[00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:46.700]   Shouldn't be important, but anyways, yeah.
[00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:50.420]   So continue to give and give faithfully, all right?
[00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:55.220]   So today is my substitute preaching
[00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:58.660]   and let me give you a five minute recap
[00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:01.220]   of what I did in the past two weeks.
[00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:03.220]   And then I give you the highlight
[00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:06.940]   or my highlight of the whole trip.
[00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:13.540]   We went to different sites and different places in Israel.
[00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:15.900]   If you have seen some of the videos,
[00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:18.140]   you should, first of all, you should remember,
[00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:23.220]   we often have some sort of preconception
[00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:26.900]   of what the land of the Bible, Israel, is, right?
[00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:28.300]   Now, if you ask your neighbors,
[00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:29.340]   if you ask your neighbors,
[00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:31.940]   what do you think of the land of Israel, right?
[00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:34.180]   What kind of image, what kind of impression
[00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:37.700]   come into your mind when people mention Israel, Palestine?
[00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:41.820]   Okay, talk to your neighbor, go to your neighbor.
[00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:44.380]   What are some of the first impressions that you had
[00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:47.660]   with the land of Israel?
[00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:50.460]   What are some of those?
[00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:53.060]   Yeah, what were some of those that came to your mind?
[00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:55.220]   What was that?
[00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:56.460]   Here, here, this corner.
[00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:57.820]   What you guys talk about?
[00:08:58.780 --> 00:08:59.700]   (laughs)
[00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.380]   Dusty, dusty and sandy, right?
[00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:03.940]   Yeah, right, right, right.
[00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:05.460]   What else?
[00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:06.300]   How about that?
[00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:07.700]   Huh?
[00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:09.540]   War, yes, war, right?
[00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:13.700]   Yeah, it's always a missile and bombs and all that, right?
[00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:16.540]   That's all you got, right?
[00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:17.580]   That's all you got.
[00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:18.420]   What else?
[00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.660]   I'm sorry?
[00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:24.780]   Promised, promised land.
[00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:26.340]   Promised land, did I get it right?
[00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:27.540]   Okay, it's good, good.
[00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:29.900]   That is correct.
[00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.500]   (laughs)
[00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:35.260]   Well, is it sandy, is it dusty?
[00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.660]   Some areas are dusty, right?
[00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:39.260]   Just like Chicago.
[00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.220]   Some areas are really dusty.
[00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:45.220]   It was very interesting, I meet some friends
[00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:47.980]   or people, strangers on the street,
[00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:51.060]   and sometimes we exchange conversation, right?
[00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:52.420]   And then they ask, "Where you from?"
[00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:53.740]   And I ask, "Where you from?"
[00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:57.660]   "Oh, you from Sweden or from Germany."
[00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:59.980]   And then I say, "I'm from Chicago."
[00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:02.820]   And their impression of Chicago,
[00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:04.700]   it's very dangerous place.
[00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:07.300]   It's probably the most dangerous place in the world.
[00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:08.980]   (laughs)
[00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:10.140]   That's true, right?
[00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:13.660]   In fact, yesterday, if you heard about the neighborhood news,
[00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:17.500]   I got, I think it happened yesterday or Friday.
[00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:18.740]   Yeah, it happened Friday.
[00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:22.140]   There was shooting in the Kenwood High School neighborhood
[00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:23.500]   in Hyde Park.
[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:24.500]   You heard about it?
[00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:27.540]   Because you are numb.
[00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:28.380]   Because you are numb,
[00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:31.580]   because there's so many different shootings, right?
[00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:32.420]   You just don't care.
[00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:33.260]   I don't care.
[00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.540]   It's not special anymore.
[00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:38.100]   And in fact, Friday, there was a shooting
[00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:43.100]   near Hyde Park, Kenwood Academy in Hyde Park.
[00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:44.660]   And I talked to some of the parents,
[00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:49.540]   who's children are students of Kenwood.
[00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:54.540]   And they told me there was a soft lockdown in Kenwood.
[00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:59.180]   Kind of scary, right?
[00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:02.260]   It's the beginning weeks of the school year.
[00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.220]   And already it's happening, right?
[00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.340]   But you talk to some of the foreigners,
[00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:09.220]   some of the people who've never been to Chicago,
[00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:13.460]   and then you try to correct their preconception, right?
[00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:14.460]   You try to correct them.
[00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:15.940]   And I don't come from,
[00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:21.420]   there were not bullets flying 24/7 here, right?
[00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:22.860]   You try to tell them, you know,
[00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:25.060]   I'm from Chicago, I'm normal.
[00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:28.820]   My street, my neighborhood is actually pretty safe, right?
[00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:30.500]   I live in McKinney Park,
[00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:35.180]   which is right next to Bridgeport, where we're at now.
[00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:38.540]   I try to correct them, you know, it's not what you think.
[00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:41.700]   Now, why did they think the way they do?
[00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:43.980]   Because of the media, right?
[00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:45.660]   Because of the media.
[00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:47.740]   Now, you turn on your TV news,
[00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:50.540]   you turn on any news channel,
[00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:53.260]   you always get the sensational stories, right?
[00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.260]   Because what is newsworthy
[00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.540]   is always the dangerous stuff, right?
[00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:00.740]   The exciting stuff, the sensational stuff.
[00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:04.980]   You don't get any news from me, right?
[00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:07.860]   Am I newsworthy?
[00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:09.540]   No, I'm not, right?
[00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:12.540]   I'm just a normal guy, ordinary, just like you, right?
[00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:15.340]   I don't read your story on, you know, CNN
[00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:17.980]   and all the major news channels.
[00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:22.540]   All we got from the news channel is always a,
[00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:26.980]   well, one of the perspectives, right?
[00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:29.220]   One of the blind spots.
[00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:33.300]   What is newsworthy is often sensational.
[00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:37.620]   That's why when they hear about Chicago,
[00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:40.140]   they always think of the gangsters,
[00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:42.420]   the shootings, right, the killing,
[00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:44.100]   and all that stuff.
[00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:45.860]   So I try to correct that.
[00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:50.780]   And I go to the land of Israel for the past two weeks,
[00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:54.420]   and we had that kind of reorientation too.
[00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.940]   Now, of course, I've been there for many, many times,
[00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:58.460]   and I don't need that.
[00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:01.100]   But once we arrive, once we arrive,
[00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:05.940]   all of the Team Israel people,
[00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:09.340]   they tell me, "Wow, this is Israel?
[00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:10.420]   "Is that right?"
[00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:12.060]   I said, "Yeah, you are in Israel.
[00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:13.380]   "Check your GPS.
[00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:14.380]   "You are in Israel."
[00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:15.500]   (audience laughing)
[00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:19.180]   "You are not in Sahara Desert.
[00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:23.380]   "You are not in some, you know, no man's land.
[00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:25.780]   "It's actually pretty urbanized, right?"
[00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:27.180]   I keep telling them, actually,
[00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:30.740]   Israel is a mini United States, right?
[00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:35.740]   So we land Israel on Monday, two Mondays ago,
[00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:39.980]   after 13 hours of flight.
[00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:43.940]   So we land in the Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv,
[00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:47.580]   or near Tel Aviv, and then we check out our rental cars.
[00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:50.460]   So I drive one car and the other guy, Ronald,
[00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:51.620]   drive another car.
[00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:55.460]   So we head out to the north side of Israel, to Galilee,
[00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:56.700]   right?
[00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:58.660]   It's a beautiful place.
[00:13:58.660 --> 00:13:59.780]   It's a beautiful place.
[00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:04.780]   It's the freshwater lake,
[00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:06.900]   the Sea of Galilee, Lake of Galilee,
[00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:11.900]   is a freshwater lake at the lowest point on planet Earth.
[00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:15.060]   It's a beautiful place, right?
[00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:17.340]   Besides the heat wave, right?
[00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:18.500]   It's a beautiful place.
[00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:23.500]   And they took a lot of pictures.
[00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:25.260]   They have fun.
[00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:29.380]   And then we check into our Airbnb.
[00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:33.820]   We stayed there for less than a week, four to five days.
[00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:37.900]   And then we drove all the way down to the middle
[00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:40.220]   of the country, which is Jerusalem.
[00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:44.820]   Now, once we arrived in Jerusalem, it was a Thursday.
[00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:45.780]   It was a Thursday.
[00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:51.100]   Thursday night, we arrived and checked into our second Airbnb
[00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:52.540]   and then we settled in.
[00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:54.980]   And then after an hour, I told the team,
[00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:56.980]   "Hey, let's meet on ground floor.
[00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:01.180]   Because we have two different Airbnbs."
[00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:05.300]   I said, "After an hour or so, you settle down
[00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:07.660]   and we're gonna meet on the ground level
[00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:09.820]   and then we're gonna walk the street, okay?"
[00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:11.380]   'Cause we checked in the Airbnb,
[00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:14.700]   and which is located right at the heart of the city,
[00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:17.900]   which is Ben Yehuda Street.
[00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:18.740]   Ben Yehuda Street.
[00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:21.340]   If you Google that, you'll find out Ben Yehuda Street
[00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:24.580]   is one of the busiest streets in the city of Jerusalem,
[00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:27.780]   in the new part of the city of Jerusalem, not the old city.
[00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:30.780]   Anyways, it's very close to the old city.
[00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:33.180]   So we went to the ground level and I said,
[00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:37.140]   "Hey, it's about time to go for dinner."
[00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:38.180]   Right?
[00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:39.620]   So they walked the street
[00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:43.540]   and there's light rail and all that.
[00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:48.420]   And then shops and restaurants are all open.
[00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:52.180]   And Thursday, I mentioned Thursday, we arrived
[00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:54.460]   because Thursday, Thursday evening,
[00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:56.860]   is the busiest day of the week.
[00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:58.460]   Busiest day of the week.
[00:15:58.460 --> 00:15:59.300]   Why?
[00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:02.180]   Because Friday is the Shabbat.
[00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:05.300]   So it's the day before Shabbat, right?
[00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:06.700]   It's like our Friday night.
[00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:08.500]   It's like our Friday night.
[00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:11.620]   So their Thursday night is a very busy night.
[00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:13.620]   And everyone is, you know,
[00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:17.820]   all the restaurants have tables and chairs out there
[00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:19.300]   on the sidewalk.
[00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:24.180]   Good food, you know, good drinks,
[00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:28.340]   and people are chatting and having a good time.
[00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:30.580]   And one of the team member told me,
[00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:32.660]   "This feels like Europe."
[00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:33.700]   "This feels like..."
[00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:35.460]   Is that right?
[00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:36.940]   Europe is like that, right?
[00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:41.900]   You just chill out in the evening, nice and cool.
[00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:44.220]   I said, "Yeah, exactly."
[00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:45.100]   Right?
[00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:49.100]   And then we went to the Western Wall, the Wailing Wall,
[00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:51.580]   and to check out, you know, all the activities there.
[00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:54.540]   And it was crazy, so busy.
[00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:56.580]   Because some of the Jews,
[00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:59.060]   especially the religious observant Jews,
[00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:02.140]   they would go to the Western Wall almost every day
[00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:04.140]   to pray and to read scripture.
[00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:05.620]   So we had a good time.
[00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:08.860]   We went to different site,
[00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:13.860]   and to so-called retrace the steps of Jesus,
[00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:17.900]   the steps of the Old Testament stories
[00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:19.140]   or New Testament stories.
[00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:25.260]   Every place that we go is a storied place,
[00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:27.220]   storied place.
[00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:29.980]   It means place full of stories,
[00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:34.220]   place full of traditions, histories, and legends.
[00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:35.420]   Almost every site.
[00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:40.140]   You know, I used to study in Israel for quite a bit,
[00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:43.820]   and I stay in the Old City.
[00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:46.860]   So I go out to the Old City almost every day,
[00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:52.380]   just to walk and to get grocery or stuff like that.
[00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:57.340]   Every stone has a story.
[00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:01.420]   Every corner of the street has a story.
[00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:05.500]   Has a story that goes back to thousands of years ago,
[00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:07.700]   go back to the Old Testament time.
[00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:12.700]   And you can relate to what has happened in the past
[00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:18.300]   to what is relevant to all of us today.
[00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:21.860]   And today, I would like to share one of the stories
[00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:24.300]   or one of the sites that I went to,
[00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:27.020]   which is one of the highlights, all right?
[00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:28.620]   Now let me read the scripture first.
[00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:30.780]   2 Kings 20, 20.
[00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:33.340]   20, 20, 2 Kings.
[00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:39.140]   Now, this is the conclusion of the reign of King Hezekiah,
[00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:41.700]   one of the Old Testament kings,
[00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:46.700]   one of the kings reigning in the southern country of Judah,
[00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:49.860]   right around Jerusalem.
[00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:53.300]   So this is the conclusion, the concluding note.
[00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:56.860]   So after chapters of information,
[00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:59.900]   history about the reign of Hezekiah,
[00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:01.780]   the writer of the Bible says,
[00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:06.380]   as for other events of Hezekiah's reign,
[00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:11.260]   all his achievements and how he made the pool,
[00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.140]   the water, the water pool,
[00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:15.700]   and the tunnel, the water tunnel,
[00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:18.980]   by which he brought water into the city,
[00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:21.940]   are they not written in the book of Kings of Judah?
[00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:26.540]   Now, the last question that he asked
[00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:28.980]   was a rhetorical question.
[00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:31.500]   But what I mean by rhetorical question
[00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:36.500]   is that the answer is expected, of course, right?
[00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:37.500]   There were other events,
[00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:40.420]   many other events and achievements of King Hezekiah.
[00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:43.340]   Are they not written in the book of Kings of Judah?
[00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:46.540]   The archive, the government files,
[00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:49.780]   you know, the, you know, how many gigabytes,
[00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:52.740]   you know, in today's term, are all stored
[00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:55.940]   in the government archive of the day.
[00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:59.540]   And that archive is called the archive of Kings of Judah.
[00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:00.660]   Right?
[00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:01.980]   So there are many other things
[00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:04.300]   that the biblical author can talk about,
[00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:06.940]   about King of, about King Hezekiah.
[00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:09.140]   And he said, I can talk so much,
[00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:11.540]   but they are all written in the government archive.
[00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:13.780]   And I didn't talk about it, right?
[00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:14.940]   So in the previous chapters,
[00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:19.940]   he talked about what King Hezekiah has done in his reign.
[00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:22.620]   Some of the highlights in the history
[00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:24.660]   of the reign of Hezekiah.
[00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:28.820]   Now, Hezekiah is a good king.
[00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:30.300]   He's a good king.
[00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:32.140]   Now, why do I have to mention the good king?
[00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:35.700]   Because in the book of Kings, as you can remember,
[00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:39.300]   there were many, many kings that we quoted.
[00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:42.380]   Northern country, Israel, the southern country, Judah.
[00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:46.580]   The book of Kings is all about the history
[00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:50.420]   of the royal people, the kings and the queens
[00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:53.140]   and the elites of the country.
[00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:58.540]   Most of the kings are bad kings.
[00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:02.180]   If you talk about the northern king,
[00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:05.740]   the kings of Israel, the northern country,
[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:08.420]   none of them is good.
[00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:09.500]   None of them is good.
[00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:14.300]   Everyone has gone astray from the faith
[00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:18.100]   and let the whole nation to worship the false god, Baal,
[00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:21.100]   worship the false gods.
[00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:24.740]   None of them is good in the northern country.
[00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:26.500]   That's why they went into exile.
[00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:32.580]   And then he continued to talk about the southern kings,
[00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:34.820]   the kings of Judah.
[00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:37.060]   There are many of them because the history is,
[00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:40.580]   of course, is longer than the northern country.
[00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:44.340]   The southern country, Judah, also has many kings,
[00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:48.420]   but many of them are bad kings, all right?
[00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:51.980]   And here and there, there are some good kings.
[00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:55.340]   Hezekiah is one of them.
[00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:57.020]   Hezekiah is one of them.
[00:21:57.020 --> 00:22:00.900]   Now, how do you define a good king, right?
[00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:02.460]   Now, I told you the bad kings,
[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:04.860]   all they did was to worship the false god
[00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:06.820]   and lead the people to worship the false god,
[00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:11.820]   to leave the faith, the true faith of Yahweh.
[00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:17.860]   The good kings will turn around,
[00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:20.820]   turn around the whole nation
[00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:24.820]   and have the whole nation worship Yahweh, the true God,
[00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:28.100]   the one and only God, the creator God, the covenant God.
[00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:30.980]   So Hezekiah is one of them.
[00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:35.980]   And in fact, in the early reign of King Hezekiah,
[00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:38.300]   he exercised and implement
[00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:43.140]   some of the all nationwide religious reform.
[00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:46.460]   So he broke down all the false god shrines
[00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:49.620]   and false gods temples,
[00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:53.980]   some of the orders, rightful orders,
[00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:55.980]   he broke them all down.
[00:22:55.980 --> 00:23:00.420]   So he got all, you know,
[00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:05.100]   all encompassing policy implement in his reign.
[00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:07.100]   In the early time of his reign.
[00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:10.340]   So that was King Hezekiah.
[00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:12.180]   So there are many things the biblical author
[00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:13.660]   talks about this good king.
[00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:18.940]   But one of the biggest crisis
[00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:22.100]   that Hezekiah faced when he became king
[00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:27.100]   was the incoming invasion of Assyrian empire.
[00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:35.580]   Now, back then, one of the superpowers in the whole earth
[00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:37.740]   is the Assyrian empire.
[00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:41.860]   Now, if you learn a little bit about Assyrian empire,
[00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:44.020]   you have never heard of, you know,
[00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:49.020]   some of the cruelest or the most militarized nation
[00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:52.020]   on earth, Assyrian empire.
[00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:56.660]   They go to different places to conquer different people
[00:23:56.660 --> 00:24:01.260]   and to do some of the most evil things,
[00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:04.860]   you know, to oppress the conquered people
[00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:09.860]   and to destroy the cities and all the towns.
[00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:12.780]   And the Assyrian empire was growing
[00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:14.700]   in the time of Hezekiah.
[00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:18.460]   So one of the major crisis Hezekiah had
[00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:23.220]   was the growing Assyrian empire
[00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:26.820]   that would threaten the security
[00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:29.180]   of his small nation Judah.
[00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:33.380]   So he did many things, Hezekiah,
[00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:36.500]   in order to defend his country, all right?
[00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:40.420]   Now, facing, you know, a Goliath, right,
[00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:43.540]   Assyrian empire coming at your footstep,
[00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:45.180]   you know, you gotta do a lot
[00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:47.860]   because you're a small nation, right?
[00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:51.380]   You got to spend a lot of time and a lot of effort
[00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:53.780]   in your military defense, right?
[00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:56.620]   Jerusalem is a very small place.
[00:24:56.620 --> 00:25:01.900]   Jerusalem is also not a land of,
[00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:05.420]   that has a lot of resources.
[00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:08.100]   So he did a lot of things, Hezekiah,
[00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:09.300]   in order to defend his country.
[00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:12.220]   And one of the things that we can retrace his steps
[00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:14.380]   is the Hezekiah tunnels.
[00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:20.100]   It is a almost 2000 feet long tunnel
[00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:22.020]   that brings water from the water source,
[00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:24.340]   the only water source in the city of Jerusalem,
[00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:27.020]   Gihon Spring, all the way,
[00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:31.300]   dug this tunnel 2000 feet underground
[00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:32.580]   into the mountain,
[00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:36.660]   all the way, bringing water from the Gihon Spring
[00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:40.620]   to the heart of the city, inside the city.
[00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:42.020]   You know, in the old days,
[00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:45.460]   usually the water source or the spring of the city
[00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:50.460]   is located outside or at the foothill of the town, right?
[00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:53.180]   The town, when we build a town in the ancient time,
[00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:55.420]   we want to build a town on top of the mountain
[00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:57.060]   for defense, right?
[00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:59.980]   But you know, there's always pros and cons.
[00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:03.540]   You build high, you don't get water, right?
[00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:05.220]   Where's the water?
[00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:09.100]   The water's coming from the underground water table, right?
[00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:10.900]   Have you ever dug well?
[00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:12.980]   Have you ever dug well?
[00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:14.500]   You dug deep, right?
[00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:17.660]   You dug deep into the ground.
[00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:18.500]   Why?
[00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:21.460]   Because the water table is underground, right?
[00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:25.540]   So you have to dug like 50 feet down, 20 feet down,
[00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:28.820]   in order to reach the water table in the limestone.
[00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:31.780]   Same case in Jerusalem.
[00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:33.460]   The water table is down there.
[00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:38.460]   So imagine, you know, you got a hill, right, or a ridge.
[00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:40.100]   City of Jerusalem, the city of David,
[00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:42.540]   is on top of the hill,
[00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:46.140]   and the water source is the Gihon Spring.
[00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:49.460]   It's right at the foothill.
[00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:54.180]   Now, how do you solve the problem of military defense, right?
[00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:55.620]   When the Assyrian Empire,
[00:26:55.620 --> 00:27:00.620]   when the Assyrian soldiers come to attack the city,
[00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:04.580]   they will surround the city, right?
[00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:09.580]   And they will tap into your water resource
[00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:12.180]   and won't let you use the water, right?
[00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:17.660]   So in the normal day, when there is no military attack,
[00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:20.300]   you can go out of the city wall, out of the city gate,
[00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:23.460]   and you go all the way down to the foothill,
[00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:26.900]   and then you have a bucket,
[00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:31.660]   and then you fetch water from the well, or from the spring,
[00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:33.420]   and then you go back uphill, right?
[00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:38.060]   Now imagine, day by day, you have to do that, right?
[00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:41.380]   In the morning, because you gotta make coffee,
[00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:43.260]   so you gotta have some water, right?
[00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:46.620]   So early in the morning, usually the women do the job,
[00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:51.500]   all right, the men stay back on the lazy boy,
[00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:55.900]   and wait for the women to bring water to home.
[00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:58.820]   So in the morning, and probably in the evening,
[00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:02.100]   you know, the women are very busy going out of the city gate,
[00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:04.300]   out, you know, from the mountain top,
[00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:07.500]   go to the foothill to fetch water back home.
[00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:10.380]   In the normal day, you can do that, that's fine.
[00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:13.900]   But in order to prepare for the ongoing,
[00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:18.140]   or the upcoming Syrian attack,
[00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:21.860]   Hezekiah dug this tunnel, 2,000 feet long, is that long?
[00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:25.260]   Pretty long, right?
[00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:27.740]   All by human hands, can you imagine?
[00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:28.980]   All by human hands.
[00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:33.380]   And today, we can go to the Hezekiah tunnel,
[00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:37.700]   and I tell you, this is the highlight of the whole trip.
[00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:39.780]   Everyone thinks so, everyone thinks so.
[00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:42.540]   Unless you are claustrophobic, kind of,
[00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:44.100]   you know, you can't go in.
[00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:47.500]   We have a couple of members who cannot go in,
[00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:49.780]   so they decide not to go, which is good, which is good.
[00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:52.220]   If you get panicked in the tunnel,
[00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:54.940]   there's no way I can rescue you, right?
[00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:59.900]   There's no phone signal, there's no Wi-Fi in the tunnel,
[00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:03.220]   so you have to walk through the tunnel one way,
[00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:05.220]   you know, from the Gihon Spring.
[00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:07.540]   You walk in with your flashlight, right?
[00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:09.300]   You gotta bring your flashlight,
[00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:11.140]   and then the size of the tunnel,
[00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:17.140]   remember, I'm five nine, I have to duck most of the time.
[00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:18.620]   I have to duck.
[00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:20.180]   If you're really short, that's fine.
[00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:23.340]   I have to duck most of the time.
[00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:24.540]   And you have to walk through the tunnel
[00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:28.900]   from the starting point to the end point, 2,000 feet.
[00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:29.980]   How long does it take?
[00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:33.540]   In the water, you wait in the water.
[00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:36.340]   There's fresh water coming out of the Gihon Spring.
[00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:38.700]   It still works, the spring is still working today.
[00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:40.660]   You know, it's just amazing.
[00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:44.220]   For 3,000 years, it's fresh water
[00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:46.620]   coming out of the Gihon Spring.
[00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:49.700]   So we walk in the dark with a flashlight
[00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:54.180]   for almost 45 minutes, sometimes an hour,
[00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:58.500]   and sometimes longer because I stop,
[00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:02.580]   and I explain to the team right inside the tunnel.
[00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:05.100]   And think about it.
[00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:10.100]   You know, this Heisekai Tunnel was the greatest
[00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:17.580]   water engineering project in his day, in the entire world.
[00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:22.140]   You don't find anything like this
[00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:23.900]   in other parts of the country,
[00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:26.260]   or in other parts of the planet Earth.
[00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:31.260]   It's the greatest, smart, and genius idea.
[00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:35.140]   They have two teams dugging together,
[00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:39.020]   you know, trying to join each other inside the mountain.
[00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:40.820]   2,700 years ago.
[00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:42.540]   By what?
[00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:43.420]   By sound.
[00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:45.500]   When they dug in the limestone,
[00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:47.940]   that you can hear the other team, what they're doing,
[00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:50.140]   and are we coming closer?
[00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:52.260]   That's why the tunnel is not straight.
[00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:54.620]   It's going like S-shaped, you know,
[00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:57.140]   zigzag into the mountain.
[00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:59.420]   It's one of the greatest water projects
[00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:03.620]   in the world at Heisekai's time.
[00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:07.780]   So Heisekai did that in order to defend the city.
[00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:10.860]   Now back to the scripture.
[00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:15.220]   Did the scripture talk about it?
[00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:16.980]   Yes, it does.
[00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:21.700]   But right at the end, it's only one phrase.
[00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:23.460]   All the other events of Heisekai's reign,
[00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:26.740]   all his achievements, and he mentioned this.
[00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:30.860]   He made a water pool, and a water tunnel,
[00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:34.020]   and he brought water into the city from the Gihon Spring.
[00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:35.980]   Outside of the city, into the city,
[00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:38.580]   in order to prepare for the Assyrian siege.
[00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:45.420]   Now, for such a great water engineering project,
[00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:51.260]   it's very interesting, the Bible only has one statement.
[00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:57.020]   All the stories of Heisekai, recorded in the Bible,
[00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:59.180]   are not about his human effort.
[00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:03.740]   Because if you read the story,
[00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:07.740]   you understand eventually the Assyrians came
[00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:09.020]   and besieged the city.
[00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:15.980]   And almost Jerusalem fell because of the Assyrians.
[00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:20.620]   But you read the record of King Heisekai,
[00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:27.220]   at the day of distress, he went to the temple.
[00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:32.100]   He went to the temple of Jerusalem to pray.
[00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:35.180]   To pray for deliverance.
[00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:39.460]   To pray that God would help him and to deliver him.
[00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:42.180]   Now what a contrast.
[00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:46.500]   Because tons of money and tons of effort
[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:48.580]   go into ducking the water tunnel.
[00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:53.020]   Right, the greatest water project ever in his day.
[00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:57.860]   But even that system, even that water project
[00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:00.780]   did not save him, did not save his nation.
[00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:07.020]   And Heisekai's story is all about the salvation of God.
[00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:09.740]   Only God can save.
[00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:13.420]   Humans cannot save.
[00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:14.980]   Have you ever thought about it?
[00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:19.660]   Like the days of Heisekai, he spent tons of effort
[00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:24.660]   in order to defend himself, to prepare for coming crisis.
[00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:28.940]   We do that too, right?
[00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:32.740]   How much time have we invest, think about it.
[00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:36.860]   How much time have we invest into our 401k,
[00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:40.060]   into our pension, in thinking about our future?
[00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:43.740]   Thinking about how we prepare for, I don't know,
[00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:48.740]   retirement or days of distress, right?
[00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:53.820]   How to prepare for any crisis that we can think of.
[00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:58.100]   The medical insurance in the United States,
[00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:00.300]   it's such a mess, right?
[00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:04.980]   But we have to spend so much energy, so much worries
[00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:07.340]   in order to prepare for that, right?
[00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:09.860]   Human efforts.
[00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:15.460]   The story of Heisekai, the biblical record,
[00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:19.260]   give us another perspective.
[00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:23.900]   Yes, you should prepare.
[00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:26.620]   Yes, you should do all that you can
[00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:29.180]   in order to defend yourself.
[00:34:29.180 --> 00:34:32.300]   But ultimately, you should not forget,
[00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:37.140]   it is Yahweh who saves, it is Jesus who saves.
[00:34:37.140 --> 00:34:41.060]   I'll tell you the story and then I'm gonna end.
[00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:43.260]   Years ago, I was in Vancouver.
[00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:47.060]   I was a young pastor.
[00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:49.900]   And you know, sometimes we do a pastoral visit
[00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:53.060]   to different families and different people.
[00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:57.420]   I remember it was in the late '90s.
[00:34:57.420 --> 00:35:01.620]   And I was in Vancouver, and there were many rich people
[00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:02.460]   in Vancouver.
[00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:05.340]   Oh, they're so rich.
[00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:09.020]   You know, in fact, I was a young pastor
[00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:11.180]   and I was taking care of a youth group.
[00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:16.180]   And one of my students, he lives alone in a big mansion.
[00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:20.500]   It's bought by parents from Hong Kong,
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:21.660]   but they don't stay there.
[00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:23.340]   Only the kids stay there, right?
[00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:26.260]   17-year-old, 18-year-old, crazy.
[00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:27.100]   I went to his house.
[00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:28.500]   I really like to go to his house
[00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:31.780]   because you walk into his mansion,
[00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:36.140]   the huge living space is occupied by a snooker table.
[00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:39.820]   You know the billiard?
[00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:42.180]   The snooker table?
[00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:43.380]   You know the pool table?
[00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:47.220]   Pool that you have a stick and then you poke the ball.
[00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:49.300]   You know that table?
[00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:51.140]   But the huge size ones, right?
[00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:52.380]   The huge size.
[00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:55.500]   So we go to his house and we play snooker, right?
[00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:56.700]   We play billiard.
[00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:58.300]   It's just that rich, right?
[00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:02.980]   I remember one time I was arranged to go
[00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:05.900]   to one of the other businessmen.
[00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:08.380]   Went to visit him.
[00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:13.380]   And we went to his house and talked to him about gospel
[00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:17.580]   to share with him what Jesus has done for us.
[00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:19.380]   You know how he look at me?
[00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:22.180]   I still remember how he respond to me
[00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:23.580]   because he's richer than me.
[00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:28.420]   He's probably, I guess he's more good looking than I am.
[00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:31.540]   He's successful.
[00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:32.940]   He got the family.
[00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:36.900]   He got all, everything intact, right?
[00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:38.940]   I mean, he said, "I have nothing to worry about.
[00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:42.140]   "Don't talk to me about death and stuff."
[00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:42.980]   Right?
[00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:47.540]   What Jesus has done for, to him, Jesus is a poor man.
[00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:48.380]   Right?
[00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:52.780]   To him, the gospel is, what, it sucks, right?
[00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:53.820]   It sucks.
[00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:57.940]   Because compared to him, he has the best of the world.
[00:36:57.940 --> 00:36:59.140]   Right?
[00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:01.780]   So I talked to him and kind of being looked down
[00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:04.380]   and kind of being, you know, he didn't yell at me
[00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:09.380]   but I can tell he's pretty, the despising tone and look.
[00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:11.540]   And I left, right?
[00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:12.380]   I left.
[00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:18.340]   And that was one of the worst moment in my ministry.
[00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:21.380]   You know, I have doubt, what am I doing here?
[00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:23.940]   (laughing)
[00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:25.980]   Some years later, some years later,
[00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:31.180]   you know, one of his family members called us and said,
[00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:34.060]   "Hey, can you visit my dad?"
[00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:36.260]   Which is that guy, the businessman.
[00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:40.940]   About three or four years later, I visited him again.
[00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:45.500]   He had cancer, last stage.
[00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:49.260]   We remembered the contrast.
[00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:53.860]   We remember the contrast, his tone and his look.
[00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:59.160]   Before, he was successful and despising.
[00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:04.580]   Two or three years later, because he had been diagnosed
[00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:06.740]   with last stage of cancer, liver cancer,
[00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:10.260]   his tone totally changed.
[00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:13.020]   His perspective totally changed.
[00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:17.020]   At that point, we explained to him the gospel.
[00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:20.620]   We explained to him what Jesus has done for us.
[00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:24.580]   We explained to him the hope that we have,
[00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:26.580]   beyond death, right?
[00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:30.740]   As you can tell, when crisis hit,
[00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:35.200]   you cannot be proud anymore, right?
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:38.380]   You cannot be prideful of your achievement,
[00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:42.280]   of your human effort, because someday we're gonna fade away.
[00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:47.460]   All we can do, the best we can do right now,
[00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:50.340]   is to delay our response.
[00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:52.020]   Don't think about it, right?
[00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:52.940]   Well, we don't have to think about it.
[00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:54.700]   Have you ever thought about tomorrow
[00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:56.660]   you're gonna be diagnosed with cancer?
[00:38:57.780 --> 00:38:58.620]   You won't, right?
[00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:02.780]   All you care about is, okay, today, tonight,
[00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:05.380]   we're gonna have a big feast, right?
[00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:07.460]   Yeah, we're gonna eat, and then we're gonna sleep well,
[00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:09.380]   and tomorrow we go to work, right?
[00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:11.780]   All we need to think about is this, right?
[00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:15.140]   To delay our response to the most important things
[00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:16.780]   in our lives.
[00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:18.260]   Do we have hope beyond death?
[00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:23.180]   Jesus saves, and only Jesus saves.
[00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:28.300]   That is what the story of Hezekiah is all about.
[00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:33.180]   You can spend all your budget in your military defense,
[00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:37.020]   in your health insurance, in your achievement.
[00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:40.900]   You can plan your education, you can plan everything, right?
[00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:42.440]   But only Yahweh saves.
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:45.240]   Don't forget about that.
[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:50.300]   The salvation of Jesus Christ is so great of a salvation
[00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:53.180]   that we can have life beyond death,
[00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:54.540]   and this is eternal life.
[00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:56.820]   Right?
[00:39:56.820 --> 00:39:59.580]   Yes, we need to prepare, we need to go to work,
[00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:02.380]   but don't forget, we need to worship.
[00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:04.660]   We need to worship God and follow Him.
[00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:07.420]   We need to give thanks, right?
[00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:11.780]   We need to do the will of God, because we belong to Him,
[00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:13.740]   and we know only Jesus saves.
[00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:15.700]   All right, we're gonna end here,
[00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:17.740]   and we're gonna pray together.
[00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:20.580]   May this be a reminder to all of us
[00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:23.220]   how great a salvation that we have in Jesus.
[00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:25.060]   Let us all pray.
[00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:29.380]   Father God, we give you thanks for saving us,
[00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:31.380]   for redeeming us.
[00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:35.020]   Yes, all the human achievement that we can do,
[00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:40.460]   yes, we need to be responsible with our lives.
[00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:42.020]   We need to plan, we need to arrange,
[00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:47.020]   we need to implement our responsibilities,
[00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:51.020]   but ultimately, let us not forget that only you save.
[00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:53.860]   And thank you for your great love.
[00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:55.620]   Thank you for your grace.
[00:40:55.620 --> 00:41:00.060]   And be reminded that we are your people.
[00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:02.980]   Be reminded, we need to praise you.
[00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:06.740]   We need to give thanks to you, to follow you.
[00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:10.460]   Thank you for being our leader.
[00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:12.940]   Thank you for being our Lord.
[00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:15.380]   And lead our life in the coming week.
[00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:20.380]   And let us not be forgetful that we can stand in your grace
[00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:25.420]   to relate to you in our family, in our campuses,
[00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:27.980]   in our work, we're gonna glorify you.
[00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:31.340]   In Christ's name, we pray.
[00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:34.500]   Well, thank you very much, and I wanna see you next week,
[00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:36.380]   and let's worship together.
[00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:38.420]   Let's worship God and serve him together.
[00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:40.380]   God bless you.
