[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   - Pastor Mark, thank you very much, welcome.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.400]   My name is Tommy Lee,
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.960]   and I'm born and raised here in the city of Chicago.
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.060]   So 44 years old, been here,
[00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.100]   living here on the South side of Chicago,
[00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.500]   graduate from Washington University in St. Louis
[00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.560]   over at business school.
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.680]   And then for about 10 years, I built cell towers.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.040]   But during that period of time, I said,
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.400]   Lord, what is it that you want me to do?
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.040]   Is it to be a pastor?
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.440]   Because I've always wanted to do full-time ministry
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.400]   and serve you.
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.880]   And so at night, I went to seminary.
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.000]   I went to Moody Theological Seminary for about four years.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.960]   And then after that, I graduated
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.840]   and I was a pastor for about three years.
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.420]   And through that, I realized,
[00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.000]   God, you did not call me to be a pastor.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.040]   That just was not my skill.
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.320]   That was not how you've gifted me to do it.
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.340]   And so now in the last 12 years,
[00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.240]   I get a chance to utilize some of my strengths,
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.760]   utilizing some of my experience in the business world,
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.840]   in the ministry world.
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.840]   So I get a chance to lead four different organizations,
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.720]   whether it's at Resource Global and at the Growth Center
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.640]   and different other organizations
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.760]   to continue to integrate how God has gifted me.
[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.480]   And that really is the whole idea,
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.180]   the theme today that we're gonna talk about
[00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.680]   for those who are in-person,
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.600]   those who are watching online.
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.120]   What does it mean for us to be Christ in the world?
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.120]   God is giving you a story.
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.960]   All of us have a unique story.
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.560]   Our stories are different.
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.880]   But within those stories,
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.600]   there's chapters of the whole idea
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.000]   of chapters of a role that God leads all of us.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.760]   And there is a journey that he uses
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.000]   as he continues to develop our passions
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.480]   and our strengths to ultimately follow him.
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.040]   And today we're gonna look at a specific story today.
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.920]   The story of David and Solomon.
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.360]   That as David dies,
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.520]   he leaves him with three simple words,
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.880]   three simple phrases that Solomon needs to understand
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.240]   in order to be a successful king.
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.120]   And that's what we're gonna look at today.
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.120]   And so before we turn on,
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.000]   you know, the last,
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.280]   I've been with you all for three times already.
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.760]   And the last three times I've talked about the history
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.200]   and life of David.
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.000]   And the whole story started,
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.200]   which leads us to this point.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.320]   David is a young shepherd boy.
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.320]   Samuel is told by God that Saul is no longer the king
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.360]   and Samuel, I need you to go to Bethlehem.
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.520]   And I need you to choose the next king.
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.400]   Samuel goes to Bethlehem and there he meets Jesse.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.720]   And Jesse parades his son
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.200]   and Samuel looks at his oldest son comes in
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.240]   and the Lord tells him,
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.520]   do not look at the outward appearances,
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.600]   but the Lord looks at the heart.
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.800]   None of the brothers,
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.960]   the older brothers are suitable to become king.
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.560]   Samuel then asked Jesse,
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.520]   is there someone else?
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.920]   He ushers in the youngest boy.
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.680]   David is in the shepherd field.
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.040]   He's in the sheep,
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.920]   tending the sheep in the field.
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.240]   So he brings them in.
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.000]   And there he is anointed as king.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.960]   If you are on the side,
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.560]   now, if you ever get a chance,
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.360]   there's this lady by the name of Dr. Laverne Tolbert.
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.000]   And she wrote this nice little pamphlet that says,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.160]   the title, I serve you just as my mother did.
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.440]   And it looks into the Jewish history
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.440]   of why David is so faithful to God.
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.520]   And he makes one phrase in the Psalms.
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.960]   He says, I serve you just as my mother did.
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.960]   And we talk and we look at the faithfulness of David
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.960]   all throughout scripture.
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.640]   And that's what God is using him.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.840]   That's what God has seen in his life.
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.880]   Story goes on.
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.480]   Another sermon that I did with you guys,
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.800]   David and Goliath.
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.120]   All of you guys are familiar
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.360]   with the story of David and Goliath.
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.400]   David battles the giant because he is sent,
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.120]   he wasn't even chosen to be a soldier.
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.360]   He is sent by his father to go deliver food
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.080]   over to his brothers.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.880]   And there he sees Goliath.
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.120]   And he sees the Philistines coming against the Israelites.
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.680]   And as we talked about,
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.400]   the reason why the Philistines are attacking the Israelites
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.520]   is the Israelites control the passageway
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.560]   to the Jordanian Valley.
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.360]   In order for them to get past the Jordanian
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.000]   and control the passage,
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.840]   they have to get rid of the Israelites.
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.800]   David is the only one brave enough
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.440]   to fight the Goliath the champion.
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.080]   And ironically, Saul, who is the King of Israel,
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.000]   is a Benjamite.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.560]   And one of the things that we talked about is
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.080]   what do Benjamites do?
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.040]   They're experts in the slingshot.
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.200]   But Saul did not think of the slingshot.
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.560]   Saul is afraid of Goliath.
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.600]   And so David kills him with the slingshot.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.200]   Now, you all think that the story after that is
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.560]   happy ever ending, right?
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.840]   And as a result, David ascends to become King
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:58.800]   and story is over.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.680]   No, it actually doesn't.
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.840]   The story of 1 Samuel tells us then
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.440]   David is now chased by Saul because everyone loves David.
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.680]   Songs are written about David.
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.280]   Messages, everything.
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.160]   Everyone is a fan of David, except Saul.
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.360]   And Saul ends up whining to kill David.
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.360]   And so as a result, from 1 Samuel all the way to 22,
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.360]   about 17 to 22, it tells us the story of David running.
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.760]   David runs to his wife or actually more so before that,
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.360]   David loses his job.
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.440]   Because Saul no longer wants him to work for him.
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.720]   He tries to kill him.
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.720]   He runs to his wife, Michal.
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.200]   Well, Michal is married to Saul's,
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.600]   is married, Michal is a daughter of Saul.
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.520]   So he can't stay there.
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.080]   He runs to his mentor, Samuel.
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.960]   Well, eventually Saul finds him there and he has to leave.
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.960]   He runs to his best friend, Jonathan, who is the son of Saul.
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.680]   Well, eventually he can't go there.
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.840]   Everything he could depend on from his job,
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.240]   from his wife to his mentor, to his best friend,
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.120]   things that he could depend on are all gone.
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.160]   All these crutches are taken away from him.
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.200]   You know where he ends up?
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.480]   He ends up in the city of Gath,
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.400]   the home of the Philistines, the home of Goliath,
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.960]   who he just killed.
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.800]   And he ends up pretending to be a crazy man.
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.360]   After that, he can't stay there.
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:39.360]   He ends up in 1 Samuel 22, in the cave of a dulem by himself.
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:44.760]   Everything is gone.
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.880]   All the stories, all the songs,
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.080]   all of his crutches are all gone.
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.960]   That's where David is.
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.680]   And he writes, if you guys have a slide,
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:58.600]   he writes Psalm 57 and he writes Psalm 142.
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.760]   And there in 142, if you get a chance,
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.760]   let's take a look at 142, extra 142, is this.
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.600]   Next slide.
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:12.440]   Psalm 142, I cry out to you, O Lord.
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.600]   Yeah, I cry to you, O Lord.
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.640]   I say you are my refuge,
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.360]   my portion in the land of the living.
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:23.400]   Attend to my cry, for I am brought very low.
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.720]   Deliver me from my persecution,
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.680]   for they are too strong for me.
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.560]   Bring me out of the prison,
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.600]   that I may give thanks to your name.
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.200]   The righteous will surround me,
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:38.320]   for you will deal bountifully with me.
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.160]   All his crutches are gone,
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.800]   and he has no one else to depend on,
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.640]   but the Lord, as he wrestles by himself
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.400]   in the cave of Doolam.
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.880]   The Lord needed him to learn that journey
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.320]   of what it means to depend on him.
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:56.760]   That David, when all the crutches are gone,
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:59.560]   when all the people that you could depend on are gone,
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.320]   can you still have faith and trust in me?
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.520]   David had to learn that lesson.
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.680]   Once he learns that lesson,
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.360]   God brings a community around him.
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.680]   He now then becomes king.
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:13.320]   And not only does he become any king,
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:17.440]   he becomes one of the greatest kings in history.
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:21.640]   The greatest king Israel has ever seen, second to Jesus.
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.480]   But yet, everything doesn't go well, does it?
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.720]   He makes a serious mistake.
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.680]   The man after God's own heart makes a serious mistake.
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:32.040]   The biggest mistake that he makes is Bathsheba.
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:34.080]   He has an affair with Bathsheba.
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.920]   A son is born through Solomon.
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:40.040]   He ends up killing Bathsheba's husband, Uriah the Hittite.
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:42.080]   He doesn't make a lot of good decisions.
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.600]   And he has to learn to deal with the consequences
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.600]   and the repercussions of his sin.
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.720]   And that will affect his legacy.
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.080]   That will continue to affect his kingdom
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.360]   and what history writes about him.
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:56.120]   And so now the story ends.
[00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:00.280]   And now we are over in 1 Kings 2.
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:03.560]   David is now an old man.
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.480]   Solomon, his youngest son,
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.200]   who is the son of Bathsheba and David,
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.600]   is gonna become king.
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.000]   And we all know about Solomon.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.280]   One of the wisest kings in history.
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:16.640]   David sits down with him.
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.880]   And he gives him these three phrases.
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:21.840]   When David's time drew near,
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:26.200]   he commanded Solomon, his son, saying,
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:29.840]   "I am about to go the way of all of the earth.
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:33.740]   "Be strong and show yourself a man.
[00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.720]   "And keep the charge of the Lord."
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:39.240]   Be strong, show yourself a man,
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.920]   and keep the charge of the Lord,
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:44.480]   walking in his ways and keeping his statues,
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.760]   his commandments, his rules, and his testimonies,
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.600]   as it is written in the Law of Moses,
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:54.400]   "That you may prosper in all that you do
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.440]   "and wherever you turn."
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.840]   And that's what we're gonna talk about,
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.280]   is three simple phrases.
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.320]   Not gonna spend too much time breaking out the verse.
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:06.280]   I wanna talk about what those verses mean
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:07.400]   in our culture today,
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.080]   not only for those who are sitting here
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.400]   in Chicago, Illinois,
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:11.560]   but those who are watching it
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:13.000]   from different parts of the world.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.280]   What do the phrases, be strong,
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.580]   show yourself a man,
[00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:20.000]   and walk in his ways,
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.540]   mean for us as Christ followers,
[00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:24.360]   each and every single day?
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.800]   What does it mean in our work?
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.280]   What does it mean in our family life?
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:28.920]   What does it mean in our personal life?
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.380]   And that's what we're gonna talk about today.
[00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:33.520]   Be strong, show yourself a man,
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:36.120]   walk in his ways.
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.800]   First one, be strong.
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.880]   One of the things, a couple months ago,
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.520]   or actually probably about a month ago,
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.000]   my wife is a first grade teacher
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   here in Chinatown in Chicago Public Schools.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.800]   About, man, about one o'clock,
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.800]   I'm on the Zoom call doing interview.
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.400]   And I get a text from my wife saying,
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.860]   "Our school is on lockdown.
[00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:03.820]   "There is a shooter somewhere inside the school
[00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:06.520]   "or outside the school, no one knows."
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:07.560]   That's it.
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:10.320]   And so I'm on this Zoom call,
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.960]   and I call her back right away.
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:15.040]   Nothing, get nothing.
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:17.480]   I go back to my work at three o'clock,
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.400]   she calls me up,
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:20.720]   and she says to us,
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:24.400]   "There was somebody killed right outside our school.
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:26.840]   "And Tommy, I think the person who was killed
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.880]   "is the father of our closest friend.
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.640]   "The Lamb family who are pastors
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:35.280]   "right next door to this church,
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.760]   "their father and father-in-law were killed,
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:41.320]   "was killed and shot 22 times
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:44.220]   "by an individual for no reason at all,
[00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:46.180]   "but just driving down Chinatown,
[00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:47.920]   "sees them, shoots them,
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:50.920]   "gets out and shoots them in their 20-something times.
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:54.480]   "And now that pastor and his family,
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:57.380]   "the pastor and his family who had to counsel people
[00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:59.820]   "all the time about how to deal with grief,
[00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:03.500]   "talk to them about how to deal with trials and tough times,
[00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:07.740]   "they are now the ones dealing with that grief.
[00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:10.240]   "They are now dealing with that tragedy."
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.580]   In the weeks ahead, in the weeks now,
[00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:15.300]   I've gotten the chance to spend a lot of time
[00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:16.980]   with the family.
[00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:18.380]   I sit with the daughter a lot,
[00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:19.700]   and we sit there on Friday nights,
[00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:22.340]   I see them quite a lot on Friday nights.
[00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:25.120]   And she tells me about how life is now,
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.500]   that her father has now been murdered.
[00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:29.020]   Her mother is now dealing,
[00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:32.380]   because literally her husband went to get a newspaper,
[00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:35.220]   walked three blocks to get a newspaper.
[00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:37.780]   On his way home, he never returned home
[00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:39.520]   because he was shot.
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:41.900]   And she's dealing with the grief.
[00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:45.100]   And the daughter tells me, "Tommy, every day,
[00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:49.100]   "I remember the last conversation I had with my dad.
[00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:52.560]   "I just replay the conversation over and over
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:54.580]   "and over again.
[00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:56.940]   "And you know what makes it hard?
[00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:01.760]   "I'm trying to figure out and deal with not being angry,
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:05.020]   "not being bitter against certain cultures
[00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:06.640]   "or certain things that are happening.
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:10.520]   "I'm trying to choose not to be angry at God."
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:16.500]   One of the things of being strong in our faith
[00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:20.260]   is that we continue to embrace compassion and love,
[00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:25.140]   and that we never, ever allow anger
[00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:27.060]   and resentment overcome us.
[00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:29.400]   Whether it's the problems that we see in our world,
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:31.000]   or whether it's in our personal life,
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.840]   we continue to make a choice to embrace compassion and love.
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:40.860]   And you never allow anger and resentment to overcome you.
[00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:44.900]   And in today's society, that's a hard time, isn't it?
[00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:47.580]   For some of us who are sitting here as Asians,
[00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:50.780]   I can understand that you see some of the Asian violence
[00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:53.260]   going on in today's society as well, too.
[00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:55.260]   Recently, I was driving down 35th Street.
[00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.140]   Many of you guys come down 35th Street,
[00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:58.380]   you get off the highway.
[00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:00.860]   I live about five minutes away from here.
[00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:02.540]   I'm driving down 35th Street,
[00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:06.000]   and there's a car weaving in and out, in and out,
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.420]   and it gets right behind me and wants to turn.
[00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:13.580]   But well, I have a no turn on red, so I am not turning.
[00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:16.880]   A guy comes in, again, it's an African American guy.
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:20.240]   And he comes right back to me, he rolls down his window,
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:25.240]   and he says to me, "This is why we effing shoot you people."
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.420]   And I was shocked, and I said to the Lord,
[00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:30.100]   and he drives off, and I left wondering,
[00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:33.700]   Lord, what does it mean to love
[00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:35.840]   the people who are hard to love?
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:40.860]   What does it mean for us to learn to forgive
[00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:44.980]   as you forgave, because you had to deal
[00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:46.860]   with the ultimate sacrifice.
[00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:50.380]   Learning what it means to have compassion and love
[00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:53.260]   does not mean that we're a stepping stool for everyone.
[00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.820]   It does not mean that people get to do whatever they want.
[00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:57.740]   As Christians, we say, oh yeah, that's fine,
[00:14:57.740 --> 00:14:59.120]   we forgive them.
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:02.500]   Being strong means that we love and have a compassion
[00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:06.980]   for everyone, but we do fight the injustices in our life.
[00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:10.420]   That we do stand up and call out those injustices
[00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:11.260]   in our life.
[00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.700]   I love, we just celebrate Dr. King, right?
[00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:15.860]   I love the words of Dr. King, and if you guys
[00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:18.700]   could put that quote on the screen as well, too.
[00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:22.100]   Dr. King says this, I'm sorry about this,
[00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:23.860]   I should've made the font a little bit bigger,
[00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:25.460]   but I'll read it over to you.
[00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:27.820]   He says this, "Wherever the early Christians
[00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:31.380]   "entered a town, the power structure of God disturbed
[00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:33.260]   "and immediately sought to convict them
[00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:37.700]   "for being disturbers of the peace and outside agitators.
[00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:40.100]   "But they went on with the conviction that they were,
[00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:44.860]   "it was a colony of heaven, and they had to obey God
[00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:46.740]   "rather than men.
[00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:50.380]   "They were small in number, but big in commitment.
[00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:54.660]   "They were too God intoxicated to be astronomically
[00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:56.220]   "intimidated.
[00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:58.860]   "They brought an end to such ancient evils
[00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:02.660]   "as infanticide and gladiatorial contest."
[00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:06.700]   Being a Christ follower means that we continue to love
[00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:10.180]   every single death, people with despite their skin color,
[00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:13.140]   despite their sexual orientation, despite all of that.
[00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:16.820]   It means that we love people as Christ would love them.
[00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:19.740]   But what it does mean is that we do stand up
[00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:22.500]   to those injustices that we see, that we continue
[00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:25.580]   to make a difference in the cities and structures
[00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:27.620]   that we make, that as Christ followers,
[00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:29.900]   that we make it a better place.
[00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:33.460]   That our workplaces, our homes, our cities,
[00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:36.020]   our communities, whether it's in Chicago,
[00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:38.300]   whether those who are watching from other parts
[00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:41.460]   of the country, that you are integrating your faith
[00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:43.180]   into all that you do.
[00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:49.060]   But you choose to do it with the spirit of love
[00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:53.860]   and compassion, and that you never make decisions
[00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:56.620]   out of anger and resentment.
[00:16:56.620 --> 00:17:00.300]   And that's hard to do, isn't it?
[00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:01.660]   That is hard to do.
[00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:02.980]   I recently had the board meeting
[00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:05.020]   for my organization Resource Global.
[00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:05.900]   We just sat here.
[00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.620]   And the board sat down with me and says,
[00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:10.940]   "Tommy, how's your family?"
[00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:11.980]   Great, great, great.
[00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:14.980]   But they said, "How are you doing spiritually?"
[00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:18.900]   And I said to them, "I'm struggling spiritually."
[00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:21.420]   You know why I'm struggling spiritually?
[00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:23.700]   It's been hard to love people.
[00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:25.860]   Because the more I sit in ministry,
[00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:27.900]   it's been now 15 years now,
[00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:30.620]   and the more I get involved in ministry,
[00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:32.940]   the more I deal with pastors,
[00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:34.620]   pastors that I've read in books,
[00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:36.780]   pastors that I've listened to on podcasts,
[00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:39.140]   the more I interact with Christians,
[00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:42.220]   they're hard to love.
[00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:45.780]   They take advantage of you every single time.
[00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:47.940]   They find ways to cheat you every single time.
[00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:50.780]   And I've been so surprised by that.
[00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:53.100]   And I said to the board,
[00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:54.460]   "I've grown disenchanted.
[00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:57.340]   I have to choose to see beyond that
[00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:00.020]   and see Christ in everything I do.
[00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:02.260]   And it's a choice that I have to make.
[00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:04.460]   And it has not been easy."
[00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:06.940]   So for us, one of the things is be strong.
[00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:09.100]   To really be able to continue,
[00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:10.780]   to really be able to love the Lord,
[00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:13.580]   to have compassion in all that we do,
[00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:17.700]   and never lead out of anger or resentment.
[00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:20.020]   Secondly, show yourself a man.
[00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:21.860]   Two things I'll say about that.
[00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:24.140]   Show yourself a man is number one example,
[00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:26.740]   is be willing to take ownership
[00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:30.660]   of your mistakes and sins in a very humble way.
[00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:32.940]   One of the ways of showing yourself a man
[00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:34.500]   is that we are all grown up.
[00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:36.020]   It's not like my two-year-old daughter
[00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:37.380]   who doesn't like to share,
[00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:39.260]   and now I have to sit here and talk to her
[00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:40.500]   about what it means to share.
[00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:41.340]   She's two years old.
[00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:42.180]   She's learning.
[00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:43.180]   All of us are adults.
[00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:45.140]   It's being willing to take ownership
[00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:48.380]   of our mistakes and sins in a very humble way,
[00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:50.420]   knowing that we're not perfect,
[00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:53.780]   knowing that we're gonna make mistakes.
[00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:57.660]   But when we make those mistakes,
[00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:01.220]   are we willing to take ownership of it?
[00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:03.980]   We look at David all throughout scripture.
[00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:05.380]   A man after God's own heart,
[00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:08.300]   and he made a lot of mistakes.
[00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:12.460]   And he had to take ownership of those mistakes.
[00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:16.860]   Peter was always putting his foot in his mouth all the time.
[00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:18.540]   Paul had to deal with the fact
[00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:22.580]   that he had to sit there and deal with Christians
[00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:24.140]   when he was a Gentile,
[00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:26.500]   and he messed with them all the time,
[00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:27.980]   and he persecuted all the time.
[00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:30.340]   He had to live with that guilt
[00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:32.580]   after he became a Christ follower.
[00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:36.140]   I have two friends, two very successful individuals,
[00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:37.700]   and these two individuals,
[00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:40.580]   married couple, husband, wife, they were Chinese.
[00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:43.060]   They were extremely successful in the sense
[00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:46.500]   that they graduated from a prestigious university
[00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:48.380]   over in California.
[00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:50.180]   Then they worked for a tech company.
[00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:52.460]   Many of us used their computers.
[00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:56.100]   They worked for a very extremely influential tech company
[00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:58.300]   and was very successful.
[00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:03.180]   They then went to get their MBAs over here at university.
[00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:07.660]   Again, and then from that point, after their MBAs,
[00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:10.900]   they got hired for an athletic shoe company
[00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:14.340]   that many of us wear their shoes,
[00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:19.020]   and also was in a very prestigious position.
[00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:23.620]   The wife specifically oversaw all of the marketing
[00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:25.100]   for the World Cup,
[00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:27.100]   and eventually she was gonna be promoted
[00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:31.180]   for vice president of marketing in Asia.
[00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:33.140]   Right, great story.
[00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:36.100]   It all came crashing down.
[00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:37.900]   Why?
[00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:42.300]   The husband got caught selling shoes on eBay.
[00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:48.620]   A guy who earned over $300,000 a year
[00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:50.820]   thought it would be exciting
[00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:54.380]   to make a little money selling shoes on eBay,
[00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:56.380]   and after a while, you get caught,
[00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.900]   and he got fired right away.
[00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:02.580]   The wife who worked with them, HR called her in,
[00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:05.260]   and he said, "Did you know any of this
[00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:06.820]   "was going on with your husband?"
[00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:08.020]   "Yes, I did."
[00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:12.620]   "At any point, did you actually report this to HR?"
[00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:13.980]   "No, I didn't."
[00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:16.620]   "Hey, she had just gotten promotion.
[00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:18.700]   "She just got all her papers get promoted,
[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:20.140]   "vice president of marketing for Asia.
[00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:22.540]   "They were gonna move to Hong Kong."
[00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:24.900]   He said, "You didn't report it.
[00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:27.180]   "You're fired as well, too."
[00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:30.380]   Instantly overnight, everything that they had worked for,
[00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:31.220]   gone.
[00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:34.540]   They struggled through their marriage.
[00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:36.540]   They struggled with identity.
[00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:39.700]   They struggled with the decisions they had to make,
[00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:41.820]   but they had to rebuild their life.
[00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:43.220]   One of the things I've appreciated
[00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:45.660]   about this particular couple is they admitted
[00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:49.060]   with the husband, "I made some mistakes, some bad mistakes."
[00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:52.340]   How do we then rebuild our life?
[00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:55.140]   How do we humbly make amends for our mistake,
[00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:57.300]   and those were dumb mistakes,
[00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:59.900]   but rebuild our life and continue to go on?
[00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:03.620]   All of us are gonna make mistakes.
[00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:07.740]   Are we humble enough to take ownership of our mistakes
[00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:10.780]   and sins in a very humble way?
[00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:12.860]   The other thing to be strong is this one.
[00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:16.620]   Be willing to listen to voices around you
[00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:19.180]   because you're not perfect,
[00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:21.620]   and we all need accountability.
[00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:24.060]   For Solomon, if he was to be strong,
[00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:25.780]   to show yourself a man,
[00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:28.940]   Solomon was the brightest of all the kings.
[00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:32.540]   Solomon knew, and he called the shots.
[00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:35.540]   Was he willing to listen to the voices around him
[00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:38.780]   because you're not perfect,
[00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:41.580]   and we all need accountability?
[00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:46.220]   I travel a lot for my work,
[00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:47.940]   and during the fall, I was gone a lot
[00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:49.380]   for about six weeks straight.
[00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:52.540]   When I got home, I noticed a distance
[00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:53.940]   between I have a two-year-old daughter
[00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:55.740]   and a seven-year-old daughter,
[00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:58.660]   and I noticed that they were always going to their mom
[00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:01.100]   all the time, and they kinda ignored me.
[00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:03.100]   My wife says to me, "Hey, Tommy,
[00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:06.100]   "you've been gone quite a lot,
[00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:08.540]   "and when you're at home, you also have meetings.
[00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:09.500]   "You're out early in the morning.
[00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:11.060]   "You have evenings, all that stuff.
[00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:13.180]   "Have you noticed that the girls
[00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:15.060]   "aren't coming to you anymore?
[00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:18.540]   "You need to spend more time with your girls."
[00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:21.140]   You know what the easy, justifiable thing is?
[00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:22.340]   I've been to Nairobi.
[00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:24.780]   I had to come back and do this and this and this.
[00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:26.700]   When I come home, I have a late-night meeting
[00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:28.180]   with Jakarta and all that stuff.
[00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:29.820]   Do you not know how hard I work?
[00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:31.220]   You have to deal with it.
[00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:34.700]   Was there truth in what they had to say?
[00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:37.100]   Was there truth in what they had to say?
[00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:39.180]   I come back, and I meet with my team,
[00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:41.100]   and now we've gotten to a point with Resource Global
[00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:44.620]   where over 30 people, big, they sat down with me
[00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:48.740]   and says, "Tommy, as this organization continues to grow,
[00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:52.020]   "we need more structure, and you don't provide
[00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:53.860]   "that structure that we need."
[00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:57.860]   Again, you know what the temptation is, right?
[00:23:57.860 --> 00:23:59.260]   I'm the boss.
[00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:02.820]   Guys, do you not realize I'm trying to make money?
[00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:05.140]   I'm out there meeting with donors,
[00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:07.980]   and I'm trying to make this thing survive.
[00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:11.100]   Is there truth to what they have to say?
[00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:13.660]   Are they speaking any truth?
[00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:17.700]   Can I be humble enough to listen to them?
[00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:21.340]   And so as a result, I had to make changes.
[00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:22.820]   I had to bring in different people
[00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:24.900]   and change their position and admit
[00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:28.100]   that there are certain areas I wasn't good at.
[00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:31.380]   And be okay with that.
[00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:36.900]   I say this all because sometimes it's hard
[00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:38.740]   for us to listen to voices.
[00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:41.300]   And I will say this, for those who are older
[00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:45.340]   who are sitting there, sometimes the Chinese culture,
[00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:47.140]   the Asian culture, especially if you're older,
[00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:49.660]   says you've gotta respect your older elders,
[00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:51.660]   you gotta listen to your elders.
[00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:54.700]   I encourage you, if you're older sitting there,
[00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:56.860]   learn to listen because when you work
[00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:59.980]   with that younger generation, they will actually respect
[00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:02.820]   and honor you more when you take time to listen.
[00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:05.740]   I sit there and talk to my mom all the time,
[00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:08.460]   and she says, "Well, I want everyone to respect me."
[00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:10.500]   But her idea of respect is everyone just listens
[00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:12.100]   and does whatever she says.
[00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:13.340]   But I tell her all the time,
[00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:16.140]   respect is that you communicate.
[00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:18.100]   Respect means that you dialogue
[00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:20.020]   and be willing to admit you're wrong,
[00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:22.220]   that you're not always right.
[00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:24.620]   And so for all of us sitting here,
[00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:28.940]   one, be willing and humble to make mistakes,
[00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:32.540]   but also be willing to listen to the hard things
[00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:37.060]   in your life, the times when you don't want to hear
[00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:40.420]   what people have to say, but is there truth
[00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:44.460]   to what they're saying about you and your character,
[00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:45.980]   even though it's hard to hear?
[00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:49.820]   Solomon had a hard time hearing that.
[00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:53.100]   You know, eventually what was the downfall of Solomon?
[00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:56.060]   He got caught up too much in the love of women.
[00:25:56.060 --> 00:26:00.420]   That became ultimately, his ego became so big
[00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:02.060]   that he stopped listening.
[00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:06.500]   The one of the wisest kings who actually had an opportunity,
[00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:10.700]   I believe because of his talent, surpasses his father, David,
[00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:14.180]   but he refused to listen.
[00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:17.140]   He refused to admit mistakes,
[00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:20.140]   and soon eventually gave in to sin as well too.
[00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:24.580]   Last thing, be strong, show yourself a man,
[00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:25.620]   walk in his ways.
[00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:26.620]   We have a couple minutes left.
[00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:28.580]   I wanna show you a couple of slides here.
[00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:30.660]   I show one slide here.
[00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:36.900]   My friend Andy Crouch talks about this.
[00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:40.460]   He says that as individuals, as human beings,
[00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:44.820]   we approach life with the exploitative attitude.
[00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:49.020]   Our method in life is we wanna take all you can get.
[00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:52.580]   Our attitude is I win, you lose.
[00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:54.860]   We've been taught about that all our life, right?
[00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:56.300]   You gotta take care of yourself.
[00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:57.540]   I hear that quite a lot.
[00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:59.740]   You gotta take care of yourself.
[00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:01.300]   And then once you take care of yourself,
[00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:03.180]   take care of your family.
[00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:06.020]   Then whatever you have left over,
[00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:07.980]   then take care of everyone else.
[00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:11.380]   And so we approach life with this method of,
[00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:12.940]   we're gonna take all you can get.
[00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:14.740]   We gotta think about ourselves.
[00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:17.420]   I win, you lose.
[00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:19.940]   But Andy says this, and let's show the next slide.
[00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:20.980]   He approaches life with this.
[00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:23.980]   He says, as Christ followers, here's our attitude.
[00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:28.900]   All right, oh, yes.
[00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:30.260]   With the ethical attitude,
[00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:35.780]   the approach is do things right.
[00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:39.300]   That our attitude is you win, I win.
[00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:41.060]   Guys, let's keep that up there.
[00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:43.500]   That we approach things with the whole idea
[00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:45.700]   is that you win, I win.
[00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:49.460]   It is not a matter is I take everything I can.
[00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:54.460]   It is the attitude of, it's always others first.
[00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:58.300]   It is always about Christ loving other people.
[00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:01.340]   It is always about you and I being a steward
[00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:03.300]   of what God gives me.
[00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:06.980]   It's a choice that we make every single day
[00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:10.020]   to make sure that the other person wins,
[00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:12.220]   the other person succeeds,
[00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:14.940]   the other person is successful
[00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:19.020]   in everything they do at our expense.
[00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:22.420]   But it's a choice that we have to make.
[00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:24.900]   Solomon had to make a choice.
[00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:27.420]   David had to make a choice.
[00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:30.660]   David made a choice when he chose Bathsheba
[00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:34.260]   when he should have been out with the army battling,
[00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:36.420]   but he chooses himself
[00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:40.100]   and has a fatal mistake with Bathsheba.
[00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:42.820]   Solomon chooses pleasure
[00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:45.500]   as a result destroys his kingdom as well too.
[00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:49.460]   As Christ followers, being Christ in the world
[00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:53.620]   means you approach life with the ethical attitude.
[00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:57.300]   That it is never about other, I mean yourself,
[00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:00.460]   but it is always about others.
[00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:03.620]   It is a decision that you make, not only your heart,
[00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:05.820]   but with your mind to choose that
[00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:09.380]   in every single decision that you make,
[00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:14.380]   it honors God and glorifies God in every single way.
[00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:17.060]   I would say this, and I say this with the young people.
[00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:19.940]   If you're in your mid-20s
[00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:23.860]   and you're just graduating and working in a job,
[00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:25.860]   the decision that you're gonna have to make
[00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:30.060]   for those who are in their young mid-20s to early 30s,
[00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:32.860]   whose life do you belong to?
[00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:34.740]   Before you become rich
[00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:37.060]   and before you start ascending into the corporate world
[00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:39.460]   and all that stuff, whose life do you belong to?
[00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:42.260]   Are you gonna make a decision
[00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:44.020]   that in every aspect of your life,
[00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:46.300]   from your money to your career, to your dreams,
[00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:48.940]   your family life, is all given to the Lord?
[00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:54.060]   Because if you wait until you're successful,
[00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:58.540]   if you wait until things get stabilized,
[00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:01.260]   you'll always give in to the temptation
[00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:03.340]   of choosing yourself.
[00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:07.500]   Being a Christ follower means that we make decisions
[00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:09.540]   that never benefit us.
[00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:13.580]   We make decisions that glorify God in all that we do,
[00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:16.900]   that we are a steward of what God has given us
[00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:21.740]   at our expense, and it's a choice that you have to make.
[00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:25.460]   One last illustration, and I'll wrap up.
[00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:28.540]   I get a chance to travel a lot, all the time.
[00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:31.060]   And one of the countries that I travel to is Nairobi.
[00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:33.340]   I think I've shared a little bit of this illustration,
[00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:35.860]   but let me just build out this illustration at all.
[00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:38.980]   When you go over to Nairobi, there are a lot of streets,
[00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:42.540]   everything is all remodeled, airports, streets, roads,
[00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:44.860]   highways, overpasses, everything.
[00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:48.980]   It's all being funded by the Chinese.
[00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:52.020]   The Chinese are giving so much money to build roads
[00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:54.260]   and infrastructures and technology.
[00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:58.260]   But in the process of that,
[00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:01.340]   they are bribing other people, officials,
[00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:05.580]   and paying them so much money that those who are from,
[00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:07.020]   the Chinese are getting rich,
[00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:10.340]   but the African politicians are also getting rich
[00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:13.380]   at the expense of the people,
[00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:15.900]   because there are still a lot of people who are poor.
[00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:19.780]   What you need is Christ followers in the workspace,
[00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:21.900]   Christ followers in the government,
[00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:24.060]   Christ followers integrating their faith,
[00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:28.180]   choosing others first, never about how much it can make me.
[00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:31.260]   To make a decisions that benefits the country
[00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:35.180]   and our societies and our communities as a whole.
[00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:38.300]   And that's what we need for all of you who are sitting here,
[00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:42.620]   Christ followers that makes a difference in a community.
[00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:45.780]   That when you walk away, wherever you are,
[00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:49.180]   that in your workplace or in your home or in your cities
[00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:50.740]   or in your community,
[00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:54.420]   that community is left in a better position
[00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:58.900]   because you made decisions that didn't benefit you,
[00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:00.860]   but benefit them.
[00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:05.220]   That's what it means to be Christ in the world.
[00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:09.060]   That's what it means to make a difference in the world.
[00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:11.940]   The cross of Christ brought us to where we are.
[00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:13.860]   Christ died for our sins.
[00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:17.380]   Christ is our example in all that we do.
[00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:20.140]   Our job now is to continue to glorify,
[00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:24.540]   to be a steward of what he has given us.
[00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:25.940]   Let's pray.
[00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:28.460]   Father, thank you for all that you do.
[00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:30.660]   Thank you for your words.
[00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:32.020]   Thank you for your leadership.
[00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:33.140]   Thank you for the cross.
[00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:34.500]   Thank you for your grace.
[00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:37.820]   As we remember the words that David gave to Solomon,
[00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:41.620]   be strong, show yourself a man, walk in his ways.
[00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:44.420]   May we take those words and apply that
[00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:45.780]   in our life as well too.
[00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:47.340]   Christ we pray, amen.
