1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,600
 Thank you, I'm excited to be here today.

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,000
 Always love being here at UV and enjoyed the worship.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,240
 Thank you to the singers and musicians who led us, that was really excellent.

4
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,360
 And this morning we're going to be talking about why we're here in general, why we're

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,480
 here.

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,320
 Not just the big existential question, we're not really going to address that.

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,360
 That's a great question and just as a spoiler, the Bible has some really good answers to

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,800
 that question as to why we're here on earth, why we exist, what our purpose is.

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:39,480
 We're going to talk more specifically about why we're here today on a Sunday, why we're

10
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,360
 in church, why are we here in church, why do we gather together, why do we do this and

11
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,480
 what some of the reasons are for that.

12
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,000
 And we're going to look in the third chapter of John.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,600
 As we, before we read this, I'm going to remind us what's going on in the third chapter of

14
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,120
 John, in the third chapter of John, Nicodemus, who's a Pharisee, he's a part of the nobility

15
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,780
 and also the religious leadership in Jerusalem.

16
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:08,120
 He comes to Jesus and he comes at night because he doesn't want anyone to know that he's talking

17
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:14,320
 to Jesus because Jesus is not in favor with the religious leaders, with the Pharisees.

18
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,880
 And he comes to Jesus to ask him these spiritual questions.

19
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:22,120
 So Jesus begins to explain to him about salvation, about how it's the new birth, it's like being

20
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,640
 born again spiritually.

21
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,120
 Jesus talks about the Holy Spirit, he talks about the kingdom of God, he explains some

22
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,680
 really deep stuff to Nicodemus.

23
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:36,040
 And in the middle of this passage, there is John 3, 16, right, the verse that we all know

24
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:42,040
 so well, where Jesus is talking some about the gospel and God's love for us.

25
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,320
 And so that's the, we're going to look at John 3, 16 to 19 today, these verses that

26
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,360
 are right in the middle of this passage, that's the context of what Jesus is talking about.

27
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,400
 But we know this as kind of a summation of the gospel and that's exactly what it is.

28
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,880
 But today we're not just going to look at that piece, we're going to look at what it

29
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,560
 means for us in the church, John 3, 16 to 19.

30
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,800
 So I'm going to pray real quickly and then we'll read these verses together.

31
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:11,720
 God, I just pray that you would be present with us this morning, that you would, through

32
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,000
 the power of the Holy Spirit, really illuminate the scriptures to our hearts, that you would

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,480
 speak to us and that we would hear what you have to say, that people would not hear my

34
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:26,080
 words or my ideas, but that we would hear from you this morning and that your word would

35
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,640
 shape us and change us like it's supposed to and that we would go out from here or from

36
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,520
 wherever we are watching this and be different, be changed and be more like who you want us

37
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,840
 to be, God, in Jesus' name, amen.

38
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,280
 All right, so let's read these verses.

39
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,720
 John 3, 16 to 19, it says, "For God so loved the world that he gave his only son, that

40
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,840
 whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.

41
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,680
 For God did not send his son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the

42
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,340
 world might be saved through him.

43
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:02,480
 Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned

44
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,440
 already because he has not believed in the name of the only son of God.

45
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,280
 And this is the judgment, the light has come into the world and people love the darkness

46
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,440
 rather than the light because their works were evil."

47
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:24,800
 Now, this is an important question for us to consider, why are we here?

48
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,760
 Why do we come to church?

49
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,200
 Why is it a part of our lives?

50
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:35,720
 And if you are not familiar with church or you're not familiar with faith, just initially

51
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,760
 it seems like a strange proposition, right?

52
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,960
 That there would be a day of the week where we would get up and go to a lot of effort,

53
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:48,200
 you know, we take a shower, get dressed, do all those things and get up early, get in

54
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:54,040
 our car and go to a place and gather with other people.

55
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,440
 And honestly, sometimes even the people we gather with, to outsiders it doesn't make

56
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,500
 that much sense, right?

57
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,080
 Because we, a lot of times we're very different.

58
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:07,000
 A lot of times our church gatherings we gather with people who come from different backgrounds

59
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,360
 and different experiences, even different cultures.

60
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,480
 And so, why do we do that?

61
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,400
 Why is it important?

62
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,560
 On the way here this morning, I was a few minutes late getting here because I drove

63
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,320
 past Sauk Stadium, it's right down the street.

64
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,440
 And there was a game today, I'd forgotten they had a home game today, that's why I was

65
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,880
 a few minutes late, because I got caught in some of that traffic.

66
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,880
 But that's something that we all understand, like why do you go to a baseball game?

67
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,000
 Well, because it's fun and you know, they have overpriced food that's really good and

68
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,400
 so that's why you go, you go to enjoy it and have a good time.

69
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,520
 But why are we here?

70
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,400
 Why do we do this?

71
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,600
 Or why would you even, if you're part of the virtual audience, why would you say, "Hey,

72
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,440
 I'm gonna make an appointment in my week, set aside some time to make sure that I tune

73
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:02,040
 in and I listen to some brothers and sisters in Christ worshipping God and I worship with

74
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,840
 them and I listen to the word of God being talked about."

75
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,720
 Why do that?

76
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,480
 It doesn't make a lot of sense on the face of it.

77
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:17,360
 And one of the things that happens sometimes in church is we just kind of take that question

78
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,360
 for granted.

79
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,720
 We don't really think about it or think about the answers to it, we just take it for granted

80
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,620
 and we just show up without ever asking it or we just engage in church.

81
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:34,720
 If you're watching the live stream, maybe just engage without ever asking it.

82
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,520
 Until the day that we find out we don't really have a good answer and then we just stop showing

83
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,520
 up.

84
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,640
 There's no reason to.

85
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,480
 And we know that that actually happens.

86
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,400
 It happens to people in the church.

87
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,280
 The data is really clear on that.

88
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:58,120
 In the decade prior to the COVID-19 pandemic from 2009 to 2019, Pew Research reported that

89
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:05,160
 church attendance dropped in North America, in the US, by 7% during that decade.

90
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:12,580
 And the Barna Research Group, which is another group that does research amongst church goers,

91
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:19,160
 they reported that during the pandemic, 32%, a third of people who identified as practicing

92
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:25,600
 Christians, so these were people who self-identified as serious about faith and about church, related

93
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,040
 that they had stopped attending church either in person or virtually, stopped totally.

94
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,540
 They weren't going in person, but they also weren't connected virtually.

95
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:37,360
 They were just not engaged with church.

96
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,800
 And these statistics are even more stark for young people.

97
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:46,160
 In 2019, the Barna Group published research that said that among 18 to 29-year-olds who

98
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:52,200
 grew up in church, 64% were withdrawing from church involvement as an adult after being

99
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,240
 active as a child or a teen.

100
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:05,280
 So clearly, this is an issue, at least in the US and North America, that people at some

101
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,520
 point decide there's not really a reason for me to be there.

102
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,560
 I'm not sure why I'm there.

103
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,520
 And so they stop showing up.

104
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,520
 They stop being engaged.

105
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:16,560
 And that's why it's really important for us to consider this question thoughtfully and

106
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,520
 biblically, and that's what we're going to try to do this morning.

107
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:24,480
 And I want to start by being honest and saying that there are a lot of problems in church,

108
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:32,520
 and we don't do well to try to ignore those or to try to cover them over.

109
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,920
 In our modern church, especially here in North America, there's a lot of problems.

110
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,920
 There's a lot of mess.

111
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:42,120
 I mean, there's a lot of good reasons to want to disengage and to say, "I'm not sure that

112
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,320
 I want to be there because of some of the things that go on."

113
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:50,280
 At times, instead of reflecting the character of Jesus to the world, the church kind of

114
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:56,480
 stinks, kind of smells bad of selfishness and hypocrisy or dysfunction and conflict

115
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:02,680
 or legalism or materialism and chasing after money, even abuse.

116
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,360
 Those are things that happen in the church.

117
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:10,400
 They shouldn't, and they're dishonoring to God and they're heartbreaking, but they do.

118
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:17,160
 And so we understand why there might be moments for people in church and for us to say, "I

119
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,520
 kind of want to disengage because of what I'm seeing."

120
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,520
 We can all find reasons to withdraw.

121
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,680
 So what reasons are good enough to keep us here?

122
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,520
 Are there reasons that are good enough to keep us here?

123
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,240
 As we think about this initially, you know, a lot of stuff might come to mind, and some

124
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,400
 of those reasons might be partial answers to the question.

125
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,560
 Some of them are a part of the true answer to why we're here, but some of them are just

126
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,940
 incorrect and wrong.

127
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:52,800
 There's a lot of reasons that we come that may not be healthy, and some of them are tied

128
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,440
 to wrong assumptions about what church is.

129
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,460
 And some of those things that we might initially think of, you know, there's obviously sociological

130
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:04,000
 reasons that we can attend church.

131
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,640
 Experts even who are not believers agree that it's good for our mental health and our sense

132
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:17,200
 of well-being and purpose in life to have kind of the purpose that faith gives us and

133
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,800
 to find community in church.

134
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,760
 So there's sociological reasons.

135
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,760
 There's emotional reasons.

136
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:29,100
 Again, according to the Barna Group, most people that regularly attend church report

137
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:34,800
 that they experience enjoyment at church and cite this as a main reason for attending.

138
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:40,460
 Church can make us feel good and help us to get through the week, and we can enjoy the

139
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:44,320
 worship or we can be entertained by things that go on at church.

140
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,800
 Or maybe we just really like to see our friends.

141
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,280
 We get excited about seeing friends and acquaintances that we have at church.

142
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,800
 Well, those things are wonderful.

143
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,600
 Those are great things, but that's not the primary reason we're here.

144
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,420
 That's not the heart of why we come.

145
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:04,100
 Then there are some of us who engage with church, whether it's in person or virtually,

146
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,000
 we do it just because it's a habit, right?

147
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,100
 We've always done it.

148
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,100
 It's a part of our week.

149
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,100
 It's a part of our routine.

150
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,840
 We just do it out of habit.

151
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:20,280
 At times, some of us probably have participated in church out of a sense of obligation.

152
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:24,640
 I grew up in church, so that's been true for me at different times, especially as a young

153
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,640
 person.

154
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:31,320
 I did it because I thought I was supposed to, and I thought it was expected of me, and

155
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,480
 perhaps that's one of the reasons that we participate.

156
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,900
 We feel like our parents or our family members or other friends or people around us or even

157
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:48,340
 the leaders of the church are really expecting us to be a part, and so we do it out of obligation.

158
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:51,420
 And there can be cultural reasons, too.

159
00:10:51,420 --> 00:11:01,060
 Sometimes we feel like that it's just what we do, what people of our cultural class,

160
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:06,980
 social class, our economic class or our group, that's what we do.

161
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:12,600
 Even some people are engaged in church because of their political affiliation, not because

162
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:18,080
 they know Jesus, but just because they think it's what you do when you're a certain type

163
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:22,120
 of person in society.

164
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,220
 And then there's spiritual reasons, too.

165
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:28,580
 We can participate in church because we're trying to justify ourselves in some way, because

166
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:35,940
 we're trying to show that we're a good person, and maybe we're trying to convince ourselves

167
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,940
 of that.

168
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:40,420
 Maybe we're trying to, we know some stuff's not right in our life, and so we're trying

169
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:46,600
 to be like, "Well, I want to be good, and so I guess that means I go to church."

170
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,420
 Or maybe we're trying to convince someone else.

171
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,140
 Maybe we're trying to show other people that we're a good person.

172
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:53,820
 We're like, "Yeah, I'm someone who goes to church.

173
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,100
 I mean, I'm a solid person.

174
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,820
 I'm a churchgoer."

175
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,300
 Or maybe we're even trying to convince God.

176
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:05,380
 Maybe we're trying to earn something with God by showing up at church, and by saying,

177
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:08,540
 "Yeah, God, I'm a good person.

178
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:12,860
 I've been going to church, so shouldn't you answer my prayers, or shouldn't you care about

179
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:17,980
 me more, because I've been trying to do this."

180
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:21,940
 The reality is none of these reasons are really adequate to explain why we're here, and why

181
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:26,340
 we should be here, or to keep us here in the future.

182
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:31,380
 Some of them are true and helpful, like the fact that we can find enjoyment, and encouragement,

183
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,940
 and support, and community.

184
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,460
 That's true, and that's a part of the true reason we're here, and that's a beautiful

185
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,460
 thing.

186
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,600
 But some of them are wrong.

187
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,980
 If we think that going to church justifies us before God or anyone else, that's wrong.

188
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,420
 That's just not true.

189
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:52,700
 And even the best of these answers are really just byproducts of the true answer.

190
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:57,380
 The enjoyment, the blessing, the community we find, that's really a byproduct of the

191
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,380
 true answer.

192
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:01,460
 It's not the answer in full.

193
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:05,460
 So to really find the ultimate answers, we need to go back to God's Word and look at

194
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,460
 this.

195
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,860
 That's what we're going to do together this morning.

196
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:14,540
 And here in verse 16, we see the first part of this answer for us.

197
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:18,660
 We're here because God is there.

198
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,780
 God exists.

199
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:26,860
 That phrase is something that the late theologian Francis Schaeffer used to say, I think he

200
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:32,500
 actually taught a book, "The God Who Is There," and he spoke about the God of the Bible as

201
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,460
 the God who is there, the God who exists.

202
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,980
 And this is really big and foundational.

203
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:46,420
 This passage in verse 16 begins with the words, "For God, for God so loved the world, for

204
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,460
 God."

205
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:53,260
 And the existence of God is assumed as an established fact here.

206
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:59,100
 And this truth is an essential part of why the church exists and why we're gathered here

207
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:03,740
 today because God exists, God is there.

208
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:09,100
 If we're unsure about this, then it's certainly easy to be confused about the need to be here,

209
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:15,140
 to show up, to be connected to a church or the need to gather together if we're not sure

210
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,660
 if God exists.

211
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,580
 The whole Bible begins with a statement about God.

212
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:22,220
 It says, "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth."

213
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:26,380
 And from this verse and a lot of other verses throughout scripture, it's clear that God

214
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:31,660
 is the central character of the narrative of scripture.

215
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:36,020
 He's also the creator, he's the first cause of the universe, and ultimately that tells

216
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:41,940
 us that this is God's universe and this is his earth and this is his story.

217
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:50,860
 He created us in love and he has lovingly allowed us to take part in his story, but

218
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:54,700
 we're taking part in God's narrative, not the other way around.

219
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:59,060
 God's not a little piece that gets added on to our narrative.

220
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:03,700
 That's usually how we view it in life, that we're, it's about our narrative and God, we

221
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,900
 ask God to come take part in what we're doing.

222
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:09,740
 But it's actually the opposite, that's true.

223
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:15,140
 This universe is God's narrative and out of God's love, he allows us to take part in his

224
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,140
 story.

225
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:21,180
 But his existence is the bedrock of reality in this universe and it defines everything

226
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,180
 else.

227
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,220
 It defines our existence.

228
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:27,220
 We exist because God exists.

229
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:32,260
 So I want us to think about this for a minute here, spend a little extra time talking about

230
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:38,660
 this because God's existence is really foundational to a lot of the other reasons that we're here,

231
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:41,100
 that we gather together.

232
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:45,860
 And it's also something that's really attacked in our modern culture and a lot of us have

233
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:52,020
 probably experienced moments of doubt or skepticism or wondering or questions about the existence

234
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,980
 of God or his nature and that's okay.

235
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:58,300
 Honestly, that's a healthy thing for us to do.

236
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:02,620
 Acknowledging those doubts and those questions allows us to wrestle with them and to take

237
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:06,420
 them to God, to examine God's word and to actually find answers.

238
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,580
 So that's really healthy for us.

239
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:13,500
 If we never acknowledge those doubts and those questions, then the questions never get answered

240
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:18,900
 and eventually we would just walk away assuming that there are no answers to those questions

241
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,900
 and that's not true.

242
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,060
 There are.

243
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:24,940
 God has answers for us and so it's healthy for us to wrestle with those.

244
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:28,740
 So if you're someone today who says, "I'm kind of wrestling with that a little bit,"

245
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:31,820
 with is God really there?

246
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,500
 Does he exist?

247
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,660
 Is he real?

248
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,780
 What is his nature like?

249
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:41,900
 I want us to just talk briefly about this, okay?

250
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:47,500
 And I want to point out that if we're struggling with the existence of God and we're saying

251
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:52,660
 maybe God isn't there, then there are actually three really big questions that we have to

252
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:57,060
 answer if we're trying to escape the truth of God's existence.

253
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:03,580
 And the first one is if God isn't there, if there is no God, then why are we here?

254
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:09,740
 How do we explain the presence of really anything else in the universe?

255
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:20,180
 There's really not a naturalistic evidence-based explanation for the beginning of the universe

256
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:24,460
 because even though we can say, "Well, we can look at evidence from the very early history

257
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:28,820
 of the universe," we have no evidence of what came before.

258
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:32,860
 It's a physical impossibility for us to know what came before because there was nothing

259
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,700
 before the universe existed.

260
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:43,580
 And so even all of the best explanations of the best scientific minds in our world when

261
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:48,300
 it comes to how the universe came into existence go into metaphysical territory.

262
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:54,740
 People talk about maybe there was oscillating universes or some type of multiverses or all

263
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,240
 these things like that, but those are metaphysical explanations.

264
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:05,700
 There's no evidence, no scientific evidence we can have that any of that's true.

265
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:12,420
 So even the best scientists and the smartest people in the world can't say what began the

266
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,620
 universe, what started the whole thing.

267
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:18,720
 The Bible tells us that God did.

268
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,820
 And there are other good reasons to believe that what the Bible says is true, but the

269
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,860
 Bible tells us that God did.

270
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:28,540
 So that's something that points to the existence of God.

271
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:32,060
 It's a proof of God's existence, the fact that the universe is here itself, the fact

272
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:35,920
 that we exist and everything else that we see is here.

273
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,740
 If God did not exist, where did those things come from?

274
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:43,060
 The other thing that we have to think about is if God doesn't exist, where do we get our

275
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:46,140
 innate sense of morality of right and wrong?

276
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:52,300
 And why is it that us as humans, even those of us who claim no religious affiliation or

277
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:57,660
 belief at all, are still really convinced about certain things that they believe to

278
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:02,820
 be right or wrong, certain things that they believe to be just and unjust.

279
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,640
 All of us as humans have an innate sense of morality.

280
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:12,660
 It's shaped by our experiences and it's different for different people, but everyone has that

281
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,940
 sense.

282
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,820
 And again, where does that come from?

283
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,140
 We can't explain that without the existence of God.

284
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:24,100
 We can't just say, "Well, it's there because it's something that humans developed over

285
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,980
 time to help their species survive."

286
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:31,340
 Well, that's really not a good explanation because a lot of what we believe about justice

287
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:37,540
 and injustice and a lot of our innate sense of morality transcends our desire, our instinct

288
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,540
 for survival.

289
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:43,540
 Throughout human history, people have been willing to give up their life for something

290
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:46,120
 that they believed was right.

291
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:50,540
 And so it's not just something that we have developed in order to survive as a species,

292
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,860
 it's deeper than that.

293
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:55,340
 It's more important to us than that.

294
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,620
 And it's there in all of us.

295
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:02,220
 We all believe some things are right and wrong, even if we don't believe in God or any form

296
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,500
 of faith.

297
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:09,780
 And the third thing that we have to think about that shows us that God exists is just

298
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:13,940
 all of the order and complexity and intelligence that we see in our universe.

299
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:21,980
 Our universe is full of just amazingly complex systems, from the macro on the galactic structure

300
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:26,460
 level all the way down to the micro, our cells and our DNA.

301
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:32,660
 And we've seen over the last few years how chaotic things can become, even because of

302
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,060
 microorganisms, right?

303
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:42,620
 There's a lot more complexity and a lot more intricate, amazing intelligence involved and

304
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:48,300
 information involved, even on a cellular level, than any of us can even kind of wrap our minds

305
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,620
 around.

306
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,380
 Where does all that come from?

307
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:58,100
 Again, this is something that points us to the fact that God exists.

308
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:03,300
 Now we might say, "Okay, well, those things do point us to the fact that God exists, but

309
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:07,820
 how do we know that the God of the Bible is the God that we're talking about?"

310
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:13,020
 And one of the things I would point us to there is that the Bible actually is provable.

311
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:17,340
 The Bible talks about things that we can investigate.

312
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:22,740
 The Bible has historical and archaeological things that we can look at and go back and

313
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,900
 say, "Okay, this person was talked about.

314
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,900
 Was this a real person?

315
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,500
 This place, was this a real place?"

316
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:34,820
 And we see that as we do that, the Bible is corroborated by those sources of evidence,

317
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,500
 by history, by archaeology.

318
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:41,260
 The Bible has prophecies about people that were, where things were predicted in the future,

319
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,700
 and then those people actually lived and did those things.

320
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,700
 Those things came to pass.

321
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,300
 The Bible's internally consistent.

322
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,980
 It agrees with itself.

323
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:53,980
 Obviously there are lots of things that are difficult to understand in the Bible that

324
00:21:53,980 --> 00:22:00,420
 we have to study out, but the Bible has an internally consistent voice and witness to

325
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,700
 us.

326
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,180
 The text is consistent.

327
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,180
 Over time, it has stayed consistent.

328
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:09,540
 Honestly, the existence of the church throughout church history is one of the proofs that the

329
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,860
 Bible is true.

330
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:18,800
 The fact that the church has continued to persevere and thrive in the space of so much

331
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,700
 opposition throughout history.

332
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:26,900
 You may say, "Okay, those things are helpful, but I'm still not, I don't know, you know,

333
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:31,820
 I kind of want like a hundred percent proof that God is there."

334
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:35,980
 If that's what you're seeking, then I would say, "I don't think you're going to find that."

335
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:38,160
 And here's why.

336
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:44,100
 Because the God who reveals himself in the Bible is a God of love, not a God of force

337
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,880
 and coercion.

338
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,320
 God invites us into a love relationship with him.

339
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,340
 He doesn't say, "Hey, I'm going to give you so many, so much evidence, and I'm going to

340
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:58,920
 beat you over the head with it until the only thing you can do is choose to be in a relationship

341
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,920
 with me."

342
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,100
 God doesn't do that.

343
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,460
 God doesn't force anyone to believe in him.

344
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:07,700
 But he says, "Hey, I'm going to give you enough to quiet your fears, and then I'm going to

345
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:11,380
 invite you to trust me and to love me."

346
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,540
 That's the God who is there.

347
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:16,780
 And ultimately, that's why we're here today.

348
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:21,060
 We're not here in church just because it's a fairy tale, but we keep showing up because

349
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,280
 we haven't figured it out.

350
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:26,140
 We're not here in church just because it's good for our mental health to be around each

351
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,800
 other and to believe in something.

352
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,860
 That's great that it is.

353
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:33,420
 It's a byproduct of the truth.

354
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:37,660
 But we're here because this is real, because God is real.

355
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:41,220
 He really exists.

356
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,580
 He's really there.

357
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:48,220
 And that's the foundation of why we're here, because God is there.

358
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:54,160
 Next thing we see in this passage is that God loves us.

359
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,700
 We're here because God loves us.

360
00:23:55,700 --> 00:24:01,100
 As we read further in verse 16, Jesus, and remember, this is Jesus talking to Nicodemus.

361
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:05,820
 So when we're reading verses 16 to 19, Jesus himself is speaking these words.

362
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:11,580
 Jesus tells us that not only does God exist, but also that God is a loving God who loves

363
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,480
 us specifically.

364
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,180
 And this is such wonderful news.

365
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:19,740
 Just knowing that there's an all-powerful creator God, even if we believe that, that's

366
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:29,220
 not so much of a comfort, because what if God is angry or mean or vindictive?

367
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:36,460
 But the Bible tells us that not only is God there, but he also loves us.

368
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,220
 And he loves specifically.

369
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:43,980
 And what I mean by that is that God doesn't just love the earth, love us, love everybody.

370
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:44,980
 He does.

371
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,480
 He loves globally.

372
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,100
 But he also loves specifically.

373
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,920
 He loves you.

374
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,680
 He loves me.

375
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:56,740
 And this really has enormous implications for our worth and our value as humans, our

376
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,740
 lives.

377
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:03,220
 We are created in God's image, but we're objects of his love.

378
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:08,680
 The fact that we're valued by the most powerful being in the universe means we have worth

379
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:16,740
 and value that no one else or no thing else can take away.

380
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,980
 Our lives matter and God loves us.

381
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:25,620
 And that's true for each one of us, because God loves you specifically, not just globally.

382
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:30,600
 His love is directed towards you.

383
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:35,580
 And as Pastor Mark was mentioning earlier, when we go through those challenges of life,

384
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:42,040
 those uncertainties, those job challenges or trouble in school or things that we can't

385
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:47,340
 figure out or issues in a relationship with someone else and we're hurt or we're confused

386
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:54,040
 or we don't know what to do, we need to know that God loves us and loves us specifically

387
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,660
 and cares about our lives.

388
00:25:56,660 --> 00:26:04,220
 And we see that that is why we are here today in church.

389
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,240
 We're not just here out of habit or routine.

390
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,480
 We're not just here because we don't know what else to do on Sunday morning.

391
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,820
 We're here because God loves us.

392
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,820
 He loves you.

393
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:13,820
 He loves me.

394
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,640
 We're objects of His love.

395
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,480
 And that's why we show up.

396
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:21,380
 That's why we're here.

397
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:24,920
 Next we see in this verse that God has revealed Himself to us.

398
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,960
 God has spoken.

399
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,440
 We see this in verse 19.

400
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,500
 It tells us that the light has come into the world.

401
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:35,520
 The statement makes it clear that God has shined on us.

402
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,980
 He's revealed Himself to us.

403
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:41,460
 God has revealed truths about Himself, about the nature of reality, about the significance

404
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:46,320
 of what it means to be a human, and about how He wants us to live in relationship with

405
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,400
 Him and with other people, with the people around us.

406
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,060
 God has spoken and revealed that stuff to us.

407
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:57,100
 He's revealed these things in a long love letter that He wrote to us through human authors

408
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:01,180
 that we call the Bible or the Word of God, and we call it that because it is spoken by

409
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:04,720
 God to us.

410
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,280
 And He has told us who He is.

411
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,800
 He's told us who we are.

412
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:14,480
 He's told us what is good and what is true in life, what is false and evil.

413
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,440
 He's described to us His good and beautiful design for our world and for our lives in

414
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:25,920
 it, and He's invited us to live in right relationship with Him and with the people around us.

415
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,020
 He's described what that relationship looks like.

416
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,200
 He's been honest with us.

417
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,020
 He's assured us that if we follow His good and beautiful path for our lives, we'll experience

418
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:39,240
 deep fulfillment and health in our relationship to Him and others, even though we'll still

419
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:45,080
 live in a broken and fallen and at times painful world.

420
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,840
 But He's also told us that if we reject His overtures of relationship, we'll experience

421
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:54,280
 separation, and that this separation will lead to unhealthy, self-destructive behavior

422
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,560
 that's damaging to us and the people around us.

423
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,680
 God's been honest.

424
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:01,280
 He's told us the truth.

425
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:05,640
 He's revealed that His Word is vibrant and alive with contemporary truth.

426
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,340
 It means something for us today.

427
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:11,680
 It's without error, and that we need to interact with it.

428
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,680
 We need to read it.

429
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,680
 We need to study it.

430
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:18,240
 We need to seek to understand what it means, even across the gaps of language and culture

431
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:25,000
 and history that exists between us in this current moment and the time that it was written.

432
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,580
 That's why it requires listening and study.

433
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:33,560
 That's why He's instructed us to talk to each other about it and to listen to it, proclaim

434
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:37,800
 and explain through preaching.

435
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:42,100
 And then we're supposed to be changed and shaped and formed by it.

436
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:48,280
 We're supposed to align our lives to God's truth as it's revealed to us.

437
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:54,900
 We're supposed to let God's truth and God's Word change us, and that's why we're here,

438
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,240
 because God has revealed Himself.

439
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,280
 He has spoken.

440
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:08,520
 He has something to say to us, and it's significant, and we're supposed to be formed by it.

441
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:15,320
 The next thing we see in these verses is that we're here because there are heavy realities

442
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,040
 in the universe.

443
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,760
 This passage reminds us of that.

444
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:25,800
 Verse 16 tells us there's a very real danger that we could be in a state of separation

445
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:32,800
 from God and perish, as the word that's used in that verse, for eternity.

446
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:39,640
 The relationship between humans and God was broken by our rejection of Him, and because

447
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:43,840
 of that, both spiritual and physical death are realities.

448
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:52,400
 That was the thing that God told the first humans in the garden was, "Hey, if you break

449
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,860
 our relationship, there will be death.

450
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:57,320
 Death will become a reality."

451
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:03,320
 And since then, it has been a reality, both physically, that none of us live forever,

452
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:07,920
 but also spiritually, that we can be separated from God.

453
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,520
 That's a heavy reality.

454
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:14,000
 Verses 18 and 19 in this passage make it clear that good and evil are real.

455
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,160
 Darkness and light exist in our world, and God's one day going to judge between good

456
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:23,840
 and evil in our world, in our lives, and in our own actions.

457
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:29,000
 Now sometimes that's comforting when we think about God judging evil in someone else's life,

458
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,600
 but that's heavy when I think about it in my own life, right?

459
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,840
 It's a heavy reality.

460
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,360
 It's a sobering truth.

461
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:39,600
 That means the choices that we make in life do matter, and our decisions, they either

462
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:45,960
 move us towards God or away from God, towards what He's spoken and revealed that is good

463
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:53,360
 and right, or away from those things, towards life or away from life, towards deeper relationship

464
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,120
 with Him or towards separation.

465
00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:00,480
 That's what God has revealed to us, and that's heavy.

466
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,880
 And that's one of the reasons we're here in church, not just for cultural reasons, certainly

467
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,160
 not for political reasons.

468
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:08,240
 We're here because this stuff is real and it matters.

469
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:15,560
 These realities are heavy, and we should care about them, and we do, and that's why we take

470
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:20,360
 part in church, and we gather together, and we listen to God's Word, because the choices

471
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:26,360
 that we make have consequences, because there is real good and evil in our world.

472
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:33,040
 Life's not just some type of game that's a collection of inconsequential choices.

473
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:36,400
 These things really matter.

474
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:40,280
 Next thing we see in this verse is that we're here because of Jesus.

475
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:45,840
 God sent a rescue in verses 16 and 17 to tell us that God sent His Son into the world in

476
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,300
 order that the world might be saved through Him, that whosoever believes in Him should

477
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,640
 not perish but have eternal life.

478
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:58,880
 Jesus came to rescue us, to save us from sin and death, to forgive our past sins, to reconcile

479
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,520
 us and bring us back into right relationship with God.

480
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:07,200
 And verse 16 tells us that God provided that rescue because of the greatness of His love

481
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,680
 for us.

482
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:12,120
 God loved us so much, and that's why He sent the rescue.

483
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:16,640
 And this is really, really good news, and that's part of the reason, that's the biggest

484
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:26,240
 part of the reason that we are here today, because Jesus, God sent Him to rescue us,

485
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,800
 to save us.

486
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:31,320
 Even though we were in a state of continuing to reject God, we were saying, "God, I'm not

487
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:36,480
 interested, I want to continue to go my own way, and I want to continue to live in selfish

488
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:42,360
 and self-destructive ways," but God said, "No, I love you anyway, and I'm going to reach

489
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,200
 into your world and rescue you."

490
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,000
 It's an act of God's grace, and that word means unmerited favor, it means we didn't

491
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,320
 deserve it, but God sent the rescue anyway.

492
00:32:54,320 --> 00:33:01,440
 We don't perform work to earn it, to earn the rescue that God sent, we simply accept

493
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,960
 it by faith and receive it, receive God's grace.

494
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:10,240
 And that tells us something really big about why we're here in church.

495
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:17,720
 It's not because we're trying to earn favor with God, because we can't, and it's not because

496
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,360
 we're good people.

497
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:24,560
 Sometimes people inside and outside church think that people come to church because they're

498
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:27,840
 good, and that's not true.

499
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,800
 People even say like, "Oh, he's a good guy, he goes to church," or "She's a good girl,

500
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,560
 she's there every week," right?

501
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:37,400
 No, we don't come here because we're good, we come here because we're not, we come here

502
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:41,920
 because we're imperfect and we know that, and we need Jesus and we need rescue, we need

503
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:46,580
 saving, and that's why we're here.

504
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:54,000
 Because we need to be changed, we need help, and because of God's grace and mercy through

505
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,800
 Christ that we are saved and rescued and redeemed and forgiven and healed and reconciled, and

506
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,920
 that's why we're here.

507
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:09,480
 We're here because we're made new in and through Jesus.

508
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:15,760
 If we accept God's offer of rescue, that gift, we're restored to right relationship with

509
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:20,720
 God, and then God begins to work in our heart, and we begin to change.

510
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:28,240
 Verse 16 tells us that we will have life, and this reminds us that Jesus said that he

511
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:33,680
 came so that we could have life more abundant and fulfilling and full.

512
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:37,920
 God's word tells us in other parts of the scripture that in Christ we are made into

513
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:43,960
 a new creation, and that's a huge part of why we're here, because we want to be made

514
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,200
 new.

515
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:54,040
 Apart from Christ, before relationship with God, most of us were probably selfish and

516
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,360
 had a lot of things that were unhealthy in our lives.

517
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,680
 I know that's true for me.

518
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:04,080
 Now that I know Jesus, I'm still selfish and have a lot of unhealthy things in my life,

519
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:09,600
 but God is at work slowly stripping some of those away and helping me to be more like

520
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:13,800
 Christ, helping me to love others more, helping me to love my wife more and love my children

521
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:19,160
 more, helping me to love my community and my neighbors more, helping me to care for

522
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:26,080
 others in a deeper way, helping me to learn to pursue after and connect with God in a

523
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,400
 different way.

524
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,880
 We call it in church, we call that process sanctification.

525
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:37,640
 It's just a church word that means that God is changing you and making you more like Jesus,

526
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:40,680
 and that's why we're here, because we want to be made new.

527
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,080
 We want to hear God's word proclaimed to our hearts.

528
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:48,440
 We want to change from our selfishness and all the mess that we used to be into a reflection

529
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,520
 of Jesus.

530
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:55,160
 That's why we're here, because we're made new in Christ.

531
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:58,480
 And we're here because we're responding to God.

532
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:04,680
 In verse 18, we see that God is calling us to respond to his love and his rescue with

533
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:10,560
 belief or faith.

534
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,960
 Whoever believes in him is not condemned.

535
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,920
 God's calling us to respond with belief.

536
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:21,000
 And the Bible is clear that God wants us to respond to his love.

537
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,800
 We respond to his love as we return it by obeying the truth that he's revealed to us.

538
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:32,560
 We return his love and respond to his love by making God the object of our praise and

539
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:37,180
 worshiping him, something that we did this morning, something that we do in church.

540
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:41,160
 We respond to his love in community.

541
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:46,440
 God's made it clear that we need the support and encouragement and the help of one another

542
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:52,560
 and a group to get through life, and certainly to get through life as a follower of Jesus

543
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,560
 is not easy.

544
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,560
 There's a lot of challenges.

545
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,560
 There's a lot of setbacks.

546
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,900
 There's a lot of things that hurt us.

547
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,680
 We need each other.

548
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:05,320
 And so we respond to God's love by saying, "Okay, I'm going to love the brothers and

549
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:09,160
 sisters that God has put around me."

550
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:14,600
 We support and care and pray for one another, even as we struggle with the painful realities

551
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:18,200
 of living in the world that we live in, where things are broken and where there's conflict

552
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:23,440
 and there's hatred and there's all these problems.

553
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:31,120
 We respond to God and his love as we serve side by side and we go out and serve in our

554
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:36,640
 families but also in our communities, as we reach out to our neighbors, as we practice

555
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,880
 hospitality, as we do the things that the people of God have been known for throughout

556
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,800
 the history of the church, caring for the poor and needy and caring for those who are

557
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,000
 suffering and those who are vulnerable and those who are weak.

558
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,880
 Those are all things that we do as a response to God's love.

559
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:59,800
 And we do those together in a group with other Jesus followers.

560
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,920
 That's why we're here, because we're responding.

561
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:08,040
 We're not doing this to show off or to get anything.

562
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:12,880
 We're doing it because we're responding to what God is already doing in our life.

563
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,440
 And so we're loving each other, we're caring for each other, we're really listening to

564
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:21,640
 each other, we're supporting, we're praying, we're going out together to serve and to care

565
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:25,920
 and to try to impact the world around us.

566
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,240
 We're telling the story of Jesus and the good news of how he can change lives.

567
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:35,520
 Those are things that we're doing together because we're responding to God.

568
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:42,920
 We're worshiping him, we're praising him together because we're responding to him.

569
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:46,920
 So those are the reasons, the real reasons that we're here.

570
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:53,640
 Like I said, it's not because it's a fairy tale, it's not because we don't have anything

571
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,680
 else to do or we're just used to it.

572
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:00,600
 These things are real and God's clear about these things in his word.

573
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:05,440
 And as we close, I just want to remind us that the history of the church is full of

574
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:10,840
 people who knew why they were here, who knew why they were a part of the church, why they

575
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,840
 were participating.

576
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:17,600
 They were convinced of the realities of these things that we've discussed this morning.

577
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:22,280
 They were certain of God's existence and of his revelation of truth in his word, the fact

578
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,600
 that God had spoken and revealed himself.

579
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:30,800
 They were totally convinced of the gospel, the good news of God's love and grace and

580
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,260
 forgiveness through Jesus.

581
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:41,440
 And because of this, they were consistently and faithfully engaged in church.

582
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,440
 They were gathering together, preaching and discussing God's word together, fellowshipping

583
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,660
 with one another, worshipping God side by side, remembering Christ together, serving

584
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:52,780
 their neighbors together, sharing the good news with those outside the fellowship and

585
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:56,080
 caring for those in need.

586
00:39:56,080 --> 00:40:02,280
 And through the history of the church, people have withstood unspeakable persecution and

587
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:05,440
 life-altering challenges.

588
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:10,560
 From the first century believers who were, because of their faith, were thrown before

589
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:17,280
 lions in the Coliseum, to believers in the last century who were imprisoned and tortured

590
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:25,300
 in oppressive regimes that didn't want people to believe in God, to believers that in this

591
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:33,880
 very moment are imprisoned or suffering consequences or even their lives are endangered because

592
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,400
 of their faith.

593
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:39,100
 And throughout that history, there's this testimony of people all along the way, loving

594
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:43,480
 one another, caring for one another, loving their neighbors, serving the poor, taking

595
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:49,840
 care of the fatherless and doing all of these things because they knew why they were here.

596
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:55,800
 They were certain of the truth of God's word.

597
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:00,480
 And we may not share those experiences and that's okay if you're sitting there going,

598
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,680
 "Wow, I haven't gone through that stuff."

599
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,760
 That's okay.

600
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,560
 I'm grateful for that too.

601
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:12,200
 But we should share those convictions because we have the same reasons for being here that

602
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:16,000
 every other believer has throughout the history of the church.

603
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,080
 It's not just a cultural thing, it's not a political thing, it's not just because we're

604
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,920
 trying to be good people or we're trying to show off, it's not because we're trying to

605
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:26,640
 earn something with God or it's just our Sunday morning habit.

606
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:31,760
 It's not just because we enjoy it or it feels good, even though those are great blessings,

607
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:36,520
 it's not just because we want to see our friends, even though that's fantastic.

608
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:43,000
 But it's because this is real, God is real, his love for us is real, his mercy and salvation

609
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,920
 and forgiveness, those things are all real.

610
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:51,440
 It's because through Jesus we can really and actually be changed.

611
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,680
 We don't have to be the people we used to be.

612
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,120
 We can be something different.

613
00:41:56,120 --> 00:42:01,400
 We can love and obey God the way that we should and we can love and serve others the way that

614
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,160
 we should.

615
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,280
 And that's why we're here.

616
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:10,920
 And if that's why we're here, then that will keep us here through all the changes and transitions

617
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:16,120
 in life as we grow older and we go through different transitions in school and we're

618
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:19,520
 in college and then we're out of college and we're working and we have families and we

619
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:26,240
 have children and we are caring for relatives and life is crazy and we're moving and all

620
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:33,440
 that stuff will continue to be here because we know why we're here.

621
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:38,600
 Because God is there, he really is at work in our lives, he really does love us and he

622
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:42,880
 really can change us and he has called us to be together.

623
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,200
 Let's pray.

624
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:49,520
 God thank you for these truths that we see in your word today.

625
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:56,800
 God I pray that you would help each one of us to establish these things in our heart

626
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,360
 so that we know why we're here.

627
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:03,920
 Help us not to be here for unhealthy reasons that won't really sustain us.

628
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:09,960
 Help us to be convinced of the reality of your truth, of your existence, of your love,

629
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:15,840
 of your redemption, of the fact that you can change us and that you want us to come together

630
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:21,080
 to worship and to fellowship and to support and care and serve others together God.

631
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:24,360
 Help us to be convinced of those things.

632
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:29,680
 And give us perseverance in all the challenges of life to continue to follow after you, to

633
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:36,520
 continue to show up and to continue to really love one another side by side and to serve

634
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:41,600
 our communities and our neighborhoods and our city with the love of Christ.

635
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:47,060
 God we thank you that you are here with us this morning and we thank you for our brothers

636
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:52,640
