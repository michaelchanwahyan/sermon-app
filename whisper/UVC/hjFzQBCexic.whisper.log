[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   Amen.
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.160]   - Good morning, thank you very, very much.
[00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.000]   All right.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.240]   Well, happy July 4th.
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.840]   Mark, it's good to have you back from Israel.
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.040]   Last time I was here, you were missing,
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.440]   and it is always good to be back here at UV.
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.160]   We've been in this whole series
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.760]   about the life and times of Elijah,
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.800]   and one of the things I encourage you
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.120]   that I've really enjoyed doing is studying,
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.720]   taking a character, taking a book of the Bible,
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.280]   and just digging down into it.
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.520]   We spent the last three, four times I've been here
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.820]   talking about 1 Kings chapter 17.
[00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.840]   There is nothing like sitting there
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.520]   and just reading the same verses over and over again,
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.120]   and thinking about it throughout the week,
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.040]   and saying, "Lord, what is it
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.100]   "that you're trying to teach me?"
[00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.720]   Today, we're gonna look at 1 Kings chapter 18,
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.120]   but before we do, let me just give a summary
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.600]   of where we've been for those who are new,
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.040]   for those who've been with us,
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.400]   just a refresher, and as we look at Elijah,
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.320]   we started off in 17.1, where we talked about,
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.960]   literally, Elijah means, his name means,
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.080]   my God is Jehovah.
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.160]   Elijah is a Tishbite of Tishbe in Gilead.
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.240]   What does that mean?
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.920]   He literally came from obscurity.
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.600]   No one knew where Tishbe was.
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.360]   They knew where Gilead was,
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.760]   but they didn't know where Tishbe was,
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.360]   a small, little city, and so he came from obscurity,
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.840]   and somehow this prophet who came from obscurity
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.640]   got to the capital city of the northern kingdom of Israel
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.520]   in Samaria, and he gets a meeting with King Ahab,
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.360]   and he tells him, "Hey, look,
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.520]   "there's gonna be a drought.
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.100]   "There's gonna be a long, long drought,
[00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.840]   "and actually, that drought will last about three years."
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.440]   And he says, "Neither dew nor rain,
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.040]   "except by my word," and the motivation
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.520]   in the early parts of 17 is,
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.900]   "the God before whom I stand."
[00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.280]   That becomes a theme in his life,
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.880]   a theme in this chapter of Elijah's life.
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.600]   It's the God before whom I stand,
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.920]   and just like that, as he confronts Ahab,
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.240]   he gets ushered away to Cherith,
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.160]   a place where he is in solitude.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.040]   He's fed by ravens, and he is also,
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.980]   drinks from the brook over there.
[00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:11.920]   Well, in time, he doesn't just stay there for a short time.
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.800]   He stays there for a long time,
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.100]   and now, later on, the brook dries up,
[00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.620]   and then now the second part of 17,
[00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.680]   God says to go pack up, leave Cherith, and go to Zarephath,
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.120]   and when he goes to Zarephath, he says,
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.380]   "Hey, look, I see you.
[00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.360]   "I know where you're gonna go."
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.600]   It reminds us all the time that God sees us
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.080]   wherever we're at, and God knows where we need to go.
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.680]   Sometimes we may not know where to go,
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.640]   but God knows where we need to go.
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.460]   He also knows what you need, 'cause he says,
[00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:39.500]   "When you get to Zarephath,
[00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.840]   "you're gonna meet a widow there," and he does.
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.720]   He meets a widow there, but the problem
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.640]   with this widow is she's collecting sticks,
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.680]   and she says, "I only have a little flour.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.340]   "I have a little oil, and I'm collecting sticks
[00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.180]   "so I can go in and make some bread,
[00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.080]   "and then from that point on,
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.800]   "my son and I are gonna eat it and die."
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.280]   Really, that's who you want me to sit there?
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.380]   Yes, because sometimes God knows what we need,
[00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.260]   and what we need is different than what we think we need
[00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.880]   or what we want, but God knows what we need.
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.280]   Along the way, just like the story with the widow,
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.920]   we're gonna have to overcome first impressions
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.640]   or expectations.
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.600]   We're gonna have to overcome physical impossibilities.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.920]   It's literally a widow who is poor,
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.840]   who's gonna feed him, who thinks she's gonna die
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.540]   because she only has a little flour and a little oil,
[00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.960]   but somehow God makes that oil and that flour
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.720]   just keep going and going and going,
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.120]   but yet at the same time, this is the last story
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.160]   that we looked at when I was last here.
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.160]   Sometime later, as he stays with the widow,
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.480]   the widow's son dies, and the widow blames Elijah,
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.160]   "That you brought this upon my family."
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.040]   Elijah grabs the son, he brings it, and there we see,
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.520]   we looked at Elijah's prayer to the Lord,
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.320]   a genuine prayer where he wrestles with the Lord
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.320]   because he doesn't know what happened.
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.800]   He sits there and he yearns and he prays
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.780]   in a genuine fashion, the fashion that God wants us
[00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.760]   to wrestle with him in our own prayer life.
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.240]   He prays the impossible, but he also knew
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.920]   that God could say no.
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.680]   That's what it means to walk with the Lord.
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.560]   There is a deep relationship that you have
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.980]   with your prayer life.
[00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.600]   It's not just sitting there in your prayer
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.720]   and just asking God to provide all the things
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.400]   that you want, but you're wrestling.
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.000]   There's a natural, there is a genuine relationship
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.160]   with the Lord, and God chooses to heal the son.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.840]   And I love what verse 24 and 17 tells us.
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.760]   Now I know that you are a man of God,
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.160]   and that the word of the Lord in your mouth is truth.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.480]   She never says to him, "Now I know that you are
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.760]   "a great man, now I know that you are a powerful man."
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:48.860]   That's not what she says to him.
[00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.640]   She says, "Now I know that you are a man of God,
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.460]   "and that the word of the Lord in your mouth is truth."
[00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.920]   Because everything that Elijah does in 17,
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.760]   and we're gonna see it in 18, is as if he is a servant
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.720]   and a steward of what God has given him.
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.060]   And that's what a servant does.
[00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.680]   He gives light, he gives credit to his master.
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.400]   I know that you are a man of God.
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.400]   We talked about the theory behind Hebrews 11.
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.760]   Some of you guys who may not be familiar with Hebrews 11
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.260]   is the Hall of Faith.
[00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.880]   It talks about all these Old Testament characters,
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.440]   and you know who is not mentioned in the Hall of Faith?
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.060]   Elijah is never mentioned by name.
[00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.800]   There is one verse that does describe Elijah.
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.880]   It's this, in verse 35 of Hebrews 11,
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.920]   "Women receive back their dead by resurrection."
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.040]   One of the things that we talked about
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.600]   when we were last here is why in the world,
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.880]   in the Hall of Faith, Elijah plays such an important role
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.520]   that he was never listed in the Hall of Faith.
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.080]   Now, I do wonder if the writer of Hebrews,
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.640]   in order to honor Elijah, never mentions who Elijah is,
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.840]   but rather what he does.
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.320]   Because Elijah was never about himself,
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.360]   but always about being a steward,
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.120]   always being a spouse, servant,
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.740]   always giving credit to what God is doing.
[00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:16.740]   Which leads us today to the confrontation in Mount Carmel
[00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:21.620]   in 1 Kings 18.
[00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.560]   And there today, we're gonna look at five questions
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.940]   that emerges from these in this chapter,
[00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.500]   as we look at 1 Kings 18.
[00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:32.460]   And let me read it to you.
[00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.220]   It's gonna be a long one,
[00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.820]   so we're gonna just go on little different passages
[00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.980]   in different verses, and try to get through it
[00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.980]   as soon as we can in the next 20 minutes.
[00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:42.320]   18, verse one.
[00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.540]   After many days, the word of the Lord came to Elijah.
[00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.460]   In the third year, saying, "Go, show yourself to Ahab.
[00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.220]   "It's been three long years of this drought,
[00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.940]   "and I will send rain upon the earth."
[00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.080]   So Elijah went to show himself to Ahab.
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.740]   Now, the famine was severe in Samaria,
[00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.820]   the capital city of the northern kingdom.
[00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:07.560]   And Ahab called Obadiah, who was literally the chief of staff
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.540]   over Ahab's kingdom, and called Ahab,
[00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:12.820]   who was over the household.
[00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:17.020]   Now, Ahab was feared the Lord greatly.
[00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:18.940]   And when Jezebel, Queen Jezebel,
[00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.020]   cut off the prophets of the Lord,
[00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:24.820]   Obadiah took 100 prophets and hid them by fifties
[00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:28.340]   in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.
[00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:31.280]   Let's go to verse 11.
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.380]   Obadiah now says to Elijah,
[00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:37.080]   "And now you say," Obadiah says to Elijah,
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.660]   "Go tell your Lord.
[00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:40.560]   "Behold, Elijah is here.
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.620]   "And as soon as I have gone from you, Elijah,
[00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.560]   "the spirit of the Lord will cure you.
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.020]   "I know not where."
[00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:48.740]   Because he literally went from Samaria
[00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:51.500]   to Cherith and Zarephath, and this entire time,
[00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:54.540]   they're all looking for him, but they never found him.
[00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:55.620]   And so they're always wondering
[00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:56.860]   where this guy disappeared to.
[00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.400]   And so when I come and tell Ahab,
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.500]   and he cannot find you again,
[00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:02.340]   you know what he's gonna do?
[00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:03.900]   He's gonna kill me.
[00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.300]   "Although I, your servant,
[00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:08.060]   "have feared the Lord from my youth."
[00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.500]   And Elijah says, "As the Lord of hosts lives,
[00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.200]   "before whom I stand."
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.740]   Same theme as in the beginning of chapter seven,
[00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:16.220]   "Before whom I stand."
[00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:19.780]   That is a constant theme of Elijah's life.
[00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:23.260]   "I will surely show myself to him today."
[00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.140]   So Obadiah went to meet Ahab and told him,
[00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:29.180]   and Ahab went to meet Elijah.
[00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:32.520]   When Ahab saw Elijah, Ahab said to him,
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:36.020]   "Is it you, you troubler of Israel?"
[00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:38.180]   Verse 18, pay attention to this.
[00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:43.120]   "And he answered, 'I have not troubled Israel,
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:47.620]   "but you have, in your father's house,
[00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:50.500]   "because you have abandoned the commandments of the Lord
[00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.600]   "and followed the bells.
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:56.340]   "Now therefore send and gather all Israel to me
[00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.980]   "at Mount Carmel and the 450 prophets of Baal
[00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:02.340]   "and the 400 prophets of Asherah,
[00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:06.740]   "total of 850 people who eat at Jezebel's table."
[00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:10.780]   So Ahab sent to all the people of Israel in verse 20
[00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:13.900]   and gathered the prophets together at Mount Carmel.
[00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:17.220]   And Elijah came near to all the people and says,
[00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:20.500]   "How long will you go limping
[00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:25.140]   "between two different opinions?"
[00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:27.260]   First question that we see
[00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.220]   comes in this very verse that I just read.
[00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:32.020]   "How long will you be limping
[00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:33.620]   "between two different opinions?"
[00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:36.700]   The first question that emerges, I ask you,
[00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:40.300]   "Are you limping through your faith?"
[00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:42.220]   That's the first question that emerges.
[00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:45.560]   Are you limping through your faith?
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:50.380]   Three characters and three perspectives arise.
[00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:54.660]   There's a character Ahab, as we see in chapter 18.
[00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:59.660]   Ahab, we don't even know where his faith journey is,
[00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:03.500]   how he got out to worshiping Baal, all of that stuff.
[00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.940]   We have an idea it really is through the influence
[00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:08.060]   of Queen Jezebel.
[00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:12.500]   Ahab, out of the 19 kings in the northern kingdom,
[00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:15.120]   they said Ahab was probably the worst.
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:18.420]   Queen Jezebel actually ends up being the main villain,
[00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:20.600]   the main person who disrupts everything.
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.860]   She was the worst of even all of the kings.
[00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:26.980]   Now, at the same time, we do have some idea
[00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:31.980]   that at one point or another, Ahab was following the Lord.
[00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:33.340]   Here's why.
[00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:37.100]   When Ahab dies, his two sons take over.
[00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:38.780]   His two sons, the first son is,
[00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:42.200]   I'm gonna butcher this, so I've been trying to practice this
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.300]   for the whole weekend, I still butcher it.
[00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:45.700]   Ahaziah, all right?
[00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.020]   Ahaziah is one of the boys.
[00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:52.580]   His name literally means "owned by Jehovah."
[00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:54.220]   Interesting, "owned by Jehovah"
[00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:56.140]   is what his first name's son means.
[00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:59.860]   The next one is Jerhoram,
[00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:03.940]   which means "Jehovah is exalted."
[00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:06.220]   So why in the world are your kids' name,
[00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:09.260]   it means "owned by Jehovah" and "Jehovah is exalted,"
[00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:13.420]   if at one point or another, you weren't following the Lord?
[00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:17.340]   And somehow or another, Queen Jezebel, who you married,
[00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:21.180]   really wanted to make Baal the state religion,
[00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:24.540]   and as a result, suddenly, all the prophets were killed,
[00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:27.660]   and now there's 450 prophets of Baal,
[00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:30.380]   400 prophets for Asherah.
[00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:33.100]   There's also Obadiah, the next character that we see.
[00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:35.660]   Obadiah is the chief of staff, as we mentioned.
[00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:37.980]   He's the one who oversees the entire household.
[00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:40.260]   He's the one, when Jezebel was trying to kill
[00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:45.260]   the 100 prophets, he rescues 50 and puts 50 in each cave,
[00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.380]   total of 100.
[00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:50.440]   Well, but this time, he is scared of Ahab.
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:51.820]   When he confronts Elijah, he says,
[00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:55.540]   "Hey, look, if you send to me and Ahab can't find me,
[00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:58.660]   "he's gonna kill me."
[00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:00.700]   And then you have the third folks.
[00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:02.700]   Those are the Israelites.
[00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:06.900]   The Israelites were also scared of Ahab and Queen Jezebel.
[00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:10.400]   But then also, it's been a long three years, hasn't it?
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.520]   The drought has taken for three years.
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:17.060]   God has not responded in those droughts.
[00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:18.660]   And probably the Israelites says,
[00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:21.640]   "Hey, look, if our God doesn't respond,
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:25.080]   "then let's give Baal a try.
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:28.120]   "Let's give the God of fertility,
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.360]   "the God of harvest a try.
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.580]   "What can we lose?
[00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:35.220]   "Our God's not paying attention to us as well, too."
[00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:39.380]   When we allow our fear, our pursuit of other things
[00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:44.380]   become our focus, we find ourselves limping
[00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:46.460]   through our faith.
[00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:49.460]   When we allow our fear, when we allow our pursuit
[00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:52.020]   of other things become our focus,
[00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:55.100]   we find ourselves limping along
[00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:56.920]   and limping through our faith.
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:59.460]   I'm not sure for some of you guys who are listening
[00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:01.880]   on screen or those who are sitting here,
[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:04.620]   have you ever been canoeing before?
[00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:08.940]   Canoeing is fun and you're constantly going downstream.
[00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:11.720]   It is hard to canoe upstream.
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:14.720]   You're constantly going downstream.
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:19.480]   There is a downward pull on all of our lives
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:23.240]   as Christ followers to pull us downstream.
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:28.080]   There is a downward stream, there is a downward pull
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:32.640]   on all of our lives to pull us downstream,
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:35.360]   to affect our faith and to allow us
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:38.000]   to live in a state of limbo.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.480]   It's like an ocean current as well, too.
[00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:41.200]   You ever sit in an ocean current?
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.500]   If you ever sat in an ocean current for 30 minutes,
[00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:46.580]   you just sit on the sand right near the edge
[00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:48.160]   where the ocean's coming.
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.840]   If you weren't paying attention 30 minutes later,
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:52.880]   where would you have gone?
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:55.880]   A different place because the ocean current
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:59.520]   would have moved you from one place to another
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:01.840]   and you would have never known.
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.280]   In our work culture today,
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:07.060]   here's a term that also describes where we are.
[00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:08.840]   If you are working right now,
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:12.760]   Harvard Business Review calls this the quiet quit.
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:16.140]   It's not the great resignation, it's the quiet quit.
[00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:18.340]   I'm not sure if you ever heard that term as well, too.
[00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:20.980]   Post-COVID, it's been very, very popular.
[00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:22.500]   So literally, a lot of times,
[00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:27.500]   workers in corporations realize that I hate my job,
[00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:30.620]   I hate my boss, I don't like what I'm doing,
[00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:35.020]   but until I find a new job, I'm not gonna quit.
[00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:38.980]   I'm just gonna sit here and collect a paycheck,
[00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:43.220]   do minimally what I have to do,
[00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:46.340]   and that is the quiet quit.
[00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:50.620]   It has affected so many corporations at this time.
[00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:52.700]   I'm not gonna be dumb enough to quit
[00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:56.860]   and not get the paycheck, but I will get the paycheck.
[00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:59.460]   I will do as minimal as I can.
[00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:01.620]   You tell me what to do, I will do it.
[00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:03.900]   I am not gonna go above and beyond.
[00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:06.180]   I am not gonna do anything more,
[00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:09.960]   and anything that you ask me that's not part of my job,
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:11.940]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:15.660]   My whole goal is to collect the paycheck.
[00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:20.860]   I wonder how many of us approach
[00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:24.260]   the Christian life like this,
[00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:28.840]   that we approach it with this quiet quit mentality,
[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:31.500]   where we sit there and we sit and we said,
[00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:34.420]   "Hey, look, we're gonna go through the routines.
[00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:38.500]   "We're gonna come on Sunday, maybe once in a while,
[00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:41.080]   "if I have nothing to do,
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:44.220]   "I will attend a fellowship or a Bible study,
[00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:46.660]   "but I'm not gonna go above and beyond."
[00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:50.940]   I bet you too many of us will probably not sit there
[00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:53.020]   and say, "We're gonna give up Christianity.
[00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:55.820]   "God is wrong, I don't believe it.
[00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:58.500]   "Now, I don't think we're gonna go that far."
[00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:02.540]   But we go in a state of what we call lukewarmness,
[00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:06.420]   where we sit there, we go through the motions,
[00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:09.180]   we attend service, and then we're done,
[00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:10.620]   and we say we're still a Christian
[00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:13.780]   and we attend the church and we're religious.
[00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:17.140]   I bet you that's where many of us are.
[00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:20.280]   That is the quiet quit, that is the lukewarmness
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:23.260]   that Revelation warns us about.
[00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.980]   Now, here's a quick question is,
[00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:28.460]   why do we end up in that place?
[00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:30.620]   What are the motives that causes us to go there?
[00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:32.900]   Let me actually go through some of those things.
[00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:36.620]   Maybe sometimes what causes us to go through the motions
[00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:40.360]   is churches become a routine.
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:42.660]   Maybe some of us have grown up in the church
[00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:44.860]   all our lives and all that other stuff,
[00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:47.220]   and ever since we're younger, a lot of times,
[00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:50.720]   we've gone through the same thing.
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:53.160]   We've lost that personal attraction,
[00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.060]   we've lost that personal motivation,
[00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:57.620]   and it has become a routine.
[00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:01.220]   Maybe for some of us,
[00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:04.540]   we've grown disenchanted by the church.
[00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:07.660]   We've grown frustrated by the church.
[00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:12.520]   Christianity is not seen in a very good light these days.
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:14.800]   Because of politics, because of race,
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:18.120]   because of how pastors act or ministry leaders act,
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:19.440]   we're not always seen.
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:21.740]   We're seen by the world as haters.
[00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:24.960]   We don't love other people, we don't care about other people,
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:28.800]   and we all make it about building our own empires.
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:32.840]   Christianity today is not seen in a positive light,
[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:34.720]   and that's why sometimes you get frustrated
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.320]   and disenchanted by the church.
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:39.080]   It's not routine, we're disenchanted.
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:40.760]   Maybe a lot of times you're just distracted
[00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:43.240]   by what the world has to offer.
[00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:44.440]   And you're sitting there, "Hey, look,
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.600]   "I'll do this church thing, I'll come in,
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.420]   "but at the same time, I gotta worry about money,
[00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:49.560]   "I gotta worry about career,
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:52.100]   "I gotta worry about all these things.
[00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:55.080]   "But I'll come on Sundays, I'll give you that."
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:18:00.360]   And we live in a state of going through the routines.
[00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:02.600]   We live in the state
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:06.840]   of what Revelation's called being lukewarm.
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:08.120]   For us as Christians, let me give you
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:09.840]   a couple of signs of being lukewarm.
[00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:11.440]   Let me give you a couple fast ones
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:14.040]   and see if any of these applies to you.
[00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:16.520]   Signs of being lukewarm,
[00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:20.240]   you have an inconsistent and diminished prayer life.
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:23.120]   You struggle with having regular communications.
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:26.740]   You struggle with genuine engagement with the Lord.
[00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:29.840]   If you do pray, it's, "Lord," you go through rhythms
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:31.640]   and you have a script or everything like that,
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:33.680]   but you've failed like what Elijah said,
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:37.680]   of wrestling with the Lord, crying out to the Lord,
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.880]   talking with the Lord.
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:43.060]   An inconsistent and diminished prayer life.
[00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:44.800]   Signs of being lukewarm also shows
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:48.700]   that you have a worldly mindset and values.
[00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:50.720]   You sit there and say, "Lord, I totally understand
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:51.900]   "what you're saying, but Lord,
[00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:53.780]   "look at all these different things.
[00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:57.900]   "Look at the need to have money and power and goals
[00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.520]   "and all of these different things."
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:02.040]   I literally was talking to a woman
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:05.200]   who lives in Australia, in Perth, Australia,
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:07.560]   and she works at Deloitte,
[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:11.800]   and she's literally gonna be a partner over at Deloitte,
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:14.560]   but she works from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m.
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:16.920]   every single day in Australia.
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:18.240]   And she's a Chinese-Indonesian,
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:21.680]   and she says to me, "Tommy, I'm trying to figure out
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:25.680]   "that as I get promoted to be partner,
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:28.720]   "how do I still maintain a vibrancy
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:31.880]   "in my walk with the Lord versus getting caught up?
[00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:35.920]   "I'm already working from 8 a.m. to 9, 10 p.m.
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:39.900]   "How do I continue to maintain a diligent,
[00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:42.720]   "a godly mindset, and never about going up
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:43.680]   "the corporate ladder?
[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:47.080]   "What does it mean to have a worldly mindset and values?"
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:49.560]   We find ourselves struggling with all of that.
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:52.360]   Signs of being lukewarm is we neglect
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:55.720]   our spiritual disciplines, the importance of Bible reading,
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:20:00.520]   meditation, fasting, serving others.
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:04.000]   Other signs, lack of convictions and moral compromise
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.080]   about our character, about doing what is right,
[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:11.040]   about humility, because the things of God matters to us.
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:12.800]   And when we struggle with lukewarmness,
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:14.440]   ah, yeah, sure, sure, fine.
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:17.400]   But what it means to serve others,
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.920]   to die to ourselves every single day,
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:21.840]   because when you're a motivated Christian,
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:24.800]   you're constantly asking those questions
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:26.640]   each and every single day.
[00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:28.960]   When we struggle with lukewarmness, we struggle.
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:31.080]   We have a lack of Christian community,
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:35.000]   because we just don't see the importance of that anymore.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.360]   We see ourselves a lot of times just sitting there,
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:38.360]   and we don't need to share,
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:39.840]   we don't need to do anything accountable,
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:41.680]   we just do whatever we want.
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:45.120]   We don't see the importance of fellowship,
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:48.320]   of people holding us accountable.
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:51.800]   And for those who are sitting on the screens at home,
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.400]   and for those who are outside in the country,
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.960]   I totally understand, but for those who are in Chicago
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:58.320]   sitting there, you are the one
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:20:59.480]   that may be tempted to do this,
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:01.120]   'cause you're sitting at home and says,
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:05.360]   I will just watch, I'll attend virtual church,
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:06.480]   but I don't need any community,
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:07.560]   'cause I don't need anymore,
[00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:09.780]   I don't need anyone accountable.
[00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:12.320]   When we live in a state of lukewarmness,
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:14.280]   when we're sitting there stuck,
[00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:17.720]   stuck in being lukewarm,
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:23.820]   and limping along, we don't see the need for community.
[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:28.960]   Are you stuck, are you limping along in your faith?
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.400]   And the second thing it tells us
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.060]   in terms of the verse is this,
[00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:38.320]   if the Lord is God, follow him,
[00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:41.320]   but if it is Baal, then follow him.
[00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.280]   Make a choice, make a decision.
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:47.560]   Will my gods accomplish what I want them to do?
[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:51.920]   Because if it is not fully focused on our God
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:55.800]   and our Savior, we all have other gods.
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:57.400]   Now I'm saying that you have statues
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.400]   and everything like that,
[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:01.000]   but the gospel and the Bible tells us
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.680]   that we have gods or we have built altars
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:07.520]   in our hearts that distract us away
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:10.520]   from focusing on one true God.
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:13.080]   For the Israelites at that time,
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:16.440]   Baal was the god of power and sexual potency.
[00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:19.640]   Asherah was a god of fertility,
[00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:21.200]   and for them, the Israelites,
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:22.440]   and all the people in Israel,
[00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:24.680]   and King Ahab himself was so focused
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:28.760]   on sex, power, harvest, wealth,
[00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:31.000]   that became their god.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.240]   So if God is not your god,
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:38.380]   then what are the gods that you're chasing?
[00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:41.120]   If God is not your god,
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:44.120]   then is it wealth that you're chasing?
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:46.940]   Is it family that you're chasing?
[00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:49.760]   Is it relationships that you're chasing?
[00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:53.520]   Is it goals or dreams or comfort that you're chasing?
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:59.260]   And if it is, then you better take a hard look
[00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:04.260]   and ask yourself, if I chase after those things,
[00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:07.120]   will my god, will that god,
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:10.100]   money, wealth, family, relationship,
[00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:15.100]   will that god accomplish what I want them to do?
[00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:20.320]   And if the answer is yes in your mind,
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:25.140]   then there's no need for you to be here listening at all,
[00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:26.260]   because you've made up your mind,
[00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:30.620]   so no matter what I say, it won't matter to you.
[00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:34.000]   But you better make sure that will accomplish
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.860]   what you need them to do.
[00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:38.580]   Have you ever realized that some of the most unhappy people
[00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:41.980]   in life are wealthy people?
[00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:45.120]   And many wealthy people who spent their entire life
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:47.260]   just attaining and getting wealthy
[00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:49.660]   and finally they get to the end of it,
[00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:52.940]   and they have all the money that they want,
[00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:56.340]   they're lonely and they're realizing this is it?
[00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:59.460]   You have to ask yourself,
[00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:04.220]   will that god lead me to where I want to be?
[00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:06.740]   Now, if the answer is no,
[00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:10.140]   and you want to begin to explore the true god
[00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:12.580]   in the form of God and Jesus Christ,
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:15.820]   and see where that path leads you,
[00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:17.740]   then it goes to the third thing
[00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:19.220]   that we're gonna look at the question.
[00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:22.120]   If the Lord is God, follow him.
[00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:24.080]   But if thou, then follow him.
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:27.020]   And the last part of 21,
[00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:30.580]   and the people did not answer him a word.
[00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:32.580]   Third question.
[00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:37.600]   If you're stuck and you're looking through your faith,
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:42.340]   and you realize that the god that I'm chasing
[00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:45.120]   is not gonna get me to where I want to be,
[00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:48.980]   and I want to begin to understand what the true God
[00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:52.840]   or the form of Jesus Christ and God helps me to do,
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:56.340]   are you going to do anything about it?
[00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:59.520]   What are you gonna do?
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:02.640]   What steps are you gonna take to do it?
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:05.360]   If you realize, hey, look, the god that I'm pursuing,
[00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:07.960]   the money and all that stuff, that's not the answer.
[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:09.640]   Lord, I want to pursue you.
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:13.180]   What are you going to do about it?
[00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:14.980]   Because a lot of times, too often,
[00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:17.820]   we sit there, when we're sitting there and lukewarm,
[00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:21.340]   we know that we should be doing something about it.
[00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:25.420]   We just don't have the motivation to push ourselves
[00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:28.900]   to do it, and that's where we continue to get stuck.
[00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:31.240]   I love what my friend Dave Evans,
[00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:33.380]   he's a professor at Stanford, says.
[00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:36.980]   And he says, "These days, meaning is the new money."
[00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:40.880]   We're not at a place where people are motivated
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:43.480]   by earning more money and all that other stuff,
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:46.380]   that people in this generation
[00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:51.320]   want meaning in their life.
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:55.360]   And if meaning is not found in money or power
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:59.840]   or relationship, and it's found in the true God
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:03.200]   in what scripture calls us, as we pursue God,
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:08.200]   we will find meaning, what are you going to do about it?
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:13.100]   Many of you guys may not be familiar with basketball,
[00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:15.640]   but you will understand this story.
[00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:18.380]   Many of you guys did see the last dance with Michael Jordan.
[00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:20.680]   And when I say Michael Jordan and Chicago Bulls,
[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:22.960]   all of you guys are familiar with it.
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:25.140]   They had six championships.
[00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:26.780]   They were one of the greatest team
[00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:29.460]   in NBA basketball history.
[00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:31.700]   They had the first three championships,
[00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:34.040]   and then Michael Jordan retired,
[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:37.360]   and then he came back for the last three championships.
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:39.340]   There was an interview, the former coach,
[00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:43.300]   Phil Jackson, did on a recent podcast I was listening to.
[00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:45.700]   I was very, it just caught my attention.
[00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:48.080]   Phil Jackson says to the team, he says,
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:52.520]   "When Michael came in, we lost in the championship,
[00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:54.300]   "the Eastern Conference Championship.
[00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:57.400]   "And then the following year, we all came back.
[00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:59.320]   "And I brought the team together,
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:02.660]   "and at that point in time, we brought in this player,
[00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:06.720]   "little crazy, his name was Dennis Rodman.
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:09.580]   "He was a little nuts, but we brought him to the team,
[00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:12.620]   "and a lot of people did not like him.
[00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:14.320]   "So I brought the team together
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:17.080]   "right before the season began.
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:19.780]   "And I said to the team,
[00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:24.140]   "how bad do you want to win this championship?
[00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:26.960]   "Because if you want to win this championship,
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:31.220]   "you're gonna have to do something about it.
[00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:34.120]   "And if you want to win this championship,
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:36.920]   "you're gonna have to accept people
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:40.700]   "who are different than you to be part of this team."
[00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:43.140]   And Phil Jackson says, I pointed to Dennis Rodman,
[00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:45.420]   and says, "You see this guy?
[00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:48.260]   "Dennis over here is a little strange.
[00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:50.880]   "Dennis over here will probably go to Las Vegas
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.540]   "sometime during the season.
[00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:55.680]   "Dennis over here will probably not show up at practice,
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:57.940]   "and he'll just do his own thing.
[00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:01.140]   "But Dennis over here promised that at game time,
[00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:03.800]   "he will be here at every single game
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:07.860]   "and play his tail off to help you win the game.
[00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:10.620]   "Can you accept someone different than you
[00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:12.380]   "to be part of the team?
[00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:14.040]   "Because you have to do that
[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:17.000]   "if you want to win the championship."
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.280]   So for you and I as well, too,
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:22.100]   is if the money, the power, the family,
[00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:23.780]   the relationships mean nothing,
[00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:25.080]   and you're sitting there and says,
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:27.680]   "That's not gonna give me fulfillment or meaning.
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:32.160]   "And pursuing God is gonna give me the meaning."
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:34.080]   And you're willing to try that?
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:39.160]   What are you gonna do to pursue him?
[00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:41.320]   What changes are you gonna do?
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:46.280]   For the people, they cannot give him an answer.
[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:48.420]   What about you?
[00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:50.900]   Elijah said to the people,
[00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:54.740]   "I, even I, only am left to profit the Lord.
[00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:59.420]   "But by all his profits are 450 men," in verse 22.
[00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:00.980]   "Let two bulls be given to us
[00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:03.140]   "and let them choose one bull for themselves
[00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:05.400]   "and cut it in pieces and lay on the wood,
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:07.140]   "but put no fire on it.
[00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:10.120]   "And I will prepare the bull and lay on the wood
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:12.600]   "and put no fire to it.
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:14.740]   "And you call upon the name of your God,
[00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:16.920]   "and I will call upon the name of the Lord.
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:20.640]   "And the God who answers by fire, he is God."
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:22.660]   And all the people says, "It is well spoken.
[00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:25.640]   "We love that question, we love that."
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:27.880]   Let's go to verse 30.
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:31.320]   "Then Elijah said to all the people, 'Come near to me.'"
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:33.800]   Because now the bells are doing all this,
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:35.160]   nothing happens, right?
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:37.200]   They sit there and they call upon their gods
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:39.640]   and all that stuff, nothing happens.
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:41.080]   They start cutting themselves,
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:43.560]   they start dancing, nothing happens.
[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:47.080]   And Elijah says, "It is now my turn."
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:50.760]   Verse 30, Elijah said to all the people,
[00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:53.060]   "Come near to me."
[00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:55.300]   And all the people came near to him,
[00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:57.540]   and he repaired the altar of the Lord
[00:29:57.540 --> 00:29:59.020]   that has been thrown down.
[00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:00.620]   Elijah took 12 stones,
[00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:03.620]   according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob,
[00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:06.060]   to whom the word of the Lord came saying,
[00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:07.920]   "Israel shall be your name."
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:10.420]   And with the stones, he built an altar
[00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:12.740]   in the name of the Lord.
[00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:13.660]   Couple of things,
[00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:16.420]   if you feel like you're limping your faith, number two,
[00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:17.820]   if you feel like your God
[00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:19.620]   is not gonna accomplish what you need,
[00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:22.800]   and you're willing to make a decision to change it,
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:27.040]   you're gonna have to repair and rebuild the altar.
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:29.300]   Repair and rebuild the altar.
[00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:31.260]   Let me quickly go through what that means,
[00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:34.580]   that when you and I repair and rebuild the altar
[00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:36.480]   in our lives, what we're saying is
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:39.160]   we put the priority back on God.
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:42.540]   God, you are, I am rebuilding the altar in my life
[00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:44.760]   so that it is dedicated to you.
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:47.560]   What does that tangibly mean?
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:49.840]   That means you're gonna have to reflect upon
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:52.520]   what expected my relationship with God.
[00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:56.120]   You're gonna have to look at some of the barriers
[00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:59.760]   that can and will affect my relationship with my God.
[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:01.880]   You're gonna have to look at some of the issues
[00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:04.000]   in your heart.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.320]   You're also gonna have to ask yourself,
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:08.560]   who has God made me to be?
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:11.280]   What gives me meaning in my life?
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:14.480]   And who do I need to help in my process?
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:17.200]   The altars in our life are the altars
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:19.480]   that God places in your heart.
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:24.240]   We can always fake actions.
[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:27.360]   We can't fake what's in our hearts.
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:31.680]   In order to rebuild the altar in our life,
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:34.800]   you will have to ask yourself,
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:37.360]   where is the state of my heart?
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:40.120]   What barriers are in my heart?
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:41.800]   What are the barriers that are affecting
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:43.000]   my relation with God?
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.880]   What are the barriers that are killing,
[00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:48.600]   or the issues that are affecting my heart?
[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:50.920]   Who has God made me to be?
[00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:55.160]   What gives me meaning in my life?
[00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:57.640]   And you're gonna have to tangibly do all of that.
[00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:00.620]   And he repairs the altar,
[00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:04.440]   and then he makes a trench above the altar
[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:07.960]   as great as wood contain two seeds of seed.
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:09.960]   And Elijah put the wood in order
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:12.640]   and cut the bowl in pieces and laid it on the wood,
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:15.000]   and he says, "Fill four jars with water
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.040]   "and pour it on a burnt offering."
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:18.840]   And on the wood.
[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:22.720]   And he says, "Do it a second time."
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:24.840]   And they did it a second time.
[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:26.480]   And he says, "Do it a third time."
[00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:28.120]   And they did it a third time.
[00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:30.960]   And the water ran around the altar
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:33.600]   and filled the trench also with water.
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:34.560]   Here's my last point,
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:36.760]   and we're gonna look at Elijah's prayer.
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:40.240]   At the time of the offering of the oblation,
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:42.360]   Elijah the prophet came near and said,
[00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:44.240]   and here's Elijah's prayer,
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:48.460]   "O Lord God of Israel, Isaac and Israel,
[00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:52.360]   "let it be known this day that you are God in Israel
[00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:54.400]   "and that I am your servant
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:58.500]   "and that I have done all these things at your word.
[00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:00.300]   "Answer me, O Lord, answer me,
[00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:04.400]   "that this people may know that you, O Lord, are God
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:08.920]   "and that you have turned their hearts back."
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:11.960]   Fifth question, we've gone through four questions.
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:14.720]   Are you limping through your faith?
[00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:17.800]   And if you are, what are the certain gods
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:20.000]   in your life that you have?
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.760]   Do you know if those gods are gonna accomplish
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:25.880]   what you need, do what you want?
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:28.080]   And if it's not, what's your alternative?
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:32.920]   Is it found in the Lord your God, in Jesus Christ?
[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:36.560]   Thirdly, if it is found in the Lord Christ,
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:39.440]   what are you gonna do about it?
[00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:40.880]   Then from that point of forth,
[00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:43.480]   how do you rebuild your altars?
[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:46.880]   How do you repair your altars?
[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:51.880]   And the last one, what does the prayer of Elijah teach me?
[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:54.640]   Prayer of Elijah teaches me three things.
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:57.600]   O Lord God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel,
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:01.040]   let it be known this day that you are God in Israel.
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:05.200]   Prayer of Elijah teaches us that God is supreme.
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:08.160]   God is the God of Abraham, God is the God of Isaac,
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:10.360]   God is the God of Israel.
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:13.000]   Let it be known this day that you are God,
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.480]   you are the one true God.
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:18.120]   Second thing that the prayer of Elijah takes place
[00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:19.600]   is that I am your servant.
[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:22.680]   It shows us our position in relation to God,
[00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:25.840]   that he is, we are his servant,
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:30.460]   and that I have done all these things at your word.
[00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:32.520]   And the last one, answer me, O Lord,
[00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:35.560]   answer me that this people may know that you, O Lord,
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:40.200]   are the God that you have turned their hearts back.
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:42.000]   Look at the key verse in this one
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.020]   as we wrap up this one too.
[00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:45.320]   Look at the key thing.
[00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:48.720]   It's not that, Lord, you're God and I am your servant,
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:51.200]   and force the people to turn back on him.
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:52.280]   No, no, no, no.
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:56.240]   Lord, work in it that you are the one
[00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:59.780]   that turns their hearts back to you.
[00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:02.760]   It is not the people turning their hearts.
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:07.360]   Lord, it is you who turns their heart back.
[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:09.160]   Then the fire of the Lord fell
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:11.480]   and consumed the burnt offering,
[00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:13.800]   and the wood and the stones and the dust,
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:15.880]   and licked up the water that was in the trench.
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:18.040]   And when all the people saw it,
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:19.520]   they fell on their faces and said,
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:23.600]   the Lord, he is God, the Lord, he is God.
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:27.120]   What does this story remind you of?
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:32.200]   Does it remind you of the gospel?
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:35.160]   Does it remind you of the sacrifice of Jesus?
[00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:39.940]   That God could have easily punished all humanity
[00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:43.660]   because of their sin, and the judgment of sin,
[00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:46.900]   he could have literally leveled the fire
[00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:51.900]   and brought his entire judgment on the people.
[00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:55.860]   But he doesn't bring his judgment on the people.
[00:35:55.860 --> 00:35:59.940]   He brings his judgment on the sacrifice.
[00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:04.500]   And it is the sacrifice who takes the blunt of the flame.
[00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:09.280]   For us, as we look at the cross of Jesus,
[00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:12.540]   it is not humanity and those who have sinned
[00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:17.540]   that is the recipient of God's anger and God's judgment,
[00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:22.860]   but rather he sends Jesus who becomes the sacrifice,
[00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:27.120]   and he sacrifices the sacrifice.
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:31.300]   And through all that, through the sacrifice,
[00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:33.740]   it turns our hearts back to him.
[00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:37.020]   That's the gospel message.
[00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:40.180]   That's what the prayer of Elijah teaches us,
[00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:41.940]   a foreshadowing of Christ.
[00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:45.820]   Some of us here today may be stuck
[00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:47.740]   in limping through our faith.
[00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:51.260]   Some of us here may be wrestling through
[00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:53.540]   what are the true gods in our life.
[00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:55.940]   We may be living this state of mediocrity,
[00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:57.540]   of lukewarmness.
[00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:00.060]   We go through the flow, we go through the motions
[00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:02.500]   of coming to church, but there's things in our life
[00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:05.140]   that's tugging in our life.
[00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:06.920]   You're gonna have to make a decision.
[00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:09.640]   Who's gonna be the god of your life?
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:12.520]   And if Jesus is going to be the focal point,
[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:14.680]   the god in your life, then you're gonna have
[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:15.520]   to make a decision.
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:17.280]   What are you gonna do about it?
[00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:22.140]   Are you gonna repair and rebuild the altar in your life?
[00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:24.160]   Are you gonna sit there and reflect upon
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:25.480]   what God's meaning in your life,
[00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:27.360]   what God's purpose in your life is?
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:30.360]   Are you gonna look at some of the barriers in your heart?
[00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:34.500]   And are you gonna understand and reflect upon
[00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:36.880]   the road that God tells us through Elijah,
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:39.200]   that God is supreme in our life,
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:41.600]   that we are a servant of Christ,
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:45.660]   and it is the gospel that draws us over to him.
[00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:50.240]   That's what 1 Kings 18 teaches us.
[00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:54.520]   That it is the gospel, as God draws us to him,
[00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:57.760]   we are his servant.
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:02.760]   We are Elijah, continue to proclaim him as a servant.
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:04.100]   Let me pray.
[00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:07.140]   Father, thank you for your works.
[00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:09.940]   Thank you for the, man, the life of Elijah
[00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:13.460]   as we study so much in chapter 17 to 18.
[00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:15.180]   Thank you for how even through Elijah,
[00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:18.660]   you spoke and showed Jesus Christ through us,
[00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:21.660]   that you brought the sacrifice and your judgment
[00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:25.700]   was not placed on humanity, but placed on the sacrifice.
[00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:30.160]   And it is because of that sacrifice, we are drawn to you.
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:33.320]   May we continue to walk in your ways,
[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:35.920]   especially those of us who are sitting right here,
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:38.240]   limping through our faith.
[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:40.400]   In Christ we pray, amen.
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:42.980]   (gentle music)
[00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:44.840]   (gentle music)
