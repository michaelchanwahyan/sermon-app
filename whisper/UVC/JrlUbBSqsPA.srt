1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
 - All right, we are in the season of Advent

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,920
 and actually to next Sunday,

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,920
 we're gonna celebrate Christmas Sunday together.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,800
 So I think we should turn our attention to passages

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,120
 related to the birth of our Savior, our Lord Jesus Christ.

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,120
 So today we're gonna turn to the Gospel of Luke 1.

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,600
 And this opening chapters of the Gospel of Luke

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:28,880
 is to help us to pay attention to stories and records

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,280
 or histories related to the birth of our Savior.

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,120
 As you can see in this summary of Luke 1 and 2,

11
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,580
 the opening chapters of Gospel of Luke,

12
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:43,720
 you see pairs and pairs of stories

13
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,680
 that Luke is trying to tell us

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:52,040
 to prepare for the birth of our Savior.

15
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:56,560
 As you can see, 1.5-25 is the annunciation,

16
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,080
 that means the good news of giving birth of someone,

17
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,640
 annunciation of John the Baptist, the pioneer of Messiah.

18
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,600
 And then it is paired with the annunciation story of Jesus,

19
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,920
 our Savior, 1.26-38.

20
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,320
 And then there is a story in between 39-56,

21
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:20,280
 two mothers meeting together, Mary and Elizabeth.

22
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,880
 Elizabeth is the mother of John the Baptist

23
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,680
 and Mary is of course the earthly mother of Jesus, our Lord.

24
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,840
 And then there will be a birth stories of John the Baptist

25
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,120
 on the left, 1.57-80,

26
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:39,120
 and then birth story of Jesus, our Lord, 2.1-21.

27
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,440
 And then there are a couple of stories again

28
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,260
 to end this opening two chapters.

29
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,760
 Jesus in the temple when he was a baby

30
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,200
 being presented to the temple.

31
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,640
 And there were two individuals, Simon, Simeon,

32
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,320
 and Anna greeting and blessing the baby, Jesus.

33
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,320
 And then there will be an other,

34
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,120
 the other half of the pair of the story is Jesus

35
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:07,580
 finally going into the temple, his father's house,

36
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,400
 to debate with the teachers, chapter two,

37
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,400
 at the end of chapter two.

38
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,720
 Now Advent happens once a year,

39
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,720
 Christmas is only once a year.

40
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,440
 And I think when we read stories about Christmas

41
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,760
 in the Bible, Gospel of Luke particularly,

42
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,160
 we need to recover the sense of wonder,

43
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,000
 the sense of awe and wonder.

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,160
 Anybody seen a baby born in the delivery room?

45
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,960
 Life, I mean.

46
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,000
 No?

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,440
 Yeah, right?

48
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,040
 That's the sense of wonder.

49
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,520
 You don't have to be there to sense that.

50
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,940
 You just think about it

51
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:52,320
 and you will get that wonder, that sense of,

52
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,920
 it's like magic, right?

53
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,060
 The power of life, right?

54
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,380
 Giving birth to a new baby.

55
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,460
 And I believe that we need to recover

56
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:07,000
 that wonder of Christmas, the baby in the manger.

57
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,980
 As you can see, pairs of story gives you a sense of symmetry

58
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:16,540
 telling you the story of the birth of our savior

59
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:21,540
 under the sovereign orchestration of God.

60
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,020
 And everything's under God's control.

61
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,980
 Everything is under God's power

62
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,180
 in the birth story of Jesus.

63
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,220
 And Jesus came at the right time, in the right place,

64
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,420
 in the right spot.

65
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:38,420
 So we read the story in chapter one, 126.

66
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:42,420
 In the sixth month, God sent the angel Gabriel

67
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:46,180
 to Nazareth, a town in Galilee,

68
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,220
 to a virgin pledged to be married

69
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:52,160
 to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David.

70
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,700
 The virgin's name was Mary.

71
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,100
 The angel went to her and said,

72
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,340
 "Greetings, you who are highly favored.

73
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,980
 The Lord is with you."

74
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,940
 Mary was greatly troubled at his words

75
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:07,900
 and wondered what kind of greeting this might be.

76
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,100
 Now in the sixth month,

77
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:13,460
 that is six months after the annunciation of Gabriel

78
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:17,140
 to Elizabeth about the birth of John the Baptist,

79
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,460
 the pioneer.

80
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:22,500
 So Elizabeth was pregnant with John the Baptist,

81
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,420
 and six months later, Gabriel showed up to Mary.

82
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:31,460
 Now at this time, Mary is pledged to be married to Joseph,

83
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,140
 a probably a young man.

84
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,240
 And of course, Mary was very young as well.

85
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,660
 And Joseph was a descendant of David.

86
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:43,940
 And Mary at this point probably is 12 to 13 year old,

87
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,500
 14 year old.

88
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,020
 Yeah, back in the days, you know,

89
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,860
 people lived differently, right?

90
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,340
 Back then people get married very, very early on

91
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,580
 and they build a family

92
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,700
 because most of the people died young.

93
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,460
 So from different passages of the Bible,

94
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,660
 we know Joseph and Mary, this couple,

95
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:07,300
 come from a poor Jewish families.

96
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:11,580
 Like every typical young Jewish couple,

97
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:16,580
 everything seems to have been arranged.

98
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,900
 When you hit 13 year old, 14 year old,

99
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,140
 when you were a teenager, Joseph and Mary,

100
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:27,300
 they were expected to follow some sort of pattern,

101
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,820
 to build their own small family,

102
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:33,380
 get married, build a small family, and that's it, right?

103
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,000
 That's your life goal.

104
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,020
 You enter that stage,

105
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,380
 you automatically will do something

106
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,660
 as expected by the society.

107
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:44,140
 So Joseph and Mary, I would say,

108
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,940
 were expecting just to get married

109
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,540
 and build their own small family

110
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,220
 and have their own child and have their own children

111
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:54,900
 and then live in Israel

112
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:59,340
 to grow their own family,

113
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,980
 to join the extended family to celebrate,

114
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:05,380
 and that is expected for them.

115
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:10,380
 But comes the divine interruption to their life's plan,

116
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:14,440
 and that interruption is a big interruption.

117
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:19,260
 The angel Gabriel continues, 1 Dirty.

118
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:22,460
 The angel Gabriel said to Mary,

119
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,060
 "Do not be afraid, Mary.

120
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,440
 "You have found favor with God.

121
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,780
 "You will be with child and give birth to a son,

122
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:34,300
 "and you are to give him the name Jesus.

123
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,320
 "He will be great and will be called the Son of Most High.

124
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,260
 "The Lord God will give him the throne of his father, David,

125
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:45,540
 "and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever.

126
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:48,500
 "His kingdom will never end."

127
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:53,100
 What an interesting and astonishing news, right?

128
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,060
 You will be pregnant and the child will be what?

129
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,700
 A king, and his kingdom will be forever, right?

130
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,980
 It's astonishing to just think about it, right?

131
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:09,900
 When my wife was pregnant with the first child,

132
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,560
 nobody said these words to me.

133
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,380
 They probably would say to me,

134
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:20,440
 "Okay, you better get ready, sleep more,

135
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,200
 "because you will be deprived of sleep,

136
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,100
 "and you better save up some money

137
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,940
 "because you will be in debt," right?

138
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:31,060
 But here, for the announcement for the child,

139
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:34,700
 he will be great and will be called the Son of Most High,

140
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:39,020
 and he will be king, and his kingdom will last forever,

141
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:42,140
 and there is no end for his reign.

142
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,140
 It's astonishing.

143
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:47,700
 134, "How will this be?"

144
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,740
 Mary asked the angel, "Since I am a virgin."

145
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,900
 The angel answered, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you.

146
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,620
 "The power of the Most High will overshadow you,

147
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:59,840
 "so the Holy One to be born will be called the Son of God.

148
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,180
 "Even Elizabeth, your relative,

149
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,740
 "the mother of John the Baptist,

150
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:06,400
 "is going to have a child in her old age.

151
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,160
 "She who was said to be barren is in her sixth month,

152
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:15,100
 "for nothing is impossible with God."

153
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,500
 Now, one can imagine the shock

154
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,580
 and the astonishing news, right?

155
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:21,900
 Gabriel announces God's plan,

156
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,640
 actually it's God's interruption,

157
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:27,300
 major interruption in Mary's life and in Joseph's life.

158
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,960
 It's a major detour, major interruption

159
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,000
 for her original plan.

160
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,180
 Remember what I said in the social custom

161
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,320
 of Mary's and Joseph's day?

162
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,200
 They were expected to just get married

163
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,060
 and have their own family, and they just move on.

164
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:47,540
 But one can imagine many whys in Mary's head.

165
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:52,360
 Perhaps Mary would ask, "Why me?"

166
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:57,000
 Because there are so many Marys on the street, right?

167
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,600
 According to some statistics,

168
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:04,460
 more than 50% of girls, Jewish girls, were named Mary.

169
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,500
 There are tons of Mary out there.

170
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,640
 Why me, right?

171
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,740
 And perhaps there are many young couples

172
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,920
 engaged in Israel at that point, right?

173
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,620
 They are not the only one engaged.

174
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:24,920
 Many other are pledged to get married at that point.

175
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:29,840
 And perhaps I think the most perplexing question is 34.

176
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,520
 Verse 34, "How will this be?"

177
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,980
 The young girl Mary asked the angel Gabriel,

178
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,640
 "Since I am a virgin," right?

179
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,320
 That is difficult to swallow, right?

180
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,820
 A virgin birth.

181
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:46,920
 As for Joseph, I think it will be difficult

182
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,120
 to explain as well.

183
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:53,360
 As you know the story from the Gospel of Matthew,

184
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,400
 Joseph wanted to divorce Mary secretly

185
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,140
 in order to protect her, not to shame her.

186
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,560
 But because of divine intervention,

187
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,360
 Joseph obeyed and took Mary as his wife.

188
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:12,000
 In any case, it was a major, major just interruption

189
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,380
 in their life, right?

190
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:19,380
 When God moves so often, He moves with interruptions.

191
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,320
 Is that interesting?

192
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,340
 Is that interesting?

193
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,600
 When God moves in your life,

194
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,660
 sometimes He does so with detour.

195
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,700
 Something that is not expected.

196
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,060
 Something that you never thought of.

197
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,180
 So how did Mary respond to the angel?

198
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:45,440
 Verse 38, "I am the Lord's servant," Mary answered,

199
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,500
 "May it be to me as you have said."

200
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,200
 Then the angel left her.

201
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,740
 Now if you come from a Roman Catholic background,

202
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,620
 you probably heard of the phrase Mary's fiat.

203
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,340
 Mary's fiat.

204
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,780
 Anyone from the Catholic background?

205
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,100
 Maybe you went to a Catholic school

206
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,660
 or maybe you come from a Catholic,

207
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,780
 Roman Catholic family.

208
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:09,240
 If you have that background,

209
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,240
 you probably have heard the phrase, the fiat of Mary.

210
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:19,980
 It tried to capture Mary's reply to the angel.

211
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,820
 If you don't have Catholic background,

212
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:26,360
 you might have heard the word fiat as well, right?

213
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,580
 Fiat is Italian auto brand, all right?

214
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:34,940
 So when I prepare this sermon,

215
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,860
 I shop around for fiat as well.

216
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,140
 That is fiat.

217
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,820
 Of course, when we talk about Mary's fiat,

218
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,320
 we don't mean Mary had a Italian car, right?

219
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:50,420
 And by the way, before I bought a Mini Cooper,

220
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:55,180
 I was debating to get a fiat, but I didn't.

221
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,180
 I got a Mini Cooper.

222
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,820
 Anyways, Mary's fiat.

223
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:03,140
 We don't mean Mary had a car.

224
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:07,980
 The word fiat comes from the Latin translation of the Bible

225
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:11,060
 some 400 years after Christ.

226
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:15,940
 So it's somewhere around the fourth century after Christ.

227
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,980
 Some Bible translator translate the Bible

228
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,740
 into the common language of the day.

229
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,780
 And the common language, common,

230
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:27,660
 is the Latin word voce.

231
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:31,620
 Voce, voce means common language.

232
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,220
 Back then, a lot of people were using Latin

233
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,180
 as their common language.

234
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,460
 The Bible has to be translated into Latin.

235
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,660
 And that translation is very famous,

236
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:43,300
 very popular at that time, called voce.

237
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,860
 And in the voce translation, the words of Mary,

238
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:51,860
 the first word, may it be, is translated in Latin, fiat.

239
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,980
 So you got it, right?

240
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,880
 Fiat is Italian word.

241
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,140
 It means let it be, let there be.

242
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:04,220
 You remember Genesis 1?

243
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:09,220
 When God set up the cosmos, when God set up the universe,

244
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,500
 what was the first word spoken by God?

245
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,300
 What was the first word?

246
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,220
 Let there be, right?

247
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,820
 Let there be light.

248
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:23,820
 And in voce, in the Latin translation, is fiat, looks.

249
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:28,340
 Fiat, let there be, let it be.

250
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,060
 Looks, light.

251
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,860
 Fiat, looks.

252
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,660
 Let there be.

253
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:40,780
 So when Mary says, fiat, let it be,

254
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:43,140
 it means let your will be done.

255
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,100
 Well, I don't understand.

256
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,060
 I cannot comprehend everything.

257
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:52,580
 But let it be, fiat, is a word of faith.

258
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:57,180
 Now at this point, I'm sure Mary doesn't even know

259
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:00,420
 how the birth of Savior can be accomplished

260
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,660
 since she was a virgin.

261
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,220
 And what will be the son's destiny?

262
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:10,680
 What will happen to my son, to this special son?

263
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,980
 What will be her future?

264
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,860
 Nothing is in the answer.

265
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:23,460
 There were tons of uncertainties, unknowns at this point.

266
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,500
 For this high school girl, right?

267
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,980
 13, 14 year old Mary, God bless her.

268
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:32,740
 And that is so special about Mary.

269
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:38,940
 Now, of course, if you come from a Roman Catholic background

270
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:43,500
 you will find doctrines that would amplify,

271
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,300
 that would amplify Mary's status.

272
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,400
 If you come from a Roman Catholic background,

273
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:54,000
 they would describe Mary in highly exalted term,

274
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 like co-redemptrix, co-redemptrix.

275
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,340
 So Mary, because of her obedience,

276
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:06,300
 made salvation possible.

277
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,160
 So God, of course, is the first cause,

278
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,220
 but not without Mary's obedience.

279
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:16,540
 So in Roman Catholic theological term,

280
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,580
 it is highly exalted because Mary's obedience

281
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,460
 then make the redemption possible.

282
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:25,220
 So she is called co-redemptrix.

283
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:30,220
 And sometimes called mediatrix, mediatrix,

284
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:35,540
 the mediator or female mediator between God and humanity.

285
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:40,540
 Or because Mary's high status, exalted status,

286
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:45,400
 she has, she's being described as perpetually virgin,

287
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:50,400
 perpetual virginity, or immaculate conception.

288
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,600
 It means when she was born, when Mary was born,

289
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,000
 she was born without original sin.

290
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 She was not born like us in the sinful condition.

291
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,600
 Now this sort of theological imagination

292
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,780
 found no biblical data, no biblical support.

293
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:14,520
 As you can see, Luke 1:46, in one of the Psalms

294
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:18,300
 that Mary sang to the Lord after receiving the annunciation,

295
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,880
 Mary said, "My soul glorifies the Lord,

296
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,800
 "and my spirit rejoices in God, my Savior."

297
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,600
 Does Mary need a Savior?

298
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,680
 Yes, she does, right?

299
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:37,060
 1:46, Gospel of Luke, and 1 Timothy 2.5.

300
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,360
 It says point blank, there's one God,

301
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,960
 and how many mediator between God and man?

302
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,720
 One, right?

303
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,460
 One mediator between God and man, the man, Jesus Christ.

304
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:57,040
 So it is clear there's no biblical warrant

305
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,480
 to describe Mary in such a high status.

306
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,760
 But we still need to wonder,

307
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,760
 we still need to wonder how a teenage girl,

308
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:11,760
 how a teenage Jewish girl could have such a great faith.

309
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,680
 Right?

310
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:19,160
 You go to a high school fellowship,

311
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:23,000
 you pick one of those girls, you ask them,

312
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,240
 "Do you believe in Jesus Christ?

313
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,040
 "Do you believe in God?"

314
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,200
 They probably will say, "I come to church because it's fun."

315
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,120
 Mary is being set apart here.

316
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,080
 But I wanna make sure that you understand

317
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,320
 this is not blind faith.

318
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,880
 'Cause so often we morning people would see faith

319
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:46,120
 as some sort of blind, irrational belief,

320
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,120
 or wishful thinking.

321
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,640
 You know, in the Bible, faith is not like that.

322
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,240
 In the Bible, faith is based on something solid,

323
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,920
 and that is the character of God, the faithfulness of God.

324
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,240
 And God has revealed Himself in the history

325
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,880
 and in Scripture that He is faithful.

326
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,680
 So that kind of faith is not blind faith,

327
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,000
 it's reasonable faith.

328
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,880
 It's great faith indeed, but it's reasonable.

329
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,960
 So no matter what, God will work things out

330
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,960
 for His own glory.

331
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,800
 Even though we don't know or we cannot comprehend.

332
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,600
 And as for Mary, it's the same thing.

333
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,600
 I just don't know how it would be accomplished.

334
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,920
 I just don't know how it will unfold, right?

335
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,520
 We are at the end of the story,

336
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,800
 we saw the end of story because Jesus died on the cross

337
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,120
 and on the third day He rose from the dead, right?

338
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,640
 But for Mary at this point,

339
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,640
 she had to wait for another 30 some years

340
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:48,840
 in order to see the full plan of God revealed, right?

341
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,880
 But at this point, she is the first hero of faith

342
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,680
 in the New Testament.

343
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,960
 Let it be, fear it.

344
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:02,320
 And after this, Mary rushes to see her relative, Elizabeth.

345
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,600
 And we see here this exchange between two mothers.

346
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:11,200
 We see why Mary was so special.

347
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,080
 Luke 1:39, "At that time, Mary got ready

348
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:19,080
 and hurried to the town in the hill country of Judea,

349
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:23,920
 where she entered Zechariah's home and greeted Elizabeth.

350
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,360
 When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting,

351
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,280
 the baby lived in her womb

352
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,800
 and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit."

353
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,920
 1:42, "In a loud voice, she exclaimed,

354
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,360
 'Blessed are you among women

355
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,200
 and blessed is the child you will bear.

356
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,320
 But why am I so favored

357
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,840
 that the mother of my Lord should come to me?

358
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:51,160
 As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears,

359
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,040
 the baby in my womb lived for joy.

360
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,160
 Blessed is she who has believed

361
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:02,160
 that what the Lord has said to her will be accomplished.'"

362
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,840
 You notice where's John the Baptist here?

363
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,040
 It's in the womb of Elizabeth, right?

364
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,840
 Still in the womb, six months.

365
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:15,320
 And this baby in the womb is already hearing

366
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:20,000
 the coming of the Savior by greeting the mother of Jesus.

367
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,320
 It's jumping inside the womb.

368
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,560
 But how does the Bible,

369
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,280
 how does the scripture describe Mary here?

370
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:35,280
 1:45, "Blessed is she who believe."

371
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:40,240
 You see here, it's not Mary is essentially different from us.

372
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,640
 It's not because she is holier.

373
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:48,160
 It's not because she is set apart from us, essentially.

374
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:52,360
 She is the same human being just as we are.

375
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:56,000
 It is not Mary is essentially different from us.

376
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,320
 It is she who believe.

377
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,840
 It is her faith, her faith in God,

378
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,040
 in God's plan, in God's bigger plan.

379
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:09,960
 Even her own plan is being disturbed,

380
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:14,440
 her own plan being interrupted or detoured.

381
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,840
 But she puts her faith in God,

382
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,680
 knowing that the plan of God will not fail.

383
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:28,320
 Many years ago, there's a British Bible translator

384
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:33,120
 or British Bible scholar named J.B. Phillips.

385
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,360
 J.B. Phillips translated the New Testament

386
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,280
 into contemporary English at that time.

387
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,680
 And he wrote some other books.

388
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:44,400
 And one of the little books that we should all read,

389
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,520
 we should all read.

390
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,840
 It's a very little, tiny book.

391
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,000
 And sometimes you pick up a book,

392
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,760
 you have to read cover to cover

393
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,720
 in order to find out the content, right?

394
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,000
 But for some books, if you pick it up,

395
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,320
 you read the title of the book,

396
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,360
 you immediately know what the book is all about.

397
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,120
 You don't have to read.

398
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,320
 You ever encounter any books like that?

399
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,120
 You pick it up, read the title or subtitle,

400
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,400
 you know what the book is all about.

401
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,400
 You don't have to read it.

402
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,080
 You don't have to buy it.

403
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,320
 Some books are like that.

404
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,280
 And J.B. Phillips wrote such a book.

405
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,160
 And the book title is "Your God is Too Small."

406
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,520
 Your God is too small.

407
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:28,000
 It's a tiny little book.

408
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,240
 It would be beneficial for you to pick it up and read it,

409
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,360
 you know, to edify your faith, to build your faith.

410
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,200
 But as I said, you pick up this book,

411
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,080
 very thin, it's like a booklet.

412
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,840
 And you immediately know what the message is all about.

413
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,040
 Your God is too small.

414
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,080
 Do we all have the same struggle?

415
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,280
 We do.

416
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:56,880
 We struggle with the fact that our God is too small.

417
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,600
 It's way too small

418
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:03,600
 because we create our God in our own image, right?

419
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,160
 Instead of the other way around,

420
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:08,440
 when things don't seem the way we expected,

421
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,560
 when we face uncertainties,

422
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,240
 when things seem to be in chaos,

423
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:19,240
 we reduce God into a little idol.

424
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,280
 God is too small.

425
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:25,960
 And sometimes our prayer can be too small.

426
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,480
 What have you been praying for?

427
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,640
 What have you been praying for this month?

428
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:39,440
 Probably some needs or some list of things that you want,

429
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,280
 right?

430
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:45,520
 And the message seems to challenge all of us

431
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,240
 that sometimes our prayer can be too small

432
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,880
 because our God is too small.

433
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:56,680
 And sometimes our own plan may also be too small.

434
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:01,680
 And we seldom think of the plan of God,

435
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,520
 which is much, much, much bigger.

436
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:10,040
 It takes miracles to see the plan of God.

437
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,920
 It takes God himself to accomplish

438
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,240
 something that is worthy of his name.

439
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:22,760
 Sometimes it takes God's power and our obedience,

440
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:27,560
 our fear in order to see the big plan of God.

441
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:31,760
 Now, the faith of Mary is fear.

442
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,760
 Let there be.

443
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,240
 Yes, I don't understand.

444
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,960
 I don't see all the details.

445
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:43,840
 I don't see the details as yet, but let it be, fear it.

446
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,760
 I don't need all the details worked out before I say so.

447
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:53,120
 May this be our prayer, our attitude and our faith.

448
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,600
 Let's pray together.

449
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:00,400
 Father, thank you for being our God.

450
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:05,200
 Thank you for being our big, big God,

451
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,560
 much bigger than we think,

452
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:13,520
 much bigger than our mind and our plan and our thinking.

453
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,480
 You are indeed worthy of our worship.

454
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:21,720
 So we come before you in humility,

455
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:27,920
 knowing that you are the one who makes all things new.

456
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:34,280
 You are the one who control and orchestrate everything

457
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,920
 from the greatest to the least.

458
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,680
 All things are in your hand.

459
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:43,120
 So we commit our life into your hand.

460
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:48,200
 And I pray that you'll help us to say fear it,

461
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,920
 to say let it be.

462
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:55,280
 In our life journey, we wanna see your glory.

463
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,560
 In our faith, we wanna see your power.

464
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:03,240
 So grant us this obedient, obedient attitude,

465
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:08,720
 the faith that we're gonna see that you are faithful.

466
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,240
 And the plan that you accomplish is much bigger,

467
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,720
 bigger than our own plan.

468
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,560
 Father, once again, use us, use our faith,

469
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:23,280
 increase our faith and help us to be loyal and faithful

470
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:27,480
 to follow you, to serve you, to continue to worship you

471
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,840
 so that we will see your glory more and more

472
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,400
 as we experience your power.

473
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,240
 In this Advent season, come to us

474
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,880
 and we open our hearts to welcome you,

475
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:43,960
 our Lord Jesus, who come as a baby in the manger

476
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:48,640
 to bless us, to redeem us and to save us

477
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,040
 so that we can be your sons and daughters.

478
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:56,120
 Thank you and we worship you in Christ and pray.

479
00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:01,040
 Well, God bless you and see you next Sunday.

480
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:04,520
 And remember next Sunday is gonna be 5 p.m., right?

481
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,120
 5 p.m., yeah, don't come in the early morning, okay?

482
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,520
 There's no breakfast for you.

483
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:13,520
 Get your ticket and join our Christmas baptism Sunday.

484
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,560
 All right, God bless.
