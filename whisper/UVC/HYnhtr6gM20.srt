1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
 Well, thanks Kelly. And we do have some staff transition this month and this year

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:11,520
 uh, Reverend Ng, our senior adult minister is going to retire by the end of this month and

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,400
 actually some of the senior adults are having a

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,120
 farewell with him today

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:23,040
 So we're going to pray for him because he's getting weak and he cannot serve us

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,040
 Any anymore because he's physically and mentally being challenged

7
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:32,800
 um, so continue to pray for Reverend Ng and he's going to retire and the staff will

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,400
 um

9
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,880
 Be making some transition in our staffing and in our ministries as well

10
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:44,800
 Uh, so more details to you and Kelly. Thanks for announcing the general assembly and please

11
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,200
 Make time to be here

 because we're going to go through our finance and our needs in the church and

13
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,040
 We invite you to participate and to contribute

14
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,520
 and once again, uh, Chi is going to be our assistant pastor and

15
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,000
 We can only afford him for part-time position

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,720
 Um, so, uh, please continue to give and please continue to support the church ministry so that we can grow together. All right

17
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,280
 um, so, um

18
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:20,880
 Do come to the general assembly and we'll tell you all the details and uh things that we forecast and we do need

19
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,000
 every sister and brother in Christ to

20
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:30,060
 Participate and to build this church together because this church is the body of Christ. It's our body is our family

21
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,620
 So we are all part of it and we are all members and we need to

22
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,500
 Work together and build this church. All right

23
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,300
 Um today I would like to start a mini

24
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,940
 sermon series on worship

25
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,100
 uh worship

26
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,060
 Uh, you probably come to church for some time

27
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,020
 Uh, probably you're the first time here. But in any case sometimes we gather

28
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,580
 uh together to sing

29
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,660
 to pray

30
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:03,340
 and to read scripture and reflect on the word of God and we're going to

31
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:07,580
 Care for one another and this is what worship service

32
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,740
 Uh looks like

33
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,740
 and I think years of

34
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:15,360
 COVID and pandemics have deteriorated

35
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,380
 our sense of worship

36
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,900
 Don't you agree?

37
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:26,220
 Right. I mean remember those three plus years we had the online and live streaming, right?

38
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:30,620
 Where were you right? You were probably on your bed, right?

39
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:36,860
 You're sleeping in and then oh, it's about time to uh, join the online worship service and you turn on your phone, right?

40
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:42,380
 And then you kind of like you didn't brush your teeth and you know, you just watch your phone and oh I worship

41
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:46,700
 You know, you know, we are deteriorate into that kind of uh,

42
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:51,420
 You know low state of worship. So, uh, we have to pick it up

43
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:56,380
 We have to understand what worship is all about and we have to understand why we are here

44
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:03,020
 Right, we are here not only because of some of the benefits that we get, you know people and friends and uh,

45
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:09,580
 You know food and all that stuff, but we need to understand why we are here to worship and the word worship

46
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:15,260
 Is actually coming from uh an old anglish word of worship, right?

47
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,820
 uh, what is what what it does, uh mean is that um

48
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,620
 something of value

49
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,700
 and something of honor

50
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:30,780
 Either a person or an object that we assign or we ascribe to someone or something, right?

51
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,700
 Someone or something

52
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,020
 Um, you go buy a car, right?

53
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:38,220
 These days cars are very very expensive, right?

54
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,700
 Uh, someone just bought a new car

55
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,380
 uh lately

56
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:46,140
 Uh, and she paid for over 40k

57
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:50,940
 For japanese car, right? Of course. It's a great car, right?

58
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,740
 But is it worth right?

59
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,540
 That's the word is all about

60
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,900
 you

61
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:05,820
 Think of value and honor of a person on object and you ask the question whether he or she or it worth

62
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:12,620
 The uh the value that we assign or we ascribe to it and in some sense worship is all about value

63
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,100
 And honor we ascribe to god

64
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:21,980
 God is great and god is to be honored and he deserves the honor and that's what worship is all about

65
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,220
 And you flip the pages of scripture

66
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:28,220
 from the book of psalms from the old testament from the new testament and

67
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:31,180
 It talks about the

68
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,480
 worthiness of god

69
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:39,580
 Worth our time and our effort to bring him the glory and to praise him

70
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,200
 sample here

71
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,780
 Revelation chapter 4 11 you are worthy

72
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:48,060
 Oh lord our god to receive

73
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,620
 glory honor and power

74
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,020
 both revelation talking about having you

75
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,080
 Worship what we do eternally

76
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:02,860
 It's all about worship. It's all about the worth of god that we bring to him and we praise it

77
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,580
 And that's what worship is all about. We have to see

78
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,060
 the value of god

79
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,660
 in your life

80
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,940
 That god is worthy of your everything

81
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:16,460
 Your praises and your prayers and your worship

82
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:19,580
 So we're going to turn to psalm 8

83
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:26,620
 And to think about this topic of worship and you have your bible, please open it up to psalm 8

84
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:31,340
 It says it's a very very short, uh, nine verses long psalm

85
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,900
 That talks about worship and there are three points I want to go through with you

86
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,100
 First two verses it talks about the worth of god

87
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:46,860
 And then the second part the middle part talking about our worth as human beings as creatures of god

88
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51,660
 And then the last part talking about our mission our work

89
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,120
 Uh, we can

90
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:59,120
 Collaborate or we can serve god and work with god together in this world of creation

91
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:06,160
 So let's go through this psalm together psalm 8 a psalm of david. So it's written by david the psalmist

92
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,020
 It says oh lord our lord

93
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:15,900
 How majestic is your name in all the earth you have set your glory above the heavens

94
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,700
 You have set your glory and honor

95
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,420
 above heavens

96
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,900
 So you can see what david is trying to do

97
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,620
 He observes the heavens the sky

98
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:32,460
 And then the earth the creation the cosmos the vast universe

99
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:36,140
 And then he exclaimed that god is to be worshipped

100
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:41,660
 How majestic your name in all the earth I can see your name. I can see your power

101
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:47,980
 I can see your authority over everything that you have created and that's what david is doing

102
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,860
 He looks at the universe and then he bursts out with

103
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:54,220
 Uh

104
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,220
 awe and wonder

105
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:00,540
 Now I think I think if we have to rebuild our life of worship

106
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:05,100
 If we need to know how meaningful it is to gather as church

107
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:12,060
 No matter how many people we have to worship god together. We have to recover a sense of awe and wonder

108
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,460
 Don't you agree?

109
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,220
 the awe and wonder

110
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:20,460
 when we observe the vast universe how amazing it is

111
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:26,140
 And then we think of the the designer or the the god who created everything

112
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,700
 And we think of him as someone

113
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,660
 and that

114
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:38,620
 We cover that sense of uh, uh, awe and wonder and we praise him and we worship him. That's what david is doing here

115
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:41,500
 Now last week millions of people

116
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:47,660
 Woke up early or even be there, you know a day or two before and they went to

117
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,700
 Uh the the path of totality, right?

118
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,920
 and to see the

119
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,300
 100

120
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,060
 solar eclipse

121
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,060
 How many of you did see it?

122
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,580
 Did you see it?

123
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:04,540
 No. Yeah, right. So you went out to the street and it's all there, right?

124
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:09,980
 And you look up into the sky and then you see the wonder of creation

125
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:14,860
 Many of us or I should say well, probably many of us

126
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,620
 We went

127
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,620
 uh monday morning

128
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,940
 and drove many hours

129
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:28,940
 To reach that path of totality and in order to observe the the amazing universe

130
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:34,220
 right the vast, uh, uh universe the uh,

131
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,860
 awe and wonder

132
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,100
 Some people even tear up when they see

133
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:43,660
 The solar eclipse right? Isn't that amazing? I saw it too, right?

134
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:48,060
 And you know according to some survey there were about four millions of people

135
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,780
 four million people

136
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,120
 They don't live along the path of totality

137
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,580
 but they

138
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,420
 They they drove there

139
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:02,380
 Right, they they they drive there or they fly there in order to see that right?

140
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,540
 um

141
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,540
 It's just amazing number, right?

142
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:11,900
 And I did a short video and um, I I thought of uh this book

143
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,340
 called uh, the privilege planet

144
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:18,300
 Uh, it was written some years ago by two

145
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,140
 scientists

146
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,180
 and

147
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:26,220
 What they are trying to bring is the idea this the concept of you know, our earth

148
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:31,500
 Our planet earth is a privileged position to do all of this

149
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,640
 um

150
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,340
 observation

151
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,700
 and we

152
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,700
 they argue

153
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,380
 On this planet earth. We are in this swiss spot, you know

154
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:46,320
 the optimized place in the entire universe

155
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:54,160
 So that we can discover the laws of physics so that we can do a lot of different scientific discoveries

156
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,500
 And because we are being put in this

157
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:04,940
 Situation right the atmosphere is protecting us and we're not too far from the sun. We're not too close to the sun

158
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:11,020
 and then the moon and the stars and everything is being designed in such a way that

159
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:13,920
 makes scientific discoveries possible

160
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:21,580
 And I think that's a very very interesting idea. I know some people would disagree with it. But um

161
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:26,220
 If you look at psalm 8, that's what david is trying to say

162
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:34,140
 We are in the swiss spot on this planet earth and we can observe the wonder of creation the greatness of creation

163
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:37,820
 So we can appreciate how great our god is, right?

164
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,620
 verse 2

165
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,700
 from the lips of children and infants

166
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:49,900
 You have ordained praise because of your enemies to silence the foe and the avenger

167
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:53,100
 Now, what is what is he talking about? This is

168
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,900
 kind of a difficult verse

169
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,060
 And there are different translations

170
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:02,460
 Of this verse but the idea you can grab is pretty clear

171
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,340
 Uh, first of all is it talks about children

172
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,580
 and infants

173
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,700
 the babies

174
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,700
 Right the babies, you know our church has

175
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:17,900
 Many many babies, right? We have uh, some twins, you know, we have many cute babies

176
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,740
 you know

177
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:26,220
 We modern people we hold a baby in our arm, right hold an infant. Um, what what is your what's your feeling?

178
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,860
 Right

179
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,460
 It's awesome, right?

180
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,220
 It's cute baby

181
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,580
 Right. This is how modern people see babies

182
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,780
 But I probably explained this to you before

183
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,340
 for the ancient people in

184
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,780
 biblical culture

185
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:47,900
 Babies are not cute, right? Even we understand it, right? Well, I have two

186
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,460
 children, right?

187
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,460
 Uh, they are not cute anymore

188
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:56,780
 Um, they are older now and I continue to spend money on them, right?

189
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,180
 And they give me suffering

190
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:03,020
 So we don't we don't optimally think of they are cute, right?

191
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:08,000
 Now the ancient people they understood this because it's liability

192
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,940
 And babies are powerless people

193
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:18,940
 We understand it and they understood it because you know, we look at babies, uh, you know, we we have to feed them

194
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,580
 We have to change diapers for them

195
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,820
 And we have to protect them, right?

196
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,580
 my wife

197
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,740
 wakes up every saturday morning

198
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:35,260
 And she always has the habit to catch a tv show and the tv show is it's all about nature

199
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:42,860
 We're talking about some environmentalist going out to the nature and try to protect some of the extinct animals and all that stuff

200
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,180
 and she's always

201
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,180
 um, you know

202
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,900
 uh amazed by you know, how how

203
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:57,580
 How how interesting the universe is how interesting the creation is and you know, if you observe the creatures

204
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,980
 the animals

205
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,900
 most most of the animals

206
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,020
 when they

207
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,020
 give birth to

208
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:09,980
 The babies so-called the babies usually the babies can take care of themselves, right?

209
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,700
 either deer or birds

210
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,040
 uh

211
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,740
 Eagles, right? Usually they can take care of themselves, right?

212
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:24,620
 And the effort to feed them the effort to protect them are usually uh, pretty minimal

213
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:27,180
 but for humans

214
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,340
 We are not

215
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:34,220
 We're not you you think about it when we when we were born

216
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,100
 We were helpless

217
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:40,620
 We were powerless and when it's someone our parents

218
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,660
 you know to

219
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:46,700
 Love us to protect us to feed us

220
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,980
 And this is what verse two is all about

221
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,780
 It says god

222
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,540
 has ordained

223
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,540
 praise

224
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,540
 In the babies

225
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:06,380
 Right, I think a better translation is not the niv translation here. I think better translation is the word praise is actually strength

226
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:11,420
 Fortress or protection that means god is to protect

227
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,060
 the helpless babies

228
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,620
 Those people who find them helpless

229
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:22,220
 Those people who find them powerless and weak and they humble themselves before god

230
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:27,500
 And they're not proud before god. They will receive the protection and strength from god

231
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,780
 That's that's what psalm 8 is all about

232
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:35,180
 David looked at the sky and the universe and he

233
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:41,820
 Recovered the sense of wonder god is so great because the creation is so so great and we are so helpless

234
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:48,080
 And we are so powerless and we have to look up to god for help and strength and protection

235
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:51,020
 That's what psalm 8 2 is all about

236
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:56,620
 Now, um, we have to understand the psalm we have to understand the

237
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,620
 Design of the psalms, you know, the book of psalm has 150

238
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,880
 Psalms in it, right?

239
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,840
 And uh here I list out the first 14

240
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:11,800
 14 psalms and we know the the entire book of psalms the psalter

241
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,400
 has

242
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,020
 Two two psalms in the beginning psalm one and two as introduction

243
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:21,960
 Is a dual introduction to the entire book of worship book of psalms

244
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:29,560
 And then there's a group of psalms psalm three to seven we call them psalms of david is written by david

245
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:35,480
 um, and all of this psalms from three to seven has has one

246
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,100
 single central theme

247
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,360
 Is that david?

248
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,960
 was helpless

249
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,960
 he was being anointed king, but

250
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:49,240
 Uh, he was pursued by his enemies and he was hopeless to defend himself

251
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:53,740
 And he prayed to god and he's trusting god and god becomes his protection

252
00:15:53,740 --> 00:16:01,400
 And he puts his faith in god and god defends him god defends the humble and overcome his enemies

253
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:05,880
 That's what psalm three to seven is all about and then there's another group of psalms

254
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,440
 nine to fourteen

255
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,080
 Uh runs along the same idea

256
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:14,280
 They are the individual laments

257
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,640
 the psalmist is crying out to god because he

258
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:23,020
 Is powerless against his enemies all these persecutions and all these sufferings

259
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:28,600
 Uh difficulties in life and he look up to god psalm nine to fourteen

260
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,800
 It's all about humble people finding protection in god

261
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,440
 And psalm eight is right

262
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:39,240
 Between right at the center and it celebrates the power of god

263
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,120
 power of god over those

264
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,800
 Who are like babies?

265
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,480
 Who are defenseless?

266
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,480
 Who are powerless?

267
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:54,120
 Now should we get that feeling when we read the psalm along with the psalmist david

268
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:58,520
 And we are all struck by the power of god in creation

269
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:04,520
 And at the same time the power of creation the power of god humbles us

270
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:08,760
 And in light of god's greatness, we are like babies

271
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:13,240
 We exist we have our beings all depend on

272
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,800
 the god

273
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:21,000
 Who create everything who created you and who created me who sustained you?

274
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,720
 And who also sustained me?

275
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,240
 Without god we cannot

276
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,400
 be

277
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,400
 We cannot exist

278
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,400
 A couple weeks ago. Um, I have some serious, uh lower back pain

279
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:41,160
 You know, I haven't had back pain for a long time, but in a couple weeks ago, I just had this, you know

280
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:49,160
 Very quite serious, uh lower back pain and uh, I use a lot of uh, salonpas, you know, I put some all around me

281
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:54,760
 All around me, but you know, it didn't really help right and then my my skin got rashes in

282
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,240
 It's just terrible right?

283
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,880
 And I and I don't know what to do and I didn't get hurt, you know, I didn't do anything to get hurt

284
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:06,360
 And um, I don't know. Yeah, i'm over 50 years old, right?

285
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,280
 You look at me

286
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,280
 I'm in pretty good shape, right?

287
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,160
 Compared to other over 50 years old man, right?

288
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:19,880
 If you grade a man who were 50 years old, you know, great a b c d f right? I'm probably on the uh,

289
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,680
 You know the top level, right?

290
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:30,920
 But you know, I just find it difficult to to recognize that I I have this back pain, you know for days

291
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:36,280
 And the only conclusion I had is that i'm getting old

292
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:39,080
 I'm getting old

293
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,080
 And don't we all get get old, right?

294
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:46,920
 um, we we we get weak and we realize that only god

295
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:54,840
 Is our strength and that's why god is worthy of our praise when we see and sense his power in the creation

296
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:59,560
 Uh, psalm 8 continues to to tell us our worth

297
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:06,840
 Right. So david look at the universe and he think of how majestic the power of god is and he also

298
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,760
 Like looking in into the mirror

299
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:15,320
 He understand his own position in the universe

300
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:20,600
 Verse three he says when I consider your heavens the work of your fingers

301
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:24,360
 The moon and the stars which you have set in place

302
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:29,320
 What is man that you are mindful of him the son of man that you care for him?

303
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,120
 So he exclaims

304
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:38,520
 When I consider the heavens when I see that how big the universe is it tells us

305
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,400
 Hey, we are not worthless

306
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,400
 Even though we are so small

307
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,560
 And we are so insignificant

308
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:49,960
 But god cares for you and for me

309
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:55,320
 Sometimes don't we feel that way, you know go for our daily life, you know, we we

310
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,480
 We have to tackle different challenges and you know life is tough, right?

311
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:05,240
 And sometimes we do feel that way. We are insignificant. Nobody cares about us, right?

312
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:11,480
 Psalmic says no you are worthy in god's sight

313
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:18,280
 Yes, we are not worthy of the grace of god, right no one can earn the grace of god no one can

314
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,800
 Right. We're all sinners. We're all broken. However

315
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,440
 in the other hand

316
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,840
 The bible reminds us and psalm 8 reminds us

317
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,160
 We are worthy

318
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,160
 of god's sight

319
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,200
 And that's why some people read the psalm

320
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,120
 as

321
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,120
 Telling us the paradox

322
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,120
 of human being

323
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,120
 You know what paradox is

324
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,260
 It's not quite contradiction. It's not logical contradiction

325
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:49,560
 Paradox, it's like it's like two sides of the same coin

326
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,440
 Right, it tells different

327
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,920
 Aspect of the same entity

328
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,560
 Right, but it's a different angle

329
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:04,520
 Here psalm tells us the paradox of human being and we find both sides of being human

330
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,000
 Yes on the one hand

331
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,420
 In the vast universe. We are just like a speck of dust. We're so insignificant

332
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:14,600
 Yet on the other hand

333
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,920
 In god's sight you are worthy

334
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,360
 It says what is man?

335
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,560
 man in hebrew is

336
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:30,440
 And knows it's it's a it's a common word in hebrew to describe mankind. I think the nlt gets it

337
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:35,820
 Right nlt new living translation gets it right it translated as mere mortals

338
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:40,040
 Mere mortals and we are all mere mortals, right?

339
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,560
 And we'll die someday. We'll pass away someday, right?

340
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:47,240
 The song leader the worship leader reminds us right?

341
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,600
 Our life is broken, right? We are fragile

342
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:55,640
 We pass away quickly, right time flies. I was talking to one of the brothers

343
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:01,560
 Uh, you know, he said oh my kid is eight years old ten years old now, right? I said time flies

344
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:06,920
 Right, we pass away. I pass away quickly and we're mortals

345
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,880
 and then

346
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,720
 The son of man. What is the son of man that you care for him?

347
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,120
 right

348
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,000
 Here the original language is son of adam

349
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:24,680
 Where we get the english name adam, right? So we all know some hebrew, right?

350
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,680
 adam

351
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,600
 son of adam

352
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:34,440
 And what does it mean son of adam, you know hebrew hebrew is a pretty interesting, uh language sometimes

353
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:42,520
 Two words sound alike and the meaning are related, you know and adam or adam is one of the words

354
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,480
 Adam means you know man

355
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:50,760
 Person or a human being right and then in hebrew

356
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,320
 ground

357
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,680
 the earth

358
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,360
 You know the dust

359
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,100
 The earth what we're stepping on is adamah

360
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,360
 Right. So adam and adamah

361
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,560
 They're related right with dust

362
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:13,320
 We're turning to dust right? We are so close to the ground, right? So when when you die, you know six feet under right?

363
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,920
 We are mere mortals

364
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:20,680
 And the psalmist david is using those terms to remind us

365
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:25,500
 That we are limited. We are powerless and we are insignificant

366
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:29,340
 So yeah, there you go. If you feel that you are insignificant

367
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:32,600
 Nobody care about you and you sometimes feel

368
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:37,720
 That you are not good enough or you don't measure up when you compare to other people

369
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,000
 You're exactly right

370
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:46,680
 You should feel that way I should feel that way but the song reminds us the other side of the same coin

371
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:52,680
 That we marvel how valuable we are in the sight of god

372
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:56,200
 Again, two terms tell you

373
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:00,280
 How much worth you have in the sight of god?

374
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:05,080
 That you are mindful of him. What is meant that you are mindful of him?

375
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:10,200
 Mindful of him can be translated. God remembers you right?

376
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,680
 Uh when you're happy

377
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:20,280
 God remembers you when you are crying when you are weeping when you're sad when you're depressed god think about you

378
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,680
 think of you

379
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,600
 That's what mindful means

380
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,720
 and then

381
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:29,560
 What is the son of man that you god you care for him?

382
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,040
 and the word care

383
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:35,400
 Uh, it's a very interesting term again in hebrew. It can

384
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,040
 It basically means

385
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:45,640
 Role calling role calling, you know when we go to primary school when you go to high school the teacher walks into the classroom

386
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,120
 and she does

387
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,060
 the

388
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:51,060
 Attendance sheet, right?

389
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:53,240
 And then we'll call every single one of you

390
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,880
 Call you by name. Are you here?

391
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,520
 Call you by name. Are you here?

392
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,000
 That's what care for means

393
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,080
 You are on the list of god's

394
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:08,280
 attendance

395
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:12,040
 You are here and god is mindful of you that god cares for you

396
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:15,160
 So

397
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:19,720
 Here it reminds us that we are valuable in the sight of god

398
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:25,160
 and then at the same time he continues in verses five to nine to tell us how

399
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:30,440
 You know how how um, how glorious we are

400
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:36,440
 Versus five and following god you made him man

401
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:41,880
 Every one of us a little lower than the heavenly beings or angels

402
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,720
 And crown him with glory and honor

403
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,840
 You see that in the sight of god

404
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,520
 We are crowned

405
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,520
 with glory and honor

406
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:59,480
 We are so much better. We we this phrase is with glory and honor crown with crown him with glory and honor

407
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:04,840
 Basically means you have the highest honor in the entire universe

408
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,520
 No, you're different from all the other creatures

409
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:16,040
 Because we human beings are being created in the image of god and we have so much worth in the sight of god

410
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,920
 Yes, we are limited

411
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,920
 but we are

412
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,940
 Valuable in the sight of god

413
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:26,280
 Let me continue verse

414
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,440
 verse six and following

415
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:34,200
 You made him ruler over the works of your hand and you put everything under his feet

416
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,560
 all flocks and herds and beasts of the field

417
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:43,880
 The birds of the air the fish of the sea all that swim the paths of the seas

418
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,740
 Everything is under

419
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,920
 the feet of men

420
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:52,220
 Under the feet of humankind

421
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:56,920
 Um god made us god made human beings

422
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:03,180
 This is not an accident this is not an afterthought

423
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:09,000
 The psalmist is reminding you that god made you

424
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:17,400
 God made you however insignificant you feel god made you god created you

425
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:26,040
 Now you remember some some years ago. I talked about this picture pale blue dot remember this picture

426
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:31,560
 Um, it's it's taken by uh, nasa's uh voyage one

427
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,980
 Uh many many years ago. It was taken in the year of 1990

428
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:39,880
 February 14 valentine's day

429
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:44,360
 um, it's the voyage one is is a is a

430
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,440
 photographing

431
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:50,520
 Machine and just being launched by nasa into the deep space

432
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,380
 and on that day

433
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,480
 1990 february 14

434
00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:00,300
 The cameras switched back before, you know, uh, the earth disappeared

435
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,460
 And

436
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:06,700
 It took the picture and you can find the very very small dot

437
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:09,900
 the pale blue dot so-called

438
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:14,700
 still visible in the milky way

439
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:18,620
 Now that picture reminds us

440
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:25,260
 That we are a speck of dust in the universe. We're right there, right? Can you see that?

441
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:28,780
 We're right there

442
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,340
 and sometimes our secular culture

443
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:34,300
 Will have us believe that we are

444
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:37,100
 Not significant

445
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:43,980
 Or we have no meaning in our existence, right matters are eternal, right? All that matter

446
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:47,020
 Is the matter right?

447
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:52,300
 We're just a bunch of people, you know with our chemical makeup or physical makeup, right? And that's it

448
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,780
 Where is the?

449
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:57,900
 Where where is the intrinsic value of human being?

450
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,960
 We have no

451
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,620
 Intrinsic value. We're just accidents

452
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:05,740
 Um and nature just take its course

453
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:10,160
 And there's no inherent value or dignity in our existence

454
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:17,660
 Um, that's what the uh secular culture or naturalistic culture is trying to have us believe

455
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:21,980
 In the same way in the biblical culture

456
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:25,260
 in bible bible time

457
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:28,060
 You know all these neighbors of israel

458
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,680
 babylon egypt

459
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:36,620
 Or or whatever cultures are surrounding israel. They believe in some of the myths

460
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:43,660
 And some of the myths were saying that humans were being made to be slaves to other gods

461
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:49,820
 Humans exist because humans are to be slaves

462
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:56,780
 to the gods the lesser gods or the uh, the higher gods and all the gods are in in

463
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,340
 up there having vacation

464
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:06,300
 And you know from time to time we have to you know, bring in uh our offerings to please the gods, right?

465
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,860
 So the gods can have a good time up there

466
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:12,620
 And that is the cultural myth of the day

467
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:16,720
 if you if you if you hear the uh similarities

468
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,540
 The ancient stories

469
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:24,140
 the ancient myth of humans being slaves to the gods

470
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:27,820
 Right no values and then our western

471
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:30,140
 secular culture

472
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:32,140
 They're actually pretty similar

473
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:34,300
 We are here with no reason

474
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,300
 but the bible

475
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:42,060
 Says something totally different the bible says we human beings are no accident

476
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:44,860
 And you are not

477
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,860
 an afterthought to god

478
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:49,260
 The psalmist says god made us

479
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:52,140
 a little lower than the angels

480
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:58,700
 The highest honor we can have in the entire universe and secondly, it says god made human beings

481
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:02,460
 Rulers

482
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:06,140
 So human beings are unique. We have a royal

483
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:09,020
 status

484
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:11,020
 We're like kings and queens

485
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:14,540
 Only human beings are made in the image of god

486
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:17,900
 You know you we call genesis 1

487
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:21,660
 In fact, psalm 8 is a summary of genesis 1

488
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:29,180
 And it tells us god set us apart from all other things in the universe and all other creatures in the universe

489
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:31,920
 Because we are the image of god and we are the representatives

490
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:35,260
 Of god the king god the creator on earth

491
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:39,500
 So you read psalm 8 only nine verses

492
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:47,500
 Is actually a brief summary a condensed summary of genesis 1 god made everything in the universe for humans to flourish

493
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:52,300
 God made you and you are unique. There's no one like you

494
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:55,820
 There's no one like me and god gives

495
00:31:55,820 --> 00:32:01,420
 Each and every one of us the honor to rule with him to govern

496
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,860
 to

497
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,460
 operate

498
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,340
 to

499
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,460
 take care of

500
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,180
 uh

501
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:12,300
 The creation and we have this honor to be part of the work of god. All right

502
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:16,940
 As we close

503
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,940
 I want you to take three things home

504
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:21,020
 first

505
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:23,020
 You're worthy of god's care

506
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:26,300
 Your life your existence

507
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,540
 It's not talking about your work

508
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:31,740
 It's not talking about your your achievement

509
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,740
 you

510
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,580
 as a human being

511
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,420
 Man or woman

512
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:40,780
 You are worthy of the care of the creator god

513
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,780
 right

514
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:44,780
 Your existence your being

515
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:53,420
 It's not talking about your work right the asian culture. We are all performance based right? Oh, we got a four point also, you know

516
00:32:53,420 --> 00:33:00,940
 My parents would praise me right so I get more values or how much I earn how many figures on my paycheck

517
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:04,860
 Right. Those are our achievement that bring us values

518
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:09,980
 But some is telling you your being your existence alone

519
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,500
 is

520
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,700
 worthy

521
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,300
 of god's care

522
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:20,060
 And then secondly we are being called to care for the kingdom of god the creation work of god

523
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:22,940
 You go back tomorrow monday

524
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:25,660
 your accountant your teacher your

525
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:28,140
 Whatever industry you are in

526
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:33,660
 God see values in your work because you are making the you uh, the the creation

527
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,560
 working

528
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,860
 operating

529
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:39,820
 God can use the angels to do all your works

530
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:43,100
 Right to make the society running

531
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:47,580
 God can use other means but he has chosen you

532
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:51,100
 To be one of the workers to work alongside with him

533
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:58,060
 And that is the value of psalm 8. It's telling you god may you and me ruler

534
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:02,140
 We can take care of god's creation together

535
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:05,820
 And that's why we are different. That's why we're unique

536
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,660
 number three

537
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:10,300
 God is worthy of our worship

538
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:13,820
 God is worthy of our worship

539
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:21,920
 Uh, we have to recover the sense of wonder when we see the universe when we see the god behind the universe

540
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:25,340
 When we sing songs to god

541
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:31,900
 When we sing praises to god we just wonder man god is so great

542
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:39,020
 And yet he takes care of me, right? He can have relationship with me. He's like friend to me

543
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:42,700
 and I can have a personal relationship with

544
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,260
 with this creator

545
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:49,020
 Um god is worthy of our worship and we have to recover that sense

546
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:54,220
 You know, it's a sense of wonder all the time when we walk into the church when we worship together

547
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:57,420
 You know, I did not go to

548
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:04,780
 Uh the path of totality to see the full 100 solar eclipse. I should have gone. I should have gone now

549
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:06,540
 I regret it

550
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:12,780
 I should have gone. However, you know, my son went, you know, my son and his friends, you know about 10 of them

551
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:15,180
 uh, they drove a couple of cars and uh

552
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:22,800
 You know, my son nathan is in uh, uh champagne, right? He's in june. It's junior in in champagne

553
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,140
 So, uh, he he told us

554
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:30,380
 Hey dad, we we want to go to see uh, the uh, the solar eclipse

555
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:35,340
 I mean it would take us two hours of driving from champagne to somewhere called paris

556
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,260
 illinois

557
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,760
 Paris, you know not not france paris, illinois

558
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:43,420
 So, uh, so he told me about it, but we have to skip class

559
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:48,220
 I said sure. Yeah, right. Well you skip class anyway, so

560
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:54,860
 uh, so they drove they drove two hours to paris in the open field and then they

561
00:35:54,860 --> 00:36:02,540
 They bring the cameras and they they bring the devices and uh, they do the time lapse and stuff and it's just amazing

562
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:05,500
 And he sent back some of the video files to me

563
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:12,620
 and um, I I watched those videos and there's nothing to to really see except the the eclipse because the

564
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:17,420
 The camera is is facing upward right? You can only see the sun, but I can hear what they

565
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:19,420
 say

566
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:24,940
 In the entire time the full 100 solar eclipse takes about 3.5 minutes

567
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:28,140
 And I watched those videos looking at the sun

568
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:35,420
 And hearing what they say, you know three and a half four minutes long video

569
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:39,260
 And all I hear is wow

570
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:42,700
 Whoa

571
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,820
 Ah

572
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:47,980
 And all that's it's meaningless, you know words, right?

573
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:51,980
 But it's their the expression of sense of wonder

574
00:36:51,980 --> 00:37:00,220
 When you see the eclipse and you understand how vast the universe is and how how wonderful the universe you are all struck

575
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,220
 right

576
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:07,580
 And all they said in the in the entire four minutes is just that right? Wow

577
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:11,260
 This is great, this is wild

578
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:18,780
 Psalm 8 reminds us when we worship god we should have that sense of wow

579
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:22,220
 God is so great and yet he loves us

580
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:26,300
 Right you think about salvation we have in jesus christ

581
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:30,780
 God came to the speck of dust

582
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,420
 In this vast universe

583
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:36,220
 Jesus came and saved us

584
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:41,500
 Jesus came and died on the cross so that we can restore our relationship with him

585
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:45,180
 Wow

586
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,660
 We should be all struck

587
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:52,220
 By the greatness of god and by the love of god, right? Amen

588
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:56,140
 Let's all do that every single week

589
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,660
 When we come here

590
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,660
 Now we have to come on time. Okay

591
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:07,900
 But come on time because it's just like solar eclipse, right? You missed out you missed out, right?

592
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:15,740
 The entire worship service is the offering to god and to see that god is worthy of our praise

593
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:19,500
 Let's all pray together

594
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:23,420

600
