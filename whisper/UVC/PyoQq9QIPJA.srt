00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
 Welcome to the first of this series called Mapping the Bible.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,040
 Now this is a special series I've always wanted to do,

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,000
 to use Google Earth, videos, pictures, and different visuals

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,120
 to help us travel to the land of the Bible

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,440
 so we can appreciate, we can hear the messages of the Bible.

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,240
 You can see in my background,

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,960
 we are right above in the air of the land of Israel,

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,740
 the Bible land.

9
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,720
 Now of course the best ways to go about studying the land

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,840
 and how it relates to the messages of the Bible

11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,940
 is to go to Israel yourself, right?

12
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,640
 To study the land, to walk on the ground,

13
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,700
 to experience yourself.

14
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,320
 If you do that, I can almost guarantee you,

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,360
 you will see the Bible in a totally different new way.

16
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,400
 But we are still in the pandemic

17
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,480
 and international travel is such a hassle.

18
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,560
 So we cannot do that easily.

19
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,320
 However, we can use technology like Google Earth

20
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,700
 to help us out.

21
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,360
 Now you may think immediately,

22
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,680
 why do we need to study the land of the Bible?

23
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,600
 Can we just get to know God and read scripture directly?

24
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,160
 Why do we need to travel to the land of Israel, Palestine

25
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,880
 in order to get a better understanding of the word, right?

26
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,320
 Now I believe understanding the Bible,

27
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,720
 our faith has so much in common with traveling.

28
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,800
 Now think about it.

29
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,240
 Every time you open the pages of scripture,

30
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,500
 you turn to the word of God.

31
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,580
 You should recognize there is huge difference

32
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,340
 between our culture and the culture

33
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,500
 of the Old Testament and New Testament, right?

34
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,140
 In fact, the original languages of the Bible,

35
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,940
 even though translated into modern languages

36
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:43,720
 were in classical Hebrew, not modern Hebrew,

37
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,860
 classical Hebrew, some Aramaic in the Old Testament

38
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,940
 and the New Testament was written in Greek.

39
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,540
 So on top of linguistic language differences,

40
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:56,540
 our world and the biblical world are quite different

41
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,440
 in terms of cultural values, right?

42
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,540
 Customs and all that.

43
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,960
 We're not saying the Bible was simply a product

44
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,660
 of ancient culture, trapped in the ancient time.

45
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,860
 We're not trying to suggest that,

46
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,340
 but we need to understand when God reveals himself

47
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,380
 through scripture, God communicates in ways

48
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:18,340
 that are intelligent to the ancient audience

49
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:21,520
 using their languages, using their metaphors,

50
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,020
 using their images or their cultures.

51
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,820
 So in order for us to get a better understanding

52
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:32,660
 what scripture says or what scripture may mean to us today,

53
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:37,220
 we need to take a step back and kind of time travel

54
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:41,780
 to understand, to learn about how the first audience,

55
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,840
 the ancient Israelites received the messages, right?

56
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,860
 Now, somewhat like traveling to a foreign place,

57
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,660
 a foreign culture, a foreign country,

58
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,480
 different from our own.

59
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,520
 We first need to get some basic understanding

60
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,960
 of that culture, right?

61
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,340
 The history, the geography of that place,

62
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,040
 how those people live in that region and all that.

63
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,400
 We may get those information from a guidebook

64
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,400
 like Lonely Planet or find information off the internet.

65
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,960
 So now think about it.

66
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,960
 Every Bible reading, every time we think about the scripture

67
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,420
 is actually a cross-cultural activity.

68
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:26,660
 Now let me begin with Psalm 125, verses one and two.

69
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:29,460
 Those who trust in the Lord are like Mount Zion,

70
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:33,100
 which cannot be shaken but endures forever.

71
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,300
 As the mountains surround Jerusalem,

72
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:39,580
 so the Lord surround his people now and forevermore.

73
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,940
 Then the Psalm talks about God granting peace and security

74
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,460
 to those who are committed to the way of God,

75
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:49,480
 contrasting the wicked whose way will perish.

76
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,560
 But how do we understand the words,

77
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,640
 as the mountains surround Jerusalem?

78
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:00,440
 Now I am zooming into the Old City of Jerusalem.

79
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,880
 The yellow line you see on the map

80
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,800
 outlines the current Old City wall of Jerusalem.

81
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,240
 The city wall dates back to the Ottoman period.

82
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:15,240
 South of the Old City is the long, narrow Eastern Hill.

83
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,660
 This is where the Bible refers to as City of David,

84
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,420
 Mount Zion, ancient Jerusalem.

85
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,860
 Now if we are standing on the Eastern Hill,

86
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,940
 on an elevated point on the City of David,

87
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,620
 and take a 360 degree roundabout look,

88
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,860
 you will be able to appreciate Psalm 125.

89
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,060
 So we're looking north now.

90
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:42,060
 We see the Al-Aqsa Mosque, Temple Mount in front of us.

91
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,360
 Notice the elevation is higher than where we are,

92
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,040
 the City of David.

93
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,440
 Now turn a little bit to the right,

94
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,560
 northeast is Mount of Olives.

95
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,520
 Elevation again is higher.

96
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,320
 Continue to the east, we see the Palestinian village,

97
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,920
 Silwan, on the foothill.

98
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:04,560
 Now looking south, we see a mountain range.

99
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,620
 This is the southern approach to Jerusalem.

100
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,980
 On top of the hill is the United Nations Headquarters.

101
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,040
 Again, the elevation is higher

102
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,280
 than where we are standing now.

103
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,080
 Below us, there are some archeological remains.

104
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,000
 They date back to the pre-Israelite,

105
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,160
 Canaanite, Jebusite period,

106
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,320
 called the Step Stone Structure.

107
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:32,320
 Now southwesterly, we see a high hill called Western Hill.

108
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:37,480
 On top of it is the Catholic Church Domitian Abbey.

109
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,260
 Now continue turning back to where we started,

110
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:44,220
 we see the Temple Mount again.

111
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,660
 Now you should be able to appreciate

112
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:52,660
 the mountains surrounding us is hugging Jerusalem.

113
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,260
 It's the City of David, right?

114
00:05:55,260 --> 00:06:00,260
 Being surrounded by higher, elevated mountain range.

115
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:04,580
 So this psalm attributed to King David,

116
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,980
 but whoever wrote this psalm originally

117
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,540
 has to be someone who is familiar

118
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:12,720
 with the local physical settings of Jerusalem, right?

119
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,180
 Otherwise, he would not be able

120
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,100
 to write something like that.

121
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:21,100
 The psalmist is using local geographical terrain features

122
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,100
 to talk about something beyond geography,

123
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:29,120
 talks about theology, talks about faith, right?

124
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,720
 If we put our trust in God, look around you, right?

125
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,920
 Just like the Lord Yahweh will surround Jerusalem

126
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,340
 and protect Jerusalem,

127
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,060
 just like the mountains are protecting it, right?

128
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:45,060
 If we put our trust in God, the Lord God will protect us,

129
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,280
 will grant us security, will grant us peace.

130
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,860
 (gentle music)

131
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:53,440
 (gentle music)

132
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,020
 (gentle music)

133
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,600
 (gentle music)

134
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,180
 (gentle music)

135
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,760
 (gentle music)

136
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,000
 (gentle music)

137
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,880
 Now continue with our orientation of the land.

138
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,240
 This land of the Bible has many different names and labels.

139
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,340
 Sometimes it is called Israel, sometimes called Palestine,

140
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:20,080
 and Palestine was a name given by the Roman emperor

141
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,480
 after the defeat of second Jewish revolt

142
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,880
 in the second century AD.

143
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,040
 The Old Testament also has different names and labels

144
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,720
 to describe this land.

145
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,640
 Land of Canaan, the promised land,

146
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:36,040
 land flowing with milk and honey,

147
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:40,200
 and many call this land the Holy Land today.

148
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:44,200
 It is a religious symbol, a religious label.

149
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,340
 And yes, this is a sacred place

150
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:50,960
 because it is a sacred home of three different

151
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,840
 major monotheistic faiths, Judaism, Islam,

152
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,080
 and Christianity, of course.

153
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,440
 And some still call it Near East or Middle East.

154
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,400
 Why?

155
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,400
 Well, about 200 years ago in the 19th century,

156
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,200
 from the perspective of the European powers,

157
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,860
 this region is, of course, the East, right?

158
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,160
 Now, back then, it was under the control

159
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,440
 of the Ottoman Empire.

160
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,400
 At the end of 19th century,

161
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:27,000
 the first Sino-Japanese War broke out far away from Europe.

162
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,480
 And then the Ottoman Empire,

163
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:34,740
 which lasts for about 400 plus years, started to crumble.

164
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:39,740
 So to the Westerners, to the Western European powers,

165
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:44,140
 there were two different Eastern problems, right?

166
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,560
 There were two regions in the East

167
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,620
 that have some political struggles.

168
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,500
 One was the Far East.

169
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,340
 The Near One is naturally called Near East.

170
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:00,140
 Now, then in the 20th century,

171
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,380
 the Western countries recognized that the region

172
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:07,260
 of Persian Gulf and India was strategic

173
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,980
 to their political interests.

174
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:12,440
 So people started using terms like Middle East

175
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,100
 to describe Persian Gulf.

176
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,260
 And then as times go by,

177
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:23,260
 because Palestine is connected to Persian Gulf and beyond,

178
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:28,040
 the definition of Middle East enlarges

179
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,820
 to include the regions between Persian Gulf

180
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,020
 all the way to the Mediterranean Sea.

181
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:38,100
 So yes, the land of the Bible has many different names,

182
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,660
 but one thing remains constant.

183
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:45,660
 It is the geographical dynamics, the geographical feature.

184
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:49,140
 This is a land connecting three different continents.

185
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:54,140
 As you can see, Africa, Asia, and Asia Minor in Europe.

186
00:09:54,140 --> 00:10:00,260
 It is the center, the land bridge of the ancient world.

187
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:05,940
 It's a springboard, right, to go from one region to another.

188
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,300
 It's a place where people are connected,

189
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,660
 a place where people come and go all the time.

190
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:15,660
 Now, with this geographical perspective,

191
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:19,340
 I would like to suggest with some biblical geographers

192
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:24,340
 would say this land is appropriately described

193
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,520
 as the land between.

194
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,200
 It's always the land between,

195
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,000
 people come and go all the time.

196
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,380
 And the best way, the best value of this land

197
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:37,380
 is not to build an earthly empire, but to communicate,

198
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:43,460
 to tell the world a message, to broadcast a message.

199
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:49,820
 A Bible geographer rightly says,

200
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:54,820
 this land, the best value is to build a podium.

201
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,260
 It is to communicate.

202
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,900
 So if you think about it,

203
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:03,380
 isn't that why God would choose this land

204
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:06,940
 to begin his redemptive program?

205
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:11,260
 Isn't that why God would place his people

206
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:16,260
 to start his redemptive purpose in this place, right?

207
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:23,820
 Now let's look at a second passage today, Deuteronomy 11,

208
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,860
 Deuteronomy chapter 11.

209
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,740
 Now the book of Deuteronomy was the sermons

210
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,940
 of the servant of the Lord, Moses.

211
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:35,500
 When Moses was standing in the east side of River Jordan,

212
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,540
 he was not allowed to enter Canaan,

213
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:43,540
 but he is called by God to tell the Israelites,

214
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:46,820
 the next generation, as they go into Canaan,

215
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:50,480
 they have to pay attention to a few different things.

216
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,100
 Chapter 11, verses eight and following,

217
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:57,580
 "Observe, obey all the commands I am giving you today,"

218
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,100
 Moses said to the Israelites,

219
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,980
 "so that you may have the strength to go in

220
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,580
 "and take over the land that you are crossing

221
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,380
 "the Jordan to possess."

222
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:10,780
 Verse 10, "The land you are entering to take over

223
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:15,780
 "is not like the land of Egypt from which you have come,

224
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:18,880
 "where you plant your seed in Egypt

225
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,100
 "and irrigated it by foot as in a garden,

226
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,940
 "a vegetable garden."

227
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,900
 Verse 11, "But the land, the land of Canaan,

228
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,300
 "you are crossing the Jordan to take possession of

229
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,500
 "is the land of mountains and valleys

230
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,380
 "that drinks rain from heaven.

231
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:40,020
 "It is the land the Lord your God cares for.

232
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:44,780
 "The eyes of the Lord your God are continually on it

233
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:49,020
 "from the beginning of the year to its end."

234
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:53,560
 13, "So if you are faithfully obeying the commands

235
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,700
 "I'm giving you today to love the Lord your God,

236
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,940
 "to serve him wholeheartedly,

237
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:01,860
 "then I will send rain," God says, "on your land.

238
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:04,160
 "I will send rain on your land in this season,

239
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,280
 "in this right timing.

240
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,020
 "Autumn and spring rains will be sent to you

241
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,660
 "and you may gather in your grain,

242
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,400
 "your harvest, your new wine, and your oil.

243
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,240
 "I will provide grass in the fields

244
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,860
 "for your cattle, for your flock,

245
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,620
 "and you will eat and be satisfied."

246
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,020
 Now think about this passage.

247
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:25,000
 This passage is full of geographical details.

248
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,960
 Look at the land of Canaan.

249
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,120
 It is totally different from Egypt, right?

250
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,120
 Egypt, the delta, is flat with all the branches of Nile,

251
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,400
 because the Nile will flood annually,

252
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,760
 constantly supplying water to farmer.

253
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:44,320
 It is not like Egypt.

254
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,940
 Canaan is not like Egypt.

255
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:49,800
 Nor is it like Mesopotamia,

256
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:54,040
 where you got two big rivers, Tigris and Euphrates.

257
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,960
 The land of Canaan has no big river.

258
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:02,960
 The biggest river you can find is the Jordan River, right?

259
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,440
 But it is very small.

260
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,680
 It flows through the dry and thirsty land

261
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:13,080
 of the wilderness of the Jordan River Valley.

262
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,740
 So there's not much use of it in terms of farming.

263
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,520
 So in order to survive in this land,

264
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:23,600
 Deuteronomy says you need to understand

265
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,140
 this is different geographically from Egypt,

266
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,680
 where you come from.

267
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,680
 In Canaan, you have to depend on rain from heaven.

268
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:34,520
 Around the rainy season of October and November,

269
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:39,200
 rain clouds will move from west to east, all right?

270
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:44,200
 Rain clouds will bring in water to water the land,

271
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,560
 so you can farm, you can harvest,

272
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,800
 you will have food to eat.

273
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,320
 But when rain is not enough,

274
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,400
 is when rain is not sufficient,

275
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,420
 you get drought and famine.

276
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,700
 So the book of Deuteronomy says

277
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:04,420
 you have nothing to depend on in the land of Canaan,

278
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,360
 but God who controls the rain,

279
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,600
 the God who sends rains at the right time.

280
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,160
 You got to depend on God, you got to trust in him.

281
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,360
 You do not turn away from the God of heaven,

282
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:20,640
 to the idols, to other false gods in the land of Canaan,

283
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:24,480
 be it Baal, the storm god, or any other false god.

284
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,680
 You got to trust in God, you got to focus on him.

285
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,860
 Only Yahweh the Lord you can trust, and he will send rain.

286
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:37,860
 So you think about it, to survive in this land is difficult.

287
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,000
 It is not an easy land.

288
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,840
 It is never a paradise.

289
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:46,200
 And God settles his people in this land

290
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,040
 to teach them, to train them.

291
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,320
 The land must wait for God to open the heaven and water.

292
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:58,920
 The land is a spiritual classroom,

293
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:03,520
 a spiritual mentor, to train the faith of God's people,

294
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,160
 to teach them, to discipline them,

295
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,520
 to fix their eyes on God the creator alone.

296
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,100
 (gentle music)

297
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,880
 (gentle music)

298
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:28,980
 - Now, isn't that true for most of our life journey

299
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,940
 as we follow Christ?

300
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:35,940
 What COVID has taught us is that life is full of crises,

301
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:40,560
 challenges, temptations, and trials,

302
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,660
 and all those tough situations can happen to us,

303
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:48,460
 every single one of us, unexpectedly, suddenly.

304
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:52,620
 We will be hit by a storm, right?

305
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,980
 And faith in the Bible has always been faith

306
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,520
 in the midst of difficulties.

307
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,180
 Never easy.

308
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:05,500
 But following Christ is like that, right?

309
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:10,300
 God put us in a spiritual classroom for a good purpose.

310
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:14,340
 In all these difficulties and all these challenges,

311
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:18,580
 pandemic included, God has a good purpose.

312
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:21,380
 It's a life-giving purpose.

313
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:25,620
 The purpose is to draw us closer and closer to him.

314
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:28,900
 So when we face difficulty, when we face challenges

315
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,140
 or uncertainties in our futures,

316
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:35,260
 whether we are going to school, determining our future,

317
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:40,260
 whether we hit rock bottom in our career,

318
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,540
 remember that God is mentoring us.

319
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:48,140
 Like living in the land of Canaan,

320
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,540
 we have to depend on him.

321
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,420
 We have to trust in him.

322
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:54,260
 And knowing that God is always with us,

323
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,820
 God is always trustworthy.

324
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,620
 Let me close by reading Psalm 125 again.

325
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,620
 Psalm 125.

326
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:06,500
 "Those who trust in the Lord are like Mount Zion,

327
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:11,580
 "which cannot be shaken, but endures forever.

328
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:14,260
 "As the mountains surround Jerusalem,

329
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,620
 "so the Lord surround his people,

330
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,940
 "both now and forevermore."

331
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,980
 Let's pray together.

332
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:25,620
 Father, we give you thanks

333
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:29,180
 for all the experiences that we have.

334
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:34,060
 You put us in a spiritual classroom to train our faith,

335
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:37,940
 to pray to you, to depend on you,

336
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,740
 knowing that you are the faithful God

337
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:42,220
 who always cares for us.

338
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:47,220
 Thank you for the lands of Canaan that we experience now.

339
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:52,300
 No matter what challenges we are facing,

340
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,660
 trials and temptations,

341
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:59,460
 we pray that we will continue to fix our eyes on you,

342
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:04,460
 to follow you, to commit our lives to trust in you.

343
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,980
 And pray that you will strengthen our faith.

344
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,020
 And as we do so, we draw closer and closer to you.

345
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:13,460
 In Christ, we pray.

346
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,300
 Amen.
