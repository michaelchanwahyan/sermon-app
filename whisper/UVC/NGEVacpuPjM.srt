1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Okay. Okay.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 Before we begin, I'd like to ask everyone a question.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 Do any of you pray for the brothers and sisters

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 who serve on Sundays, especially this weekend?

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 If you do, I want to thank you.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Because every time I give a sermon,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 I am filled with fear and anxiety.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Let alone today I'm preaching in English.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 Lord, have mercy on me.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Today I hope to discuss Romans chapter 12, 1 to 2 with you.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 And I encourage everyone to reflect more deeply on the message within.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Let's pray.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 Dear Lord, our God, we thank and praise you.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 We dedicate this hour to you.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Anoint the lips of your child.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Let your words be spoken with power and authority.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 May the Holy Spirit work in people's heart as they listen to you.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 The book of Romans is a very important book in the Bible.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Well, you might say, like, every book in the Bible is important, right?

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 By important, I mean that the book of Romans

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 has had a profound impact on generations of theologians.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 The theologian and philosopher Augustine in 386 AD

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 repented after reading Romans 13, 13 to 14,

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 and later became a renowned preacher.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 His writings still carry great weight today.

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 The theologian and religious reformer Martin Luther in November 1515

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 taught the main point of Romans is not about how a righteous God punishes the unrighteous,

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 rather that God declares people righteous through their faith in him.

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 This doctrine was the driving force behind his reform movement.

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 Before we dive into Romans 12, 1 to 2,

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 let me briefly summarize what was discussed in Romans chapter 1 to 11.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 In summary, Paul explained the basic teachings of Christianity,

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 emphasizing that both Jews, who seem to have a higher status and were proud,

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 and Gentiles, who seem to have a lower social status,

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 were both God's people justified through faith in Christ,

37
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 not by observing the Old Testament law or rituals.

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 Now, as we come to Romans 12, verses 1 to 2,

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 serve as a turning point from the previous chapters.

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 The apostle Paul transitions from explaining the true meaning of the gospel

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 to teaching believers how to live out their justified lives through faith in their daily conduct.

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 Title for today, "The Perfect Sacrifice."

43
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 Let's start by reciting Romans 12, 1 to 2.

44
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 "I appear to you, therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God,

45
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 to present your bodies as a living sacrifice,

46
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship.

47
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind,

48
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 that by testing you may discern what is the will of God,

49
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 what is good and acceptable and perfect."

50
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 When I read this passage, I could easily relate it to how Paul felt at the time.

51
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 Since 2008, our family, along with many brother and sister,

52
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 have gone on mission trips to China.

53
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 We almost go every summer.

54
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 But we haven't been able to go since 2019.

55
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 But my heart always yearns to see my brothers and sister in China.

56
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 I always think about, like, how they are doing.

57
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 I really hope to have the opportunity again to visit them,

58
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 ask them about their well-being, their gatherings,

59
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 and whether they are still holding on to their faith.

60
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 Similarly, in the beginning of chapter 12,

61
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 the apostle Paul, out of godly compassion and love for the brothers and sisters,

62
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 Paul encourages believers on how to practically live out life as a Christian.

63
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 Because the church was divided by their differences,

64
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 they forgot they are following the same God.

65
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 In Ephesians 4.1, it says,

66
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 "I therefore, a prisoner for the Lord,

67
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 urge you to walk in the manner worthy of the calling to which you have been called."

68
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 The teachings in the Bible are not just meant for reading or acquiring knowledge.

69
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 The ultimate purpose of these teachings is to know God and to put His words into practice,

70
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 to present your bodies as a living sacrifice.

71
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 In the Old Testament, sacrifices were generally about selecting, preparing, offering,

72
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 and literally sacrificing animals to please God in religious rituals.

73
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 There were various types of sacrifices, such as burnt offering,

74
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 grain offering, peace offering, sin offerings, and trespass offerings,

75
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 each with its own preparations, certain elements, rules, procedures,

76
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 and they each had their specific purpose, all of which are necessary.

77
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 However, what Paul mentions here is different.

78
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 It is a living sacrifice.

79
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 Before we talk about living sacrifice,

80
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 I want to first talk about the bodies mentioned in the Scripture.

81
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 The word bodies in the original text refers to the whole person.

82
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 This includes the body, the mind, spirit, and thoughts.

83
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 Furthermore, the word bodies is not one physical body, but rather many bodies,

84
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 a community of faith, a community of faith offering themselves as one sacrifice.

85
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 When a person believes in Jesus, it is indeed an act of offering.

86
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 A person who accepts Jesus as their Lord Savior,

87
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 acknowledge his or her sins, surrenders himself before God,

88
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 declares that their life no longer belongs to themselves.

89
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 They are no longer their own masters,

90
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 and they ultimately choose to recognize Jesus as his or her own personal Savior.

91
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 From then on, I no longer live, but Jesus lives in me.

92
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 This declaration is a response to the Gospel.

93
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 Romans 8:11, "If the spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you,

94
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies

95
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 through his spirit who dwells in you."

96
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 To offer our bodies as a living sacrifice,

97
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 the sacrifice mentioned in Romans 12 is made possible

98
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 not by whether a person is willing or not to offer themselves,

99
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 but by the prerequisite that Jesus first offer himself as the perfect sacrifice,

100
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 accomplishing salvation.

101
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 It is the precious blood of Jesus that cleanses us from all sins,

102
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 enables people to be born again, become holy, and be called righteous.

103
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 It is because Jesus first offered himself as a sacrifice

104
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 so that people can become a living sacrifice.

105
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 Hebrew 1010, "And by that will we have been sanctified

106
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all."

107
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 Reflecting back on the days of my college years,

108
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 when I memorized Romans 12 1-2,

109
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 I was only thinking about how mission-driven I felt

110
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 and how determined I wanted to be a good Christian,

111
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 offering myself as a sacrifice.

112
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 The motivation behind offering myself came from my own selfishness.

113
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 It makes me feel good to think this way.

114
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 However, I didn't truly understand the focus is not on me.

115
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 It is not about how much I love God

116
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 and willing to offer myself as a living sacrifice,

117
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 but on how much God loved me that he sent his one and only son, Jesus Christ,

118
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 to be the sacrificial lamb so that I can live.

119
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 To offer our bodies as a living sacrifice is a true and proper worship

120
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 because it is a proper response to Jesus' sacrificial offering.

121
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 For those who follow the law, it is the most natural response to the gospel,

122
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 a response of gratitude to God,

123
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 and a reasonable response of someone who understands the grace once received.

124
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 Verse 2.

125
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 "Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind."

126
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 This present age has its own thoughts and lifestyle,

127
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 which believers who have received God's grace must discern.

128
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 Therefore, the meaning of "do not be conformed to this world"

129
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 is that we must be cautious and not let these trends and values worldview shape our lives.

130
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 Recently, during a gathering, a friend mentioned that because of his two daughters,

131
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 he often watches Disney Channel.

132
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 Lately, he noticed an increased portrayal of non-traditional family relationships in the program.

133
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 According to him, the portrayal of these families and their interaction in these programs

134
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 are no different from traditional families,

135
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 except for the fact that they don't necessarily have a father and a mother.

136
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 They seem to subtly normalize non-traditional relationships.

137
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 A few years ago, in Canada, a 46-year-old father with seven children

138
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 discovered that he was actually a woman.

139
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 His wife could not tolerate his lifestyle, so he left his wife and his seven children.

140
00:12:48,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 After leaving his family, this 6'4" tall man with his hair tied up and wearing a custom-made dress

141
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 transformed himself into an 8-year-old girl.

142
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 He advertised himself online and sought adoption.

143
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 Not having to wait long, he was adopted by an elderly couple.

144
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 He now lived with them and behaved like one of their grandchildren.

145
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 He and her grandchildren spent time coloring, playing with the toy kitchen, playing toys.

146
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 One day, one of the grandchildren of this elderly couple wanted to be an older sister.

147
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 So she asked this 46-year-old man to be two years younger.

148
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 So this 6'4" tall little girl changed his age again,

149
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 played the role of a younger sibling, and settled at the age of six.

150
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 I remember a long time ago when I was picking up my daughter from school.

151
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 I saw a little girl waiting for her parents.

152
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 I casually asked her, "Your mom is coming to pick you up?"

153
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 She looked at me and did not answer.

154
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 Later, I found out that she didn't have a mom because she has two fathers.

155
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 When I returned home, I thought for a long time.

156
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 I realized that I should never assume that every child's family has a father and a mother

157
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 because there are so many combinations nowadays,

158
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 such as two fathers, two mothers, one father, multiple mothers,

159
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 one father, one mother, or no parent at all.

160
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 This is the current situation of our world's family relationships.

161
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 I don't know how many different combinations will emerge in the future.

162
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 And I often wonder, where does the next generation's concept of family stand?

163
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 What kind of world we are living in right now?

164
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 As a Christian, how would you respond?

165
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 As a Christian parent, how would you address the questions your children ask?

166
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 If you are still solely focused on how to push your children to get into a good school,

167
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 studying advanced courses at an early age,

168
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 engaging in various activities like music, painting, chess, calligraphy,

169
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 eating organic food, don't eat any fast food,

170
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 I think you need to reconsider.

171
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 I'm not trying to scare you, for I am a mother myself,

172
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 but I genuinely want to know,

173
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 when was the last time you considered your child's character?

174
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 The world urges us to put all this effort into making our child the smartest,

175
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 the most successful, most high-achieving individual.

176
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 But sadly, we turn a blind eye to their heart.

177
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 As Christian parents, we need to pray.

178
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 We need to seek God for wisdom.

179
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 We need to listen. We need to reconsider.

180
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 Sometimes when my daughter talks to me,

181
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 she brings up topics that I never thought about before.

182
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 And I don't always know the answer or know how to respond.

183
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 In those moments, I pray in my heart, asking the Lord for wisdom,

184
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 hoping at least not to say anything wrong.

185
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 Most of the time, I'm speechless.

186
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 I'm just there to listen and try to understand more.

187
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 I don't know if you have watched the UV YouTube channel recently,

188
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 for I have done an interview with Pastor Julie when I was in Hong Kong.

189
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 If you haven't watched it, I encourage you to watch it if you understand Cantonese.

190
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 In the interview, Pastor Julie provided a few reminders.

191
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 And one of them was that Christians are the people of the book.

192
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 Pastor Julie said she has a desire to teach lay people Hebrew

193
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 and make theological education more accessible

194
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 so that Christians are equipped to face future challenges.

195
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 She hoped to help believers deepen their study of the Bible

196
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 and even be knowledgeable enough to feed those around them.

197
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 2 Timothy 3:16 says, "All scripture is breathed out by God

198
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction,

199
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 and for training in righteousness."

200
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 Teaching shows you the path to walk on.

201
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 Reproof shows you where you have gotten off the path.

202
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 Correction shows you how to get back on the path.

203
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 Training in righteousness shows you how to stay on the path.

204
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 The foundation of Christian faith is God's Word.

205
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 Christian parents have asked me how we can respond to current issues in various matters.

206
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 Unfortunately, we have to admit that we just don't have all the answers.

207
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 So how can we teach our children in this day and age?

208
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 My brothers and sisters, when facing the uncertain future

209
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 and the challenges of this world,

210
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 remember that only God's Word is your greatest help.

211
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 When you read the Bible, you may not understand or feel its significance.

212
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 But day by day as you read, study the Bible,

213
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 you are accumulating your knowledge.

214
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 You are allowing God to speak to you,

215
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 allowing the Holy Spirit to transform your heart.

216
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 And sure, you will slowly store up ammunition for the battle.

217
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 Only by drawing near to God,

218
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 allowing the Holy Spirit to renew and transform our hearts,

219
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 give us the ability to discern good and evil.

220
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 Can we stand firm in this turbulent and unsettled world?

221
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 I remember a scene from a drama series I watched when I was young.

222
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 A person asked his jewel of friends how to distinguish between real and fake diamonds.

223
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 The person explained that when he was young,

224
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 his grandfather would let him play with real diamonds.

225
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 As he grew older, his grandfather added fake diamonds into the mix,

226
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 and he could immediately tell the difference.

227
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 Do you have the ability to discern the truth, brothers and sisters?

228
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 For those of you who have believed in the law for maybe two, four, or more than ten years,

229
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 how well do you grasp the truth of the Bible?

230
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 How much time have you set aside in your daily life in God's Word?

231
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 Romans 12, 1-2.

232
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 I appeal to you, fearful brothers,

233
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 by the mercies of God to present your bodies as a living sacrifice,

234
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship.

235
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind,

236
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 that by testing you may discern what is the will of God,

237
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 what is good and acceptable and perfect.

238
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 The perfect sacrifice.

239
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 Jesus has already offered himself as the perfect sacrifice,

240
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 accomplishing it once and for all.

241
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 How will you respond?

242
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 How should we as brother and sister, a community of faith, respond together?

243
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 A living sacrifice refers to the regenerate and save life

244
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 that is willing to live a life worthy of salvation received,

245
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 offering oneself fully in response to the grace of salvation that we do not deserve.

246
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 This is indeed the most reasonable and appropriate response to the gospel we have received.

247
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 As Christian, we need to hold on to God tightly and strive to study his Word diligently,

248
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 for it is good through God's Word that our minds are renewed,

249
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 giving us the ability to discern what is good and pleasing to him,

250
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 that by testing you may discern what is the will of God,

251
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 what is good and acceptable and perfect.

252
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 Let us bow our heads.

253
00:23:51,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 Lord, we thank you for loving us and for the sacrifice of Jesus Christ.

254
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 You know us better than anyone else.

255
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 Please continue to guide our lives and help us not to forget what you have done for us.

256
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 May we respond to your love by offering ourselves as living sacrifices.

257
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 May the Holy Spirit remind and help us to root ourselves in your Word,

258
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 so that we may stand firm in this turbulent and restless age.

259
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 I also want to pray specifically for our brothers and sisters who are struggling and feeling weak,

260
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 that those who are struggling may find a way out,

261
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 and those who are weak may find your companionship and presence.

262
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 For those who are sad and burdened, may you grant them wisdom to face their challenges.

263
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 For those who are wounded and sorrowful, may you embrace them and provide comfort.

264
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 Lord, please strengthen us so that the more difficult, chaotic, and oppressive our lives become,

265
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 the stronger our hearts will be in seeking strength from your Word.

266
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 As we, the church body, come before you, that we may be a living sacrifice that pleases you.

267
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 Thank you, Lord, for you will never abandon those who follow you.

268
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 And you are a God who listens to prayer.

269
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 We humbly come to you with gratitude.

270
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen.

271
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:12,000
