[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - Good morning, it's great to be here, as always.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.640]   Love being at UV, and thank you for allowing me to be here,
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.480]   and thanks Jason for leading us in worship.
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.420]   This morning we're gonna be looking
[00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.880]   in the book of Ephesians in chapter two.
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.960]   We're gonna look at verses 11 to 22,
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.600]   and we'll be talking about being reconciled in Christ.
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.040]   And I'm here periodically, when I've been here
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.760]   we've been kind of slowly going through
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.120]   the book of Ephesians, this letter that Paul wrote
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.120]   to the church in Ephesus and the surrounding churches.
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.320]   And last time I was here we looked at the first part
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.720]   of chapter two where he's talking about
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.420]   the fact that we're made alive in Christ.
[00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.440]   We talked about the equality that gives us in Christ,
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.600]   that we're all equally made alive in Christ.
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.980]   And even though we're different in our giftings,
[00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.280]   in our skills, in our talents,
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.020]   in the ways that God has gifted us,
[00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.440]   we're different in our life experiences,
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.480]   we're different even in the roles that we play
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.440]   in the church and in life and in family
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.680]   and things like that.
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.120]   We are all equally given the same redemption,
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.860]   the same grace, and that puts us really in a place
[00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.080]   where there's no inferior or superiority in the church.
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.280]   We are equally forgiven by Christ, equally redeemed,
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.360]   equally brought into the family.
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.720]   And that's how we're to treat one another.
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.080]   So we talked about that last time.
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.940]   And today we're gonna be talking about really unity.
[00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.480]   That's what he's addressing in verses 11 to 22.
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.840]   And this passage is just so powerful.
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.120]   He's talking about the unity of the church
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.720]   and how that happens, and it's not through us.
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.960]   It's an impossible thing to see this happen
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:41.920]   apart from Christ.
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.480]   And that's really what he's describing for us.
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.960]   So let's begin reading.
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.800]   We'll read these verses from 11 to 22,
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.240]   and then look at a few things that we can learn here.
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.040]   It says, "Therefore, remember that at one time,
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.020]   "you Gentiles in the flesh, called the uncircumcision
[00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.720]   "by what is called the circumcision,
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.580]   "which is made in the flesh by hands,
[00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.700]   "remember that you were at that time separated from Christ,
[00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.220]   "alienated from the commonwealth of Israel
[00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.680]   "and strangers to the covenant of promise,
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.920]   "having no hope and without God in the world.
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.780]   "But now in Christ Jesus,
[00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.640]   "you who once were far off have been brought near
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.400]   "by the blood of Christ.
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.780]   "For he himself is our peace,
[00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.440]   "who has made us both one,
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.360]   "and has broken down in his flesh
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.100]   "the dividing wall of hostility
[00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.060]   "by abolishing the law of commandments
[00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.580]   "expressed in ordinances that he might create in himself
[00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.840]   "one new man in place of the two,
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.820]   "so making peace and might reconcile us both to God
[00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.900]   "in one body through the cross,
[00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.400]   "thereby killing the hostility.
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.060]   "And he came and preached peace to you who are far off
[00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.080]   "and peace to those who were near,
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.620]   "for through him, we both have access
[00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.620]   "in one spirit to the father.
[00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.900]   "So then you are no longer strangers and aliens,
[00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.360]   "but you are fellow citizens with the saints
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.480]   "and members of the household of God,
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.440]   "built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets,
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.800]   "Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone,
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.680]   "in whom the whole structure being joined together
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.080]   "grows into a holy temple in the Lord.
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.400]   "In him, you also are being built together
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.520]   "into a dwelling place for God by the spirit."
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.880]   So he's given us this beautiful picture
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.680]   of what the church can be,
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.200]   both as individuals, that we are to be this dwelling place
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.280]   of God in the spirit, we're to be a temple of the Lord,
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.560]   but together as a group,
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.920]   that we're to be this dwelling place of God in the spirit,
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.960]   this temple in the Lord.
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.000]   But he's talking about how it happens
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.180]   that God takes all these very different people
[00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.380]   and brings them together and makes them one.
[00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.000]   Now this is something that our world is really craving.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.780]   And I mean, people who don't know Jesus
[00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.400]   are really craving this.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.300]   People want to see human beings brought together.
[00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.280]   People want to see people reconciled across differences.
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.060]   That's something our world is craving
[00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.100]   and desires to see so desperately.
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.000]   But it's also something,
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.200]   I think this is a huge gospel opportunity
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.900]   because it's something that we see clearly in our world.
[00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.640]   It doesn't happen on its own.
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:34.760]   It's not a simple thing.
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.940]   It doesn't take place easily.
[00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.360]   And we're told here how this can happen in the church
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.160]   by the power of Christ.
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.640]   And it's such an opportunity for us as we live this out
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.080]   to be a testimony of the power of Christ.
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.760]   Remember Jesus in the book of John,
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.680]   he prayed the high priestly prayer
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.640]   right before the crucifixion,
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.720]   and he prayed that we would be one.
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.040]   And he said that that was one of the ways
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.740]   people would know that we were his followers,
[00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.140]   that that would be one of our testimonies of the faith
[00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:04.140]   is that we're one.
[00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.900]   So I want us to see some things in this passage
[00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.600]   and first what I would love us to consider
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.520]   is the fact that apart from Christ,
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.040]   there are actual differences that create actual tensions.
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.440]   That's real and I love that scripture acknowledges this.
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:20.640]   So sometimes we think,
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.720]   well, we need to have unity in the church
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.520]   and we need to get along.
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.760]   And the way to get along is just to act like
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.560]   there's no differences.
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.420]   There's no problems.
[00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:31.280]   There's no problems here.
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.280]   Everybody thinks the same and we all agree about everything.
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.660]   Yeah, let's just make it work, right?
[00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.640]   But the scripture doesn't do that.
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:41.980]   The scripture acknowledges and says,
[00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.420]   yeah, people are different.
[00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:45.820]   Cultures are different.
[00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.700]   People have very different ideas about a lot of things.
[00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.980]   And the scripture doesn't ignore that.
[00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.460]   It doesn't gloss over that.
[00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.940]   Look there at verse 11.
[00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.180]   It's saying, "Therefore, remember that one time
[00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.640]   "you Gentiles in the flesh called the uncircumcision."
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.140]   Paul actually points out, he's like,
[00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.500]   the Gentiles are people who are not a part
[00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.040]   of the Jewish heritage.
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.900]   Now they're believers in Christ.
[00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.260]   They're in the church.
[00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.660]   But remember that before people kind of called you names.
[00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.020]   They were like, you guys are the uncircumcision.
[00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:20.860]   You're the outsiders.
[00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.740]   You're not a part.
[00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.580]   He's reminding them of that.
[00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:25.740]   And he's saying, who called you that?
[00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.020]   Well, it was the people who called themselves
[00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.500]   the circumcision, the people who said,
[00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.120]   we're the in crowd, you guys are out.
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.980]   And then in the same verse,
[00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.500]   he makes the point that even the people who said,
[00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.660]   they're the in crowd, they call themselves the circumcision.
[00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:41.140]   He said that was actually done by human hands anyway.
[00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.220]   He's saying that that was a boundary
[00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.260]   they set up themselves.
[00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:48.100]   It wasn't something that was really making them
[00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:48.940]   closer to God.
[00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:50.740]   It was just a boundary they set up themselves.
[00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:53.220]   But he's reminding them, there was this actual division
[00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:54.660]   between you all.
[00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:56.060]   Some of you felt like you were in.
[00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.580]   Some of you felt like you were out.
[00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.100]   It was a real tension.
[00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.300]   You guys didn't like each other.
[00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.620]   And I think that's actually really encouraging to us.
[00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:07.180]   We see tension and divisions in our day.
[00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:09.500]   Some of them are very deep, right?
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.860]   But this one is as deep as it gets.
[00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.640]   It touches on every area of life
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.600]   that they were experiencing in the first century.
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.580]   The Gentile background believers
[00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:22.740]   did not understand the Jewish background believers
[00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:23.580]   and vice versa.
[00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.100]   They didn't understand one another.
[00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:26.300]   They were very different culturally.
[00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.840]   They had completely different diets.
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.100]   They had different ways of living.
[00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.540]   They had a lot of reasons to mistrust one another.
[00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:35.020]   There was a lot of history,
[00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:38.380]   a lot of very legitimate grievances in their past.
[00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:39.700]   The Jewish background believers are like,
[00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:41.300]   hey, you guys have oppressed us
[00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.540]   and you've killed people in our nation.
[00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:46.900]   And so there was a lot of legitimate grievances.
[00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:48.100]   And scripture doesn't ignore that.
[00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:49.140]   It doesn't say, hey, look, guys,
[00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:50.860]   let's just forget about that
[00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:54.180]   and let's just kind of sing kumbaya and try to get along.
[00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:56.420]   That's not what this passage is saying.
[00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:58.520]   It's saying, hey, there's real stuff here.
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.520]   You guys are really different.
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.320]   And you have a past, you have a history,
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.740]   and that's okay, we're not gonna ignore that.
[00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:09.680]   But Jesus is gonna take us through it.
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.480]   That's what this passage is telling us.
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.480]   It goes on to say that,
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:17.160]   for he himself is our peace who has made us both one
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.520]   and has broken down in his flesh
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.240]   the dividing wall of hostility.
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.440]   Verse 13, I mean, verse 14 there,
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.800]   it says there is a dividing wall of hostility.
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.140]   It exists, it's real.
[00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:31.740]   But Jesus is gonna take us through that.
[00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:33.440]   And that's so good for us to know.
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:36.400]   There are a lot of differences in the church,
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.060]   and that's okay.
[00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:41.920]   God is the one who created the nucleus
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:42.800]   of a lot of those things.
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:45.200]   Obviously, we have extended them sometimes
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.520]   in unhealthy ways,
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.440]   but God's the one who created us in his image,
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.160]   and a part of being created in his image
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.760]   means that we are creative,
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.960]   and we like to build things,
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.200]   and we like to do things.
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.120]   And in Genesis 1:27,
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.720]   God gave what theologians call the cultural mandate,
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.400]   where he said to the first human beings,
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:06.320]   "Go out into the earth and subdue it, do your thing."
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:09.400]   And ever since then, humans have been doing that, right?
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.240]   We've been going into the earth,
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.600]   and we've been building cities,
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.060]   and creating things, and making art,
[00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:17.000]   and creating culture, and making music,
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.240]   and all these different things that we do
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.460]   that God actually created us to do, right?
[00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:24.220]   But different people in different places
[00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:26.120]   do that very differently.
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.240]   So cities in different parts of the world look differently,
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.400]   and our culture looks differently,
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.800]   our languages look differently.
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.320]   And so then, as we do that,
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.500]   that becomes, at times, a dividing wall.
[00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.280]   And again, scripture is not saying,
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.400]   "Well, that shouldn't be there.
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.320]   "It's a problem for you guys to have different cultures."
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.040]   It's not saying that at all.
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:49.760]   Our cultures reflect the beauty and the majesty of God,
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.600]   because God's a creative God,
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.140]   and he made us with all these cultural differences.
[00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:55.640]   And when we come into the church,
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:56.740]   it's not that we're supposed to say,
[00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:59.160]   "Well, I have to leave my culture at the door,
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:00.800]   "and I have to leave all these things outside,
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.520]   "and somehow try to be different
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.300]   "when I'm in the body of Christ."
[00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:08.820]   No, God says, "Bring these things into the body of Christ,
[00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:13.220]   "but I'm also going to make you a new humanity
[00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:14.620]   "through Jesus."
[00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:18.480]   And I think that's really important for us to know.
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:24.720]   There are issues, there are genuine tensions,
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.500]   and at times, even in the church,
[00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:30.520]   there are genuine, legitimate grievances from the past.
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:31.840]   And we shouldn't ignore that,
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:35.520]   we shouldn't try to whitewash it or gloss it over.
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:36.500]   That's not what the Bible does.
[00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:39.800]   The Bible says that God is going to do something
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.600]   to reconcile us.
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:45.120]   And that really starts with the fact that in Christ,
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:48.360]   we can all be reconciled to God.
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.600]   Anyone can be reconciled to God,
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.880]   and everyone can be reconciled to God.
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.560]   These verses make it clear, verses 12 to 13,
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.700]   "Remember that you were at that time separated from Christ,
[00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.360]   "alienated from the commonwealth of Israel,
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.120]   "and strangers to the covenants of the promise,
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.640]   "having no hope and without God in the world."
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.520]   He's talking to the Gentile background believers.
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:09.320]   He's saying, "Don't forget, there was a time
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:11.240]   "when you guys didn't know anything about the word,
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.880]   "you didn't know anything about the truth,
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:15.320]   "and you were completely separated from God."
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:21.380]   So, Paul is reminding us that, hey, we're all sinful,
[00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:24.420]   and a lot of us used to be in that state.
[00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:30.300]   But then, the gospel, grace, verse 13,
[00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:34.740]   "But now, in Christ Jesus, you who were once far off
[00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:36.360]   "have been brought near."
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:38.400]   Yeah, in the past, you were completely separated.
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.200]   You didn't have hope, you were alienated
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.040]   from the truth of God.
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:45.200]   But now, you have been brought from far off to near.
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.820]   You've been brought close to God.
[00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:48.120]   How did that happen?
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.340]   By the blood of Christ.
[00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:53.300]   So, what we see here is that all of us,
[00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:56.740]   even though we're all sinful, and we're all broken,
[00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:00.180]   we can all be redeemed in Christ,
[00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:02.280]   we can all be forgiven through Christ,
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:08.600]   and that all means all, regardless of our background,
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:13.720]   our life experience, our culture, wherever we have been,
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:15.540]   or whatever we've gone through,
[00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:19.720]   we can be reconciled to God through Christ.
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:23.880]   We can be brought near by the blood of Christ.
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:29.020]   And what we have to remember is that,
[00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:31.720]   as we're reconciled to God in Christ,
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:34.580]   then we become reconciled to one another.
[00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:42.100]   He says that, "He himself is our peace,
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.540]   "is our peace, that he might create in himself
[00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:47.800]   "one new man in place of the two,
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:52.800]   "reconcile us both to God in one body through the cross,
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:56.380]   "thereby killing the hostility."
[00:12:56.380 --> 00:13:00.460]   He himself is our peace.
[00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:03.040]   Jesus himself is our peace.
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:07.180]   And we are reconciled to one another through the cross.
[00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:10.980]   This Greek word here for one new man,
[00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:15.980]   anthropos means human being without reference to gender.
[00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:20.680]   And it's saying that there's a new type of human being,
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:23.000]   a new identity, a new way to be human.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.160]   It's not based in Adam, but it's based in Christ,
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.920]   saying God is creating a new humanity
[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:33.960]   and a new community through the cross.
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:37.360]   It's what this verse is telling us here.
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.520]   "He himself is our peace,
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.880]   "that he might create in himself one new man
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:41.720]   "in place of the two,
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.540]   "reconcile us both to God in one body through the cross,
[00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:47.900]   "thereby killing the hostility."
[00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:51.640]   So as we begin to individually be reconciled to God
[00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:54.300]   through Christ and the cross,
[00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:58.080]   God starts to use that to reconcile us to one another.
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:01.580]   And even people that are different than us
[00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:05.020]   or people that we may struggle to understand
[00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:07.020]   or to relate to, or maybe just something
[00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:10.180]   in their personality that really kind of grates against us,
[00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:14.640]   and it's hard for us to understand
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:16.160]   what's going on in their life,
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:20.300]   God begins to reconcile us to one another in Christ.
[00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:24.440]   And just like other areas of our sanctification,
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:26.840]   and sanctification is just a church word
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:29.080]   that means we're becoming more like Jesus.
[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:31.980]   After we come to know Jesus, we're growing,
[00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:34.040]   and it's a process of becoming more like Jesus.
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:37.080]   And just like other areas of that in life,
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:38.560]   this is a process over time,
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:41.480]   being reconciled to others in the church
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:44.480]   is a process over time.
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.480]   So we need to be patient,
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:49.200]   patient and exercise grace with one another.
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.760]   We need to understand that it takes us time.
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.920]   God has to work on our heart.
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:56.480]   God has to do that to me all the time.
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:57.760]   God has to work on my heart
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.540]   and show me areas where I'm being proud
[00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:02.520]   and where I'm not understanding someone else
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:05.600]   because of my own pride or my own stubbornness,
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.880]   or the fact that I'm like,
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:07.960]   "This is the way I like to do it,
[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:09.020]   "this is what I'm comfortable with,
[00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:11.040]   "this is the way we should do it."
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:13.640]   Sometimes it takes time for God to work on that
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.160]   and chisel it away.
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:16.320]   So we need to be patient
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:19.940]   and give grace to one another in the church.
[00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:24.080]   But at the same time, we need to expect
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:26.840]   that this kind of reconciliation
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:29.260]   would be reflected in the church.
[00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.040]   It should be, that we would be reconciled
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:33.760]   to one another in Christ.
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:37.240]   And if we're really serious about following Jesus,
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:40.320]   then we should expect that to be reflected in our lives
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:42.280]   and in our churches.
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:44.040]   We should expect to see that.
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:49.540]   And that reconciliation to one another
[00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:52.300]   is really a holistic thing.
[00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:55.400]   Look at verses 18 and 20 here, it says,
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:57.920]   "For through him, we both have access
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:59.860]   "in one spirit to the Father.
[00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:02.020]   "So then you are no longer strangers and aliens,
[00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:04.620]   "but you are fellow citizens with the saints
[00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:06.760]   "and members of the household of God,
[00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:09.280]   "built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets,
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:12.740]   "Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone."
[00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:19.340]   So these verses talk about our spiritual condition,
[00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:23.140]   our physical condition, and our emotional condition.
[00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:25.680]   All of that is in these verses.
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:27.720]   And so being reconciled to Christ,
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.240]   to one another through Christ,
[00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:30.720]   is really a holistic thing.
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:33.000]   Verse 18 says, "For through him,
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.360]   "we both have access in one spirit to the Father."
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:36.840]   When he says we both, he's talking about,
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:39.280]   he's talking about the two different groups
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:40.120]   that he's mentioned.
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.160]   He's talking about the Gentile background believers
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:43.400]   and the Jewish background believers.
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:46.440]   He's saying, remember, through Christ,
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:50.080]   both of us have access in one spirit to the Father.
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:53.320]   I also like how in verse 18 and throughout this passage,
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:56.260]   Paul is speaking in the first person.
[00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.320]   He's not saying like,
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:01.320]   "Yeah, you guys have this problem with being reconciled."
[00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.740]   He's saying, "Hey, I'm a part of it too.
[00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:05.340]   "I'm in here too."
[00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:07.360]   That's why he says we both.
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:10.400]   Because he was a Jewish background believer.
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.360]   And remember, before he was saved,
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:14.800]   he had been, he was serious, right?
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:17.600]   He was really serious about the Jewish faith,
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:20.460]   so much so that he was persecuting Christians.
[00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:22.000]   And before he was saved, he was the type of guy
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.440]   that definitely would not have hung out with the Gentiles.
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:29.920]   Because it was such a deep part of what he believed.
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.700]   And a deep part of kind of the legalism
[00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:33.300]   that he was practicing.
[00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:34.320]   So he includes himself.
[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:39.320]   He says we both have access in one spirit to the Father.
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:44.560]   That shows us the spiritual part of this reconciliation.
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:47.800]   That he's saying, as a result of reconciliation in Christ,
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.800]   we all have equal spiritual access to God.
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:52.940]   There's a spiritual reconciliation that takes place
[00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:55.440]   where we're all put in one family, right?
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:56.800]   And most of us are pretty comfortable with that.
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:58.640]   We're like, "Okay, I get it.
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:02.240]   "The spiritual reconciliation, I can handle that."
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.580]   But then he goes on, make it a little more personal
[00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:06.420]   in verse 19, he says, "So then you are no longer
[00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:10.200]   "strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:12.900]   "with the saints and members of the household of God."
[00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:17.780]   Now he's saying that there's this actual physical
[00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:22.660]   and emotional proximity and relationship with one another
[00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:24.360]   that we come into.
[00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:26.740]   So the difference in the language there.
[00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:29.060]   Before we were strangers and aliens,
[00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:32.000]   people who don't spend time together.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.920]   That's what strangers are.
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:36.760]   Aliens, that word means like foreigners.
[00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:39.800]   We were people who are like, "They're different than me.
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:43.140]   "They are the other, we don't spend time together."
[00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:47.460]   But now you're fellow citizens.
[00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:51.880]   Fellow citizens means, "Hey, we're on the same team.
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:54.260]   "We are together."
[00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:58.480]   And so he's giving us this picture
[00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:03.800]   of a physical change in our proximity to one another.
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:06.180]   That we go from being strangers, we don't hang out,
[00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:10.100]   we don't spend time together, to now, through Christ,
[00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:12.660]   we are members of the same household.
[00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:14.500]   Sounds like family, right?
[00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:15.700]   And that's what he's saying.
[00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:17.420]   You guys used to be strangers,
[00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:19.020]   you wouldn't have talked to each other.
[00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:21.380]   Now, you're family.
[00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:25.700]   That means we've come into physical and emotional proximity
[00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:26.620]   with one another.
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:31.720]   Now that's a little bit less comfortable, right?
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:35.200]   It's easy to say, "Well, I know other people in the church,
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:37.440]   "they might be different than me,
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:39.260]   "but I'm supposed to be reconciled to Christ in them,
[00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:41.240]   "so I can be spiritually reconciled.
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:44.600]   "I know spiritually we're shoulder to shoulder."
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:45.920]   That's easy.
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.240]   But when you say, "Oh, wait, I'm actually supposed
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:50.900]   "to be physically reconciled to them,
[00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:53.320]   "and there's points where I'm supposed to be actually
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:56.280]   "in physical proximity with them and in fellowship,
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.960]   "and we're supposed to be in the same room."
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:01.680]   That's hard, 'cause we say, "Wait a second,
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.760]   "these people are different than me."
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:05.480]   That's why it's hard to get in the same room.
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:07.780]   That's why it's hard to be reconciled in that way,
[00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:08.640]   to be in fellowship.
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:11.120]   That's why it's hard to be in emotional proximity.
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:12.960]   It's hard to understand their experience
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:17.040]   and walk through something with them,
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:18.840]   because we're different.
[00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:23.040]   But that's what this passage is telling us.
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.300]   This means that this reconciliation
[00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:27.920]   that God has done through Christ
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:29.760]   should impact our physical proximity
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:30.960]   with others in the church,
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:34.600]   and especially, I think, those who are different than us.
[00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.960]   That means it impacts our emotional openness
[00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:39.200]   and our bonds with one another,
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:40.700]   our fellowship together,
[00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:45.040]   and our service to the world around us.
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:50.040]   All areas of our life should reflect this reconciliation
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:52.540]   that Jesus is affecting in us.
[00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:56.380]   Built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets,
[00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:59.120]   Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone.
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:03.480]   He's the foundation of what's happening in the church.
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:10.040]   Now, so far, as we look at these things,
[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:13.480]   we start to say, "Okay, Paul,
[00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:16.120]   "this is good stuff,
[00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:19.480]   "but you don't really understand the world we live in."
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:20.320]   Right?
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:24.720]   I mean, people disagree about a lot of stuff,
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:28.520]   and we love to talk about unity.
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.640]   We love to call things united this and that.
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:32.200]   Like, even the United States,
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:35.840]   not as united as we would like to think it is, right?
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:37.320]   We love to talk about unity,
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:38.720]   but it just doesn't happen.
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:40.500]   It's too hard.
[00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:42.960]   This picture here, we read it, and we're like,
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:45.460]   "Okay, yeah, we're all made one new man in Christ.
[00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:50.360]   "That's cool, but that's not real," right?
[00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:53.860]   And we have to understand
[00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:56.360]   that this reconciliation through Christ
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:22:00.400]   is impossible apart from Christ,
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:03.480]   and that's what he's saying at the end of the passage here.
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:05.520]   "Built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets,
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:07.680]   "Christ himself being the cornerstone."
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:11.400]   Christ is the cornerstone, the foundation of this unity.
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:14.300]   It says, "In whom the whole structure,
[00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:16.640]   "the whole structure of the church,
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:18.480]   "being joined together,
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.440]   "grows into a holy temple in the Lord."
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:23.300]   But none of that happens.
[00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:26.360]   The joining does not happen without the cornerstone.
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:29.960]   In him, you also are being built together
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:32.880]   into a dwelling place for God by the Spirit.
[00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:36.180]   That doesn't happen without the cornerstone.
[00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:37.960]   This reconciliation that we're talking about
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:40.200]   is impossible apart from Christ.
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.720]   We don't do this on our own.
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:43.760]   We can't reconcile ourselves to others.
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:45.520]   We don't have the power to do that.
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:48.600]   Only God can do this.
[00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:51.340]   Only God can create a new humanity.
[00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:55.180]   And I want us to think real quickly
[00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:57.080]   about some of the things we as humans do
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:58.420]   to try to fill this void,
[00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:00.200]   because all of us understand,
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:01.500]   even people who don't know Jesus,
[00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:03.960]   understand in their hearts that it's wrong,
[00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:07.460]   that humans experiencing division and hatred
[00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:10.180]   towards one another is not how we were supposed to be.
[00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:11.620]   It's not what God created us for.
[00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:14.580]   Even people who are not believers,
[00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:16.880]   they don't believe in God, they understand that.
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.320]   They say, "Wait, these things are wrong.
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:20.060]   "Racism and discrimination
[00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:23.180]   "and all these hostilities and divisions, they're wrong."
[00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:24.100]   People get that.
[00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:28.000]   And honestly, that's good.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.680]   It's good that as humans, we see that.
[00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:33.160]   And as humans, we're good at kind of diagnostics
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.160]   and naming the problems.
[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:35.840]   That's something we do very well.
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:38.320]   But the solutions are a lot harder.
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:41.120]   And so when we think about outside the church,
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:43.280]   there are things that people say,
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:45.160]   "Okay, well, let's try to fill this gap.
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:47.280]   "Let's try to fix this in different ways."
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:49.120]   And sometimes we're tempted to do these things
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:50.840]   in the church itself.
[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:54.380]   But those solutions don't live up to the standard
[00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:56.320]   of what God calls us to, right?
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:59.840]   So one of the first things we see a lot
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:02.080]   outside the church and within the church sometimes
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.980]   that's just a human tendency,
[00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:08.060]   when we think about the divisions of who we are as people,
[00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:09.820]   is we fall into forms of tribalism.
[00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:12.740]   We say, "Well, I get along with the people
[00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:13.800]   "that are like me.
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:15.540]   "Those people are different.
[00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:16.760]   "It's really hard to understand them
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:17.600]   "or get along with them.
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:19.240]   "So we'll just do our thing with our group.
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:21.080]   "They can do their thing with their group
[00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:23.640]   "and that'll work," right?
[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:26.200]   Us human beings have done that since the beginning.
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:33.400]   And there's a lot of kind of logical seeming reasons
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:35.440]   that make sense there, right?
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.560]   But that's not what God called us to in the church.
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:40.180]   God called us in the church to love one another,
[00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:41.180]   even when it's difficult,
[00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:43.640]   even when we don't understand one another,
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:46.540]   even when we have to cross a barrier to love one another.
[00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:52.540]   So that ultimately doesn't really love others.
[00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:56.260]   It just seeks my own interests and the people like me.
[00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:58.780]   It falls short of God's standards.
[00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:00.660]   Another one that we see a lot outside the church
[00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:02.840]   is some form of tolerance, where people say,
[00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:06.760]   "Well, I understand that people are different.
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:08.620]   "I really respect that,
[00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:13.100]   "but, and I'm gonna tolerate the fact they're different.
[00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:14.340]   "We're gonna be in the same room
[00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:17.820]   "and we're gonna be there,
[00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:19.580]   "but I'm still not really loving someone.
[00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:20.940]   "I'm just kind of tolerating the fact
[00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:24.700]   "that they're different than me, and I'm okay with that,
[00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:29.700]   "but ultimately, I'm not really loving them
[00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:31.220]   "the way God calls me to."
[00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:37.380]   Another thing we see is kind of a form of self-exoneration,
[00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:41.520]   where we say, "Well, I know there's problems,
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:43.760]   "but I'm not that type of person, right?
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:46.060]   "I really care about other people,
[00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:51.060]   "and I'm not involved in the division and the hostility,
[00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:52.780]   "so that's not me.
[00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:54.580]   "I'm not a part of that."
[00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:57.820]   Again, that falls short of God's standard.
[00:25:57.820 --> 00:25:58.940]   What has God called us to do?
[00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:02.020]   God has called us to genuinely love one another
[00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:04.340]   and to genuinely be reconciled.
[00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:06.880]   Not just to say, "Well, it's easier not to interact
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:08.860]   "'cause we're different," or not just to say,
[00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:10.200]   "Well, we'll kind of interact,
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:12.000]   "but I'm just gonna tolerate someone else,
[00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:14.660]   "even though I don't really agree with them
[00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:16.760]   "or understand them," and not just to say,
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:18.400]   "Well, I'm a good person,
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:22.940]   "and so I'm not someone who would experience those tensions.
[00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:25.700]   "I'm above all that," and to act like
[00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:27.420]   we're not impacted by these things.
[00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:28.600]   No, God's calling us to say,
[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:31.480]   "Hey, these things are real.
[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:33.660]   "There are challenges in the church,"
[00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:35.260]   and not just the cultural tension,
[00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:36.860]   but just different ways of thinking.
[00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:39.020]   Like, "This person thinks differently
[00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:40.860]   "about ministry than I do,"
[00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:42.120]   or, "This person thinks differently
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:45.860]   "about worship than I do and how it looks."
[00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:48.080]   Those types of very real, practical things,
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:51.340]   God calls us to say, "Hey, these things are real,
[00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:55.320]   "and I'm supposed to love this person across this barrier."
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:57.340]   And yeah, there may be some right and wrong involved,
[00:26:57.340 --> 00:27:00.620]   and maybe we need to really focus on the scripture
[00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:03.240]   and find out what God has actually called us to do.
[00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:05.300]   I'm not saying we set aside the truth
[00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:07.140]   or set aside issues of right or wrong,
[00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:10.220]   'cause we have to work through that in the church, right?
[00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:14.860]   But even as we do that, we're still genuinely loving people
[00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:16.340]   across those barriers of difference.
[00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:18.540]   We're not just saying, "Well, I think you're wrong,
[00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:19.500]   "but I'm gonna tolerate you."
[00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:21.820]   We're saying, "Hey, I love you,
[00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:23.740]   "and I want you to know Christ more."
[00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:28.300]   And maybe you're misunderstanding
[00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:30.060]   or misinterpreting this part of the Bible,
[00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:31.620]   but as we walk through this together
[00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:32.820]   and we move towards the truth,
[00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:34.660]   I want to love you the entire time,
[00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:36.420]   and I wanna have my arms around you.
[00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:41.320]   That's what Jesus is calling us to in the church,
[00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:44.220]   actual love,
[00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:48.860]   love and respect for God's image in me
[00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:50.000]   and what God's done in my life,
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.500]   love and respect for God's image in you
[00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:53.140]   and what he's done in your life,
[00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:56.780]   love and respect and amazement at the redemption of Christ
[00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:58.620]   and the grace that God has poured into me,
[00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:00.340]   and also with the redemption and grace
[00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:01.780]   that God has poured into you.
[00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:05.500]   And love and respect and amazement and appreciation
[00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:08.380]   for the story that God has built into my life
[00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:10.460]   and all of the experiences
[00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:12.880]   and the things that have led me to who I am,
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:16.180]   and love and amazement and respect and admiration
[00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:17.460]   and appreciation for the story
[00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:18.820]   that God has built into your life
[00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:20.900]   and all the experiences and all the things
[00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:23.120]   that have led you to where you are.
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:27.720]   Again, it doesn't mean that we're not serious
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:28.860]   about right and wrong
[00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:31.900]   or that we have to set those things aside.
[00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:34.120]   It simply means that we're really supposed
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:36.140]   to love one another and be reconciled.
[00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:38.700]   And that's what unity looks like in the church.
[00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:41.820]   Unity in the church is not uniformity.
[00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:43.580]   It's not all of us being the same.
[00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:46.800]   Back to what I said at the beginning,
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:47.900]   that's not what God wants.
[00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:50.960]   God created us with all this beauty and diversity,
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:54.340]   and he did that on purpose.
[00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:57.900]   But unity in the church actually assumes diversity.
[00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:00.740]   It assumes that there's a lot of differences,
[00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:04.060]   and yet we still love one another.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.040]   That's impossible.
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:08.720]   How could we do that?
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:11.440]   Through Christ, and that's what Paul's saying here.
[00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:13.400]   He's saying this is only gonna happen
[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:15.560]   as Christ brings you together
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:19.080]   and makes a new human out of you.
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:20.980]   You're not gonna lose your background,
[00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:22.400]   you're not gonna lose your experiences,
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:23.640]   you're not gonna lose your culture.
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:26.080]   You're gonna bring that in with you.
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:29.560]   But now you're gonna have this new basis,
[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:31.640]   this new foundation of fellowship
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:35.060]   that you share in common with other believers.
[00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:36.860]   And it's difficult.
[00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:38.500]   I know it is.
[00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:41.060]   I know you guys feel that tension.
[00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:44.180]   Anybody who does ministry in a diverse city like this,
[00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:46.620]   it's difficult and you feel that tension.
[00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:48.540]   I certainly feel it in my neighborhood.
[00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:50.660]   You get a group of people in the room,
[00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:52.180]   even if they're all believers,
[00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:55.220]   they all have different ideas, different experiences,
[00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:57.680]   different culture, different preferences,
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:00.000]   different things that they enjoy that are important to them.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.780]   It's hard to bring everyone together
[00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:04.780]   and to move in the right direction.
[00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:06.620]   But what this passage is telling us
[00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:09.980]   is that God can supernaturally do this in our hearts.
[00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:17.020]   And I wanna go back to where we started
[00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:19.520]   and remind us that the world is craving this.
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:23.960]   I would say, and I think there's plenty of evidence
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:27.540]   of this in our world, that this is so impossible
[00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:29.820]   that the world can't do it.
[00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:32.640]   Apart from Christ, it's just not gonna happen.
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:35.700]   People try to make it happen in a lot of ways.
[00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:38.740]   And people try to bring people together, and that's good.
[00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:40.700]   That's wonderful.
[00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:43.400]   We should seek the peace of our cities
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:45.220]   and of our nations and of our world.
[00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:47.300]   So that's good.
[00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:51.340]   But there's example after example in our world
[00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:53.740]   of the fact that we can't make it happen
[00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:55.420]   and we can't sustain it apart from Christ.
[00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:57.340]   People just can't do it.
[00:30:57.340 --> 00:31:02.220]   As hard as they try, we can't cross those barriers
[00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:03.900]   long-term.
[00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:05.460]   We might get people together for a little bit,
[00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:06.960]   but we can't hold it together.
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:10.820]   And the world is craving that.
[00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:12.920]   And I think it's such a gospel opportunity
[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:15.260]   for us in the church if we're able to say,
[00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:20.260]   hey, look at what God is doing here.
[00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:22.100]   It's not us.
[00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:25.140]   We're a group of very different people
[00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:26.500]   with very different ideas.
[00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:29.060]   We have very different life experiences.
[00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:30.200]   We have different cultures.
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:31.660]   We have different languages.
[00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:34.900]   We have different foods and different preferences
[00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:37.140]   and so many things.
[00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:40.060]   And yet we come into the same room
[00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:41.860]   and we don't just tolerate each other.
[00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:45.380]   We actually love each other and we love to be here.
[00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:47.740]   It's one of the reasons I love being at UV
[00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:49.460]   and love being with you all.
[00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:51.720]   I hope you guys love me back.
[00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:53.380]   But that's why.
[00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:54.780]   Because it's such a beautiful thing
[00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:57.100]   when the people of God come together
[00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:00.300]   and say we have this foundation of fellowship,
[00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:03.140]   actual, real, genuine fellowship.
[00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:04.460]   We're not faking it.
[00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:06.220]   We're not pretending to like each other.
[00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:09.140]   We really love one another.
[00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:10.140]   And I really love you guys.
[00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:12.060]   I get excited every time I come in the door
[00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:14.260]   and see all the people here and see what God is doing here.
[00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:16.280]   And that's genuine.
[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:18.020]   I love UV.
[00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:19.420]   I love this church.
[00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:23.860]   And it's not because everything here
[00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:26.540]   is exactly like the churches that I grew up in.
[00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:29.300]   A lot of it's very different.
[00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:30.500]   It's because of Jesus.
[00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:34.060]   We have this foundation in Christ
[00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:37.480]   that brings us together and helps us to love one another
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:39.180]   and makes us into this new humanity.
[00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:43.300]   And I think that's such a beautiful and powerful vision
[00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:45.860]   for us to live into in the church.
[00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:49.080]   And like I said, it's a process.
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:51.180]   It doesn't happen immediately.
[00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:54.140]   We have to give grace and be patient with one another.
[00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:55.820]   But that's where we should be headed.
[00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:57.220]   And that's what we should pray for.
[00:32:57.220 --> 00:32:58.800]   That's what we should desire.
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:00.100]   That's what we should move towards.
[00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:02.420]   That's what we should let God work in our hearts
[00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:05.660]   to bring that about and be open and sensitive
[00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:07.760]   and soft-hearted before God and say,
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:11.980]   God, I know I'm uncomfortable right now.
[00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:13.460]   This is different for me,
[00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:15.460]   but I'm gonna let you pull me in this direction
[00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:20.460]   because I know this is your work to reconcile us in Christ.
[00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:23.900]   And as we do that, we start to have this testimony
[00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:25.620]   that the world can't refute.
[00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:27.780]   And the world looks at us in the church and says,
[00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:29.900]   you know what, I don't always like what you guys say
[00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:32.180]   about Jesus and sin and like the whole,
[00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:33.220]   Jesus is the only way to heaven.
[00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:34.580]   I don't know about that,
[00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:36.100]   but you guys actually love each other.
[00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:39.280]   Like, you really like being together.
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:44.280]   And I see you doing that across barriers of culture
[00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:47.980]   and ethnicity and race and different personalities
[00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:50.660]   and different giftings and different ideas.
[00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:52.940]   That becomes a really powerful testimony
[00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:57.620]   to the world around us, that Jesus is making us one.
[00:33:57.620 --> 00:33:59.260]   And just like Jesus prayed,
[00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:01.820]   it becomes something that people start to say,
[00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:04.100]   I think those people are really true followers.
[00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:05.140]   They're true disciples.
[00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:06.780]   They're truly believers in Christ
[00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:09.900]   because that's defining who they are,
[00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:11.020]   that they're coming together.
[00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:14.420]   They're reconciling Christ across barriers
[00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:16.820]   of actual difference and actual tension.
[00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:20.300]   So that's my prayer for my life.
[00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:25.300]   And that's my prayer for us as we move forward
[00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:28.940]   in our respective communities, following Jesus together,
[00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:33.100]   is that we will grow more and more into this reconciliation,
[00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:35.540]   that God will be more at work in our lives,
[00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:38.180]   and it'll be more and more evident to the people around us,
[00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:41.180]   that they'll see us reflecting this in our communities
[00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:44.260]   and reflecting the gospel and the beauty
[00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:47.780]   of Jesus making one new humanity
[00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:52.380]   out of very different things that existed before.
[00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:53.820]   Let's pray.
[00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:58.020]   God, I thank you for this miraculous picture
[00:34:58.020 --> 00:34:59.580]   that you give us in this passage
[00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:01.620]   of what it looks like to be reconciled in Christ.
[00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:04.420]   And God, I confess in my own life
[00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:08.920]   how impossible this seems at so many different times.
[00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:16.380]   It's not impossible for us to pretend like we want peace
[00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:18.380]   or to pretend like we want to work together
[00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:20.340]   or pretend like we want to get along.
[00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:26.300]   But it's really hard to love people that are different
[00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:29.100]   when we may not understand all the things
[00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:30.140]   that make us different.
[00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:31.480]   That really is hard.
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:34.580]   And what's way harder is to then get us all
[00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:36.780]   to head in the same direction.
[00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:42.160]   But God, you give us this miraculous picture in your word
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:43.380]   of the fact that we can be made
[00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:45.860]   into one new humanity through Christ.
[00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:48.500]   And so that's our prayer, God.
[00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:52.060]   We ask that our hearts would be open to you,
[00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:55.420]   that you would do this, that your kingdom would come
[00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:58.420]   in this world through us, your people,
[00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:00.700]   and that you would make us one in Christ
[00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:03.820]   so that others would know that we're your disciples, God.
[00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:05.660]   In Jesus' name, amen.
