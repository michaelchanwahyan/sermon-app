1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 (audience laughing)

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,420
 There we go.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,480
 Sorry about that.

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,580
 For all you folks online,

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,780
 sorry you're gonna have to ask somebody else what I said.

6
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:13,780
 (audience laughing)

7
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,380
 So if you will turn in your Bibles

8
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,160
 or you can take a look at the screen

9
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,660
 and we'll have the scripture text available for you.

10
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:26,360
 I'm really glad to be back

11
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,100
 and it's good to see familiar faces

12
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,700
 and some new faces too.

13
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:31,900
 If I remember right,

14
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,680
 I think it might have been the very last sermon

15
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,080
 that one of the kind of things that I had said

16
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,460
 that I was thinking like,

17
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,220
 no, this might be controversial,

18
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:42,060
 but I said, okay, enough's enough.

19
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,580
 Let's all come back to church, right?

20
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,980
 And so I know that probably may have upset some people,

21
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:50,460
 but I still stick by those words.

22
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,260
 I'd say, all right, enough's enough.

23
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,460
 Let's come back to church.

24
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,780
 Let's enjoy the fellowship that we have

25
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,580
 with our brothers and sisters.

26
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:02,140
 And with that, maybe there's all these accounts

27
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,420
 is clicking off right now.

28
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,780
 They're like, okay, I don't wanna hear this guy anymore

29
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,140
 after he said that,

30
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,460
 but I hope you will stick around.

31
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,100
 And I believe God's got something for us

32
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:17,260
 that is just so timely and it's timeless too,

33
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:22,260
 because it's something that Jesus said 2,000 years ago

34
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:27,900
 and it still meets us right where we are today, right now.

35
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,420
 So let's just get right into it.

36
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:36,420
 So over the last couple of years, it's nothing new.

37
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,940
 I'm not saying anything revolutionary here

38
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:42,540
 that we've all gone through stuff together

39
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,420
 that is probably more difficult,

40
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,740
 more challenging than anything,

41
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,940
 any season that we have experienced in our lifetime.

42
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,500
 So while only one or two things

43
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,100
 of these things that we've experienced

44
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:58,940
 over the last couple of years,

45
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,460
 one or two things would just shake the foundation

46
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,780
 of our lives, of our daily lives,

47
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,700
 we've experienced collectively a whole bunch

48
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,100
 of what I'll call fear factors.

49
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,700
 And the challenges of a global pandemic,

50
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,540
 the widespread racial tensions,

51
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,140
 and there's systematic supply chain issues

52
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,380
 we keep hearing about,

53
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:26,020
 and wave after wave of geopolitical intrigue.

54
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,340
 And then it's compounded by, you all know it,

55
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,900
 go to the gas station, go to the grocery store,

56
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,180
 economic instability, maybe it's in the workplace.

57
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,180
 And then that doesn't even include

58
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:40,540
 like what are we experiencing when we're all by ourselves?

59
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:44,780
 Maybe it's a sadness or loneliness or depression,

60
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:47,700
 feelings of inadequacy, feeling like we're failures,

61
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,100
 all these things that are just weighing on us.

62
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:56,940
 And while worry and fear are going to try

63
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:01,940
 and seize this opportunity to lead and control our lives,

64
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:07,940
 Jesus invites us to authentic faith in God,

65
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:11,980
 to not be ruled by fear and worry,

66
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,740
 but that our lives will be ruled by faith in God.

67
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:20,980
 And one of the principle ways that we express our faith

68
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:24,980
 on a day-to-day level is in the way that we pray.

69
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,980
 And so today's passage,

70
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,780
 Jesus has something to say to us about prayer.

71
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,740
 So why don't we begin with prayer?

72
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:38,380
 Father God, thank you so much

73
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:42,260
 that you invite us to come and speak with you,

74
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,820
 to meet with you, to know you,

75
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,280
 have relationship fellowship with you.

76
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,980
 And sometimes God, the reality is we don't know what to do

77
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,580
 once we are with you.

78
00:03:54,580 --> 00:04:00,540
 And so would you today speak to us and teach us

79
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,980
 how do we relate to you?

80
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,060
 Who are you?

81
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,040
 And teach us Lord how to pray.

82
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:12,060
 Just as the disciples asked Jesus, your son,

83
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:16,300
 the very first time we ask joining the generation

84
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,580
 after generation of disciples who have said,

85
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,820
 teach us how to pray.

86
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,760
 And it's in Jesus name we ask it, amen.

87
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:29,860
 So God, our father in Jesus Christ

88
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,020
 is going to reveal himself today, I believe that.

89
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:36,560
 So let's be ready to receive what he has for us.

90
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,780
 So we go to Matthew chapter six, verses five through eight.

91
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,580
 We're in the Sermon on the Mount,

92
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,680
 you know, Jesus' famous sermon.

93
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,340
 And this is what he says in chapter six of Matthew,

94
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,340
 verses five through eight.

95
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:54,900
 "And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites."

96
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,740
 I should give you the passage, there it is.

97
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,900
 "Do not be like the hypocrites,

98
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,540
 for they love to pray standing in the synagogues

99
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:06,140
 and on the street corners to be seen by men.

100
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,820
 I tell you the truth,

101
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,820
 they have received their reward in full.

102
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,900
 But when you pray, go into your room,

103
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,900
 close the door and pray to your father who is unseen.

104
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,660
 Then your father who sees what is done in secret

105
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,940
 will reward you.

106
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:24,140
 And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans,

107
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,460
 for they think they'll be heard

108
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,580
 because of their many words.

109
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,900
 Do not be like them,

110
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:33,260
 for your father knows what you need before you ask him."

111
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:37,460
 So while this passage from Jesus' Sermon on the Mount

112
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:42,300
 might look like, okay, it's his instructions on prayer,

113
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,460
 and it is, it is his instructions on prayer,

114
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,540
 but it's more.

115
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:51,100
 The whole Sermon on the Mount I submit to you

116
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,700
 is really Jesus' Sermon on what does it mean

117
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,020
 to have a real relationship with God.

118
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:06,740
 Because how we pray reveals the one to whom we pray,

119
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:12,060
 how we pray reveals our relationship to the one

120
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,700
 to whom we pray,

121
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:19,260
 and third, how we pray reveals what we believe

122
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,380
 about the one to whom we pray.

123
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:27,020
 So here, Jesus first approaches the subject

124
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,180
 from the negative,

125
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,660
 and then he's gonna go back and forth

126
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,660
 between positive, negative, positive.

127
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,940
 So he starts and he says in verse five,

128
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:36,460
 "And when you pray," here's the negative,

129
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,780
 "Do not be like the hypocrites,

130
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:41,500
 for they love to pray standing in the synagogues

131
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,180
 and on the street corners to be seen by men."

132
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,580
 Simply don't pray like hypocrites.

133
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:52,780
 Don't pray like those who have all the wrong reasons,

134
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,820
 all the wrong motives for praying.

135
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:59,460
 Don't do it for show.

136
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,760
 Don't do it to keep up appearances,

137
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,780
 not even for the appearance of spirituality.

138
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:09,020
 Don't pray so that people think you're godly.

139
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,340
 Don't pray just so that people can say,

140
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,460
 "Wow, look at that relationship they have with God.

141
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,760
 Look how close they are with God."

142
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,760
 Because that's how the hypocrites pray.

143
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,780
 They are people who have little

144
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,980
 and maybe no relationship to God.

145
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:29,180
 Yet they wanna suggest,

146
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:33,960
 and you could say they're all about this hustle.

147
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,860
 I want everybody to think I'm something I'm not.

148
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:44,380
 Remember, we are speaking to our Father in heaven.

149
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,940
 And what does Jesus say next?

150
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:52,060
 And this ought to be a shock, a surprise

151
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:56,820
 for those who have settled for that kind of communication

152
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,340
 and relationship with God.

153
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:03,240
 Jesus says, "I tell you the truth,

154
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,780
 they have received their reward in full."

155
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,900
 Why is that a shock?

156
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,660
 Why is it like a punch in the stomach

157
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,840
 for those who would pretend,

158
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,760
 act like they are spiritual,

159
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,100
 who are acting like they're talking with God?

160
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:24,400
 Because let's unpack something here.

161
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,100
 You know, Jesus often points to an absurdity

162
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,860
 so that he can show us what's so obviously true.

163
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,580
 And what's the absurdity here?

164
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,340
 I mean, think about it.

165
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,400
 What is the purpose of prayer?

166
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,260
 If we go back to Sunday school,

167
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,880
 and I don't know if you guys learned this,

168
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,760
 I learned this in VBS in Sunday school.

169
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,820
 Hey, you know, if you don't know how to pray,

170
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:52,420
 consider using this acronym, the Acts of Prayer.

171
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:55,780
 A stands for adoration.

172
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:59,420
 C stands for confession of your sins.

173
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:03,100
 T for thanksgiving and gratitude to God

174
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,580
 for what he has done for us.

175
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,580
 And then S, supplication,

176
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:11,060
 which means asking God what we need, our supply.

177
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,860
 So think about it.

178
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:18,220
 If you're a hypocrite and you pray great words,

179
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:21,980
 beautiful words of worship and adoration to God,

180
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,820
 sing wonderful songs to him,

181
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,060
 but you're doing it for show.

182
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,180
 Or you confess your sins,

183
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,300
 but you're not doing it

184
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:34,860
 because you want God to know that you're repenting,

185
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,180
 you're admitting to your flaws,

186
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,940
 but you just want people to think like,

187
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,740
 wow, look how godly he is, how humble he is.

188
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,340
 He's confessing his sins.

189
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:47,220
 And if you're thanking God for all that he's done for you,

190
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,780
 but you're not really talking to God,

191
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,740
 you're talking to the people.

192
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:55,300
 Or if you are presenting this long list of all your needs,

193
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,620
 and we all have long lists of needs,

194
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:03,620
 but we don't bring it to the one who can actually supply us.

195
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,540
 How ridiculous is that?

196
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:08,340
 When the opportunity is right there,

197
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:13,340
 the invitation is there, come, come, let's hang out.

198
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,340
 Let's fellowship together.

199
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:20,340
 Let's have a personal one-on-one appointment together.

200
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:27,660
 And then instead of taking advantage

201
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,780
 of such an amazing opportunity, an invaluable,

202
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:34,780
 such a priceless opportunity to be spending time

203
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,740
 with the God of the universe, the creator,

204
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,340
 our heavenly father,

205
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,500
 instead we're spending time with the people

206
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,900
 so we can show off.

207
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:49,220
 We have failed to do the very thing,

208
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:53,580
 the most important thing, the very purpose of prayer.

209
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,620
 We have not communicated with God.

210
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,860
 We have not spent time with God.

211
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,220
 Instead, we receive our reward in full.

212
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,380
 And what is that?

213
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,380
 That somebody might pat you on the back and say like,

214
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:08,380
 boy, aren't you a good Christian?

215
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:12,940
 Aren't you spiritual?

216
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:18,700
 And what good is it to receive that reward?

217
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:22,020
 What is that compared to the reward

218
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:24,740
 of spending real time with God?

219
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:29,540
 Then Jesus declares,

220
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:32,340
 truly they have received their reward in full.

221
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,900
 People have seen them.

222
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:38,900
 People have congratulated them, approved them,

223
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,180
 thought highly of them, respected them.

224
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:46,980
 If we're gonna do that, why would we do that?

225
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,900
 But if we're gonna do that, why do we go to church

226
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:53,500
 if it's not just to be able to put on our calendar,

227
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,420
 like check, we are at church.

228
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,460
 Look at our attendance record.

229
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,340
 Or why would we carry a Bible just so people would say like,

230
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:03,660
 wow, look at that, that guy still carries a Bible.

231
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,100
 All I carry is my phone.

232
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:11,580
 Or why would we teach or preach or serve or lead

233
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:17,180
 just so that people can say great job?

234
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:23,620
 When the opportunity is there to receive a greater reward

235
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,860
 from our heavenly father.

236
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:29,860
 So then he pivots to the positive in verse six,

237
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,180
 and he says, instead pray like this.

238
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,820
 But when you pray in verse six,

239
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:37,420
 go into your room, close the door.

240
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:40,620
 I'm gonna go back here so you can have the passage again.

241
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,500
 Sorry, I think the app froze.

242
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,620
 Oh, there it is, okay.

243
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:48,300
 But when you pray, go into your room, close the door

244
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,620
 and pray to your father who is unseen,

245
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,540
 then your father who sees what is done in secret

246
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,420
 will reward you.

247
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:59,940
 You know, I had a brother that if you would ask him

248
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,660
 to pray during worship service or in a Bible study

249
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:06,540
 or in a meeting or before a meal, he'd say, no, no, no, John,

250
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,860
 I don't do that because citing this very passage,

251
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,700
 Jesus says we should pray in secret.

252
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:16,980
 Well, friends, I hope we can all agree that Jesus

253
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,620
 in saying what he is saying here

254
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:23,620
 is not prohibiting public prayer or vocalized prayer.

255
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:28,940
 He's not saying the only way to pray is in a closet

256
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:33,580
 or in secret, but that he is emphasizing

257
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,780
 the opportunity we have that we can have

258
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:41,140
 an intimate relationship with God, a one-to-one,

259
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:45,300
 almost like a secret relationship with God.

260
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,460
 And you know what we do, right?

261
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:50,940
 When we know that we have, that somebody is gonna be,

262
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:55,820
 you know, they're gonna value a secret that we share,

263
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,740
 they're gonna guard the secret,

264
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,340
 we know we can say anything.

265
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,980
 When we're with somebody we trust, somebody we love,

266
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,940
 and we're close right next to them,

267
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,980
 and we can whisper into each other's ear,

268
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:10,220
 we know we can say anything and it's safe.

269
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,980
 We don't have to hide, we don't have to pretend,

270
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:15,540
 we don't have to put up some kind of air of,

271
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,620
 oh, you know, I'm actually better than I really am.

272
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:21,580
 No, we can be completely honest, revealing everything.

273
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:25,120
 And Jesus says, you can be that way with God.

274
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:31,860
 You can be that way with God, going into a secret place.

275
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:39,460
 You see, God is not a disinterested God.

276
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:42,740
 He is not aloof and far away.

277
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:49,420
 He is our Father who invites us to come near to Him,

278
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:53,340
 who invites us to seek Him out,

279
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:56,940
 and then promises us that we're gonna find Him,

280
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:00,220
 that He's not like trying to be evasive.

281
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:03,420
 You know, you ever get ghosted by somebody?

282
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,180
 I get, that happens to me.

283
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,340
 I know, you'd think like,

284
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,220
 yeah, how could that happen to this guy?

285
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,940
 He seems like such a likable guy.

286
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:12,300
 No, I get ghosted all the time, and I'm like,

287
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,540
 man, I know how text messages work.

288
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,900
 He just got that message.

289
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,460
 Why isn't he answering, right?

290
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,340
 So you just hope they're probably in a meeting,

291
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,740
 they can't answer right now.

292
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,340
 God's not gonna ghost us.

293
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:30,420
 He doesn't get tired of His children and say,

294
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,820
 you know, oh, gosh, this guy, he won't stop talking.

295
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,460
 He always wants to hang out with me.

296
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,900
 God's not that kind of a Father.

297
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,500
 He loves it when we spend time with Him.

298
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:46,980
 He wants us to come closer and closer to know Him better.

299
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:55,220
 'Cause remember, we're speaking with our Heavenly Father.

300
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,300
 I hope we all believe this,

301
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:03,300
 that this is the God that invites us to come near to pray.

302
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:08,140
 He's intimately close, He loves us,

303
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:12,500
 and in fact, the Bible says He loves us so much

304
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:17,500
 that His own Holy Spirit has made our bodies His temple,

305
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,500
 His home.

306
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:24,900
 But He says that we are to abide, have unity with His Son.

307
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:31,300
 And then He tells us, we're so close,

308
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:35,620
 that nothing can separate us from His love

309
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,300
 in Christ Jesus, our Lord.

310
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,180
 And that's close.

311
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:45,340
 And this is the Father to whom we pray.

312
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:50,340
 And as in a secret place, we can enjoy unparalleled,

313
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:54,060
 uninhibited access to the Father

314
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:58,940
 so that this reward of knowing Him

315
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:05,980
 is so much greater than that meager reward you get

316
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:10,460
 when you pray for the sake of what people might think.

317
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:16,140
 Sure, there's stuff that comes with this reward.

318
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,700
 You know, we bring our lists and we say,

319
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,180
 God, please help me, please provide for me.

320
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,540
 I have this need.

321
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:25,400
 And sure, God takes care of material needs too.

322
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,100
 But that's like having a steak and saying like,

323
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:32,240
 man, this is the most awesome salt I've ever had.

324
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:36,080
 (congregation laughing)

325
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,440
 There's something even better

326
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,560
 than the stuff that God provides.

327
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,920
 It's Himself.

328
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,080
 It's Himself.

329
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:51,000
 So let's not let the stuff that is good

330
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,720
 distract us from what's really the best.

331
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,360
 It's God Himself, the Father.

332
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,280
 So in verse seven, then He said,

333
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,480
 well, let's say, you know,

334
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,360
 the authentic relationship with the Father

335
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,240
 requires us to believe who He is.

336
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:14,720
 And actually it requires us to believe who we are too.

337
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,800
 That when we pray, we're not praying as strangers

338
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:23,040
 or the enemies of God, but in Christ Jesus,

339
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,040
 we are His children.

340
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:30,040
 We are talking to Daddy God, Abba Father.

341
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,120
 So we had to know who He is.

342
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,600
 We got to know who we are.

343
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,480
 And then when we pray,

344
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,080
 it also includes knowing what kind of Father is He.

345
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,920
 So in verse seven, Jesus says,

346
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,760
 "And when you pray," going back to the negative,

347
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:46,840
 "do not keep on babbling like pagans,

348
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,920
 for they think they'll be heard

349
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,640
 because of their many words."

350
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,100
 So what kind of Father is He?

351
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:54,840
 The first thing we see is He's not the kind of Father

352
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,840
 who's really impressed by lots of words.

353
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,760
 Words by themselves don't do it for Him.

354
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,280
 You know, in many religions,

355
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,160
 including many traditions of Christianity,

356
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,560
 you know, writing down prayers, reading prayers,

357
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,800
 memorizing and reciting prayers,

358
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,920
 and even praying a long time.

359
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,560
 These are valuable things, highly valued things.

360
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,640
 And don't, just like we're not gonna do

361
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,760
 Bible studies anymore,

362
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,660
 doesn't mean there's no more prayer meetings either, okay?

363
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,340
 By the way, we are gonna have Bible studies,

364
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,580
 right, Pastor Mark?

365
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,140
 And yes, we should pray.

366
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,100
 So these are all still valuable.

367
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:39,260
 Yes, write down your prayers, journal your prayers,

368
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,180
 because you know, you're gonna come back one day

369
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,420
 when you're really discouraged,

370
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,980
 and you're gonna go back and read your journal,

371
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:47,220
 go, "Man, I totally forgot about this.

372
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,700
 Six months ago, I was so depressed,

373
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:54,460
 and I asked God, 'Lord, would you please give me joy

374
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,560
 and peace?

375
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,940
 Would you give me contentment?'

376
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,580
 And I have it, and I totally forgot I asked Him."

377
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,540
 And then you can write next to your little prayer

378
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,260
 that you wrote down, "God did it.

379
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,900
 He came through.

380
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,620
 How faithful He is."

381
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,980
 And then we'll worship Him.

382
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:15,820
 So write them down, recite prayers, memorize prayers,

383
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:18,480
 'cause sometimes, you know this experience,

384
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,380
 you get to your quiet time, your prayer closet,

385
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,420
 and you're just like,

386
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:25,380
 "Man, I don't even know what to say to God today."

387
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,580
 So what do you do?

388
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,420
 You might go back and read the prayers of others.

389
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,500
 That's valuable.

390
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:34,300
 And then sometimes, you wanna discipline yourself and say,

391
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,140
 "You know what?

392
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:38,060
 I don't have much to say, but I am not leaving this room

393
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:41,660
 until I have prayed 10 minutes, or 15 minutes,

394
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,700
 until I've talked to God for half an hour,

395
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:47,380
 or prayed for an hour, or more."

396
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,080
 Those are great disciplines.

397
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:55,080
 But even those valuable things can become empty and void

398
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,580
 of value and meaning if we're not careful.

399
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,500
 Let me give you an example.

400
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,220
 You know, when I was a small boy,

401
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,820
 you know, I probably learned from my parents

402
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,940
 more than anybody else how to pray.

403
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:07,180
 And one day, when my dad would hear me saying the same things

404
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:10,060
 over and over again in prayer, like at the dinner table,

405
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,880
 he said, "Hey, why don't you kinda mix it up a little bit

406
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,180
 and be more creative?

407
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:19,300
 'Cause it doesn't sound like you mean it when you say it."

408
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,820
 So he said, "For example, maybe you might wanna start

409
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:24,100
 with not just, you know, 'Thanks for the food, God,'

410
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,980
 but you might say, 'Thank you, God, for a beautiful day.

411
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:29,980
 Thank you for taking care of me.'"

412
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,460
 And, you know, so he would provide these suggestions.

413
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,380
 And I remember thinking, "Yeah, that's a great idea."

414
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:37,060
 So I added in my prayers,

415
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,640
 "God, thank you for this beautiful day."

416
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,420
 As a child, that just like, "Hey, that's simple.

417
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,460
 That makes sense."

418
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:49,040
 And, but I remember, I was in elementary school,

419
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:53,540
 and I was praying over my cereal and milk.

420
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,420
 And I remember praying,

421
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,940
 "God, thank you for this beautiful day."

422
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,520
 And immediately, I looked out the window

423
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:05,520
 and noticed it was dark, it was raining, it looked cold.

424
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,980
 And here I was thanking God for a beautiful day.

425
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:11,060
 And immediately I realized, like,

426
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,460
 "Man, I just said something I don't even mean."

427
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:19,140
 Unless, you know, even as a kid, I was super spiritual,

428
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,300
 like, "I'm praying for a beautiful day.

429
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:24,300
 I'm believing God's gonna give it to me."

430
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:27,940
 Or, "I'm so spiritual, I'm gonna be content

431
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:30,640
 as I'm getting soaking wet and freezing in the rain."

432
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,340
 No.

433
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:36,100
 Even something that was meant to be good

434
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:39,260
 had become meaningless 'cause it was just words.

435
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:42,420
 And you know what I'm talking about

436
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,660
 'cause I'm sure you've experienced that too.

437
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,100
 We gotta check ourselves.

438
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:49,340
 And sometimes it's even the very name of God,

439
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:52,260
 the calling God Lord.

440
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,380
 You know, have you ever had,

441
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,500
 sorry, this isn't in the notes,

442
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,980
 have you ever had one of those conversations with somebody?

443
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:00,580
 Wouldn't it be annoying if I was talking to Mark

444
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,940
 and I said, "Hey, Mark, how's your day, Mark?

445
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,940
 Mark, you wanna go out for lunch, Mark?

446
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:08,620
 Is Wendy doing okay, Mark?

447
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,940
 Are your kids doing okay, Mark?"

448
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:12,420
 And if I kept saying his name over and over again,

449
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,260
 and you know what?

450
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:16,420
 If you think about it, that's how we often pray, right?

451
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:20,140
 Like, "Lord, thank you so much for this beautiful day, Lord."

452
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,460
 And then, "Lord," and then now you're all gonna get

453
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:25,520
 really self-conscious about public prayer or something.

454
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,860
 But like, even Lord,

455
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:33,980
 that He is the master of all things, King,

456
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,660
 and it becomes meaningless.

457
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,900
 It's just another word.

458
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:41,420
 Because we don't mean it when we say it.

459
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:45,140
 Or Father, or maybe even the name of Jesus.

460
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:48,380
 It just becomes something that we automatically insert

461
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,060
 into every sentence at the beginning,

462
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,020
 in the middle, at the end, you know?

463
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:55,080
 As if somehow, like the pagans think,

464
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:59,700
 that their many words are gonna get God to hear them.

465
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:04,760
 God is not a respecter of lots of words.

466
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:09,820
 So when we pray, let's pray,

467
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:13,000
 meaning what we say and saying what we mean.

468
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,640
 And here's another thing.

469
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,420
 You know, God is not like other gods, and He's not,

470
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,900
 you know, though He is our Father,

471
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,020
 He is not like our earthly father.

472
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:26,100
 And here's what I mean.

473
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,120
 How many parents do we have in this room?

474
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,020
 Well, we got a young room, not a lot of parents.

475
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:35,460
 Two parents.

476
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:38,260
 Well, when you're parents, you're gonna experience this,

477
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,820
 and this is where your children will,

478
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,000
 well, we've all been children,

479
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,940
 so maybe we remember when we've done this,

480
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,860
 that we negotiate with our parents.

481
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:51,520
 That we might even say things like adore them,

482
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,380
 love them, flatter them, like worship and praise them,

483
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,400
 just so we can get what we want.

484
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:01,960
 God's not like that.

485
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:07,360
 We don't adore Him, confess our sins, and thank Him,

486
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,440
 just so we can hurry up and get to the list of things

487
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,680
 that we need, thinking that if we butter Him up,

488
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,480
 if we get Him in a good mood,

489
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,920
 He's gonna give us what we need and what I want.

490
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,320
 Or we might bargain.

491
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:25,200
 God, if you'll do this for me, I'll do this for you.

492
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,760
 You know what my favorite one is?

493
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:33,400
 God, if you make me rich, I promise I will start to tithe.

494
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,640
 Give me a million dollars,

495
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,720
 and I promise I'll start to tithe.

496
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,720
 And you know how ridiculous that is?

497
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,480
 It's like, God, give me a million dollars,

498
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,160
 and I promise I'll give you 100,000 back.

499
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,080
 What a great deal for God, right?

500
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:51,200
 But that's how we pray sometimes.

501
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,960
 We're thinking we're doing Him a favor in these deals.

502
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:59,280
 Let's not do that.

503
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:02,700
 That's not the kind of God we serve.

504
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,740
 That's not the Heavenly Father.

505
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:09,800
 Are we using many words, strategic words, insincere words,

506
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,760
 maybe even empty words because we're forgetting

507
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,960
 who we're talking with, who we're dealing with,

508
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,520
 that He's not impersonal?

509
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:24,480
 He's not an absentee father,

510
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,280
 but rather we are speaking to our Heavenly Father

511
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,280
 who loves us.

512
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:34,720
 Yes, we believe our God is our Father,

513
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,960
 but do we really believe what kind of God He is?

514
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,960
 And then Jesus reminds us again,

515
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,080
 He doesn't respect words

516
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,040
 because that's 'cause He's not an empty God.

517
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,760
 He's not a dead God who receives empty prayers

518
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,760
 from empty pray-ers.

519
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:55,600
 So He says in verse seven again,

520
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,720
 "When you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans,

521
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,240
 "for they think they will be heard

522
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,600
 "because of their many words."

523
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,320
 Second, though, we have to remember that our Father

524
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,480
 is one who already knows what we need.

525
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:16,480
 In other words, when we give our list of needs,

526
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,300
 God's not like, "Wow,

527
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:24,500
 "here's information I did not have.

528
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:28,980
 "I'm so glad He gave me a detailed list."

529
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,840
 Or it's not like time goes by

530
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,840
 and we forget to tell God we need something,

531
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,480
 and God says, "Oh man, why didn't you tell me

532
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,600
 "you needed that?

533
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,600
 "I would've taken care of it,

534
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,620
 "but you never told me.

535
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,820
 "I had no idea that was going on in your life.

536
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,700
 "I didn't know."

537
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:50,700
 God is a Father who already knows what we need.

538
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:55,920
 You know, in a season when our prayer life

539
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,440
 can become very imbalanced,

540
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,240
 you know, when it seems like there's so many needs,

541
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,800
 that the list at the end

542
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:07,640
 becomes the large part of our prayer

543
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:11,320
 that we kind of rush through praising and worshiping,

544
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,160
 and we rush through

545
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:17,920
 sincerely confessing our sins

546
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,360
 and asking for forgiveness,

547
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,960
 where we rush through and try, you know,

548
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,000
 have a hard time remembering,

549
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,440
 "What has God done for me lately?

550
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,720
 "I gotta thank Him for something.

551
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,620
 "I gotta come up with something

552
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,360
 "just so I can get to the list."

553
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:36,040
 Let's not forget

554
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:42,120
 what kind of God, what kind of Father is He?

555
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,720
 That He is one who knows what we need,

556
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,640
 and in knowing what we need,

557
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,120
 we have a God who is able,

558
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,920
 He is capable of providing what we need.

559
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,760
 Do we believe that?

560
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,580
 Amen?

561
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:57,840
 This side doesn't sound convinced.

562
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,680
 Amen?

563
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,120
 Can He take care of us?

564
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,240
 Yes.

565
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,440
 But here's something that's equally important.

566
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,440
 Yes, He is able to take care of us.

567
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:12,080
 The Bible tells us He is a king

568
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:16,240
 that owns cattle on a thousand hills.

569
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,080
 I mean, maybe like in today's vernacular,

570
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,040
 that might be like,

571
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:25,040
 He's a car dealer who owns a thousand lots of cars,

572
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,520
 you know?

573
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,320
 If you need a car, He's got one for you, okay?

574
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,220
 By the way, I don't know how many times

575
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:37,680
 God has provided a car when I've desperately needed a car,

576
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,780
 and others have said the same thing to me.

577
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:44,240
 But not only can He do it,

578
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:50,200
 what's equally important is that He is gracious.

579
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:54,760
 He cares, He loves us, so He wants to do it.

580
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,600
 He wants to take care of us.

581
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,040
 He wants to bless us.

582
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,720
 He doesn't want us to go without.

583
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,220
 He wants to bless us.

584
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:10,960
 He wants to make sure that He is supplying us.

585
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,280
 These two things, it might seem obvious,

586
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,980
 but these two things in combination

587
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:21,720
 are so incredibly important.

588
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:28,740
 You see, if He was a powerful and wealthy God,

589
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:32,940
 it would be like having a father who is a billionaire,

590
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:37,560
 but he never asks, "Hey, did you have lunch today?

591
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:42,820
 Hey, there's holes in your clothes.

592
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,520
 Do we need to get you a new shirt?

593
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:51,760
 Hey, you look sad today.

594
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,900
 How can I help you today?"

595
00:30:55,900 --> 00:31:01,820
 It would be having a God who is a billionaire,

596
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:06,260
 who has everything that a person could want or have,

597
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:09,680
 and then, but they don't care about us.

598
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,100
 They won't lift a finger to help us.

599
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:16,080
 But what if God was unable to help us,

600
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,620
 but He really cared about us, and that was all He,

601
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,460
 you know what?

602
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:23,060
 It would be like the impotent father

603
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:26,020
 who desperately sees his desperate children

604
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:29,140
 starving to death, freezing in the cold,

605
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:32,520
 having no roof over their heads, no bed to sleep in,

606
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:36,940
 and because He's powerless, He's helpless,

607
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,040
 He can do nothing.

608
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:44,500
 But God is able, and He so cares about us.

609
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:53,580
 There's no place I see it better than in the words of Paul.

610
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,140
 I gotta ask, sister, I don't know if you read

611
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:59,780
 the sermon manuscript before I preach today,

612
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:03,080
 but I hear she quoted the very verses.

613
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:10,100
 In Romans 5, six through eight, Paul says,

614
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,780
 "You see, at just the right time,

615
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:17,780
 when we were still powerless, you know, helpless,

616
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,120
 Christ died for the ungodly.

617
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:23,020
 Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous man,

618
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:27,680
 though for a good man, someone might possibly dare to die."

619
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:31,480
 And here it is in verse eight.

620
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:35,420
 "But God demonstrates His own love for us in this.

621
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:39,980
 While we were still sinners, Christ died for us."

622
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:45,000
 Our father knew exactly what we needed

623
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,840
 more than anything else.

624
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:52,600
 We had a problem that was the elephant in the room.

625
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,680
 We could not get past it, we could not ignore it.

626
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:59,840
 It is a sin problem that we have offended

627
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,260
 our heavenly father, our creator.

628
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:08,000
 And God had the solution because we were helpless,

629
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,100
 powerless to do anything about it.

630
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:18,100
 And the solution was in His son.

631
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:21,340
 And God could say, "Oh, no, no, wait,

632
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,380
 the price is way too high.

633
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:26,560
 I cannot give up my son for these losers.

634
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,100
 They're my enemies.

635
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:33,660
 Why would I sacrifice my son for them?"

636
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:36,900
 But He didn't do that because He demonstrated

637
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:40,140
 His love for us like this.

638
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:43,700
 And while we were still sinners, still His enemies,

639
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:48,500
 He gave His son.

640
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,180
 Jesus died for us.

641
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:54,380
 Amazing.

642
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:58,060
 This is amazing love, the song that we sang.

643
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:01,060
 This is amazing.

644
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:04,220
 We needed a savior.

645
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,620
 The father was able to provide a savior.

646
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:09,700
 And because He loves us and cares for us,

647
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:13,820
 He was willing to pay the price,

648
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:18,820
 that high price so that we could be saved from our sin.

649
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:26,180
 Jesus' words on prayer reinforced for us

650
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:29,700
 that God desires an authentic relationship with us.

651
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:34,820
 Not just religiosity, not just piety,

652
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:40,740
 not just ritualism, He wants a relationship.

653
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:43,660
 Come close to me.

654
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:47,780
 Come close, come even closer.

655
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:51,060
 You're still too far away, come closer.

656
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:56,940
 And He gives us access through faith in Jesus Christ,

657
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:57,780
 His son.

658
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:00,740
 If you don't know Jesus as your Lord and savior,

659
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:05,180
 why wait a moment longer?

660
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,580
 Trust in Him today.

661
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:12,820
 He said Himself, no one comes to the Father

662
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,540
 except through Him.

663
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:18,180
 I'm gonna ask you to just bow your heads for a moment.

664
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,580
 And I'm gonna ask you to,

665
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:26,460
 we'll just go through the acts, the acts of prayer.

666
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:33,060
 God, thank you that you are indeed a loving Father.

667
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:39,260
 Thank you that you are a God who is powerful

668
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:42,380
 and you are able.

669
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:47,060
 We don't have a weak God, we don't have a distant God,

670
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:49,180
 we have a God who is intimately close.

671
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:54,900
 A God who doesn't have to hang out with us,

672
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,980
 but God who wants to.

673
00:35:56,980 --> 00:36:02,700
 We praise you for being a God like no other.

674
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:07,420
 For being our heavenly Father.

675
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:09,140
 And we confess our sin to you,

676
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:12,140
 we admit that we have sinned against you

677
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:14,620
 when we have tried to live life our own way.

678
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:18,660
 God, we have said no to you.

679
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,820
 We have said your way is not good enough.

680
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:24,980
 Your way isn't good enough for me, it's not my way.

681
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:29,980
 And we have chosen to rebel and we ask you for forgiveness.

682
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:34,860
 For every choice that we have made,

683
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:39,860
 which only confirmed that we are in rebellion against you.

684
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:45,340
 But Lord, thank you that you have sent your son, Jesus.

685
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:50,780
 Knowing exactly what we need, a savior,

686
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:53,340
 you have provided a savior,

687
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:57,060
 the perfect Lamb of God in your son, Jesus Christ.

688
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,020
 And you have said to us,

689
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:01,420
 if we will just believe in your remedy

690
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:05,340
 for our sin problem, the solution to our sin problem,

691
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:09,180
 if we would just receive in faith that remedy

692
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:12,580
 that you have said, you will forgive us.

693
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:17,020
 You'll give us a new life, a new identity,

694
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,460
 no longer an enemy of God,

695
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:21,540
 but now a child of God, a friend of God.

696
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:27,540
 That you promise us eternal life and not death.

697
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:34,700
 Thank you for the gift of salvation in Jesus Christ.

698
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:39,740
 And Lord, we do lay before you all our needs.

699
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:43,860
 And we know that we're going to keep being tempted.

700
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,480
 We're gonna keep being distracted.

701
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,580
 We're gonna think that things that are fool's gold

702
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:48,700
 is real gold.

703
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:51,700
 We're gonna think that what isn't valuable is valuable.

704
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,820
 Our priorities are gonna get messed up

705
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,420
 and we need your help, Lord.

706
00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:01,380
 Teach us, teach us how to get it right.

707
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,220
 We can't do it without your help.

708
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:07,940
 And there are other needs in this room,

709
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:12,940
 financial needs, concerns about career or education,

710
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:21,180
 relational issues, broken families, broken friendships,

711
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:26,500
 broken relationships with, in our workplaces,

712
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:29,620
 in our schools, Lord, with this world,

713
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:32,460
 we pray you will heal those relationships.

714
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:40,340
 And God, we also ask, again,

715
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:43,180
 that you would teach us how to pray.

716
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:46,540
 Because we want to have that relationship with you,

717
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,300
 that communication with you,

718
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:52,340
 that Jesus has now, he's wet our appetite

719
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:55,420
 and has shown us how much better

720
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:58,780
 how much more there is for us.

721
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:02,740
 Lord, teach us how to pray.

722
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:09,300
 I'm gonna ask you to open your eyes for a moment.

723
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:13,900
 And we're gonna finish prayer this way.

724
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:16,940
 'Cause Jesus did give us a specific prayer.

725
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:19,140
 And it's probably one that everybody in the room

726
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:21,100
 has memorized.

727
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,820
 But how many times when somebody says,

728
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:25,860
 "Okay, let's pray the Lord's Prayer together,"

729
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,260
 we're able to just, you know,

730
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,620
 we could be like texting somebody

731
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:31,660
 and we could still do the Lord's Prayer, right?

732
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,540
 You're watching a video, YouTube,

733
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,380
 and we can recite the Lord's Prayer.

734
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:40,060
 But how about right now, we'll just focus,

735
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:43,700
 pull away from all the distractions,

736
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:47,660
 and let's look at the Lord's Prayer,

737
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:50,980
 the prayer that Jesus taught us afresh.

738
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:55,180
 'Cause he said, "This then is how you should pray."

739
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:57,740
 Let's do it together.

740
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:00,300
 Our Father in heaven,

741
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,820
 hallowed be your name.

742
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:04,740
 Your kingdom come,

743
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:08,900
 your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.

744
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:11,820
 Give us today our daily bread.

745
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,740
 Forgive us our debts,

746
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:17,380
 as we also have forgiven our debtors.

747
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,900
 And lead us not into temptation,

748
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:22,420
 but deliver us from the evil one.

749
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:31,180
 And Jesus invites us to an authentic relationship

750
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,060
 with his heavenly Father.

751
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,100
 And I ask you,

752
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:37,980
 do you accept that invitation?

753
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:43,020
 Are you all in on this relationship?

754
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:49,100
 I hope your answer is a resounding yes,

755
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:51,180
 absolutely, that's what I want.

756
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:57,460
 That's in Jesus' name we have prayed, amen.

757
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:07,460
