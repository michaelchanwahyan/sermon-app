[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.720]   him. Thank you and I'm excited to be here today. I love being at UV. I get to see
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.280]   old friends and new friends every time I'm here and it's really good to be
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.720]   back. I haven't been here for a few months. It's been a while but I was here
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.600]   years ago for a long time for a period of years was here and always a part of
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.240]   the UV English service so it's really good to be back with you. This morning
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:39.880]   we're gonna look at the story of a mother. It is Mother's Day as we've
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:45.800]   already noticed and discussed this morning and that's a special day.
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.640]   Hopefully you've already had a chance if your mother is living. Hopefully you've
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.840]   already had a chance to connect with her and offer some words of appreciation and
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:03.720]   gratefulness and encouragement to your mom. My wife is here with our kids.
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:10.560]   We have five kids and our oldest is 11 so she's a very busy mom and my mom I
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:18.200]   come from a family of 10 kids so I had nine siblings. I've seen a lot of
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.360]   moms up close who had a lot to do and seen the service that they give and
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.920]   that's what we're gonna talk about today how that can be a model for us. I know
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.360]   not everyone has a mom who models God's love for them. Sometimes our
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.040]   relationship to our mom can be painful and if that's your experience that's
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.520]   fine that God can heal that and God can can bring us through that and even the
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.880]   things that we're gonna talk about today are things that apply really to all of
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.320]   us and so we're gonna be looking in the first chapter of Luke. We're looking at
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:00.520]   this very famous mom in Scripture, Mary the mother of Jesus and in this passage
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.600]   we see the beginning of the story of Jesus's physical manifestation and his
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.920]   birth here on earth. Now most of us associate this story with Christmas.
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.200]   We're in Luke chapter 1 we're gonna be looking at verses 26 to 38 and a lot a
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.840]   lot of times we think about this story in terms of Christmas and it is that's
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.480]   okay it is a part of the Christmas story but this is also the beginning of not
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.120]   just Jesus's birth but the beginning of Mary and of what we see of her
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.840]   throughout the story of the Gospels and so today we're gonna think about her
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.740]   life a little bit and some of the things that we can learn from her life and the
[00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:45.200]   theme of what we're talking about that we see modeled in her is this this heart
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:52.080]   attitude this posture of unseen service and we see this in Mary's life and if
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.640]   you had a mom who loved you especially if you had a mom who loved Jesus and
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.360]   loved you I'm sure you saw this in your mom's life. Moms model this so well for
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.880]   us this this attitude this posture of unseen service. So let's think about Mary
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:13.480]   for a minute. Here she is a seemingly unremarkable young woman. She's a peasant
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:20.240]   woman. She doesn't have any wealth, any authority, any position, any status. She's
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:27.040]   from one of the most forgotten small villages in Israel, Nazareth, and she's
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.320]   going to become known for being the mother of Jesus but she's also going to
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:39.280]   be known as we're considering today for being unknown. There it's conspicuous her
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.480]   story is conspicuous because of how little we know about her even though she
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.720]   plays this really important role we really don't know a lot about her and
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:52.840]   the the biggest picture we see of her is at this point when when Jesus is born
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.360]   and then after that throughout the Gospels there's only really small pieces
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:04.400]   of her story that we see and that tells us that so much of her service to God
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:10.600]   was unseen so much of her service to God was invisible to us and honestly
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:16.960]   invisible even to the people in her life. We don't know how much time she spent
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:22.200]   caring for Jesus or all the things that she did as a mom to care for him when he
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:28.720]   was an infant or when he was a toddler or when he was a boy and eventually a
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.880]   young man. We don't know all of those things that she did. We know she did
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:39.000]   those things because that's a part of human life and she was a mom but we
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.840]   didn't see them they're not recorded for us. We don't know all the prayers that
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:54.160]   she prayed over her son. We don't know all the tears that she cried. Mary we
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.600]   know from the scripture it talks about her reflecting and considering things
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:03.680]   in her heart. She was deeply spiritual. She knew God. She was obedient to God.
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.600]   She was a servant of God and she watched Jesus be persecuted and she watched all
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.360]   the things that Jesus went through in life. That must have been deeply
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:18.560]   emotionally wounding to her but we don't we don't see that. That's not a part of
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:25.040]   the story that we're given and that's one of the exemplary things about her
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.960]   that we can learn from is that she plays such an important part but she's so
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:37.200]   humble and she's content for her service to God to be unseen and that's why we're
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.680]   gonna look at her story today. Since it's Mother's Day she's a great model for us
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:47.760]   and like I said so many moms model that for us as well but I want to be clear at
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:52.280]   the beginning here we're not saying that Mary and her unseen service is a great
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.840]   model for moms although that is certainly true. We're saying she is a
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:01.720]   great model for all of us because being willing to serve and to serve God and to
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.960]   be obedient even in ways that no one notices or sees or thanks us for is not
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.160]   just something for Mary to do it's not just something for moms to do it's
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.120]   something for every believer every follower of Jesus. We should all have
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:19.560]   this attitude this this posture of heart that we see in her. So that's what we're
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:25.760]   gonna consider today. So let's read this passage together beginning in chapter
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:32.200]   26 this is Luke 1 26 to 38. In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:37.360]   God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin betrothed to a man whose
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:42.120]   name was Joseph of the house of David and the Virgin's name was Mary and he
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:47.620]   came to her and said greetings Oh favored one the Lord is with you but she
[00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:52.080]   was greatly troubled at the saying and tried to discern what sort of greeting
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:57.200]   this might be and the angel said to her do not be afraid Mary for you have found
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.240]   favor with God and behold you will conceive in your womb and bear a son
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:06.400]   and you shall call his name Jesus he will be great and will be called the son
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.960]   of the Most High and the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.320]   and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:19.320]   will be no end and Mary said to the angel how will this be since I am a
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:23.880]   virgin the angel answered her the Holy Spirit will come upon you and the power
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:28.920]   the Most High will overshadow you therefore the child to be born will be
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:34.920]   called holy the Son of God and behold your relative Elizabeth in her old age
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:40.160]   has also conceived a son and this is the sixth month with her who was called
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:48.680]   barren for nothing will be impossible with God and Mary said behold I am the
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:55.280]   servant of the Lord let it be to me according to your word and the angel
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:08:02.080]   departed from her the first thing we see in this passage about Mary's heart
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:09.120]   attitude her posture is that she has this posture of submission and surrender
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:15.400]   and that's so important for us if we want to be willing to enter into unseen
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:19.640]   and unacknowledged service to God we have to have a hard attitude of
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:25.680]   submission and surrender it's right there in verse 38 Mary says behold I am
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:31.280]   the servant of the Lord let it be to me according to your word now Mary was a
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:38.480]   young woman again there's so much we don't know about her but we know she
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:42.960]   must have she was a human being just like us so she must have had a lot of
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:48.120]   plans and dreams and hopes for her future just like every young person every
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:51.280]   young person has things that they want to do and ideas in their head of what
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:55.280]   they want their future to be like and whether it's relationships or something
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:00.560]   they want to achieve or something that they want to be a part of everybody has
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:06.440]   those dreams so Mary would have had those as well just like any other young
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:15.560]   person and yet she hears this she hears God's truth communicated to her from
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:22.320]   Gabriel and what does she do she releases her will and she surrenders to
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:29.880]   God's Gabriel's announcement is what we would call a watershed moment or a
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:36.160]   turning point in her life she's never gonna be the same after this it marks a
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:40.880]   pivot a change in the trajectory of her life she may have been heading in one
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:45.400]   direction before and now forever after her life's gonna be totally different
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:50.320]   she's going in a different direction and she knows that she understands that and
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:56.840]   she says that's okay I'm gonna submit to what God is doing in this moment and I'm
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:04.120]   gonna say God let my life be what you want may it be to me according to your
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:12.040]   word she surrenders to what God is doing and so that's something that we need to
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:16.440]   live out in our lives as followers of Jesus we need to be willing to submit
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:22.880]   and to surrender to what God is doing to God's truth obviously that's a difficult
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:27.240]   thing submission is a scary word for us just hearing that word is scary because
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:34.160]   it means a loss of control it means a loss of what I want my priorities and
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:40.400]   objectives and so I want to remind us that as we apply that in our lives what
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:46.600]   Mary was doing what God calls us to do is to submit to God's Word and submit to
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:50.760]   God's truth we're not simply submitting for the sake of submission and that's
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:54.200]   one of the reasons that word is so scary for us in our culture a lot of times we
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:59.200]   say well I've seen people who have submitted to the wrong thing and then
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:04.600]   they've end up being harmed or abused by that posture of submission right that
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:10.960]   causes us to be very wary of the concept of submission and that's true and we are
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:14.840]   to be wise and discerning because we're not to submit to everything we're
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:20.680]   actually supposed to resist evil remember James 4 7 submit yourselves
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:24.800]   therefore to God and resist the devil and he will flee from you so there's a
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:28.200]   lot of evil and injustice in our world that we are not supposed to submit to
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:34.880]   we're actually supposed to resist but the thing that we are to submit to is to
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:40.320]   God's truth and to what God has to say about our lives and that's something
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:49.920]   that if we will submit to it it is good and beautiful and right for us to submit
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:55.120]   to God and if we think about that for a moment it actually makes sense right
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:12:00.560]   because if God is who he says he is if he knows everything and he knows
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:05.400]   everything about our life and our heart and our future and if he's also who he
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:10.720]   says he is that he is perfectly good and loving then it makes a lot of sense to
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:15.760]   submit to his plan to say God here's what I would like to do here's how I see
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:19.560]   this working out in my future but I'm gonna trust that you have a better plan
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:23.200]   than I do I'm gonna trust that you know more than me I'm gonna trust that your
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:28.440]   desire for my heart is better even than my own desire for my heart and I'm gonna
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:33.400]   submit to you it's actually a good and beautiful and right thing for us to
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:38.320]   submit to God because he is the definition of good and his will is the
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:42.880]   definition of right and his expressions are the definition of beauty and so if
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:48.080]   we will submit to what he's doing then we will experience those things in our
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:54.160]   life that goodness that righteousness that beauty but we need to be clear on
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.840]   that when we're looking for that posture of submission where are we submitting
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:01.640]   we're submitting to God to what he's saying Mary was right to submit to
[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:05.520]   Gabriel because Gabriel was communicating God's truth to her and
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:10.360]   then what comes out of that what fruit is produced in our lives when we begin
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:17.280]   to submit to God the outcome is that God has been able to work his good and
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:25.360]   beautiful and right plan in our lives for his glory and for our good Mary's
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:31.600]   submission meant that she was able to play this part in God's grand redemptive
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:36.160]   narrative of every human that was going to be saved through Jesus now that's a
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:43.240]   beautiful and mind-boggling thing right we think about all of the people from
[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:47.800]   every tongue tribe and nation throughout all the generations of the earth that
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:51.720]   have come to relationship with God through Jesus Christ and through his
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:56.440]   sacrifice on the cross and through the redemption that Jesus brought and Mary
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:01.960]   got to be a part of that story if she had not submitted and surrendered to God
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:07.440]   she would not have been a part of that story now obviously in that moment it
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:11.640]   may not have felt great to her to say I'm gonna give up all of my plans and my
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:18.880]   dreams and my desires my ambitions and and obey God and she probably had some
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:25.280]   some conflict within her some second thoughts but because she did that she
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:29.880]   got to be a part of something that was beautiful and amazing and so far beyond
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:35.880]   herself and that's true for us as well it's not easy to surrender to what God
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:39.960]   is doing in our lives sometimes it can be difficult to submit but as we do that
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:44.120]   we get to be a part of something that's good and beautiful and way bigger than
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:49.280]   us and one of the things that's clear in scripture is that God always works
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:56.240]   always for his glory and for our good anything that God allows in to our life
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:01.280]   is only there because it's either gonna glorify him and make his name great and
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:08.560]   cause people to see him for who he is or it's gonna be good for us maybe not good
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:13.160]   in the way that we imagine when we think about what's good for us we think
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:19.000]   comfort blessing success you know material things that's what we think
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.400]   right sometimes I think God says hey you know what's good for you at times is
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:29.000]   adversity and challenge because that brings growth or to go through something
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.120]   difficult because you're gonna learn a lesson you wouldn't learn any other way
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:36.720]   but we can trust that God's always at work for our good even if it doesn't
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:40.280]   feel great in that moment and that's the fruit that was produced in Mary's life
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:43.560]   that's the fruit that will be produced in our life if we have that posture of
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:50.480]   submission to God God's glory will be evident in our life God will be
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:57.200]   glorified and God's plan will be at work in our life and we'll get to see God's
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:03.080]   good plan for us and for those around us the other thing we see here is that this
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:10.240]   posture of unseen service is a posture of the background vocalists throughout
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:16.280]   the rest of the Gospels Mary kind of fades from our view that she's there in
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:22.560]   different places she reappears briefly when she and Joseph take Jesus to
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:28.240]   present him to the Lord at the temple that's in Luke chapter 2 when her and
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:32.320]   Joseph are looking for Jesus when they leave Jerusalem after the past Passover
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:36.560]   that's later in Luke chapter 2 she's there at the wedding in Cana that's in
[00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:41.560]   John chapter 2 she was certainly there when Jesus was rejected at Nazareth
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:47.360]   that's in multiple Gospels Matthew 13 is where it's at in Matthew she's visiting
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:51.680]   Jesus during his ministry that's recorded in Luke 8 and also in the other
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:57.200]   Gospels and John 19 tells us that she was at the cross when Jesus was
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:03.200]   crucified so she's there she obviously was a true believer in what Jesus was
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:10.640]   doing and she was following him she was a follower but we don't see much of her
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:13.960]   her story really fades she fades into the background just like a background
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:21.680]   vocalist if you ever see a singing group or maybe you see some a favorite musician
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:27.240]   or artist on TV that you really enjoy most of especially on TV but even at a
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:31.760]   concert if there's screens that are showing them most of the shots are of
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:37.040]   the artist right the main person that's mostly you're gonna see and occasionally
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:40.640]   you'll see the background vocalist standing off to the side and they're
[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:45.440]   usually you know snapping and dancing sometimes doing their thing but you just
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:51.280]   see them for like a half second and then it goes back to the main person right
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:59.280]   and that's the role that Mary took she had this posture of fading into the
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:05.040]   background now from a human perspective that doesn't seem fair right because we
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:09.960]   say well you know the main singer may be a great singer but the background
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:13.680]   singers they can sing great too why is it fair that we're always looking at the
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:19.160]   main singer and from a human perspective that's that's actually true none of us
[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:24.720]   as humans should should necessarily be thrust into the limelight or celebrity
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:29.800]   that's that's not something that that God ordained for us because we're to
[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:33.480]   love and respect one another we're all made in God's image so we're not to
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:42.320]   Center ourselves but when we think about Jesus it's different right because Jesus
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:48.120]   wasn't just another man even though he was fully human he was also the Son of
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:54.920]   God and he was also here to do something that was so much bigger than anyone
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:19:00.360]   could comprehend Jesus actually reminded Mary of this in the wedding at Cana in
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:06.520]   John chapter 2 verse 4 when Mary comes to him and she's saying Jesus my friends
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:10.040]   are having a wedding they ran out of wine like what can you do and Jesus says
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:16.760]   hey it's not the right time yet he reminds her hey I there's something
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:20.920]   bigger going on here now Jesus demonstrates his love and care for her
[00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:25.000]   and that he goes ahead and does the miracle it turns the water to wine but
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.160]   he was reminding her in in verse 4 of chapter 2 there that he's saying there's
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:34.800]   a bigger picture here that you don't see and that was true of Jesus he really was
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:39.880]   supposed to be centered because he was the Son of God and he had come to redeem
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:43.960]   the souls of humanity and so everyone else was supposed to be in the
[00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:50.160]   background his purpose was so much bigger than Mary or anyone else he was
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:55.960]   fulfilling God's redemptive plan and he was doing something for the good of all
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:20:04.960]   of us and Mary recognized this and she was content to fade into the background
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:14.480]   we see it there in verse 35 in verse 34 Mary says how will this be in verse 35
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:19.480]   angels answers her and says the Holy Spirit will come upon you in the power
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:25.800]   of the Most High will overshadow you God's power will overshadow you you will
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:34.680]   be you will fade you will recede it's what that language is communicating and
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:37.320]   we need to apply that in our lives we need to have that posture as well
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:42.320]   remember Jesus taught us to pray in the Lord's Prayer in Matthew chapter 6 verse
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:46.560]   10 he taught us to pray your kingdom come your will be done on earth as it is
[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:50.320]   in heaven God made your purposes come to the
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:57.320]   forefront and may mine recede and fade John the Baptist said one of the John
[00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:00.000]   the Baptist said a lot of really profound stuff he didn't say there's not
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.240]   a lot recorded of what he said but it's all super profound but in John 330 we
[00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:13.200]   have this he said he must increase but I must decrease what a beautiful
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:18.280]   statement of what it means to be a disciple follower of Jesus is that Jesus
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:26.200]   gets bigger in people's view and I get smaller and Mary modeled that for us she
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:31.000]   faded into the background what about the fruit that comes out of that what fruit
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.600]   is produced when we fade into the background when we fade into the
[00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:41.040]   background God's narrative is centered what God is doing becomes the main focus
[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:47.760]   of the people around us but here's the cool thing is that we still get to see
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:55.120]   what's happening and we get to watch it up close I had a friend in another state
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:22:02.840]   that worked in a big music venue for a long time from like the 70s to I remember
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:05.880]   having a conversation with him in the early 2000s he was telling me about this
[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:10.200]   and he was talking about all the bands that came through the venue over the
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:15.200]   years and big-name bands that you know the biggest bands in North America would
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:21.120]   come through and he was there for all the shows but he wasn't in the audience
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:26.240]   he was on the stage now he was like a tech so he wasn't performing he was
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:30.680]   making sure everything else worked but he got to see every show from right up
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:34.440]   close and he got to see a different view than most people saw because he was
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:41.040]   backstage instead of in the audience and that's one of the perks of being in the
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:48.800]   background you're not visible but you get to be a part of something from a
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:55.640]   perspective that no one else sees and if you're willing to be in the background
[00:22:55.640 --> 00:23:01.120]   of God's work in your life yeah no one's gonna be showering you with praise and
[00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:06.520]   and your service to God might be unseen and unrecognized but you will get to see
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:12.680]   some miracles up close you'll get to see some amazing things happen from just a
[00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:19.400]   few feet away I can't even imagine what that was like for Mary for the disciples
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:25.000]   for the other followers of Jesus to see the things that Jesus did right there up
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:32.040]   close firsthand it's why their lives were radically transformed right because
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:36.160]   for them it wasn't something abstract it wasn't a story they heard from someone
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:41.440]   else they saw people get healed they saw dead people raised to life with their
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:47.080]   own eyes they were right there for it and that's one of the beautiful things
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:50.880]   about being willing to fade into the background as you get to be a part of
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:24:00.880]   that and this is true as a parent it's true for moms it's true for dads if you
[00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:05.320]   try to make it about yourself and center yourself in your kids life and what's
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:10.960]   going on you're gonna create all types of problems but if you'll fade into the
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:15.240]   background and say I'm gonna love this young person I'm gonna help them to
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:20.880]   follow Jesus I'm going to help them to walk into what God has for them you'll
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:25.520]   get to see some really neat things happen you'll be a firsthand witness to
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:30.000]   those things it's true in disciple making if you're trying to help someone
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.880]   else follow Jesus and you make it all about you and you're trying to
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:37.360]   communicate all the things that you know and you are really trying to make that
[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:43.840]   person follow you they're gonna be an unhealthy disciple but if you can fade
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:48.920]   into the background and help them learn to follow Jesus and you come alongside
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:53.720]   them and support them and encourage them and continually point them towards
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:25:01.360]   Christ you're gonna see a miracle of transformation in their life it's true
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:05.120]   when you think about praying for someone else interceding on someone else's
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:10.000]   behalf you're gonna pray stuff for someone if you love someone you say I'm
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   gonna pray for this person you're gonna pray things they're never gonna know
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.080]   about and no one else is ever gonna know about no one's gonna know that you were
[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:20.960]   praying for for them to come to know Jesus or that you were praying for them
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:25.560]   to experience blessing in their life or you were praying for them to be healed
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:31.000]   in some way they may never know no one else may ever know but when God answers
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.280]   that prayer you see the miracle and you get to see it up close because you were
[00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:43.080]   willing to be in the background and it's true in all forms of unseen service that
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:50.280]   honors God it's not easy to do something obscure that no one is noticing and to
[00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:54.460]   do it without being acknowledged and without being thanked but one of the
[00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:58.960]   beautiful rewards is that you'll get to see God do some powerful things and
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:07.400]   you'll see them up close and then we see here that Mary her unseen service this
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:13.640]   is a posture of trust and that's what we've got to learn if we're gonna be
[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:18.680]   willing to serve God in a way that doesn't center ourselves it's not about
[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:26.600]   us that's not focused on me then we've got to trust that God's Word God's truth
[00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:35.760]   God's way is best we see that here in her story verse 29 says but she was
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:39.280]   greatly troubled at the saying and tried to discern what sort of greediness
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:44.440]   might be verse 30 and the angel said to her do not be afraid Mary for you have
[00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:50.520]   found favor with God Gabriel comes and he begins to explain God's truth to her
[00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:56.280]   and her initial reaction is fear she's saying I don't get it this is terrifying
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:27:07.840]   I'm seeing an angel she's totally afraid but what happens by the time we come
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:13.480]   down to verse 37 and verse 38 Gabriel in verse 37 says for nothing will be
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:19.400]   impossible with God Gabriel saying hey I know you're scared he even says that in
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:24.400]   verse 30 do not be afraid for you found favor with God then he gives her the
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:28.080]   message and then at the end he says I know this is tough to believe but
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:34.120]   nothing's impossible with God God can do this and then verse 38 what does she say
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:39.160]   she says I'm the servant of the Lord let it be to me according to your word she's
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:46.880]   saying okay I'll I'll believe you I'll go with it I'll obey we go through that
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:54.000]   same process in our life too right when we initially encounter God's truth
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:03.640]   God's Word it challenges us sometimes it scares us right and we say God how could
[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:08.560]   that happen how could that be possible just like Mary was saying this is there's
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:12.760]   no way and I could I could have a child I'm not even married I've never been
[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:17.000]   with a man and there's no way that that child could be the Son of God in the
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:22.320]   side it's not even possible and God may bring you to a place in your life where
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:29.760]   he's he's asking you to do something and you said this is not possible you say
[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:34.240]   God you don't understand it's not possible for me to talk to that person
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:37.720]   at work about Jesus like I don't know how to do that I'm not good at that
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:41.800]   stuff and that person doesn't even really like me so it's not even
[00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:51.160]   possible say God it's not possible for me to find time in my week to serve you
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:54.840]   or to connect with this other person I know you've put that on my heart but
[00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:59.560]   it's just not possible I don't have the time God it's not possible for me to use
[00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:05.680]   my gifts in church or somewhere else to honor you because you know I'm I'm
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:10.680]   really shy and I'm uncomfortable doing that God it's not possible for me to
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:14.480]   make a big move in my life even though I know this is something that you're
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:22.440]   putting in front of me it's scary we all come to to God's truth and are
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:27.720]   challenged and frightened by at different points in our life just like
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:34.880]   Mary was but what bridges the gap for us is we have to trust God that's what
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:42.600]   Mary did it's not that between verse 30 and verse 38 she understood the whole
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:47.120]   process because she did she didn't say okay now I get it it all makes sense
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:53.360]   yeah no she still doesn't understand how it's gonna work because Gabriel told her
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:58.320]   she was gonna have a child a super that was gonna be supernaturally placed in
[00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:04.880]   her body and so she's saying I still don't understand any of this so verse
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:10.440]   38 is an expression of trust not an expression of oh I get it now I can go
[00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:14.240]   for it I'm comfortable with it she's not saying that she's saying okay I trust
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:25.480]   you it's a posture of trust and that's true for us as well we need to trust
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:29.560]   what are we trusting in we're trusting in God we're trusting in his love for us
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:36.760]   and his goodness as I said earlier God's only gonna allow things in our
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:41.560]   lives that are for our ultimate good because they bring him glory and because
[00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:47.040]   they're at work to benefit us even if we don't see the benefit in in the moment
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:52.240]   of those circumstances now that's hard to believe sometimes because we go
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:56.720]   through stuff we say I don't see any way this could be for my good so we bridge
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:31:02.040]   that gap with trust say God doesn't feel good doesn't look good doesn't smell
[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:07.520]   good right now but I'm gonna trust you that this is good that you're at work
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:11.440]   that you still love me that you're still good and that what you're doing in my
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:17.580]   life it's gonna bring you glory and it's gonna be best for me and when we are
[00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:25.080]   able to do that when we're able to trust in God's love we have peace that even
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:29.640]   our unseen service is valuable that's one of the tough things about unseen
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:32.920]   service it's one of the tough things about serving God and obeying in a way
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:36.360]   that no one sees because if you do something and everybody in the room says
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:42.800]   you did a great job and we're so grateful you did it you already feel
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:46.280]   great about that you you don't ever ask yourself well did I do a good job
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:52.680]   because you just heard affirmation from everybody right when you do something
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:57.000]   especially when you pour your heart into it you say I really want to honor God
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.960]   with this choice or with this ministry or I want to honor God by the way I'm
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:04.800]   caring for this person in my life and you pour your heart into it you do it
[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:08.520]   with all that you have and you use all the creativity and the wisdom and the
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:14.440]   energy you have to do that and then you walk away and no one says anything no
[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:21.920]   one says thanks no one says good job no one says that was a blessing to me then
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:26.800]   you do have those questions Wow was that just a waste of time why did I even do
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:35.000]   that why am I even here what what's the purpose of this but if we're trusting
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.880]   in God's love we have the peace that says yeah that that service was valuable
[00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:47.080]   even if it was unseen because God loves me he loves the people in my life he
[00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:51.240]   wouldn't call me to do this and pour my heart into it unless it mattered to him
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:56.960]   and if it matters to him that's all I need whether he uses in a big way or
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:08.720]   small way that's all I need and when we trust in God we see that God uses that
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:17.480]   unseen service in a way that's beyond what we can see or imagine Mary is a
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:22.720]   background figure in the story of Jesus but she's not forgotten she's not
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:32.640]   invisible here we are talking about her life 2,000 years later so her role was
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:37.480]   important she got to play that part in the grand narrative of redemption that
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:43.340]   we were talking about earlier I'm sure she had no idea in verse 38 when she
[00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:49.220]   said okay God let it be to me according to your will she had no idea what that
[00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:55.640]   meant she had no idea that Jesus was the Messiah she had no idea that God was
[00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:59.880]   going to use Jesus to bring people from every tribe and tongue and nation into
[00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:04.200]   relationship with him and to give them a pathway to heaven she had no idea that
[00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:10.720]   we would be sitting here today because of Jesus there's no way she could have
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:17.640]   imagined that but she obeyed she surrendered she trusted and that's true
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:24.400]   for us too especially in those areas of unseen service we have no idea how God
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:29.280]   wants to use that we have no idea the ripples that will go out from that or
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:35.320]   how God can use that to change someone else's life or to change someone else's
[00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:38.560]   life who is two or three people removed from the person in front of us that
[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:46.360]   we're struggling to love and so when we have that posture of trust and we say
[00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:51.160]   God I'm trusting you that your work is going forward that you're loving me that
[00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:55.360]   you're even in a difficult situation that you're doing this for my good and
[00:34:55.360 --> 00:35:00.960]   for your glory God can do something huge out of that so much bigger than we'll
[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:10.640]   ever know so that's my desire and prayer for us today now unseen services it's
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:16.200]   not easy it's not easy to be a mom wasn't easy for Mary to play the role
[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:21.960]   that she played it's not easy for any of us to serve God and in an obscure
[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:28.000]   anonymous way and honestly if you don't know Jesus it's impossible if you don't
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.280]   have relationship with God there's really no way you can truly love and
[00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:36.200]   serve someone else in the way that you should without getting some type of
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:40.720]   reward or getting something back so if you're sitting here today and you say
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:46.960]   this makes no sense to me it's impossible understand that you have to
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:51.440]   have relationship with God through Jesus Christ that's why Jesus came to the
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:56.480]   earth it's because we're all sinners were all broken and he through his life
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:36:00.920]   and then his death satisfied God's justice and God's holiness so that we
[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:05.000]   could have relationship with God if you're gonna try to love someone else
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.120]   this way without relationship to God it's not gonna work but if you do have
[00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:13.720]   relationship to God then God wants you to love and serve others in this way
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:22.000]   it's not easy but we're all called to it it can be painful at times it can mean
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.520]   pouring ourselves out pouring out our energy our resources our gifts in
[00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:32.400]   anonymity and no one might see it no one notices all that we're giving but if
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:36.960]   it's done in obedience to God and that's the the motive of our heart if we do
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:40.360]   these things if we have a posture of submission and surrender if we have a
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:45.640]   posture of fading into the background if we have a posture of trust then God can
[00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:49.160]   use it in an amazing and powerful way and that's what I want to encourage us
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:55.080]   with today I want to salute and commend all of the moms who who model this for
[00:36:55.080 --> 00:37:00.360]   us and who do it so well day in and day out I want to commend this example that
[00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:05.200]   we have in Mary and I want to challenge myself and all of us to live into this
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:11.600]   to be obedient to God even when no one's watching to do it for him to surrender
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:16.600]   submit to his will to let ourselves not be centered or platform but to fade into
[00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:22.840]   the background and then to trust that he's going to do something with it let's
[00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:28.560]   pray God we thank you for this example we thank you for moms that give us this
[00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:34.120]   example God I pray that we would be grateful and gracious today as we
[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:39.040]   connect with our moms and just encourage them and express gratitude for for the
[00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:44.440]   way that they loved us but God I pray that you would help us to grow in this
[00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:49.160]   every one of us help us to grow in serving you obedience to you surrender
[00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:57.040]   being willing to to fade and let you be the forefront of our lives God help us
[00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:05.080]   to grow and trusting you help us to be beautiful unseen reflections of who you
[00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:09.120]   are so that the world can see you and so the people can be drawn to that and be
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:13.720]   saved in Jesus name amen
[00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:17.080]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
