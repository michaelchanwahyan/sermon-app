[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480]   (soft music)
[00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.840]   - All right, let's turn to our Bible
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.160]   because this is one of the essence
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.400]   that we gather as the Church of God.
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.400]   And we are going through a new series on the Bible,
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.040]   back to basics.
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.920]   And we begin the series by this picture, right?
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.200]   This picture I show you last week is a tall building,
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.280]   it's a high rise building.
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:30.280]   And it recalls us how important the foundation
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.280]   of a building is.
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.200]   The taller the building,
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.200]   the deeper the foundation needs to be.
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.600]   And as you can see this diagram,
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.040]   the foundation goes all the way down, right?
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.360]   From the ground down through the soft soil,
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.440]   through the mud and all the way down to the bedrock,
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.760]   which does not move, right?
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.920]   So in order to have a strong building,
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.800]   in order to have a secure building,
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.600]   you have to build your foundation first, right?
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.200]   And the foundation is not seen, right?
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.280]   It's not visible most of the time,
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.260]   but it's important, right?
[00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.200]   Without it, the building will collapse, right?
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.000]   Without it, you cannot build a building taller and taller,
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.840]   right?
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.760]   And the same way for our spiritual life,
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.600]   the same way for our life in God,
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.680]   if we believe in the name of Jesus Christ,
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.960]   we accept Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior,
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.200]   we need to build a solid foundation for our life.
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.880]   And our relationship with God,
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.840]   hinge on our foundation.
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.000]   And we have to do it one day at a time
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.040]   and do it so one block at a time
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.960]   so that we have a solid foundation, right?
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.960]   So last week we talk about,
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.600]   we studied one of the Psalms in the Bible,
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.040]   Psalm 119, which is the longest chapter of the Bible,
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.600]   longest Psalm in the Bible.
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.240]   The Psalm talks about the importance and the influence,
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.960]   the power of the Word of God.
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.600]   And that's why we need the Word of God.
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.040]   So today as we begin,
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.080]   we will begin with the, what?
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.360]   Verse of the week, yes, right?
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.320]   Remember to take home last week
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.960]   is to spend at least 10 minutes of your day,
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.520]   the best time of your day,
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.560]   spend 10 minutes at least to read the Bible, right?
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.800]   Read the Word of God, right?
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.720]   Did you do that?
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.560]   Okay, I see one person nodding the head.
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.800]   Nodding the head, right?
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.680]   I know you've done it, yeah, I know you've done it.
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.360]   I believe in you, okay?
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.960]   Take at least 10 minutes to read the Word of God, right?
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.960]   Read the Bible and memorize the verse of the week.
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.360]   And this is the verse of last week, right?
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.600]   So let's do that together, all right?
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.040]   Psalm 119, 105, let's read it together.
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.520]   Your Word is the lamb to my feet and the light to my path.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.440]   Can you recite it?
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.720]   Yeah, 105, 119, 105, okay?
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.320]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.280]   Oh, okay, right?
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.040]   Okay, I practice it, all right.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.680]   So this is the verse of last week
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.240]   and I hope that you have it recited and memorized by heart.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.920]   And we put emphasis on the Word of God.
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.640]   As a church, I told you we are the people of the book, right?
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.760]   Of this wonderful book, of this sacred book
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.920]   that God has revealed to us.
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.720]   And today we'll continue to dig into the Word of God
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.320]   and I want you to, if you have a Bible,
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.440]   it's a print Bible or a Bible app in your phone,
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.160]   turn with me to the book of 2 Timothy.
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.320]   It's one of the books in the New Testament
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.240]   called 2 Timothy.
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.120]   Toward the end, if you search the table of contents,
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.320]   toward the end, it's called 2 Timothy.
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.240]   And there are two points from 2 Timothy chapter three.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.220]   And I wanna share with you,
[00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.560]   I wanna go through this wonderful chapter with you
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.880]   and the first half of the chapter
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.880]   from verses one to nine, chapter three of 2 Timothy
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.720]   talks about the dangers of neglecting the Word of God.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.720]   There are many dangers if we neglect the Word of God.
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.380]   And the second part of this chapter from verses 10 to 17
[00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.440]   talks about another big point,
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.400]   which is the benefits of learning the Word of God.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.160]   And because time is limited today
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.320]   and I will go through the first half,
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.880]   which is verses one to nine, the dangers,
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.160]   there are dangers of neglecting the Word of God.
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.260]   Ask questions, ask the church.
[00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.840]   Have you ever thought about it?
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.520]   If we don't have the Bible,
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.920]   if we don't dig deeper and deeper into the Bible,
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.400]   if we don't understand the Bible,
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.480]   if we don't know the Bible enough, right?
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:42.000]   If our knowledge of the Word of God is insufficient,
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.520]   inadequate, there are dangers there.
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.520]   And we turn to this book called Second Letter to Timothy
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.680]   or 2 Timothy.
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.680]   And we call this kind of books,
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.380]   with 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy and the book of Titus,
[00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:01.680]   there's three letters,
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.640]   there's three books in the New Testament.
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.880]   We call them pastoral letters, okay?
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:07.960]   Pastoral letters.
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.880]   And what it means is that these are letters
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.440]   sent by the apostle Paul.
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.840]   He is the last disciple and the least disciple,
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.440]   apostle of all, called by God to preach the gospel
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.280]   to the Gentiles.
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.080]   He's the last and the least apostle called by God.
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.800]   And Paul is called by God to be apostle,
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.920]   preaching the gospel to the Gentiles, the non-Jews.
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.240]   And Paul goes around in the Roman Empire of his day
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.000]   and plant many small churches.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.480]   And these small churches are being planted
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:44.000]   and being launched in different cities in the Roman world.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.560]   And these small churches are growing, right?
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.760]   Sometimes in the midst of, or many times
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.040]   in the midst of struggles and challenges.
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.480]   And from time to time, early Christians
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.900]   are actually suffering and they are being persecuted
[00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.340]   by the authorities.
[00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.360]   And there are crisis from without,
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.760]   and there's also crisis for these churches from within.
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.040]   Because there are some false teachers
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.660]   who come into the church community
[00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:17.360]   and spread a false gospel, false teachings.
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:22.000]   And Timothy is one of Paul's disciples,
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.900]   one of his mentees.
[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.560]   And Paul is kind of like a spiritual father to Timothy,
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.520]   and Timothy is kind of like a spiritual son to Paul.
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.720]   And under Paul's direction, Timothy is in charge
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.760]   of the home churches in Ephesus.
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.420]   Heard about this city name called Ephesus?
[00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.280]   It's a big city, right?
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.440]   Like Chicago.
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.080]   It's a metropolitan city in the Roman world.
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.720]   So Ephesus is a huge city, and you can imagine
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.580]   how difficult it is to pass through
[00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:58.580]   and to grow small churches in a huge city like Ephesus.
[00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.880]   In a big city, there are many, many different forces
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:06.120]   that counteract the church community.
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:11.120]   Cultural forces, economic pressure,
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.760]   religious forces, and spiritual forces.
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.480]   They all counteract the church and the gospel.
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:20.240]   And Paul writes letters to Timothy.
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.720]   In total, he wrote two letters.
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.760]   And to another disciple in another place called Titus.
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.440]   So Paul wrote two letters, at least two letters
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.480]   to Timothy, his disciple, his pastor student,
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:37.100]   to help him, help him to be encouraged
[00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.240]   as he passes the church.
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.620]   Because there are false teachers in the community,
[00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:46.620]   and these false teachers twist the truth and deceive many,
[00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:50.200]   especially those who are naive and uneducated or ill-equipped
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.760]   and these people are being led astray by false teachers,
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:58.160]   by cult leaders, or anyone who infiltrate into the church.
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:02.560]   And you can imagine how difficult that task is for Timothy.
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:05.240]   And Timothy has to teach, has to correct,
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.760]   has to grow the church at the same time,
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.560]   and deal with problems in the church
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:12.280]   and such an enormous mission.
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:15.520]   And being a spiritual father,
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.380]   Paul writes letters to Timothy.
[00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:20.720]   These are called pastoral letters
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:24.320]   because the tone in those letters are very personal.
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:28.520]   So as we can read some of the passages from these letters,
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.080]   you kind of find that it's kind of like
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:33.780]   a further theological training for Timothy.
[00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:36.280]   Already a pastor at Ephesus,
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.460]   trying to give him the equipment,
[00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:40.480]   trying to give him the knowledge,
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:45.180]   the courage to go on pastoring the churches.
[00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:48.800]   So in 1 and 2 Timothy, if you read them,
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.720]   scan through the content,
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:53.280]   Paul talks about the gospel of grace,
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.520]   sound teaching, the importance of sound teaching
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:59.880]   and theology and doctrines, which are so important.
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.820]   And because Timothy also has to raise up leaders
[00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:06.480]   among the communities,
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.080]   Paul also, in 1 and 2 Timothy,
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:12.800]   reminds Timothy the qualities
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.360]   and the qualifications for leaders,
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.440]   for elders, for deacons.
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:19.600]   And Paul, you know, but all in all,
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:23.560]   trying to encourage Timothy to be patient,
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:25.920]   to endure hardship.
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.680]   You know, it is hard to lead the church.
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.000]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.540]   It's not easy, right?
[00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:32.600]   It's not easy.
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:36.440]   It's one of the most challenging leadership assignments
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:39.240]   on earth, is leading the church.
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.040]   And now we come to 2 Timothy,
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.840]   which is the second letter Paul writes
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:46.080]   to his mentee, Timothy.
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.760]   We turn to chapter three, okay?
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.080]   If you have your Bible, turn to chapter three as well.
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.920]   Also, the scripture is on the screen.
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:56.200]   Chapter three, verse one.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.280]   You should know this, Timothy.
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:03.280]   Paul is addressing Timothy in a personal tone.
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:08.200]   Know this, Timothy, that in the last days,
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.880]   there will be very difficult times.
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.660]   For people will love only themselves and their money.
[00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:18.240]   They will be boastful, proud, scoffing at God,
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.560]   disobedient to their parents, ungrateful.
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:24.280]   They will consider nothing sacred.
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.840]   They will be unloving, unforgiving,
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:30.120]   and slander others with no self-control.
[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:33.440]   They will be cruel and hate what is good.
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.000]   They will betray their friends and be reckless,
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.360]   be puffed up with pride, love pleasure rather than God.
[00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:43.600]   They will act religious, but they will reject
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.780]   the power that make them godly.
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:50.240]   And Paul said to Timothy, "Stay away from these people.
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.360]   "Stay away from them."
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:57.160]   You know, the last days, what is the last days?
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:00.320]   In New Testament terms, in biblical terms,
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:03.820]   last days is the period between the first coming
[00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:08.140]   of Jesus Christ and the second coming of Jesus Christ.
[00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:11.280]   Christ came, Jesus came the first time,
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:14.760]   2,000 years ago, right?
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:19.320]   He was born God incarnate, and he lived the kingdom life
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.400]   in the midst of his disciples, in the midst of the people.
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:25.840]   2,000 years ago, he died on the cross in Jerusalem.
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:29.480]   He died on the cross and he was crucified, right?
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.960]   He was crucified, and he died for our sin,
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.800]   died for the sin of mankind.
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:38.240]   And on the third day, he rose again,
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:43.240]   and he was ascended to heaven, and he is king over all.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.720]   And that is the first coming, right?
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.600]   It has been detailed in many books
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.680]   and many passages in the New Testament.
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:52.960]   That's the first coming.
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:56.040]   And there's also the second coming, which is in the future,
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:57.240]   which lies in the future.
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.520]   Jesus will come back again
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:00.680]   because that's what Jesus said, right?
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:04.040]   That's what we are told in the Bible, in the word of God.
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.440]   And there's a second coming.
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:09.680]   Jesus can come any time, any moment, right?
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:12.240]   So the last days in New Testament terms
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:16.360]   is the period, I don't know how long, right?
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:19.640]   Between the first coming and the second coming.
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:20.720]   And that is the last day
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:23.920]   because this is the last period of human history
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:25.040]   in biblical terms.
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.120]   And that is the last day.
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:30.040]   And Paul is reminding Timothy in this period, right?
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:33.680]   And we are in this period, how people behave.
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:37.880]   And this last day, the time is critical
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.720]   because the last day is the period
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.640]   full of dangers, full of temptations,
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:49.240]   full of trials and suffering, right?
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:52.920]   And being Christian is not gonna make it easy.
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:56.200]   It is difficult, right?
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:13:01.200]   And we continue with this passage,
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:03.680]   verses six and following.
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:07.480]   He's talking about the ungodly people in the last days.
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:10.080]   And Paul said, "They are the kind
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:13.160]   "who work their way into people's homes."
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:14.480]   Why?
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.600]   Why do they infiltrate into people's homes?
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:20.320]   Well, as I told you, the early churches,
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:24.040]   they meet in homes, right?
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.680]   They meet in people's houses.
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.400]   They don't have the church building.
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:29.520]   You know, church is a community, it's a family.
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:32.640]   And they get together in different families, right?
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:35.400]   Whoever has a bigger living room,
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.560]   they gather at the living rooms.
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:41.480]   So, "They are the kind who work their way
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:43.960]   "into people's homes and win the confidence
[00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:46.600]   "of vulnerable women who are burdened
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:50.400]   "with the guilt of sin and controlled by various desires.
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:54.400]   "Such women are forever following new teachings,
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:57.120]   "but they are never able to understand the truth.
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:59.200]   "These teachers, these false teachers,
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:04.160]   "oppose the truth just as Jannate and Jambres oppose Moses.
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:07.800]   "They have depraved minds and can't defeat faith,
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:11.120]   "but they won't get away with this for long."
[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:14.280]   And Paul says, "Someday, everyone will recognize
[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:19.280]   "what fools they are, just as with Jannate and Jambres."
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:22.560]   It's a long passage, but listen up.
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.920]   How Paul described the people in the last day.
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:30.200]   The people love falsehood, and they hate truth.
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:33.720]   They hate people telling them the truth.
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.720]   The objective truth.
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:40.720]   And listen how the descriptions are being demonstrated.
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:43.680]   And they love themselves.
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:46.000]   These people love the money.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.920]   They resist the will of God.
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:51.040]   Or simply put, they're just proud, right?
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:52.560]   They're prideful.
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:53.880]   And look at the behaviors.
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:55.560]   They're trying to justify the behaviors
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:58.080]   in the name of God, even in the name of God, right?
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:02.720]   Act religious, talk religious, and talk religious,
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:06.400]   but they reject the authority of God, right?
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.280]   And Paul uses one of the examples
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:11.040]   known by many Jews of this day.
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:15.880]   Two men by the names of Jannate and Jambres,
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:18.480]   and these two men oppose Moses.
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:21.600]   Now, interestingly enough, you cannot find these two names
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.400]   in the Old Testament.
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.760]   You cannot find it in the book of Exodus.
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:29.920]   You can only find it in some hundred years before Jesus.
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:33.320]   So 200, 300 BC.
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:37.560]   At that time, the Jews,
[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:39.560]   because they were under different empires,
[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:42.160]   and the international language has changed,
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:46.840]   changed from the previous language to a new language
[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:49.360]   called Aramaic, right?
[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:51.920]   And you know the Bible, the Old Testament,
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:54.440]   was written in which language?
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:56.920]   Hebrew, right?
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:58.040]   Hebrew, by and large, Hebrew.
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:00.360]   There was some Aramaic in some chapters.
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.000]   But by and large, it's in Hebrew.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.600]   But in those days, some hundred years before Jesus,
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.840]   those Jews, when they gather together in synagogues,
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:11.880]   they wanna hear the word of God being preached.
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:15.800]   So the leader of the synagogue will read part of the passage
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:18.880]   from the Hebrew Bible, of course in Hebrew, right?
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:22.000]   And those Jews, because they are not very fluent
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.440]   in biblical Hebrew, and by that time,
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:27.440]   the international language was Aramaic,
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:31.840]   so many of them actually speak and hear Aramaic, right?
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:34.240]   So what do you do, right?
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:36.760]   The original language of the Old Testament,
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:39.320]   the Hebrew Bible, is Hebrew, right?
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:42.440]   And there's always a translator there, right?
[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:44.480]   Translator in the synagogue.
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:47.840]   And he's gonna translate from Hebrew to Aramaic
[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:50.720]   so that the people can understand the Bible,
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:52.080]   understand the word of God.
[00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:58.160]   So the paraphrase or the translation is called tagam, right?
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:01.320]   You see the word at the bottom of the screen?
[00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:02.800]   T-A-R-G-U-M.
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:03.760]   It's a Hebrew word.
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:06.160]   Simply means translation, right?
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:10.700]   Translation, translated from Hebrew to Aramaic.
[00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:14.680]   It's kind of Aramaic paraphrase of the Old Testament.
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.200]   When they come to the book of Exodus,
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:21.200]   when Moses was confronting the magicians of the Pharaoh,
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.000]   right, with the miracles of God,
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.040]   with the signs and wonders of God,
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:30.960]   and the Aramaic paraphrase, the tagam,
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:32.440]   add these two names,
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:37.960]   Jannaz and Jambres, to the story.
[00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:42.960]   So because the Jewish readers would know the story by heart,
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:47.800]   Paul is using this example to show that
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.360]   what people would do, the ungodly people,
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.480]   the false teacher would do in the last days.
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:55.600]   They're just like the ancient history.
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:58.320]   What had happened is that these two men,
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:00.640]   as we know Jewish audience,
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:05.640]   these two men opposed the authority of God through Moses.
[00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:08.960]   So what Paul is trying to get at
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:12.500]   is that there were false teachings being widespread
[00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:15.560]   in the early churches,
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:18.160]   and they were vulnerable to false teachings,
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:21.000]   especially the women.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   Now if you read this chapter or read this passage casually,
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:30.520]   you'll find it kind of uncomfortable, right?
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:32.700]   'Cause it seems like Paul doesn't have
[00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:35.780]   much good things to say about women, right?
[00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:40.780]   Women are being described as uneducated, naive, right?
[00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:44.000]   At first glance, Paul doesn't have much positive view
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.880]   on women, does he, right?
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:47.720]   But that's not true.
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:51.160]   You cannot read the passage out of the context, right?
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:54.320]   And you have to understand what happened in those days.
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:56.480]   2,000 years ago in the first century,
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:19:00.920]   women were especially vulnerable, right?
[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:03.320]   Because in those days,
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:07.280]   women didn't have the opportunity to get educated, right?
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:09.840]   And nowadays, it's totally different, right?
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:15.080]   Women are sometimes much more educated than men, right?
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.840]   So what Paul is getting at in his day
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:20.760]   is that there were women in home churches,
[00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.880]   they didn't have the privilege of education.
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:26.000]   So they were less educated, less equipped, right?
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.400]   Because they're less equipped,
[00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:32.400]   so they're easier to be deceived by false teachers, right?
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.880]   And that's what the false teachers
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:38.480]   or some of the false teachers
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:40.540]   trying to do infiltrate into the church
[00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:42.820]   and try to deceive people, right?
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:48.120]   So that they are more vulnerable to deception,
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:49.880]   and they follow those new teachings,
[00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:52.400]   so-called new teaching, and are deceived.
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:57.320]   And there's danger of neglecting the word of God, right?
[00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:02.280]   So we understand the context in Paul's day,
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:07.280]   and apply to our days,
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:10.340]   it's actually pretty similar.
[00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:13.240]   It's not talking about women being more vulnerable.
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:16.580]   Actually, Christians can be vulnerable
[00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:18.080]   if we are ill-equipped,
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:22.720]   if we are not equipped in the word of God,
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:25.960]   if we don't know much about the word of God, right?
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:29.520]   And there's a danger of neglecting the word of God.
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:32.760]   In Paul's days, in Timothy's day,
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:36.440]   as in today, right?
[00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:40.480]   If we do not dig deep into the word of God,
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:42.480]   if we don't know much about the Bible,
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:45.400]   if we don't know how to read the Bible,
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:49.060]   we are in danger of false teachers,
[00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:51.980]   or make ourselves more vulnerable
[00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:54.920]   to false, unbiblical teaching.
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:57.200]   And this is alarming, right?
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.600]   This is alarming.
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:03.600]   And this is why, you know, in our church,
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:06.780]   I put much emphasis on reading
[00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:10.340]   and understanding the Bible, right?
[00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:12.860]   Yes, we come to know God
[00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:15.620]   and restore our relationship with God,
[00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:17.560]   our creator, our father.
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:19.720]   That's important, that's the starting point, right?
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:21.080]   However, in the journey of faith,
[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:23.140]   we have to understand the Bible
[00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:27.540]   because the words in the Bible
[00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:31.680]   are God's authoritative words, right?
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:34.720]   Everything has to come under this standard.
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:37.840]   The highest standard for Christian living and doctrines
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:42.020]   is the Bible, is the word of God, is the scripture.
[00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:44.620]   And everything that we do,
[00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:47.380]   every tradition that we get to know,
[00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:48.660]   or we grow up with,
[00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:52.440]   has to come under the final standard,
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:54.200]   the highest standard, which is the word of God,
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:55.580]   which is the Bible.
[00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:57.540]   And that's why I put emphasis on reading
[00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:00.220]   and understanding the Bible, okay?
[00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:02.120]   This understanding the Bible
[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:06.600]   is not a monopoly for pastors or scholars.
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:10.340]   It's for every single Christian.
[00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:11.820]   Everyone who follow Jesus Christ
[00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:15.820]   has to understand and know the Bible.
[00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:21.900]   One of the top-notch Christian scholars or historians
[00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:26.020]   today is Mark Noll.
[00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:28.940]   Mark Noll used to teach in different institutes,
[00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:30.660]   including Whitten College.
[00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:33.200]   And you know where Whitten College is?
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:36.100]   Whitten College is about 40 minutes west of Chicago.
[00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:37.580]   It's very close to us.
[00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:40.660]   And he used to teach there for many, many years.
[00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:44.940]   His specialty is contemporary church history,
[00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:46.340]   American church history.
[00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:49.100]   And Mark Noll has written a book,
[00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:52.220]   and it was published in the mid '90s,
[00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:53.420]   and it's still in print.
[00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:59.780]   You know, renew edition, reprint edition.
[00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:01.740]   And it's this book.
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:04.360]   And the title of the book is
[00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:06.980]   "The Scandal of the Evangelical Mind."
[00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:10.400]   And if you pick up this book,
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:14.200]   and he will tell you what goes wrong
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:17.120]   in the evangelical faith in the church today.
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:20.920]   And the first sentence of the book is this sentence.
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:23.800]   The scandal of the evangelical mind
[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:26.860]   is that there's not much of an evangelical mind.
[00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:30.880]   Isn't that interesting, right?
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:33.800]   He's talking about one of the biggest problem that we have
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:37.580]   is that Christians are often anti-intellectual.
[00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:42.380]   There's a divorce somehow between our intellect,
[00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:47.380]   how we think, and our piety, our spirituality.
[00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:50.520]   And if you go to lay Christians,
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:53.340]   sometimes you have dialogues
[00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:55.840]   or a conversation about Christian faith.
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:24:00.440]   Mind, you know, how we think, the clarity of thinking,
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:03.880]   clarity of what we believe and how we practice
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:05.760]   is not in the picture.
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:10.760]   Spirituality is often defined as something lack of intellect
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:15.380]   or doesn't have anything to do with intellectual, right?
[00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:19.120]   Because we think, okay, those are for scholars, right?
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:21.440]   Those are lifeless stuff, right?
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:23.720]   And we don't need to deal with that, right?
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:26.280]   And Mark Noe is trying to diagnose
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:30.240]   what is going on in evangelical spirituality.
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:33.880]   Is that there's not much of a mind, right?
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:37.400]   We often approach spiritual truth
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:40.080]   or approach the Bible or approach our faith
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:45.080]   with kind of a anti-intellectual attitude, right?
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:49.000]   We don't care about how we analyze.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.960]   We don't care about how we articulate our faith,
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:57.320]   whether we can explain our faith with clarity.
[00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:01.820]   And sometimes spiritual is being defined as fanatic, right?
[00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:05.240]   Frenzy, right?
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:08.800]   As long as we feel high, as long as we feel good,
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.040]   and that's okay, right?
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:13.360]   And check the brain at the door, right?
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:16.500]   It seems like biblical faith is not grounded
[00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:19.220]   in any way with reason, right?
[00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:21.720]   But, you know, brothers and sisters,
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:24.280]   you need to understand in the Bible,
[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:29.180]   faith, biblical faith, is grounded in facts
[00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:31.420]   and in reasons, right?
[00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:32.480]   It is.
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:37.480]   It is grounded in facts and reasons in history, right?
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:41.960]   Biblical faith, true faith, is factually grounded.
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:45.240]   It's reasonably grounded, right?
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:46.960]   What you believe, what we believe,
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:49.480]   is not a lip of faith, right?
[00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:51.640]   You just close your eyes and jump over there, right?
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:54.120]   Oh, hopefully this is the right thing to believe in.
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:58.160]   No, the scripture tells us you can examine the facts
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:03.000]   and examine what the Bible says with a clear mind, right?
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.640]   And sometimes we just don't care.
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:07.920]   Brothers and sisters, we cannot do this.
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:10.960]   And Paul is asking Timothy to watch out
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:13.320]   because the false teachers is trying to infiltrate
[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:15.080]   into the church and spread false teachings
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:19.280]   because, you know, they just don't reason with you.
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:22.200]   I think this is really, really sad
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:23.720]   because many people know that the Bible
[00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:26.720]   is the best-selling book of all time, right?
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:27.840]   You know that?
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:31.200]   The Bible is the best-selling book of all time
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:34.420]   with five to seven billion copies printed
[00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:37.820]   over the last 1,500 years.
[00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:40.760]   Five to seven billion copies, right?
[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:44.200]   And the Bible has been translated into different languages,
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:49.200]   modern languages, Chinese, Korean, right?
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:54.160]   English, Spanish, and all sorts of different languages.
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:57.120]   It's been translated into 700-plus languages.
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:00.200]   And there are many, many translations to come, right?
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:01.560]   And I think this is really, really sad.
[00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:04.320]   This is really tragic that many people know this,
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:08.280]   but sometimes we don't put effort
[00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:10.440]   to understanding the Bible.
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:13.140]   It's more tragic that we have the Bible in our hands,
[00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:14.780]   in our phone, in our computer,
[00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:17.280]   but we don't even try to understand,
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:21.640]   try to handle the Word of God correctly, right?
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:24.520]   We're just being floppy in our study.
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:27.200]   We're just being floppy in our thinking.
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:30.600]   You know, therefore, I still believe,
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:32.040]   I still believe as a pastor,
[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:35.120]   I've been pastoring for 25-plus years.
[00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:38.240]   As a pastor, I still believe the importance
[00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:41.440]   of classical theological training,
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.600]   formal theological training.
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:45.680]   You gotta go through school,
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:48.080]   some sort of degree program,
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:50.000]   and you need to be equipped,
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.160]   and well-equipped to learn scripture
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:55.540]   so that you can teach, right?
[00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:58.860]   I still believe all the pastors,
[00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:01.480]   all those who are being called to ministry,
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:03.260]   especially teaching ministry,
[00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:06.760]   they have to go through some sort of formal training.
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:10.520]   Some sort of formal credentials are necessary.
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:13.560]   It's not anything goes.
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:17.200]   You have to go through some sort of formal credentials
[00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:22.200]   in order for you to be equipped to teach other people, right?
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:26.040]   You know, when I first studied in seminary,
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:33.040]   I started the Master of Divinity program in seminary,
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:37.560]   and you know, the toughest subject,
[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:42.560]   the most hated classes among our students,
[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:46.400]   you know what that is?
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:49.480]   It's original language, right?
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:51.600]   Hebrew and Greek, right?
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:53.840]   We just hated it, right?
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:56.340]   We have to memorize all these vocabularies
[00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:59.760]   and the paradigms and the grammatical rules, right?
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:01.440]   It's a new language, right?
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:06.440]   I don't even have time for my own native language, right?
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:08.020]   To polish my own language,
[00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:09.720]   but when we get into seminary,
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:14.280]   we have to study the word of God in its original language,
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:15.400]   right?
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:17.720]   Can you imagine, you know,
[00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:21.760]   someone studying like the greatest literature,
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:26.560]   the greatest English literature, Shakespeare, in Chinese,
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:28.460]   in translated version?
[00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:31.000]   No, you can't, right?
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.040]   You just can't translate that, right?
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:34.240]   So you have to understand,
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:37.920]   you have to know how the original language works, right?
[00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:39.640]   In order to have a better understanding.
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:42.440]   And so for seminary students, right?
[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:44.000]   Some sort of credential,
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.360]   some sort of formal training is needed.
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:50.840]   Even though you hate it, you just have to do it, right?
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:54.880]   At least you have some working knowledge of how it goes,
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:59.380]   the basics for the Hebrew and Greek or even Aramaic.
[00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:02.420]   And you know what the word seminary means?
[00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:05.800]   The word seminaries, we have Trinity Seminary,
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:07.760]   Evangelical Seminary.
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:09.640]   We have a Moody, right?
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:13.080]   Also seminary, you know, some other seminaries.
[00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:15.680]   You know what the word seminary means?
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:18.280]   (speaks in foreign language)
[00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:19.640]   Right?
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:21.800]   Yeah, in Chinese, (speaks in foreign language)
[00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:25.200]   Seminary is an old English word.
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:27.280]   It was first used in the 16th century.
[00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:30.400]   It comes from a Latin word, seminarium.
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:36.040]   Seminarium means plant a nursery,
[00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:37.160]   a seed plot.
[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:40.760]   Now you get it, what seminary is all about, right?
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:44.120]   It's a seed plot for those who are getting themselves
[00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:47.720]   ready to serve God, to teach the Word of God, right?
[00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:52.320]   They come to seminary, it's like a small farm
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:54.680]   to grow the seeds, right?
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:56.640]   Until they sprout and they're strong enough
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:58.960]   and they are ready to be transplanted
[00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:03.960]   and to help churches to walk in the Word of God, right?
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:06.720]   And I consider myself privileged to receive
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:11.120]   some theological training in North America, right?
[00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:12.960]   You know, in North America, all the schools,
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:17.320]   the Bible schools, seminaries, are actually
[00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:21.200]   some of the best schools in the world, right?
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:24.720]   In the best school in the world.
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:26.760]   I've been to three seminaries.
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:29.120]   Westminster Theological Seminary, they have two campuses,
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:31.720]   Philadelphia and San Diego, Southern California.
[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:33.760]   The second one I went to is Regent College
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.440]   in Vancouver, Canada.
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:38.840]   That's where I got the MDiv, Master of Divinity.
[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:43.160]   And then I started to serve and took a sabbatical
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:46.760]   after some years and I went to Wyndham College
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:49.720]   for my biblical archeology study.
[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:54.360]   And then now I'm in a program at Midwestern Seminary
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:55.640]   in Kansas City.
[00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:59.120]   And all of these seminaries, I have learned so much, right?
[00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:02.160]   I walk into the classroom, I'm humbled.
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:06.200]   Humbled by what I don't know, right?
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:10.560]   Humbled by the vastness of the Bible, right?
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:14.360]   The vastness of our God, how great our God is.
[00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:17.440]   And we will continue to learn it, right?
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:20.280]   And my first seminary, Westminster Theological Seminary,
[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:23.840]   one of their slogans is, "Whole counsel of God."
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:27.720]   You gotta know the whole counsel of God.
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:30.640]   The whole will of God being revealed in scripture.
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:33.640]   You cannot just cherry picking all the time.
[00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:36.080]   You have to be confronted by the whole Bible
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:39.800]   because the whole Bible reveals the whole counsel of God.
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:43.960]   The whole will of God, the demand of God,
[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:47.020]   the covenant of God, the word of God.
[00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:48.880]   You cannot cherry picking.
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.840]   It's not Whole Foods.
[00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:53.720]   You can come in and according to your desire,
[00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:55.840]   pick whatever you like.
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:57.680]   The Bible is not Whole Foods.
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:00.880]   You come to the Bible and you need to stand
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:05.840]   under this highest authority, this highest standard.
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:08.240]   You gotta be confronted by the Bible,
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:10.080]   your living, what you believe,
[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:11.800]   and how you practice the faith,
[00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:14.760]   and what your doctrines are, right?
[00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:16.720]   All the time, you need to come to the Bible.
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:18.120]   The Bible is like a mirror.
[00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:21.760]   It comes, you go into the mirror
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:25.520]   and check whether you look okay, right?
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:28.080]   And every time you open the Bible,
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:30.860]   every time you read the Bible,
[00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:33.240]   you are doing self-checking, right?
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:36.160]   Checking yourself, checking your Christian life,
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:38.240]   whether it's aligned with the will of God
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:40.900]   or it's misaligned in some areas.
[00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:42.880]   And with the spirit of repentance,
[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:46.300]   you come before God and ask God to help you
[00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:48.920]   to align your Christian living
[00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:50.520]   according to the will of God.
[00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:54.460]   And that's why I have to take home for you today, all right?
[00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:57.580]   So last week, I shared the first two points with you.
[00:33:57.580 --> 00:34:00.260]   Take at least 10 minutes a day to read the Bible, okay?
[00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:01.500]   Guys, okay?
[00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:04.000]   If you don't know, if you haven't started,
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.920]   I ask you to go to the book of Ephesians, all right?
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:11.200]   I know our men's group is going through the book of Ephesians
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:13.800]   and just read, there are six chapters, right?
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:16.960]   Six chapters in the letter of Ephesians
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:18.860]   and you can start with chapter one,
[00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:21.640]   chapter two the next day,
[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:23.920]   chapter three, chapter four, five, six,
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:25.440]   and then there are many things
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:28.080]   that you may not be able to understand at this point,
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:29.960]   but you can go back, right?
[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:31.680]   You can recycle it, right?
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:34.160]   Going back to the first chapter and try to meditate,
[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:36.340]   try to understand what is going on here.
[00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:38.320]   What is the argument?
[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:40.460]   What is the thesis of the chapter?
[00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:42.680]   What is the point, right?
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:44.560]   What is the point of what Paul is saying?
[00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:45.960]   You know, those are texts.
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:50.420]   Those are languages and you have to understand it.
[00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:52.560]   You have to comprehend the meaning.
[00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:55.000]   Or you can start with one of the gospel, as I told you,
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.400]   Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John.
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:58.800]   You can start with one chapter a day.
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.680]   Take 10 minutes a day, that's the whole point,
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:03.360]   to read the Bible and to think about it.
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:06.280]   And then memorize our verse of the week, okay?
[00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:08.560]   I have a next verse for you later, okay?
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:12.160]   So, you know, be ready.
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:14.200]   Number three, I wanna add this,
[00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:18.040]   to read some good books for spiritual growth, okay?
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:19.400]   Good books.
[00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:23.240]   I'm telling you, I wanna emphasize good books.
[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:26.520]   Because there are bad books out there, all right?
[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:29.280]   You know, I'm over 50 years old
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:32.320]   and I remember when I was young in faith,
[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:34.200]   when I was still a college student,
[00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:38.400]   and my home church didn't have a pastor,
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:40.000]   didn't have good teacher.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   So we have to go out to bookstores, Christian bookstores.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.580]   Yeah, can you find a Christian bookstore these days?
[00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:49.980]   No, right?
[00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:51.380]   They're all closed down, right?
[00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:52.320]   This is pretty sad, right?
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:54.400]   Everyone goes to Amazon, right?
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:57.280]   Everyone goes to eBooks, right?
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:00.680]   We went to the bookstores and find some books
[00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:04.160]   to help us and guide us in our Christian walk, right?
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:05.000]   And you go into the books,
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.040]   oh, there are different sections, different categories, right?
[00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:10.840]   And you go in and you try to find some good books
[00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:14.240]   and we didn't know what good books are, right?
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:16.120]   We just cannot judge, we cannot discern.
[00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:18.500]   So I bought quite a few books
[00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:20.620]   because I was yearning for the Word of God
[00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:23.060]   and I read all I can, right?
[00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:24.620]   And then years later I find that,
[00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:26.780]   oh, these books are actually bad
[00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:30.740]   and I didn't know better, right?
[00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:32.740]   Those are prosperity gospel.
[00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:33.580]   Those are, you know,
[00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:36.700]   truncated understanding of scripture, right?
[00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:39.780]   They're fun to read, they're enjoyable to read.
[00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:42.660]   However, they are not sound teaching,
[00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:44.580]   they are not solid teaching.
[00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:46.780]   And years later I find out, right?
[00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:48.140]   I feel so bad about myself
[00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:52.480]   and I have to kind of re-run away my own spiritual life
[00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:55.180]   by reading good books, getting to know good books.
[00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:57.460]   And brothers and sisters, you need to read,
[00:36:57.460 --> 00:37:00.060]   or you need to start the habit of reading.
[00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:03.380]   You need to start the habit of reading.
[00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:06.220]   Yeah, I know in our days and age,
[00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:08.100]   we don't like to read, right?
[00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:12.740]   We like YouTube or TikTok, right?
[00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:15.280]   All those sound bites, you know?
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:18.920]   We just like, you know, be entertained, right?
[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:22.580]   And passively receive information and misinformation.
[00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:24.480]   And we don't train ourself
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:28.360]   to be better people of discernment.
[00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:30.420]   You know, you need to train yourself how to think,
[00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:33.660]   how to analyze, how to articulate, right?
[00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:40.040]   And I wanna recommend you some of the good books
[00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:42.720]   for spiritual growth, right?
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:44.560]   Some of the good books, right?
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:47.480]   Again, there are many books out there, right?
[00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:50.200]   The worst thing today is that you go to Amazon,
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:53.520]   you search spiritual growth, you know,
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:58.120]   by and large you will come across some of the very, very,
[00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:01.480]   you know, truncated teaching, right?
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:05.800]   Because those books are often written by, you know,
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:09.200]   people who don't learn enough in the world.
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:11.360]   And they don't have the credential to do so,
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:13.400]   to write certain things.
[00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:16.280]   So, you know, we have to learn
[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:19.720]   and develop the habit of reading.
[00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:24.440]   Because reading is active learning, right?
[00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:29.440]   You read a passage, it's always actively engaging your mind.
[00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:31.800]   You try to understand those words
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:35.680]   and try to connect them together and find the thesis, right?
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:39.280]   Find what it says, right?
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:40.320]   You have to summarize it,
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:43.000]   you have to go back to the text and to digest it,
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.440]   to comprehend it, right?
[00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:46.240]   You have to have the habit of reading,
[00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:49.120]   ask questions in order for you to grow spiritually.
[00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:51.480]   There's no way you can get without reading.
[00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:54.680]   Some serious reading, some solid reading, right?
[00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:57.880]   I want to recommend you some of the books,
[00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:00.120]   some of the classics actually, very good books.
[00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:03.320]   Some of them are older, some of them are more recent.
[00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:06.800]   On the left you see the book written by J.I. Packer.
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:10.520]   He passed away not too long ago.
[00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:11.760]   He has this classic,
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:16.120]   "Over One Million Copies Sold," right?
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:17.000]   I'll be more thankful,
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.480]   it says, "Over One Million Copies Comprehended."
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:23.120]   Read and comprehend.
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:26.200]   However, it's a very good book, "Knowing God."
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:29.800]   It's a very simple, systematic, summary,
[00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:32.240]   explanation of the whole Christian faith.
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:35.000]   And it's been translated into different languages.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.760]   Chinese is one of them.
[00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:40.680]   And Tim Keller has written many, many good books.
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:43.280]   Yeah, Keller also passed away not too long ago
[00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:45.000]   and be with the Lord.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.440]   But one of the book is, "The Reason for God," right?
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:49.480]   "Believe in an Age of Skepticism."
[00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:53.000]   This is a book especially good
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.100]   for those who are seeking the faith.
[00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:56.400]   You want to understand the faith,
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:40:01.200]   you haven't made the commitment to believing in God,
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:04.880]   in Jesus, but this is a book for you, Tim Keller.
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:06.160]   "The Reason for God," right?
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:08.760]   He walks through you step by step,
[00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:13.040]   logically, reasonably, what our faith is all about, right?
[00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:15.280]   Why do we believe in God, right?
[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:16.960]   And on the right is,
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:18.560]   Anthony writes, "Simply Question,"
[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:22.080]   why Christian identity makes sense, right?
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:27.080]   And these are very, very solid resources to help us grow.
[00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:33.720]   Yeah, not too long ago, during Good Friday weekend,
[00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:36.640]   we invited Dr. Chloe Sun, right?
[00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:37.560]   Old Testament professor
[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:40.360]   from Fuller Theological Seminary in Southern California.
[00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:43.500]   She came and gave a workshop,
[00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:46.660]   a series of workshops on interpreting the Psalms
[00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:47.840]   and the Bible.
[00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:52.840]   And many of Chloe's books are actually helpful
[00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:55.680]   for us to understand the Word.
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:58.560]   And so, all I'm trying to encourage you
[00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:02.200]   is that take some moment to read the Bible
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:05.200]   and also find some good books for spiritual growth.
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:06.520]   We can go to our bookshelf
[00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:09.160]   and find some good books as well, right?
[00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:14.160]   And I wanna end today with this verse of the week, all right?
[00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:20.960]   Matthew chapter 22, verses 37 to 38.
[00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:24.520]   And this is what Jesus said.
[00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:27.560]   Jesus said, "You must love the Lord your God
[00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:31.600]   "with all your heart, all your soul, and all your mind."
[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:33.920]   And this is the first and greatest commandment.
[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:36.040]   Why did I pick this one?
[00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:40.160]   You must love the Lord your God with all your heart,
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:43.520]   all your soul, and all your mind.
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:48.000]   Your thinking is a way of worship.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.060]   Your thinking, your knowing God,
[00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:54.000]   is a way to draw closer to God.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.820]   It's not just by feeling, right?
[00:41:56.820 --> 00:42:00.700]   It's not just spiritual high, but with a cool head.
[00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:03.440]   You think in clarity.
[00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:05.460]   You think about the faith.
[00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:07.000]   You have a correct understanding,
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.640]   solid understanding of the Word.
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:10.400]   And that is the first and greatest commandment.
[00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:12.200]   Let's recite it together, all right?
[00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:16.040]   Matthew chapter 22, verses 37 to 38.
[00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:17.760]   "You must love the Lord your God
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:21.640]   "with all your heart and all your soul, and all your mind."
[00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:26.560]   And this is the first and greatest commandment, all right?
[00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:28.460]   Let's recite that this week.
[00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:29.660]   Let's all pray together.
[00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:32.460]   Father, we come before you.
[00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:36.520]   We give you thanks because you are the God who speaks,
[00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:38.900]   and you are the God of truth.
[00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:40.960]   And thank you for revealing your will
[00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:43.620]   and your whole counsel through scripture.
[00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:48.400]   Thank you for this book that we have.
[00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:50.360]   Thank you for the content that we have.
[00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:54.200]   It talks about you, God.
[00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:59.040]   It talks about how you deal with a sinful mankind,
[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:02.560]   how you love us, how you deal with this broken world.
[00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:05.200]   It talks about your heart.
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:11.720]   Help us to get to know you more, deeper and deeper,
[00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:13.640]   drawing closer to you.
[00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:15.880]   And I pray for the sisters and brothers here
[00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:19.780]   that we do make the effort of knowing you.
[00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:24.120]   And by knowing you, we experience joy and peace in you.
[00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:28.680]   Reading the word, reading your scripture,
[00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:32.340]   we come closer and closer to the heart of God.
[00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:35.800]   And I pray that you will bless us each day
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:39.400]   with some moments to meditate, to think about your word.
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:45.380]   And as we go reading, as we get to know our faith
[00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:50.380]   more and more, draw us closer so that we know you better.
[00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:54.500]   And thank you for being our God.
[00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:56.820]   That we can relate to you.
[00:43:56.820 --> 00:43:58.340]   We can call you friend.
[00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:00.340]   We can call you heavenly father.
[00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:04.480]   And thank you for the grace and for the peace that we have.
[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:09.620]   So may your spirit send us out with a spirit of truth
[00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:13.460]   to yearn for your truth, to get to know you.
[00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:16.460]   And may your church rise up and grow up
[00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:22.380]   with the foundation solid, grounded in your word.
[00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:23.940]   In Christ, I pray.
[00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:25.780]   (gentle piano music)
[00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:27.900]   Well, God bless you and I wanna see you next week.
[00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:31.020]   And hopefully you can stay a little bit
[00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:34.900]   and for table fellowship to enjoy the refreshment
[00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:35.940]   prepared by Kelly.
[00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:37.020]   Thank you, Kelly.
[00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:40.420]   And get to know one another and say hi to one another.
[00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:43.500]   (gentle piano music)
[00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:44.940]   (piano music)
