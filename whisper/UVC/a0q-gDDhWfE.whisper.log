[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   Thank you.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Well, it's a blessing and a pleasure
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.300]   to be speaking with you guys again today.
[00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.440]   So thank you all for allowing me to be here.
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.540]   Today is the 3rd of December,
[00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.540]   and so if you weren't aware,
[00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.720]   allow me to be the first one to tell you
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.080]   that it is officially Christmas season.
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.860]   Yes, it's the most wonderful time of the year.
[00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.220]   And when I was putting this together,
[00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.560]   I thought about singing that line,
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.400]   but nobody really wants that.
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.760]   Nobody wants to hear me sing.
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.460]   That wouldn't be good for anybody.
[00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.100]   But Christmas time, it's the time for Christmas trees,
[00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.200]   Christmas cookies, and Christmas decorations.
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.480]   It's a time to decorate houses, give gifts,
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.440]   wear matching pajamas,
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.740]   and one of my favorite parts of the Christmas season
[00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.980]   is that it's the only time of the year
[00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.080]   I can find eggnog at the grocery store.
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.960]   Are there any eggnog-like lovers in the audience
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.220]   by show of hands?
[00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.660]   Oh, only a couple?
[00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.160]   All right, that's fine.
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.260]   All right, I'll have to scratch the next five minutes
[00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.620]   of what I was gonna talk about.
[00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:05.860]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.700]   But something that's more important than eggnog,
[00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.140]   pajamas, cookies, is that this is the time of year
[00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.400]   we celebrate the birth of our Savior and Messiah,
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.540]   Jesus Christ.
[00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.480]   For many Christians, it's a time of Advent
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.280]   where we recognize and look back,
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.320]   celebrating the first coming of our Lord into this world,
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.860]   and we look forward in anticipation
[00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.220]   to His second coming into this world.
[00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.700]   So for many reasons, Christmas time
[00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.060]   should be a time of great cheer,
[00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.760]   a time of joy, and a time of hope.
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.200]   But unfortunately for many people, this isn't the case.
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.800]   For many people, the holiday season
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.300]   is actually a time of stress, a time of sadness.
[00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.220]   So I did a little looking into this,
[00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.620]   and in a recent study done by the National Alliance
[00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.120]   on Mental Illness, researchers found
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.880]   that three out of five Americans
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.200]   feel their mental health is negatively impacted
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.260]   during this Christmas season.
[00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.740]   Another study done by the American Psychological Association
[00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.260]   finds that 88% of people in America
[00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.840]   struggle with stress during the holidays.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.440]   And there were many other studies done,
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.580]   and maybe some of you, people you know,
[00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.840]   have experiences that lead us to this conclusion
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.640]   that for some people, the holidays
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.820]   are actually a very tough, difficult time.
[00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.920]   But I wanna talk a little about why is it.
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.420]   Why is it that during what is supposed to be
[00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.500]   the most wonderful time of the year,
[00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.920]   people seem to feel anything but wonderful?
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.300]   Why during this season, which is a time
[00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.700]   that should be full of good tidings of great joy,
[00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.640]   are there so many people who don't feel that joy,
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.440]   who don't feel that cheer, and don't have that hope?
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.880]   For some, this could be caused by financial concern,
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.580]   worrying about making ends meet
[00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.980]   while you're finding gifts for family and friends,
[00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.760]   while you plan for the year ahead.
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.680]   That could be a source of stress.
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.020]   For other people, it's a time of loneliness.
[00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.920]   The distance between us and our family and friends,
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.660]   it feels a little extra distant.
[00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.300]   It feels a little extra heavy
[00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.500]   when we're not together during the holidays.
[00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.400]   As you mentioned, the weather also plays a part
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.540]   in this kind of dampened mood.
[00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.580]   It gets colder, nights are longer, days are shorter.
[00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.220]   Here in Chicago, the sun doesn't shine past 4 p.m.
[00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.620]   And that's honestly a little bit depressing
[00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.660]   because it's only getting colder and darker from here.
[00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.380]   And for some people, the cold weather
[00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.920]   can bring about aches and pains,
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.260]   kind of sort of triggers this flare up,
[00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.900]   you know, of maybe arthritis or something in your body.
[00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.960]   So the cold and the darkness certainly has an effect
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.340]   on people's mental health.
[00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.000]   But while this holiday hopelessness
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.440]   can be caused by a number of varying factors,
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.740]   there's ultimately one reason behind it all,
[00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.740]   one source behind this lack of joy, peace, and hope.
[00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.520]   And it's sin, it's the reality that we live
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.460]   in a fallen world, a world stained by sin.
[00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.320]   Sin is the source of all human suffering,
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.100]   sadness, and sorrow.
[00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.760]   And this is the unfortunate reality
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.460]   that we all face on a daily basis.
[00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.360]   We live in a sin-stained world,
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.580]   and in this world, even the most beautiful things
[00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.500]   that should bring us the most joy and wonder
[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.980]   can be corrupted by sin.
[00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.020]   That's why it's no surprise to see that
[00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.540]   during a time of year that should be filled
[00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.260]   with joy, peace, and happiness,
[00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.780]   many are suffering.
[00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.960]   We see something beautiful corrupted by sin,
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.800]   pain instead of peace, strife instead of serenity,
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.000]   hopelessness instead of happiness.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Yet in the same way that we see this exchange
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.040]   of pain in the place of peace,
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.640]   something beautiful corrupted by sin,
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.940]   it's not just something that affects us.
[00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.120]   We can actually trace this pattern all the way back
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.080]   through the history of humankind to the beginning
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.380]   when we see that exchange take place.
[00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.120]   But in the same way that we can trace the problem,
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.620]   sin, back to the beginning,
[00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.900]   we can also find the solution to that problem
[00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.500]   from the very beginning.
[00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.000]   And so that's something that I wanna talk about today
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.540]   is how God from the very beginning
[00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.580]   has offered his people hope.
[00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.780]   And it was this hope, this promise of God
[00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.220]   that the people of God have looked to,
[00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.940]   have held onto for thousands of years,
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.240]   and it is this hope that has kept God's people
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.800]   even in the midst of great suffering, troubles, and trials.
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.480]   And so it's this very same hope that we can look to today,
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:57.700]   whether it's Christmas time,
[00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.540]   whether it's after Christmas time, in between,
[00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.280]   we look to this hope as a solution
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.440]   for our own sorrows and troubles.
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:09.420]   And so I wanna look together at Genesis chapter three.
[00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:10.660]   So we're gonna get into the text
[00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.620]   and I can stop just ranting.
[00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.500]   Well, actually, no, I'm gonna talk a little bit more
[00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:16.560]   then we'll get into the text
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.600]   because I wanna set the scene a little bit, right?
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.860]   I wanna give you guys some context
[00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.740]   for what is going on when we see here Genesis chapter three.
[00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.080]   So allow me to set the scene.
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.040]   So if you want, this is your thing,
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.940]   close your eyes, imagine it.
[00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:31.580]   You don't have to if you don't want to,
[00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.060]   but just picture it.
[00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.400]   There's total darkness, nothingness.
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.100]   The world is empty and blank.
[00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:39.700]   It's void of anything.
[00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.620]   And then a voice calls out into this nothingness,
[00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.900]   let there be light.
[00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.100]   And there was light.
[00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.700]   And then God creates the heavens and the earth.
[00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.380]   He puts all the galaxies, the solar systems,
[00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:55.620]   the stars in their place, the sun and the moon.
[00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:00.320]   He creates the earth and he takes all the water on the earth
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.620]   and he divides it and separates it and brings up the land.
[00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.080]   Well, then he plants seeds, trees,
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.860]   fruit bearing trees on the land.
[00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:12.340]   He fills the land with all kind of animal life, plant life.
[00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:16.140]   He fills the water with all kind of fish and wildlife.
[00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:19.860]   And you see God is building, designing step by step,
[00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.640]   day by day, this beautiful creation.
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.020]   And all of this creation that he made,
[00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:30.020]   that he powerfully, wisely, perfectly spoke into existence
[00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:32.840]   is doing something.
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:36.060]   The sun, the moon, the stars, the earth,
[00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.980]   the animals, the trees, the mountains,
[00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:42.140]   even the smallest grain of sand on the beach
[00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:45.700]   is declaring the glory of God.
[00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:46.980]   And we see all this happening,
[00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:50.140]   declaring the infinite glory of God as we go day one,
[00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:51.460]   day two, day three.
[00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:54.940]   And it's as if it's all leading up to a point, a climax,
[00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:59.940]   the pinnacle of creation on day six when God creates man.
[00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:04.780]   And so God takes from the earth the dirt and he forms a man.
[00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:07.640]   He forms him and designs him, the scripture says,
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.840]   and he breathes into him the breath of life.
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:14.260]   And in that we see something that God creates mankind
[00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.500]   in his own image.
[00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:19.080]   Nothing in all of creation can say that they are made
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:21.660]   or it is made in the image of God.
[00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:24.200]   But this one man is made in his image
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:27.140]   and all of his descendants made in the image of God.
[00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:31.060]   And so all of creation, all this perfection,
[00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:34.340]   all this beauty we just imagined, God gives to the man.
[00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:36.720]   And even amongst the perfect world,
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.800]   God sets aside a perfect garden
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.620]   and he places the man in the garden to keep it,
[00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:44.220]   to tend it, to live off of the fruit
[00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:46.460]   and all the bounty that God has given the man,
[00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.700]   everything he could possibly need.
[00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:51.980]   And then we see as the man is giving names
[00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:54.340]   to all the creatures, all the animals,
[00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:57.140]   he has a realization because when he,
[00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:01.180]   I'm imagining this, when he names the giraffe,
[00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:04.320]   he sees a daddy giraffe and a mommy giraffe.
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.980]   And he names a tiger, he sees the boy tiger
[00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.440]   and the girl tiger.
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.840]   Well, he realizes that all these animals
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:13.780]   have their pair and their mate, but I'm alone.
[00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:16.440]   That as good as these animals are,
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.780]   there's none that matches me,
[00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:19.540]   there's none that is perfect for me.
[00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.420]   I don't have a companion.
[00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:25.180]   And so God creates for him, he puts him to sleep
[00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:28.420]   and takes from his own side, his own flesh and bones
[00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:32.860]   and creates a perfect, suitable companion for this man.
[00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:35.920]   He creates the first woman and he gives her,
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.820]   like a husband giving his daughter in marriage,
[00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:41.060]   he brings her and gives her to the man.
[00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:43.180]   And the man sings out this praise,
[00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:45.100]   I think you could say it's the first psalm
[00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:47.020]   that we see in the scriptures when he thanks God
[00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:49.300]   and praises him for this woman he's given him,
[00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:52.300]   this helper, flesh of my flesh, bone of my bone.
[00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.740]   And we see that after this happens,
[00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:58.420]   it's almost as if God stops and he looks at the man
[00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:01.140]   and the woman and all the animals and all the trees
[00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:03.220]   and the plants and the waters and the stars
[00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:05.380]   and the sun and the moon, and he declares
[00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:07.780]   that it is very good.
[00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:11.860]   Absolute paradise, total perfection,
[00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:16.820]   no sin, no death, no pain, no toil, no suffering or sadness.
[00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:20.460]   In the garden of Eden, Adam and Eve had everything
[00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:23.560]   they could ever need and everything they could ever want.
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.760]   And this is where we begin chapter three.
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:29.440]   So I'll be reading from Genesis chapter three,
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:32.360]   verses one through 15, if you wanna follow along.
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:35.680]   Now the serpent was more crafty
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.400]   than any of the other beasts of the field
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:40.280]   that the Lord God had made.
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:44.040]   He said to the woman, did God actually say
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:47.240]   you shall not eat of any tree in the garden?
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.360]   And so I wanna stop a few places here
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.440]   as I read through this passage to point out
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:54.040]   some of these things that I think we can really
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.360]   gain a lot of wisdom from in seeing
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:59.160]   how did this first temptation take place?
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.640]   Because I believe that the tactics of the enemy
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:02.800]   have not really changed.
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.200]   There's nothing new under the sun.
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.680]   And so this form of temptation that we see
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:10.040]   come against the man and the woman and their response,
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.920]   we can experience those same things.
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.200]   And so we should learn from this.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:16.000]   And so the first thing we see, the very first temptation,
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.120]   this first inkling of sin entering the world,
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:22.560]   it is a questioning and a doubting the word of God.
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:26.480]   When the serpent says to Eve, did God actually say this?
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.560]   What he's doing is he's questioning,
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.160]   creating doubt within the woman's mind
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.880]   of whether or not God's word is trustworthy,
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:37.360]   whether or not God is credible and reliable or authoritative.
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.880]   Did he actually say that?
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:40.600]   Do you really have to follow that?
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.120]   Are you sure you heard that correctly?
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.080]   There's that seed of doubt.
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:46.680]   And the woman responds and rightly corrects him.
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:50.040]   And she says, we may eat of the fruit
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:52.480]   of the trees in the garden, but God said,
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.360]   you shall not eat of the fruit of the tree
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.120]   that is in the midst of the garden.
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:58.520]   Neither shall you touch it lest you die.
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:00.540]   And so two things we see in Eve's response
[00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:02.480]   that are a little curious is that
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.120]   when you look at the previous chapter,
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:06.240]   God never said they couldn't touch the fruit
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.440]   or touch the tree.
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:10.040]   Somehow Adam and Eve, I don't know if they misheard
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:12.240]   or added it maybe for their own protection,
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:15.040]   but they added something to what God had said.
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:18.280]   What's more, we see that Satan,
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:21.280]   and this is, I believe, still one of his tactics today.
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.880]   He flips what God says.
[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:27.100]   And so when we see God spoke to Adam that all the trees,
[00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:30.160]   all the fruit you can eat from, but not this one.
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:34.380]   What Satan does is he minimizes what God has given Adam
[00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:36.320]   and he maximizes that restriction.
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:40.040]   It says, did God say you couldn't eat from any tree?
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:42.740]   And so what Satan does is he wants the woman
[00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:46.080]   and the man to focus on the one thing God said
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.340]   wasn't for them that they shouldn't have.
[00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:51.820]   Instead of focusing on all that God had given them,
[00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:53.620]   I'm somebody who loves fruit.
[00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:55.740]   You can ask my wife, you can ask Rachel.
[00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:58.020]   I love fruit, I'm always looking for new fruit.
[00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:00.160]   There's so many fruit in the world,
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.460]   and they had all of it, and I can't believe it.
[00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:04.820]   They allow the devil to tempt them to only focus
[00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:07.060]   on that one tree they couldn't have.
[00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:10.180]   But as much as I have a hard time understanding
[00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:12.820]   why they would do that, we do the same thing.
[00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:16.540]   God has given us so much goodness in the world,
[00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:20.180]   and yet we're often tempted to focus on those things
[00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:23.400]   that we can't have because there's something in human pride
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:26.460]   that doesn't like God telling us what we can't do,
[00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:29.260]   what we can't say, what we can't have.
[00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:30.340]   We don't like that.
[00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:32.900]   And so instead of rejoicing and enjoying
[00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:35.820]   all the good things God has given us when we sin,
[00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:38.160]   we choose to instead enjoy the few things
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.300]   that God says, this isn't good for you.
[00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:42.660]   I don't want this for you, don't have that.
[00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:44.820]   And we rebel against God just as Adam and Eve did.
[00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:47.780]   And so my first thing is that we should learn from this.
[00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:49.500]   The first thing we can gain from this
[00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:51.920]   is to focus on the good God has given us,
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.100]   to overcome the temptation towards the bad
[00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:55.740]   that is not good for us.
[00:13:56.620 --> 00:14:01.340]   I'll continue from verse four.
[00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:02.980]   But the serpent said to the woman,
[00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:06.020]   you will not surely die, for God knows
[00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:08.500]   that when you eat of it, your eyes will be opened,
[00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:12.380]   and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.
[00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:15.500]   Again, further doubting, now outright denying.
[00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:18.160]   At first it started with questioning,
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.860]   did God really say that?
[00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:21.480]   To outright denying, that's not true.
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:23.660]   Okay, God said that, but it's not true.
[00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:27.060]   And I think today we should also be aware of
[00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:29.880]   and on guard against similar temptations
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:34.760]   to mistrust or outright deny the word of God,
[00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:37.200]   that he's graciously given us for our good.
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.820]   So the temptation comes in verse six,
[00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:43.260]   says that when the woman saw the tree was good for food,
[00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.660]   and that it was a delight to the eyes,
[00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:48.760]   and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise,
[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:50.520]   she took of its fruit and ate,
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:54.140]   and she also gave some to her husband who was with her,
[00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:55.220]   and he ate.
[00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:57.100]   Then the eyes of both were opened,
[00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:59.300]   and they knew that they were naked,
[00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.040]   and they sewed fig leaves together
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:03.380]   and made themselves loincloths.
[00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:07.140]   Adam and Eve had been naked from the beginning.
[00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:12.060]   Nothing new happened except this loss of innocence,
[00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:14.100]   where they realized they were naked.
[00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:15.460]   But the thing with that is that
[00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:17.100]   there was nothing wrong with nakedness.
[00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.660]   God had made them naked, and it was good.
[00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:20.940]   But we see what happens here
[00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:22.800]   when they took and ate of that fruit,
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.700]   their morality, their minds, their conscience was corrupted.
[00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:27.860]   They had lost their sense of innocence.
[00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:31.640]   And we see that entrance of sin,
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.960]   guilt, and shame into the world,
[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:36.220]   to the point they tried to cover themselves with leaves,
[00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:38.180]   which you'll see later in the chapter,
[00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:40.100]   it was not sufficient.
[00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:42.500]   That's another sermon that I could,
[00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.660]   there's so many sermons you can get from this passage,
[00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:46.100]   but just remember that.
[00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:48.920]   They tried to cover themselves, but it wasn't sufficient.
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:52.860]   So, verse eight.
[00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:54.700]   They heard the sound of the Lord God
[00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:56.980]   walking in the garden in the cool of the day,
[00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:58.820]   and the man and his wife hid themselves
[00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:00.700]   from the presence of the Lord God
[00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:02.340]   among the trees of the garden.
[00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:04.860]   But the Lord God called to the man and said to him,
[00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:06.460]   "Where are you?"
[00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:08.140]   Now, I wanna make a point here
[00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:10.300]   that when God asked this question,
[00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:13.140]   he wasn't asking questions the way we ask questions.
[00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:15.820]   We ask questions because we wanna learn something.
[00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:17.860]   There's some piece of knowledge we don't have,
[00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:19.640]   and we want to get it.
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:20.860]   That's not how it works with God.
[00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:22.940]   God already knows everything.
[00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:26.520]   There was never a time where God learned something,
[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.920]   because God already knows everything.
[00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.200]   So, when he asked Adam, "Where are you?"
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.960]   It wasn't because he didn't know where Adam was.
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:36.920]   It's because he wanted to prick the conscience of Adam,
[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:39.600]   so Adam would reflect, "What am I doing?
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.440]   "Where am I?
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:41.680]   "I'm hiding from God."
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:44.000]   Which doesn't even, how can you hide from the God
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.520]   who knows all things?
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:48.460]   Whose eyes are everywhere, who sees everything?
[00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:49.700]   That was the point of this question,
[00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:51.620]   was to prick Adam's conscience.
[00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:56.580]   And Adam says this, "I heard the sound of you in the garden,
[00:16:56.580 --> 00:17:00.940]   "and I was afraid, because I was naked and I hid myself."
[00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:02.100]   So Adam hid.
[00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:05.280]   He hid himself from God because of his guilt and shame,
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:06.420]   which we already know.
[00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:10.980]   I mentioned before, there's no logic in hiding from God.
[00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:12.780]   But we tend to do the same thing
[00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:15.060]   in a slightly different way,
[00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:16.620]   but it's the same thing at the heart of it,
[00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:20.100]   that when we sin against God and our conscience is pricked,
[00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:23.000]   we tend to feel that we ought to distance ourselves from God.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.520]   Maybe we feel like, "Whatever I did this weekend,
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:27.560]   "I know it wasn't right.
[00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:28.680]   "I shouldn't go to church.
[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:29.800]   "I can't fellowship.
[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:30.620]   "I'm too guilty.
[00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:33.000]   "I'm not right the way others are right."
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.320]   Or we feel like, "I can't pray right now.
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:36.220]   "I can't go to God.
[00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:38.460]   "He's angry with me, 'cause he knows what I just did,
[00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:39.800]   "what I just said."
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.180]   Or maybe, "How could I pick up the Bible
[00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:43.020]   "and read it right now?
[00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:43.840]   "I'm such a hypocrite.
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:45.160]   "I just sinned, I can't."
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:48.680]   And so our sin causes us to hide from God in a sense.
[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:49.920]   We turn from God.
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.300]   Well, on the flip side, how it should be is that
[00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:54.740]   when we sin, we ought to go to God,
[00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.520]   because he's the one who forgives us
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:58.880]   and cleanses us and makes us right.
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:01.280]   Sin should not separate us from God
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:02.980]   the way it did with Adam and Eve.
[00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:06.320]   We should go to God, confess our sins,
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.740]   and receive forgiveness and restoration.
[00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:10.480]   We're not gonna find that by hiding from God
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.200]   in many of the ways we try to.
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.100]   I'm gonna continue.
[00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:17.800]   Verse 11.
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:20.600]   God said, "Who told you that you were naked?
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.800]   "Have you eaten of the tree
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:25.720]   "of which I commanded you not to eat?"
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:27.280]   Now, this is an interesting part
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:29.240]   where we see something enter the world
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:31.600]   that we're also all still guilty of,
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:32.800]   called the blame game.
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:35.040]   Verse 12.
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:39.440]   "The man said, 'The woman you gave me to be with me.
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:41.440]   "She gave me the fruit of the tree, and I ate.'"
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:44.120]   So Adam not only puts the blame on the woman,
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:45.720]   well, she gave it to me,
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.560]   he also kind of puts the blame towards God,
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:50.160]   because it's the woman that you gave me.
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.720]   He's already pointing fingers.
[00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:54.000]   He's already passing the blame.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.160]   Then what does the woman say?
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.340]   "The Lord God said to the woman,
[00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:59.400]   "What is this that you have done?"
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:02.440]   The woman said, "The serpent deceived me, and I ate."
[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:04.700]   So we already see this lack of accountability
[00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:06.480]   and responsibility for sin.
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.720]   Instead of confessing and admitting guilt,
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:10.320]   it's, well, it's the woman's fault.
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:11.440]   Oh, it's the serpent's fault.
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:12.360]   Oh, God, it's your fault.
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:13.600]   You put us here.
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:16.600]   And we still struggle with that.
[00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:19.080]   It's difficult to take accountability when we sin.
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:22.240]   It's easier to think that, well, it's this person's fault.
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:23.880]   And, you know, no, I wasn't being rude.
[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:24.980]   They just took it the wrong way,
[00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:26.600]   and they shouldn't have started with me.
[00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:28.480]   You know, we kind of steal all these things
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:32.820]   that Adam and Eve did and stumbled with here.
[00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:34.800]   They're still stumbling blocks for us today.
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:37.640]   We can learn a lot from reading this and from studying it
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:40.580]   and comparing what they did to what we should do.
[00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:42.960]   Okay, but I'll continue.
[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:47.860]   The serpent deceived me, and I ate.
[00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:50.960]   I do want to note that after Adam and Eve sinned,
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:53.980]   it's important to see this, because in this next passage,
[00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:56.960]   we see the mercy of God, the justice of God,
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:58.320]   but also the mercy of God,
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:01.320]   because Adam and Eve had just been created by God
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:03.840]   from nothing, given everything.
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:05.500]   He gave them everything,
[00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:07.800]   and they immediately turned and rebelled
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:10.960]   and committed this heinous, high-handed sin
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:14.400]   against Almighty God, against their creator.
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:18.040]   And yet, God first turns to the serpent
[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:20.000]   and punishes the serpent,
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.260]   not the man and the woman who had sinned against him.
[00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:24.960]   So even in that, you see some of God's mercy.
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:28.160]   God could have just started over from that second
[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:31.280]   and created a new earth and a new Adam and a new Eve,
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:32.480]   but he was merciful.
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:36.140]   And the worst of this punishment is on the serpent.
[00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:39.220]   Verse 14, the Lord God said to the serpent,
[00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:40.820]   because you have done this,
[00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:43.500]   cursed are you above all livestock
[00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:45.540]   and above all beasts of the field.
[00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:47.060]   On your belly you shall go,
[00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:50.740]   and dust you shall eat all the days of your life.
[00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:53.780]   I will put enmity between you and the woman,
[00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:56.780]   and between your offspring and her offspring.
[00:20:56.780 --> 00:21:00.820]   He shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.
[00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:06.100]   So surely this was the darkest day in human history.
[00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:09.100]   It was the entrance of sin into the world,
[00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:11.480]   which at that time was a perfect world,
[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:14.140]   an untarnished, unblemished world.
[00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:15.420]   Paradise was lost.
[00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:18.820]   We went from perfection to corruption.
[00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:21.380]   Innocence exchanged for guilt and shame.
[00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:24.380]   Purity exchanged for sin.
[00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:26.700]   Hope exchanged for hopelessness.
[00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:29.700]   Life exchanged for death.
[00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:31.940]   And even as bleak at times,
[00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:34.500]   depressing the current state of the world may seem,
[00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:36.780]   when you see all the terrible things happening
[00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:38.860]   in our city, in our country,
[00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:40.900]   surely you see it around the globe.
[00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:42.540]   I can guarantee you,
[00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:45.600]   nothing we have today is as dark as it was on that day,
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:48.940]   when darkness first entered the world.
[00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:51.580]   But as is often said,
[00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:55.060]   it's always darkest before the dawn.
[00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:58.680]   You see, in the midst of this very darkness,
[00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:02.620]   we find the advent, the emergence of light,
[00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:04.620]   a dawn of hope,
[00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:08.380]   a promise given by God himself,
[00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:12.100]   in which his people have held onto for thousands of years,
[00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:15.060]   a promise of salvation, redemption,
[00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:17.940]   restoration, and justice for mankind.
[00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:22.860]   And we find this promise, ironically, in a curse.
[00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:26.220]   In verse 15, the Lord God said to the serpent,
[00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:27.680]   "Because you have done this,
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:30.620]   "cursed are you above all livestock
[00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:32.680]   "and above all beasts of the field.
[00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:33.960]   "On your belly you shall go,
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:36.960]   "and dust you shall eat all the days of your life,"
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:39.400]   which is almost a metaphor,
[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:43.760]   a picture of utter humiliation, lowliness, defeat.
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:48.360]   "I will put enmity," which is conflict, warfare,
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:50.440]   violence, "between you and the woman
[00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:53.080]   "and between your offspring and her offspring.
[00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:54.480]   "He shall bruise your head,
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:55.960]   "and you shall bruise his heel."
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:58.480]   So this is the curse that God gives to the serpent.
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:01.920]   But even in this curse, we find a promise
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:04.200]   when God says, interestingly,
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:07.200]   "I will put enmity between you and the woman,
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:10.240]   "between your offspring and her offspring.
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.440]   "He shall bruise your head."
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:15.320]   There's a pronoun there of an offspring of the woman.
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:18.060]   "He shall bruise your head,
[00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:19.480]   "and you shall bruise his heel."
[00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:21.960]   And so I wanna talk a little bit about that last part.
[00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:24.640]   He shall bruise your head, you shall bruise his heel.
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:28.440]   It's referring to the offspring or the seed of the woman.
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.320]   In Hebrew, this is the word zara.
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:33.760]   Its meaning is like an offspring, a descendant,
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.600]   a child, a literal seed.
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:39.080]   And in the Bible, when we see this word used in this way,
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:42.600]   it always refers to a man, the seed of Abraham,
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.320]   the seed of David.
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:45.480]   But in this one instance,
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:48.000]   of all the places I could find in the Bible,
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.160]   the seed describes a woman.
[00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:54.080]   And this is because the seed is in,
[00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:55.440]   and it comes from the man.
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:56.960]   It doesn't come from the woman.
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:58.800]   So it's curious that God would talk
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:00.760]   about the seed of a woman.
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:02.920]   This wouldn't really make sense normally,
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:05.440]   but I think this is significant.
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:06.600]   Because in this promise,
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:10.200]   the seed of the woman is referring to a certain someone.
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:12.280]   And if you can think of who it is,
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:13.840]   go ahead and just shout it out.
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:16.480]   Exactly, exactly.
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:18.880]   'Cause there's one person, one child,
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:20.600]   in all of human history,
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:23.320]   who was born without a human father.
[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:26.240]   So literally, Jesus, the Messiah,
[00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:27.440]   born of the Virgin Mary,
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:31.960]   could only be the seed of a woman.
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:34.460]   Jesus Christ, the Son of God,
[00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:37.040]   the seed of the woman,
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:39.440]   promised by God from the very beginning
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:41.240]   that he would be the one to bruise,
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:44.520]   to crush the head of the serpent.
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:47.800]   God says, "He will bruise your head,
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:49.160]   "you will bruise his heel."
[00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:50.720]   And so you can compare the two.
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:52.720]   To bruise someone's heel,
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:54.280]   it's like a snake bite to the back.
[00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:55.520]   You don't see it coming.
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:58.920]   It's kind of an underhanded, deceptive attack.
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:00.720]   But if a serpent were to come on the stage,
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:03.380]   and I don't know if we have snakes in Chicago.
[00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:04.320]   I know we have rats.
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:07.120]   Maybe if we had some more snakes, we'd have less rats.
[00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:09.900]   But if a snake came on stage and bit me in the heel,
[00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:12.360]   it would hurt, it would not be great,
[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:13.880]   but it wouldn't kill me.
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:15.440]   It's not a fatal blow.
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:19.840]   But if I turned around and stomped on that snake's head,
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:20.760]   that's it.
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:21.680]   It's a fatal blow.
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:23.080]   It's a death strike.
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:24.800]   A complete defeat for that snake.
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:27.800]   And so in that curse, there's also a promise
[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:32.600]   that this one figure, this male offspring of the woman,
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:35.360]   this savior, would be bruised on the heel,
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:37.700]   would suffer some temporary defeat.
[00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:42.360]   But in that defeat, he would ultimately defeat the serpent.
[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:44.680]   And so this passage right here is known
[00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:48.960]   as the Proto-Evangelium, which just means the first gospel.
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:52.400]   It is the first gospel message in all of the Bible.
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:55.920]   The first glimpse of hope, promise of redemption,
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:59.360]   fulfilled in Jesus Christ's death and resurrection.
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:03.120]   Because in death, Jesus was rejected and scorned
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:06.580]   by his own people, betrayed by them.
[00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:10.400]   Betrayed even by a disciple who he loved as a brother.
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:12.520]   On the way to the cross, he was abandoned
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:14.340]   by the rest of his disciples.
[00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:18.520]   In that crucifixion, in that rejection and abandonment,
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:22.440]   Jesus suffered the serpent's bite to the heel.
[00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:25.920]   Yet in his resurrection, he crushed the head of the serpent
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:30.480]   declaring victory over sin, death, and the grave.
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:34.200]   And so this was the hope, this savior figure to come,
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:37.120]   was the hope of Adam and Eve, that one of their descendants
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:39.560]   would one day crush the head of the serpent.
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:42.320]   That this figure, this messiah, the savior,
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:44.740]   would defeat Satan and rid humanity
[00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:47.200]   of his evil schemes once and for all.
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:49.900]   It is this savior who is the messiah of Israel,
[00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:51.920]   the one in which the people of Israel
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:53.760]   hoped in for thousands of years.
[00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:58.920]   The one whose birth we celebrate every year at Christmas.
[00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:02.000]   He is the one upon which all of our hopes rest.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.640]   All of God's people rest their hope in this one savior.
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:07.960]   He is the solution to all of our problems.
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:10.360]   The ones that, the sin problem that has plagued
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:14.220]   all of mankind throughout history and plagues us today.
[00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:18.020]   Our problem is sin, it's devastating effects on our bodies,
[00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:22.780]   our families, every aspect of our life is marred by sin.
[00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:27.460]   But just as it is written, she will give birth to a son
[00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:30.020]   and you shall call his name Jesus.
[00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:34.300]   For he will save his people from their sins.
[00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:36.940]   This is the hope that we must cling on to.
[00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:40.000]   The same hope that Adam and Eve, even after the fall,
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.380]   even after such a devastating loss of perfection,
[00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:45.140]   this was the hope they held to.
[00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:47.380]   The same hope we see throughout the scriptures.
[00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:50.420]   So many of God's faithful held on to this hope
[00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:53.140]   of a savior, of a redeemer.
[00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:56.200]   One example I wanna look at from the book of Job.
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:28:00.260]   A great example, Job was a man who lost nearly everything,
[00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:03.760]   who by worldly standards had nothing to live for.
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:07.100]   His possessions, gone, his children, dead,
[00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:10.940]   his own friends accused him of evil.
[00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:12.500]   His wife even asked him, you know,
[00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:16.300]   why don't you just curse God and die already?
[00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:18.860]   Yet in spite of all his suffering and anguish,
[00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:21.180]   Job could confidently declare this.
[00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:24.780]   I know that my redeemer lives and that in the end,
[00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:27.460]   he will stand on the earth.
[00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:29.920]   And after my skin has been destroyed,
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:32.620]   yet in my flesh, I will see God.
[00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:34.820]   I myself will see him with my own eyes,
[00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:38.740]   I and not another, how my heart yearns within me.
[00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:40.860]   You see, despite Job's sorrow and suffering,
[00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:45.820]   he was able to hold on to hope in God, his redeemer.
[00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:48.980]   And so I ask, can you, can we say with Job,
[00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:53.020]   I know my redeemer lives in the midst of our suffering,
[00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:55.140]   my redeemer lives.
[00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:57.460]   In the midst of frustration, difficulty,
[00:28:57.460 --> 00:28:59.740]   disappointment with family, with friends,
[00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:02.060]   my redeemer lives.
[00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:05.100]   In the midst of pain and anguish, physical ailment,
[00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:06.820]   my redeemer lives.
[00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:10.100]   When you lose a loved one, my redeemer lives.
[00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:12.900]   You see, that is our hope, that Jesus Christ,
[00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:16.580]   the seed of the woman, he lives, he's our hope.
[00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:18.680]   It's this very same hope,
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:21.260]   which has been held onto for millennia.
[00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:23.680]   The prophets all wrote of it, they spoke of this hope.
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:26.100]   Many people have waited for thousands of years
[00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:27.340]   for this hope.
[00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:30.020]   Now we have him, we have this hope.
[00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:33.300]   Yet unlike all the people of God that came before us,
[00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:35.560]   we don't have to wait and look forward to it.
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:37.880]   We look back to something that already happened.
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:40.520]   We know what happened, we have a confidence of it,
[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:42.880]   of the time that Jesus entered the world
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:46.640]   to live a perfectly righteous life that we never could.
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:49.080]   To suffer and die a painful, humiliating death
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:50.520]   that we never would.
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:53.920]   To bear the wrath of God that we deserved.
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:56.400]   To defeat sin, to defeat Satan.
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:59.400]   And we know that not only was he born in this world
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:02.560]   of the Virgin Mary, not only did he suffer
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:03.960]   and die under Pontius Pilate,
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:07.620]   not only was he buried dead for three days
[00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:10.780]   after three days, he rose again to life.
[00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:14.360]   And so we can say confidently, as Job said,
[00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:17.900]   I know my Redeemer lives.
[00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:21.480]   Not only is this a present reality that we look back to,
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:23.080]   that we commemorate yearly,
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:27.100]   we also have an even greater future hope that we hold onto.
[00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:30.180]   The second advent, the second coming of Jesus Christ
[00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:33.360]   into the world, the Messiah who will once and for all
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:35.100]   defeat the serpent.
[00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:38.780]   And when he comes back, he will raise all his believers
[00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:42.100]   who have fallen, he will raise us and give us a new body,
[00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:46.300]   uncorrupted by sin, new minds, unstained by evil.
[00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:49.700]   He will put the enemy under his feet
[00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:53.940]   and then put an end to sin and death and pain for all time.
[00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:57.340]   And he will give us eternity with God in a new heavens,
[00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:59.520]   new earth, a new place of perfection.
[00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:03.300]   And this is our joy, this is our peace, this is our hope.
[00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:07.500]   This is our solution to the problem of sin, shame and guilt,
[00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:10.620]   loneliness, hopelessness, depression, sickness,
[00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:14.220]   death, frustration, trouble, trial, tribulation.
[00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:16.500]   Jesus Christ is our hope.
[00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:20.380]   So during this Christmas season, we should be encouraged,
[00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:23.740]   encouraged by this hope of who he is, what he has done
[00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:25.900]   and what he will ultimately accomplish.
[00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:28.620]   Even in the midst of difficulties and troubles,
[00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:31.300]   we have a hope, we have something to hold onto
[00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:33.020]   that will keep us going.
[00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:35.340]   And therefore we should be encouraged
[00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:37.780]   and we should encourage one another.
[00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:38.980]   Look to a brother or sister,
[00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:41.660]   if you see someone around you, reach out.
[00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:44.860]   If they're struggling, so many of us are,
[00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:46.740]   offer them that same hope, remind them,
[00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:48.220]   encourage them with this hope.
[00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:52.060]   It's not just a hope that we have, we share with one another.
[00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:54.580]   There's a passage I wanna, I'll just mention it,
[00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:58.360]   I won't read it, but Ephesians chapter two, verse 12,
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:02.020]   Paul is reminding the brothers and sisters in Ephesus
[00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:04.740]   of the time before they were in Christ,
[00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:08.300]   when they were alienated from the household of God,
[00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:12.060]   they were strangers and in the world they had no hope.
[00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:13.820]   They were without God.
[00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:15.780]   And there's people like that today.
[00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:18.460]   And we once were like that with no hope in the world,
[00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:21.620]   with no ultimate solution or answer to all the troubles
[00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:22.980]   and pains of this world.
[00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:25.420]   But in Christ, we have that hope.
[00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:28.420]   And it's not just enough for us to hold onto the hope
[00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:30.540]   or to share it with our brothers and sisters,
[00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:32.240]   but we have to reach out to those in the world
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:35.620]   who are lost, stumbling in darkness, who don't have hope.
[00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:37.460]   Share that message of hope with them.
[00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:39.820]   I think Christmas time is a perfect time
[00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:42.140]   because it's already on everyone's mind.
[00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:44.060]   There's gonna be family meals,
[00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:46.580]   you might be sitting next to somebody in your own family
[00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:48.500]   who is lost and without hope.
[00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:51.380]   Share that hope with them, a coworker, a friend,
[00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:54.500]   a stranger on the bus or the train or whatever,
[00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:55.800]   share that hope with them.
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:57.160]   It's the perfect time.
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:00.520]   We have the hope that the world needs.
[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:03.260]   So as we approach our celebration of Christmas,
[00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:07.640]   of the advent of Messiah, Emmanuel, God with us,
[00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:10.460]   who as we heard earlier is the wonderful counselor,
[00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:13.860]   almighty God, everlasting father and prince of peace,
[00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:17.700]   the seed of the woman and the savior of mankind,
[00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:22.700]   let us draw close to him, hold onto him, find hope in him,
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:26.060]   and be as willing and as eager to share that hope
[00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:27.640]   with someone else.
[00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:29.860]   And so my prayer for all of us, for you guys,
[00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:32.540]   is the same as Paul's prayer for the Romans,
[00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:36.040]   when he says, "May the God of hope fill you
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:39.080]   "with all joy and peace in believing,
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:41.580]   "so that by the power of the Holy Spirit,
[00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:44.480]   "you may abound in hope."
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:45.320]   Let's pray.
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:50.540]   Heavenly Father, Lord God almighty, I thank you, Lord.
[00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:53.840]   We love you, we praise your precious and holy name.
[00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:56.200]   We thank you that even in the midst of a dark,
[00:33:56.200 --> 00:34:01.100]   sin-stained world full of evil and trouble and suffering,
[00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:04.100]   you have given forth a light in the midst of darkness,
[00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:07.140]   a light that we look to, a light that we have,
[00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:10.080]   that we hold onto, and God, I thank you for this light.
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:13.460]   I thank you for your love that we see in Jesus Christ.
[00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:15.840]   Help us, God, to be encouraged by this hope.
[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:20.080]   Help us to be strengthened and matured in our faith
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:22.800]   by this hope, and to be so filled with love
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:26.000]   for you and others that we take this hope to the world,
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.300]   who needs it more than anything, God.
[00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:30.560]   So that is my prayer today, that we would all be,
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:33.620]   not just hearers of your word, but doers who act,
[00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:37.960]   who take this message and apply it to our lives, God.
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:40.560]   Help us in this, I pray, for the glory
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:44.080]   and in the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ, amen.
