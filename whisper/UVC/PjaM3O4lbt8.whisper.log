[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.580]   Well, thank you, James, and thank you for leading us in worship.
[00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.300]   James and Annie really enjoyed that.
[00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.920]   And I'm excited to be here, always excited to be at Urban Voice
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.100]   and really enjoy being here with you all.
[00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.340]   Glad to be back again this morning.
[00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.060]   We're going to be looking in Acts chapter 11.
[00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.440]   So if you want to turn there
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.020]   in your Bible or in your Bible app, Acts chapter 11,
[00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:31.080]   we're going to be looking at verses 19 to 26 and looking at a special group
[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.700]   of believers in this passage and in our world.
[00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.800]   The modern world that we live in, a lot of times what we see
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.340]   is that our world really values and celebrates and craves
[00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.840]   things that make a lot of noise.
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.060]   We we get excited about recognition and praise and fame and celebrity.
[00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.920]   Big, big accomplishments.
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.600]   That's what's important to us.
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.980]   And our culture really values that we value chatter and things that go viral.
[00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.320]   Those are the things that we like.
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.520]   And a lot of times we value that even over content.
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.200]   And this kind of milieu, it's less important
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.120]   what is being done or said and more important how many people hear it or see it.
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.840]   We kind of end up prizing noise over quality a lot of times.
[00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.580]   And sometimes even the most foolish or ridiculous moments
[00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.960]   can be praised and seem important or special
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.040]   just if enough people see them or notice them if they get enough views.
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.080]   And it's not just noise.
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.140]   Our world also assigns value based upon quantity.
[00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.880]   We look at things that are small, someone who's doing something small
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.560]   with small numbers, and we think that that is not very important.
[00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.080]   We might think it's inferior or even useless at some times.
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.200]   We look at something big that's being done with big numbers,
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.660]   and we think that that's a big deal.
[00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.840]   And so a lot of these cultural voices are constantly telling us
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.500]   to only do big things, to go big or go home.
[00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.840]   We're we're told that we should only ever dream big dreams
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.140]   and we should only give our time to something if it's going to be noticed.
[00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.300]   And sometimes we feel like if we're not getting noticed,
[00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.220]   if people are not seeing what we're doing,
[00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.680]   if we're not being recognized, if we feel unseen,
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.100]   then we feel worthless.
[00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.560]   We feel like we're failing. We feel like we are losing.
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.760]   We feel like if we're not accomplishing something big
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.100]   and earth-shaking and revolutionary, then we're getting nowhere.
[00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.480]   And if no one knows our name or no one sees us, then we have no worth.
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.320]   And culture often tells us these things explicitly and implicitly.
[00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.920]   And these things give us the impression that
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.300]   living an ordinary life is at best, you know, kind of
[00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.600]   failing to be what you should be or could be,
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.980]   and at worst, maybe just foolish and not even a good idea.
[00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:05.020]   But the problem here is that we lose sight of the value
[00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.400]   of the ordinary, of ordinary life and of ordinary obedience to Jesus.
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.620]   A lot of times we've forgotten how much we need lives of everyday usefulness,
[00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.920]   and we're ignorant of how profoundly these lives really weave together
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.760]   the fabric of our society and our world and support everything that our world contains.
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.420]   And sadly, a lot of times this is just as true in the church
[00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.500]   as it is in culture outside of the church.
[00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.300]   In the church, a lot of times we've lost our vision
[00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.480]   of the beauty of ordinary faith and the beauty of ordinary life,
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.680]   the beauty of ordinary obedience to Jesus.
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.100]   And this scripture is important because it helps to refocus our perspective.
[00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.860]   The reality is that the Bible consistently throughout the scripture,
[00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:56.960]   it consistently affirms the value of an ordinary life, of obedience to God
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.780]   and how essential that is in the kingdom of God.
[00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.160]   And it elevates this to a place of prominence and says that it's important
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.960]   and it's valued by God.
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.340]   It's honoring to God himself.
[00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.160]   Some of the biggest things that have happened in the kingdom of God
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.360]   have always taken place through the lives of unseen, anonymous,
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.160]   ordinary followers of Jesus.
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.360]   And that's what this passage points us to.
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.580]   So let's read these verses together.
[00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:23.500]   We're going to read Acts 11, verses 19 to 26.
[00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.920]   Now, those who were scattered because of the persecution that arose over Stephen
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.260]   traveled as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch,
[00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.720]   speaking the word to no one except Jews.
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.940]   But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene,
[00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.140]   who on coming to Antioch spoke to the Hellenists also,
[00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:44.100]   preaching the Lord Jesus and the hand of the Lord was with them.
[00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.200]   And a great number who believe turned to the Lord.
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.280]   The report of this came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem,
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.360]   and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.620]   When he came and saw the grace of God, he was glad and he exhorted them all
[00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.040]   to remain faithful to the Lord with steadfast purpose,
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.080]   for he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith.
[00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.580]   And a great many people were added to the Lord.
[00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.900]   So Barnabas went to Tarshish to look for Saul.
[00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.900]   And when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch for a whole year.
[00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.500]   They met with the church and taught a great many people.
[00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.900]   And in Antioch, the disciples were first called Christians.
[00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:26.500]   Now, this passage is about some very ordinary believers.
[00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.620]   In fact, they're so ordinary that we are told basically nothing about them.
[00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.820]   There's no names. There's no genealogies.
[00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:39.220]   There's no educational background, no social information about these believers,
[00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.700]   no positions of rank within their culture or their society.
[00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.420]   They're they're simply referred to as some of them
[00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:51.900]   with that them being followers of Jesus, saying some of these followers of Jesus.
[00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:57.060]   Yet their nameless testimony speaks so powerfully of God's work
[00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.380]   in their lives and through their lives, God's work in their community.
[00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.900]   God does something huge and powerful in Antioch through this group of nameless
[00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:08.740]   believers. And their testimony speaks to us powerfully
[00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:13.820]   about the beauty of lives lived in ordinary, faithful obedience to Jesus.
[00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:18.140]   So as we consider this passage, first, I want us to think about three points
[00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:22.580]   of what ordinary faithfulness is, talk about what it is.
[00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:27.100]   And then we're going to think about four points of what it does in our life
[00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.820]   when we live it out, try to answer those two questions.
[00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:34.340]   What is ordinary faithfulness to Jesus and what does it do in our lives?
[00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.340]   So first, let's think about what it is.
[00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:37.900]   What is ordinary faithfulness?
[00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.780]   The first thing I want us to see is that ordinary faithfulness
[00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.740]   is quiet devotion to Jesus.
[00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:49.060]   It's it's devotion to Jesus and our relationship with him.
[00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.540]   Now, what is devotion to Jesus? What does that mean?
[00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.020]   What does that look like?
[00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.860]   Well, devotion is the manifestation in our actions of the love
[00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.380]   and focus of our hearts.
[00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.780]   For example, I love my wife
[00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:06.940]   who is here today with me,
[00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:10.980]   and I seek to manifest that love by acts of devotion.
[00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:15.020]   So I should devote my time and my attention to her.
[00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.100]   I should serve her. I should listen to her.
[00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.140]   I should sacrifice for her. I should prioritize her.
[00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:25.140]   I should prioritize our relationship by making time for her.
[00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:28.460]   I should commit to value what she values.
[00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:31.540]   The things that are important to her should become important to me.
[00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:35.500]   I should love those that she loves and care for what she cares for.
[00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.420]   I should even build my schedule and structure
[00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.540]   the rhythms of my life around her and our relationship.
[00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:48.740]   If I'm doing that, then it'll be clear to her that I'm devoted to her.
[00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:51.300]   It'll be clear to other people that I'm devoted to her.
[00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:55.500]   So that's just kind of a simple example
[00:07:55.500 --> 00:08:00.660]   of what devotion looks like that we all should be able to grab onto and understand.
[00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:02.900]   The same is true of our relationship to Jesus.
[00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:07.780]   Devotion to Jesus looks like giving him the best of our time and attention.
[00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:12.380]   It looks like spending frequent, consistent, undistracted time
[00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:17.140]   connecting with Jesus through God's word in prayer and in worship.
[00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:22.420]   It looks like prioritizing our relationship with Jesus over other things in our lives,
[00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:26.260]   listening to his voice, serving him with our whole heart,
[00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:30.540]   being willing to sacrifice and put away things in our life
[00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:33.180]   that are going to pull us away from him, pull us into sin
[00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:38.300]   and seeking to commit ourselves to value what he values.
[00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:41.620]   The things that are important to Jesus should be important to us.
[00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:46.060]   We should love the things that lift him up in our lives and draw us closer to him.
[00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:50.300]   And we should stay away from stuff that takes us away from Christ.
[00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:54.220]   And we should build our schedules and the rhythms of our life
[00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:59.020]   around connection to God, making sure that we have time to connect with God.
[00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:02.300]   That's devotion to Jesus.
[00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:06.020]   And the reason I call this ordinary faithfulness quiet
[00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:08.700]   devotion is not because it's silent or noiseless.
[00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:12.060]   There are times when our devotion may be full of loud worship,
[00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:15.940]   but I call it quiet because it should be done
[00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:20.060]   not for recognition, not to be seen by others.
[00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.180]   It's not done to be noticed.
[00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:24.340]   It's done out of love for Jesus.
[00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:28.020]   It's not performative faithfulness to make myself feel better
[00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:33.660]   or to gain acknowledgement from other human beings or even to earn favor from God.
[00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:38.540]   It is simply a faithful obedience
[00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:41.620]   and devotion that is motivated by love for Jesus.
[00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:46.300]   That's pretty easy to understand, but not always easy to do.
[00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:50.380]   It requires God's grace at work in my heart, requires the activity,
[00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:53.780]   the Holy Spirit in my life, and it requires commitment day in and day out.
[00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:56.860]   It requires ordinary faithfulness.
[00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:59.060]   The next thing that ordinary faithfulness is
[00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:02.340]   is quiet obedience to God's commands.
[00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:06.460]   Ordinary faithfulness is obeying the things that God has told us to do
[00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:09.340]   and seeking to live out the character that God has instructed us to live out.
[00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:11.380]   I'll give us another simple example.
[00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:13.940]   Think about the fruits of the spirit in Galatians five.
[00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:17.620]   You know, the list here, love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,
[00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:19.900]   faithfulness, generosity, self-control.
[00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:25.380]   Think about that list now and ask yourself, do we live out those character traits?
[00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:28.700]   Are those the types of things that characterize our relationships at home
[00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:33.300]   with our family or at work with our coworkers, our boss, in our community
[00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:35.900]   with with the people that live around us or in our church?
[00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:38.620]   Are those things that characterize our relationships?
[00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:43.540]   That's something that God has commanded us to do, to live out those values.
[00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:48.660]   Speaking of church, are we obeying God's commands to be part of church?
[00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:51.580]   Are we engaged with the community of the people of God?
[00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:55.180]   Are we involved in a way that is honest and transparent in that community?
[00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:59.020]   Are we opening ourselves up to relationship with other believers?
[00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:01.380]   Are we loving and depending on that community?
[00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:04.420]   These are things that God has instructed us to do.
[00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:06.900]   Are we loving God with all of our heart?
[00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:09.540]   Are we putting nothing else before him?
[00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:13.980]   Are we loving those around us as much as we love ourselves?
[00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:16.820]   Obviously, there are a lot more to God's commands than that.
[00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:20.300]   But but that's a great place to start with just some of the simple things
[00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:22.980]   that we know God has told us to do.
[00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:25.500]   That's what it means to obey God's commands.
[00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:25.860]   Are we?
[00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:30.940]   To love God with all of our hearts, to love our spouses, our children,
[00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.980]   our parents, our brothers and sisters, our neighbors, our family in the church,
[00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:39.140]   to give, to serve, to uplift, to care for, to be peacemakers, to love truth,
[00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:40.900]   to stay away from sin.
[00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:42.940]   These are things that God has commanded us.
[00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:45.740]   And scripture is full of instruction about the kind of lives
[00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:47.140]   that God wants us to live.
[00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:51.540]   And we should be seeking to live that way, to obey God, God's commands.
[00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:55.980]   And again, I call this obedience quiet, not because it's silence at silent.
[00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:59.620]   At times it may be bold, but it's quiet because it's obedience.
[00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:01.740]   That's motivated by love for Jesus.
[00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:03.620]   It's empowered by God's work in our lives.
[00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:05.540]   It's not about us or recognition.
[00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:08.940]   It's not something that we serve to be seen.
[00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:12.340]   It's not for an audience other than Jesus.
[00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:17.540]   And the honest truth is it's not even possible to live out that life of obedience
[00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:20.620]   to God's commands if God's not already at work in your heart,
[00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:22.820]   if you don't already have relationship with him.
[00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:26.700]   Because once again, it's easy to understand but hard to do.
[00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:29.300]   It requires God's grace to love others.
[00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:32.420]   It requires God's work to help us forgive.
[00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:34.140]   It requires the activity of the Holy Spirit.
[00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:38.060]   It requires commitment day in and day out and faithfulness.
[00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:42.900]   The other thing I want us to see about what ordinary faithfulness is,
[00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:46.100]   ordinary faithfulness is the proclamation of God's message.
[00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:51.900]   The things we've talked about so far about ordinary faithfulness are really
[00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:53.900]   attitudes and actions.
[00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:58.220]   But it's more than attitudes and actions, there's also a verbal component that we
[00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:00.500]   have a story to tell.
[00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:07.060]   And yes, our actions speak and they're essential to that story that our actions
[00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:12.260]   honor God, but we also have words to tell.
[00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:16.020]   The scripture is clear that we should pair our actions with words that describe
[00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:20.380]   and explain and communicate the good news of the gospel, the good news of hope,
[00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:24.260]   forgiveness, grace, and salvation through Christ.
[00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:28.300]   And we proclaim God's message as we share the grand redemptive narrative of the
[00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:33.420]   Bible, God's loving creation of the universe, the relationship between God and
[00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:38.220]   humans that's broken because of human sin, then God's loving rescue and
[00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:42.300]   restoration that God sends through his only son, Jesus, the free gift of
[00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:47.060]   salvation that comes by God's grace and through faith in Jesus, God's ongoing work
[00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:52.940]   of loving restoration and recreation that he's doing in our world, in the universe,
[00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:54.300]   through the coming of his kingdom.
[00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:55.820]   That's the story that we have to tell.
[00:13:55.820 --> 00:14:02.180]   We can tell that grand, the big picture story, the grand narrative of redemption.
[00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:05.580]   But we also get to proclaim this message as we share the redemptive narrative of
[00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:13.140]   God's work in our own lives, God's loving creation of me and the broken relationship
[00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:16.660]   between God and me because of my sin, God's rescue of me through Jesus,
[00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:21.180]   the ongoing work of restoration and recreation that God is doing in my life
[00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:24.020]   and in my heart and changing me.
[00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:27.500]   We all have a personal version of this narrative to tell.
[00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:31.380]   And as we tell these redemptive stories, whether it's the grand narrative or our
[00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:35.300]   personal narrative, even if we're just telling a little bit, even if we're just
[00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:40.060]   able to share a small piece of that story of what God's done in our life or a small
[00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:45.420]   piece of God's love for someone else, and even if it's just a snippet at a time,
[00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:50.940]   as we tell those to the people around us, we obey God by proclaiming the message
[00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:52.300]   he's given us.
[00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:53.700]   And that's what we see in this passage.
[00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:57.300]   These believers, these ordinary faithful believers, they were just talking to people
[00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:02.460]   and telling the story of God's love and redemption.
[00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:06.300]   So those are some of the things that ordinary faithfulness is in our lives.
[00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:11.100]   And I want us to think now about some of the things that ordinary faithfulness does.
[00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:16.780]   At first, we see that ordinary faithfulness points to the beauty of the gospel.
[00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:21.740]   Now, the followers of Jesus that are referred to in this passage,
[00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:24.380]   as we talked about earlier, they're ordinary, they're normal people,
[00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:27.220]   they're not wealthy or upper-class people.
[00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:30.980]   And we can assume this because verse 19 tells us they came to Antioch because they
[00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:33.100]   were fleeing the persecution in Jerusalem.
[00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:39.660]   And that's the persecution that started when Stephen was martyred and the people
[00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:44.100]   stoned him and Saul, who would later become Paul, was watching over their coats.
[00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:46.860]   That's story in Acts 8.3.
[00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:50.620]   So the people that are fleeing this persecution, if you think about any time
[00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:56.100]   of social upheaval or crisis, the refugees are usually the ones from the lowest rungs
[00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:58.060]   of the economic ladder, right?
[00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:02.660]   People with more wealth and status, they have more ways to kind of stay safe and
[00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:03.700]   to insulate themselves.
[00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:08.300]   But the people who don't are usually the poor people, the people who don't have
[00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:08.660]   as much.
[00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:10.580]   And so they're the ones who are forced to flee.
[00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:13.700]   So that's probably who these people in Antioch were.
[00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:17.980]   They were not the aristocrats from the church at Jerusalem that had to flee
[00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:19.500]   to Antioch.
[00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:24.380]   They were just normal families.
[00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:28.020]   And we know they were families because in Acts 8.3, it talks about the fact that Saul,
[00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:31.500]   when the persecution started, he was going house to house and dragging out men
[00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:32.620]   and women.
[00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:38.260]   So we know these were men, women, and families, just normal people who loved
[00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:39.700]   Jesus, who were living their lives.
[00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:42.820]   And because of this persecution, now they have to flee to another city,
[00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:44.420]   to Antioch.
[00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.260]   That's the picture we have here.
[00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:47.500]   They're not wealthy or powerful.
[00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:49.600]   They're not influential.
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:54.100]   They don't have status.
[00:16:54.100 --> 00:17:01.340]   And yet, God uses them in an amazingly powerful way.
[00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:09.260]   This passage tells us that God uses them to bring a great many people into the
[00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:10.980]   family of God.
[00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:16.060]   It tells us that the hand of the Lord was with them.
[00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:18.380]   God uses them to do something amazing and powerful.
[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:22.180]   So what's so amazing about these people?
[00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:23.660]   Were they amazing communicators?
[00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:26.180]   Were they really compelling in the way they shared the gospel?
[00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:28.980]   What was it about these people?
[00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:32.740]   Well, we know ultimately the answer to that is that God was at work,
[00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:34.140]   the Holy Spirit was at work in their lives.
[00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:35.860]   This was the work of God.
[00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:40.100]   But I think we can also see in this passage that a part of what was amazing
[00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:45.380]   about these people was they were living lives of faithful and beautiful and,
[00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:50.820]   yes, ordinary devotion to Jesus that aligned perfectly with the words that they
[00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:53.780]   were proclaiming.
[00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:58.260]   They weren't known for being important or great or viral.
[00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.100]   They weren't known for being influencers.
[00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:06.020]   They were just known for living these God-honoring lives of faithfulness and
[00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:09.300]   beauty and obedience to God.
[00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:15.620]   And we see this testimony reinforced throughout the history of the church.
[00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:21.220]   For every name that you might think of that's great in the history of the church,
[00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:26.580]   for every Martin Luther or Billy Graham or whatever name you might think of,
[00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:32.180]   there are hundreds of thousands of ordinary faithful believers who lived their
[00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:35.260]   lives, loved their families, loved their spouses, loved their children,
[00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:36.820]   served their neighbors.
[00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:41.900]   They helped the sick and helped the poor, and they told people the story of Jesus.
[00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:48.780]   And many of them even suffered in ways that we can't even really wrap our minds
[00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:53.100]   around, but we don't know their names.
[00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:58.900]   But their lives of ordinary faithfulness glorified God and brought people to God
[00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:00.300]   and brought people into the kingdom.
[00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:02.820]   That's the history of the church.
[00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:06.100]   That's the history of the church right now.
[00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:11.980]   The modern moment of the church, all of the growth and all the exciting things
[00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:16.700]   that God is doing are in places where you don't know the names of those people.
[00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:24.300]   There's not pastors in villages in China or in Africa or in the Middle East that
[00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:25.660]   most of us would know their names.
[00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:27.340]   They're not famous.
[00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:32.100]   And yet, they're living lives of faithful obedience to God, and God is using them to
[00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:34.100]   do amazing and powerful things.
[00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:44.300]   The goodness of the character of God that we read about throughout scripture was
[00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:47.660]   reflected in the lives of these followers of Jesus.
[00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:52.980]   Things like reconciliation, forgiveness, peace, the fruits of the spirit that we
[00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:57.540]   talked about a moment ago, the shalom and wholeness of living out the values of the
[00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:04.060]   kingdom of God, the manifestation of true agape love, something that our world is so
[00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:10.340]   hungry for, the wonder of being full of grace but also being full of truth and
[00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:15.980]   speaking the truth, obeying God's commands, living a life of righteousness
[00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:20.340]   before him, all these things are what define these ordinary believers.
[00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:23.020]   Their lives pointed to the beauty of the gospel.
[00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:26.580]   That's what ordinary faithfulness does, and that's just as true for us.
[00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:30.180]   This can still happen when we live a life of ordinary faithfulness.
[00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:33.940]   Our ordinary, everyday, faithful obedience to God points to the beauty of the gospel.
[00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:38.580]   It strips away all the noise of ourselves and our ambition, our pride,
[00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:43.340]   our branding, our mess, and it brings to the forefront the simple,
[00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:48.580]   beautiful things that make a life of following Jesus an incredible experience
[00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:53.540]   of both growth through difficult trials and also joyful rest in his strength and
[00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:55.260]   who he is.
[00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:58.740]   It points to the wonder of the good news of God's grace, the good news of the
[00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:00.700]   gospel, the good news of the love of God.
[00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:06.260]   Ordinary faithfulness points to the beauty of the gospel.
[00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:09.660]   Ordinary faithfulness also puts Jesus at the center.
[00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:12.860]   This is one of the coolest things about this passage to me.
[00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:16.420]   In verse 26, we see that the disciples were first called Christians in this
[00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:20.420]   Antioch church, and this statement is a little bit astonishing in itself.
[00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:22.740]   Why were they not called that before?
[00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:27.020]   But it tells us the defining characteristic of this movement taking place in Antioch
[00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:28.980]   was Jesus Christ.
[00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:31.180]   Isn't that cool?
[00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:37.260]   Jesus was the thing that outsiders noticed and remembered and gave credit to.
[00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:42.500]   That's because this work was a movement of God through ordinary believers.
[00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:46.580]   So there was no celebrity preacher they could name this movement after.
[00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:51.100]   There was no wealthy donor that was driving things that they could name this
[00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:51.860]   movement after.
[00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:55.700]   There was no local landmark that they wanted to name it after.
[00:21:55.700 --> 00:22:00.820]   There wasn't an affiliation to describe this group, no river or park or anything
[00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:01.740]   else.
[00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:07.300]   This wasn't called the Olive Tree Mission or the Broad Street Gathering.
[00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:12.540]   The only description that outsiders could think of to describe what was going on was
[00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:14.180]   Jesus.
[00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:18.460]   I think that's so cool and so powerful.
[00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:20.980]   And I think it's a challenge to us.
[00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:25.660]   What if our local churches left that kind of impression?
[00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:29.260]   Jesus was at the center of this church and he was at the center of this movement.
[00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:33.220]   And when people on the outside looked at it, Jesus was the only thing that they saw
[00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:34.740]   and God received the glory.
[00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:38.260]   And that's why they began to call these people Christians because they were named
[00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:40.620]   them after Jesus.
[00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:44.180]   This is what ordinary faithfulness does.
[00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:45.460]   It puts Jesus at the center.
[00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:47.700]   It lifts him up.
[00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:49.300]   And here's a reality that's hard.
[00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:51.960]   It's hard for me.
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:58.180]   If we are living a life of ordinary faithfulness, a lot of times we're going to feel small.
[00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:00.660]   We're going to feel unseen.
[00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:04.520]   But we have to learn to embrace this reality rather than fight against it.
[00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:09.140]   Because when we are made small, then God is made big in people's eyes.
[00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:12.620]   When we are obscured, then God is made obvious.
[00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:16.740]   And that's actually what we want.
[00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:21.220]   What a beautiful way to glorify God and put Jesus at the center by being faithful in those
[00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:25.520]   small, ordinary, obscure ways.
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:29.420]   And that's what it did in this passage.
[00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:34.780]   Next thing I want us to see is that ordinary faithfulness brings us purpose and peace and
[00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:35.780]   freedom.
[00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:38.460]   It brings something beautiful to us.
[00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:41.540]   Learning to embrace ordinary faithfulness gives us a healthy sense of purpose in our
[00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:42.540]   daily lives.
[00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:46.660]   You know, a lot of us, or at least me, maybe I'm just talking to myself here, but a lot
[00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:51.900]   of us awake each day both overwhelmed and underwhelmed with purpose.
[00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:54.260]   We're overwhelmed because we want to accomplish so much.
[00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:56.380]   We want to do such great things.
[00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:59.700]   We're pressured and crushed by the weight of all the stuff we have to do and how long
[00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:01.060]   our to-do list is.
[00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:04.840]   We know we want to make great strides and we want to have a lasting impact and we want
[00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:08.140]   to be impossibly productive and get so much stuff done.
[00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:12.340]   And, you know, we want to make astounding profits in whatever business endeavors we
[00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:13.340]   have.
[00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:14.340]   We want to give back to the community.
[00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:16.260]   And of course, we want to leave a legacy for others.
[00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:20.180]   There's so much that we want to do that it's just overwhelming.
[00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:24.660]   But at the same time, the relentless demands of our calendars also leave us underwhelmed
[00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:28.820]   because even though we have these lofty ambitions, our days are full of mundane tasks.
[00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:32.380]   And we have to do all these mundane things in our families, at work, around the house,
[00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:33.660]   in our communities.
[00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:37.500]   So we're underwhelmed because we feel like we spend so much time doing things that don't
[00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:40.940]   matter or maybe they're even useless.
[00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:45.700]   And we wonder if we're wasting our time or sometimes we wonder if we're wasting our lives.
[00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:52.140]   And living a life of ordinary faithfulness speaks to both of those emotional quagmires
[00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:54.540]   and gives us truth.
[00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:59.500]   First of all, living a life of ordinary faithfulness to God relieves the pressure of being overwhelmed
[00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:01.220]   by questions of purpose.
[00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:04.500]   We don't have to live our day with the weight of all that we must accomplish.
[00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:08.900]   We don't feel like we need to change the world and leave our mark in just 24 hours.
[00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:13.460]   We can live the day with a simple understanding of what is significant and important.
[00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:15.660]   Be devoted to Jesus today.
[00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:17.060]   Obey God's commands today.
[00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:18.100]   Live out his truth.
[00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:19.220]   Share his message.
[00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:21.420]   It's that simple.
[00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:25.820]   We can know that our purpose is actually modest and clear for today and for this week and
[00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:27.060]   for this year.
[00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:31.620]   And further, we can learn to rest in the truth that with the power of God at work in our
[00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:35.840]   life that purpose is actually attainable.
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:40.060]   By God's grace, we can actually be faithful in the small things that he's given us to
[00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:41.060]   do.
[00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:44.100]   And this day has purpose and it has value.
[00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:49.500]   And I don't have to feel rushed to accomplish everything at once because there is time for
[00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:50.660]   what's truly important.
[00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:56.580]   There is time for ordinary faithfulness to Jesus.
[00:25:56.580 --> 00:26:01.100]   And second, living a life of ordinary faithfulness imbues even the smallest aspects of my life
[00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:02.900]   with deep purpose.
[00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:07.780]   I'm reminded here of this brother Lawrence who was this medieval Christian monk and he
[00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:11.280]   wrote this classic called Practicing the Presence of God.
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:14.940]   And in it, he says that when he was doing his work in the kitchen, he had to work for
[00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:17.980]   decades in the kitchen peeling potatoes and doing these mundane things.
[00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:22.780]   It says that he having accustomed himself to do everything there for the love of God
[00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:26.820]   and with prayer upon all occasions for his grace to do his work well, he found everything
[00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:30.840]   easy during the 15 years that he had been employed there.
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:35.300]   So this man spent decades of his life peeling potatoes and doing menial kitchen tasks.
[00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:39.220]   But he found a way to see this work as honoring and pleasing to God and he found a way to
[00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:42.040]   connect with God while he did it.
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:48.540]   So he can peel potatoes with purpose and significance, then surely we can be faithful at our workplaces
[00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:52.660]   or in our homes and see it as honoring to God.
[00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:55.500]   We don't have to be underwhelmed by mundane tasks.
[00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:59.580]   We can find purpose in glorifying God even as we vacuum the house or finish up those
[00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:04.580]   reports for our boss or run errands or help a neighbor install a new thermostat.
[00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:09.540]   When we're preparing a meal or helping a classmate or cleaning a messy floor or even changing
[00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:14.540]   diapers, we can do those things as acts of devotion to Jesus because we love him and
[00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:16.560]   want to love others who he loves.
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:20.420]   We can do these things as acts of obedience because God commanded us to serve others and
[00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:22.020]   give to others and care for others.
[00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:27.220]   We can find purpose in even the smallest tasks in our lives.
[00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:29.960]   And embracing ordinary faithfulness can also give us peace.
[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:35.660]   You know, a lot of us grew up on Disney movies and so we heard a lot of things like if you
[00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:38.860]   can dream it, you can do it or there's no limit to what you can accomplish if you put
[00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:41.220]   your mind to it and work hard.
[00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:44.220]   Nothing wrong with those things, but sometimes those things, even though they were meant
[00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:50.420]   to boost our confidence and inspire us, they built into an expectation that we started
[00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:55.380]   to feel like we were actually supposed to change the world and change everything.
[00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:59.280]   Maybe we feel like we're supposed to start something really big, some big company that
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:04.340]   makes a lot of money or that changes everybody's lives or we feel like we should, you know,
[00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:08.300]   save the world, clean all the carbon out of the atmosphere and save all the animals everywhere.
[00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:11.320]   We feel like we've got to do so much.
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:13.300]   And even in the church, we feel this way.
[00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:16.500]   We feel like we need to embrace all the causes and support all the needs and right all the
[00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:19.860]   wrongs and sometimes we're frustrated because we haven't made more progress.
[00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:25.860]   Why haven't we fed all the hunger yet or whatever it is that we want to do?
[00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:30.100]   Those are good things and it's good to have big dreams and big ideas, but sometimes that
[00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:35.220]   becomes a pressure that begins to crush us.
[00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:42.340]   And if we're honest, that unspoken expectation can become very heavy, so heavy that we can't
[00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:43.340]   live up to it.
[00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:46.380]   And when we figure out we can't live up to it, a lot of times we're discouraged.
[00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:49.060]   It can damage our faith and cause us to despair.
[00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:54.180]   It can even cause us to give up on trying to make a difference or even give up on our
[00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:57.620]   faith and our trust in God.
[00:28:57.620 --> 00:29:01.380]   The reality is we were never supposed to change the world.
[00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:02.780]   Only God can do that.
[00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:05.820]   Only God can do the big things.
[00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:07.860]   We can't save anyone.
[00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:10.580]   We can't even change our own hearts.
[00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:11.580]   God is God.
[00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:15.100]   Jesus is the Savior of the world and we are not.
[00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:19.620]   And there's actually freedom in knowing that.
[00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:23.060]   Freedom as we get out from under the crushing burden of pressure and expectation that we're
[00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:27.020]   supposed to fix things, freedom as we understand that we're not responsible to do something
[00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:29.300]   that we never could have done in the first place.
[00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:30.780]   I can't do it.
[00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:35.500]   There's freedom in saying those words and in understanding that, that God created us
[00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:38.660]   with limitations and that's okay.
[00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:43.580]   But simply acknowledging our inadequacy isn't enough because it might lead us to despair
[00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:47.440]   if we don't also at the same time see God's power.
[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:49.940]   It's not just enough to see our weakness, we need to see God's strength.
[00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:52.540]   And when we do that, we find peace.
[00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:56.420]   Peace as we see that God can change us, he can change our world and he is at work to
[00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:58.140]   do both.
[00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:02.700]   Peace as we realize that by God's grace we can be used by him to take part in his global
[00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:08.500]   restoration project that is his kingdom and is accomplished through his church, through
[00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:10.020]   us.
[00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:15.020]   Yes, only God can do big things, but he can use his people doing small things to do a
[00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:16.020]   big thing.
[00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:17.060]   He can use us.
[00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:23.900]   Our actions matter and there's so much peace and freedom in knowing that.
[00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:29.420]   And then we see that ordinary faithfulness is fruitful beyond our imagination.
[00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:31.820]   What fruit comes out of this passage?
[00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:35.900]   It's more fruitful and healthy and impactful than anyone could have imagined.
[00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:38.980]   First the church at Antioch becomes the first multi-ethnic church.
[00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:42.120]   Before this the church was an assembly of Jewish believers.
[00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:46.300]   In Acts 13.1 we read the people who are part of the leadership of this church and it's
[00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:51.120]   a list of people from North Africa, from all over the Mediterranean, very different diverse
[00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:53.940]   backgrounds and diverse people groups.
[00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:57.300]   This church becomes the first multi-ethnic church.
[00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:02.820]   It's a major turning point in history, in Christian history to go from a Jewish background
[00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:05.900]   movement to a multi-ethnic background movement.
[00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:08.300]   God does something amazing through this church.
[00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:12.180]   But also this church becomes the main missionary sending church of the New Testament.
[00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:16.980]   If you go on through the book of Acts you see in Acts 13.2 and 3 the church at Antioch
[00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:21.180]   commissions Paul and Barnabas, prays over them and sends them out on the first missionary
[00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:22.700]   and church planning journey.
[00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:27.660]   In Acts 14.26 to 28 Paul and Barnabas come back to the Antioch church to give a report
[00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:29.780]   of what God did on this journey.
[00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:34.400]   In Acts 15.40 Paul and Silas are sent out again and commended by the Antioch church.
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:39.220]   In Acts 18.22 Paul once again returns from his church planning and strengthening journey
[00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:41.200]   and comes back to the church at Antioch.
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:46.220]   And these passages show that to Paul and to the Antioch believers themselves this church
[00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:49.020]   shared in the fruit of the missionary journeys.
[00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:53.900]   God used this church to be a part of planning churches in Philippi, Corinth, Thessalonica,
[00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:54.900]   Ephesus, Galatia.
[00:31:54.900 --> 00:32:01.340]   All these things we read about came out of the lives of these ordinary nameless unknown
[00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:03.180]   believers.
[00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:07.540]   They did something small in obedience to God and God used it to do something really, really
[00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:10.120]   big.
[00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:11.740]   So how do we respond to this passage?
[00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:14.920]   I think this passage is both a challenge and an encouragement to us.
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:20.380]   For some of us it's an encourage, it's a challenge maybe to reorient some of our priorities
[00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:26.520]   towards lives of devotion to Christ and obedience to God's commands and sharing his message
[00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:31.360]   and doing those simple and ordinary things that maybe we've been too busy to do or we've
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:35.340]   been too distracted or we've been focused on other things.
[00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:38.960]   Maybe we need to reorient towards those things.
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:43.040]   But for all of us I hope this passage is an encouragement, it's an encouragement as we
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:47.680]   deal with the day-to-day tasks of our lives and we find ourselves confronted with the
[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:51.920]   reality that our reach is shorter than our grasp, we're not able to accomplish all that
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:57.680]   we want to and we feel small and insignificant, we feel unseen in those moments, we're unsure
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:01.900]   if we're having lasting impact, sometimes we're afraid that we're failing or we're doing
[00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:04.140]   something futile.
[00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:08.820]   This passage assures us that if we're living a life of obedience to God we are not unseen.
[00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:10.600]   Our days are not futile.
[00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:14.800]   By God's grace we can accomplish more than we know and our contributions even though
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:20.360]   they may seem small, they're used by God to do something big in our world.
[00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:24.840]   God is powerful and great and good and he is at work and so if we'll live this life
[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:29.000]   of ordinary faithfulness to him he'll use it in a powerful way.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.760]   I want to close just by encouraging us to remember there's nothing wrong with dreaming
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:38.320]   big dreams or wanting to do something big for God or do something big in your life,
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:44.720]   that's fine and God might have that for you but here's the reality, living for Jesus is
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:49.640]   certainly a lot more than ordinary faithfulness but it is never less.
[00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:57.560]   No matter how much God has for you in your life it will never be more than that moment
[00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:59.480]   of devotion to him.
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:03.920]   Then it will never be more than that obedience to his commands and that sharing his message
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:05.120]   with other.
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:09.560]   It may turn into something really big, a lot more than ordinary faithfulness but it'll
[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:11.560]   never be less than that.
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:13.760]   Let's pray.
[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:17.200]   God thank you for the truth of your word, thank you for this passage and these believers
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:20.520]   and what a testimony they are to us.
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:24.080]   We don't know any of their names or their histories or their stories but you use them
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:26.040]   in such a powerful way.
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:30.360]   They were ordinary faithful people that just honored you with their lives and God I pray
[00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:35.000]   that that would be true of us, I pray it would be true of me.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.800]   That I would be devoted to you, that I would obey your commands, that I would share your
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:42.880]   message with others and that you would get all the glory for everything that you do in
[00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:43.880]   my heart and life.
[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:44.560]   In Jesus name.
