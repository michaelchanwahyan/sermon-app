1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
 Here we go.

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,480
 Mark, it is good to see you.

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,980
 Happy New Year to everyone.

4
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,560
 For those who are here, it is great to be back.

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,840
 For those who are online, it is great to be back.

6
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,860
 For those who are not familiar, my name is Tommy Lee.

7
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,160
 And I get a chance during the week, actually,

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,200
 when it's quiet here, my office is right here

9
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,480
 because we get a chance to share some space

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,580
 with Urban Voice and they have graciously,

11
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,400
 continuously allowed us to work here during the week.

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,200
 Born and raised here in the Chicago area,

13
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,280
 born in Bridgeport, born in Chinatown,

14
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,400
 and now I live right over on 35th in Indiana.

15
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,960
 And so a lot of times, I've been working

16
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,320
 on this series on Elijah.

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,000
 And so I wanna go through a passage

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,040
 that we looked at the last time I was here.

19
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,420
 I wanna at least close the loop and talk through

20
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,400
 some of the lessons that we learned.

21
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,560
 Then I wanna do one more at 1 Kings 19,

22
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,040
 and then we're done with the story of Elijah.

23
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,440
 And Elijah is this one guy who's really unimpressive.

24
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,800
 He's not someone who kinda, someone that you sit there,

25
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,360
 he's not David, he's not Solomon, he's not even Saul,

26
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,000
 he's not Peter, he's kinda rough around the edges.

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,360
 He comes from a rural area.

28
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:18,440
 Scripture calls him, he's this Tishbit from Tishbe

29
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,760
 in Gilead, as 1 Kings 17 tells us.

30
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:26,640
 He's this guy who just comes out of nowhere.

31
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,440
 And look, I mean, the author even tells us he's from Gilead

32
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,560
 because we don't even know what a Tishbit is.

33
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,280
 We don't even know what Tishbit is.

34
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,000
 We know it's somewhere in Gilead,

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,440
 and that's what 1 Kings 17 tells us.

36
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,960
 And so he comes out of nowhere in 1 Kings 17,

37
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,600
 and he gets a meeting with the king,

38
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,060
 King Ahab of the Northern Kingdom.

39
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,520
 As we talked about the last time I was here,

40
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,200
 and we looked at 1 Kings 17, post-Solomon,

41
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,920
 post-David, post-Saul, the kingdom of Israel

42
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,080
 was split into two parts.

43
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,520
 You had a northern part, northern kingdom,

44
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,940
 which was called Judah, and the southern part,

45
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,520
 which was called Israel.

46
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,260
 Israel was the site of the Babylonian invasions.

47
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:13,120
 That was where, when you look at Nehemiah, Ezra,

48
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,280
 that's where the story takes place.

49
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,840
 Our story with Elijah takes place actually

50
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,200
 right in the northern kingdom.

51
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,920
 And out of the northern kingdom,

52
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,920
 there's 19 kings who ruled for a long time post-Solomon.

53
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,440
 And scripture tells us all 19 kings

54
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,940
 were evil in the eyes of the Lord.

55
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,580
 None of them were good.

56
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,420
 All of them were bad.

57
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,440
 But the king that we're looking at today

58
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,520
 during the time of Elijah was King Ahab.

59
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,840
 He was the worst of the worst of all of the kings.

60
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,000
 But ironically, he actually was not the worst.

61
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,480
 His wife, Queen Jezebel, actually ends up

62
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,120
 being the villain of the story, as you will see,

63
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,080
 throughout 17, 18, and 19, the first kings.

64
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,080
 And so this guy, Elijah, this Tishbit the Tishbi in Gilead

65
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,720
 gets a meeting with King Ahab.

66
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,240
 How this real guy gets a meeting with the king,

67
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,560
 we don't know.

68
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,200
 But he shows up one day and he gets a meeting with the king

69
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,800
 and he tells them and the king this,

70
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,600
 "Neither dew nor rain except by my word."

71
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,400
 He predicts a drought.

72
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,620
 He says, "You will not have dew, you will not have rain,

73
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:33,160
 "and it'll last for three and a half years."

74
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,920
 And he tells them that my motivation is

75
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,040
 the God before whom I stand.

76
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,800
 That's why I'm doing all these things.

77
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:44,800
 I'm doing it on behalf of the God before whom I stand.

78
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,060
 And so from that point on, later on,

79
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,640
 once he says that to the king,

80
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,600
 he then ushers him over to Cherith.

81
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,480
 God says to him, "Go to Cherith."

82
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,920
 And he walks over to Cherith.

83
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,840
 And therefore, now he just doesn't,

84
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,120
 he lives there for at least a year

85
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,000
 or maybe a long number of months,

86
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,120
 not definitely, not a couple weeks,

87
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,840
 where scripture tells us he's fed by the ravens

88
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,720
 and he is drinking from the brook over in Cherith.

89
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,320
 Soon after, the brook dries up in Cherith,

90
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,760
 and God tells him, "I want you to go to Zarephath."

91
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,040
 And it's a hundred miles walking.

92
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,360
 By the way, it's the birthplace of Queen Jezebel,

93
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,640
 who is the villain and the queen of this entire story,

94
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,460
 married to Ahab.

95
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,680
 "Go, walk over to Zarephath,

96
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,560
 "and there you will find a widow."

97
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,520
 And he comes across this widow and she's picking up sticks.

98
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,560
 And this widow is picking up sticks and he approaches her,

99
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,240
 and she says to him, "Look, whatever you need,

100
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,760
 "I don't have anything.

101
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,200
 "I'm picking up sticks.

102
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,800
 "I have a little flour, a little oil.

103
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,460
 "I'm gonna mix it with water.

104
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,420
 "I'm gonna make some bread,

105
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,520
 "and then my son and I are gonna die.

106
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,540
 "And we're just gonna eat and die.

107
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,260
 "That's it, we have nothing.

108
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:59,240
 "So Lord, you made me walk a hundred miles

109
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,320
 "to Zarephath for this, yes?"

110
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,080
 The Lord knows where you are.

111
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,120
 The Lord knows what you need.

112
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,320
 The Lord knows where you're going.

113
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,460
 That's the key that Elijah had to learn.

114
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:19,520
 The God before whom I stand, that's my motivation.

115
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,400
 Go to Zarephath, go to Cherith, all of those things.

116
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,480
 We follow the Lord because one, he knows where we are,

117
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,420
 he knows what we need, and he knows where we're going.

118
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,840
 It doesn't go according to plan.

119
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,400
 It may not be where we wanna go.

120
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,120
 It may not be what we think that we need,

121
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,960
 but the Lord knows what we need,

122
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,520
 where we're going, and where we are.

123
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,760
 Later on, stories, his son dies and all that other stuff,

124
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,000
 and now there's a miracle that performs,

125
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,440
 and now today in 1 Kings 7, 18,

126
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,000
 which some of you guys who have been here have heard,

127
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,160
 and so we're gonna go through that story one more time,

128
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,580
 is the showdown and the battle at Mount Carmel.

129
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,240
 And so now it's been three and a half years.

130
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,120
 The drought is finally over.

131
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,880
 And 1 Kings 18 tells us,

132
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:18,320
 "After many days, the word of the Lord came to Elijah

133
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:22,220
 "in the third year, saying, 'Go, show yourself to Ahab,

134
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,800
 "'and I will send rain upon the earth.'"

135
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,800
 After three and a half years, go to Ahab, the drought is over.

136
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,060
 So Elijah went to show himself to Ahab.

137
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:37,440
 Now, the famine was very severe in Samaria.

138
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,480
 Samaria is the capital city of the northern kingdom

139
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,220
 where Ahab has his kingdom.

140
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:47,640
 The famine is very severe, the drought is very severe.

141
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:52,640
 It's been three and a half years of no water.

142
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,720
 And there later on, there's Obadiah,

143
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,200
 we don't have time to go through that,

144
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,560
 that's the chief of staff, his conversation, Obadiah.

145
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:04,560
 And so now he gets to Ahab and he proposes a challenge.

146
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,400
 Ahab, we're gonna meet at Mount Carmel.

147
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:15,160
 You bring all your prophets, Abau and Asherah.

148
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,020
 I will bring my God and we're gonna meet here

149
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,160
 and we're gonna call upon the name of the Lord

150
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,300
 and whoever, whatever happens, if the Lord brings fire,

151
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:29,400
 whichever God, whether it's Abau or my God brings fire,

152
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,260
 that is the true God, what do you think?

153
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,240
 Ahab says, I like this idea.

154
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:40,240
 You have one God, I have 450, let's do it.

155
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:46,240
 So they came together and they meet at Mount Carmel.

156
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,980
 450 prophets, Abau and Asherah shows up.

157
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:55,700
 Elijah shows up and all of Israel, because they're curious,

158
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,200
 they wanna know what happens.

159
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,000
 They all show up and here's what he says.

160
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,120
 So Ahab sent to all the people of Israel

161
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,060
 and gathered the prophets together at Mount Carmel.

162
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:13,040
 This is verse 20, chapter 18.

163
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,800
 And Elijah came near to all the people and said,

164
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,920
 "How long will you go limping

165
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,520
 "between two different opinions?

166
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,700
 "If the Lord is God, follow him.

167
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,820
 "But if Baal, then follow him."

168
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:33,720
 And the people did not answer him a word.

169
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:37,300
 The Israelites sat there and stood there.

170
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:40,440
 They had no response.

171
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,800
 They did not answer him a word.

172
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,520
 One of the things that we talked about,

173
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,360
 and there's two things that I wanted to touch base

174
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,960
 on the second part, is are we limping

175
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,980
 between two different opinions?

176
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,060
 As Christ followers, as Christians,

177
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:00,320
 are we limping through two different opinions?

178
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,580
 Let me give you two illustrations of what that means

179
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,940
 for us in our context.

180
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,000
 There's the first one, there's more the black

181
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,440
 and white version of it, right?

182
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,600
 In terms of limping between two different opinions.

183
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,380
 The first one is that we limp between following Christ

184
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,160
 and we limp between the world.

185
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,000
 It's black and white.

186
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,380
 We have one foot following Christ, we're all in.

187
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:24,920
 We're all in in terms of following Christ.

188
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:28,460
 But there's another part of our life

189
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:32,140
 where we're attracted by what the world offers.

190
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:37,020
 We're attracted by the power, the influence,

191
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:40,620
 the money, the wealth, the promises.

192
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,660
 We limp between following Christ

193
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,480
 and following what the world has to offer.

194
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,000
 Because that was Ahab and Jezebel's problem.

195
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,360
 They wanted the prosperity and fertility

196
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,060
 which they believed that Baal could offer them.

197
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:01,880
 For us as Christians, we want what the world has to offer

198
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,080
 because it's the money, the relationship,

199
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,940
 the job, the status that we believe

200
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,880
 is the answer to all of our problems.

201
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,080
 That's what Judas believed.

202
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,400
 That's why he turned on Jesus.

203
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,960
 That's what David believed

204
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,400
 and that's why he made the decisions

205
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,760
 when he saw Bathsheba, he wanted Bathsheba.

206
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,540
 That's what Solomon believed and all of his wisdom,

207
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,760
 the wisest of all the kings,

208
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:33,340
 fell into a lust of women

209
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:36,840
 because for him, that gave him fulfillment.

210
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:41,960
 But ultimately, did Judas find fulfillment?

211
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:45,720
 Ultimately, did David find fulfillment?

212
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,960
 Ultimately, did Solomon find fulfillment?

213
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,840
 The rich, young ruler, when Jesus would come in front of him,

214
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,800
 the rich, young ruler wanted to follow Jesus

215
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,480
 and Jesus says to him, "Sell everything and follow me."

216
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,020
 The rich, young ruler had a hard time.

217
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:08,880
 The black and white issue is that as Christ followers,

218
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,480
 we limp between two different opinions.

219
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,400
 We limp between the opinions of following Christ

220
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,800
 versus the opinion of what the world has to offer.

221
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,440
 Now, here's the one thing.

222
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,640
 And some of you guys are sitting here right now.

223
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,880
 So it's like my friend who I was texting

224
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,720
 and when I was originally did this sermon,

225
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,660
 this one friend texted me and she says,

226
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,720
 "You know, I have a hard time following

227
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,260
 "and giving up my life because I actually,

228
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,520
 "do I really wanna sell everything

229
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,400
 "and be poor all my life just to follow Christ?"

230
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,520
 I actually think sometimes people believe that.

231
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,680
 I believe that a lot of times with Christians,

232
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,160
 we sit here and we say, "Okay, following Christ

233
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,760
 "means I have to sell everything,

234
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,560
 "I have to be poor and give up everything."

235
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,920
 Is that what, no, no, no, no, no.

236
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,720
 I don't think that's really what God is trying to say.

237
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,080
 Being a Christian does not mean that you sit there

238
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,320
 and you sell everything and you become poor

239
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,360
 and you give up everything.

240
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,040
 For some of us who are sitting here,

241
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,160
 God has placed us in a position,

242
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,720
 whether it's your job, your gifts, or your creativity,

243
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:15,440
 all of those things, he has given you certain things.

244
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,120
 Some of you guys who are sitting here right now

245
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,160
 have the capability of making money.

246
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,000
 If God is giving you the skills and the gifts

247
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,500
 to make money, make money.

248
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,160
 If God has given you the skills to be a pharmacist,

249
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,120
 be the best pharmacist that you can.

250
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,560
 If God has given you the skills to be an engineer,

251
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,080
 be the best engineer that you possibly can.

252
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,780
 Whatever you do, thrive and be successful at it.

253
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,680
 That doesn't mean that you can't have vacations

254
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,400
 or have nice stuff and all that stuff.

255
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,820
 You know what it means to follow Christ?

256
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:55,460
 It's whose life do you belong to?

257
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:59,120
 That when you sit there and look at all your skills

258
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,120
 and all your gifts and all your money and all your time,

259
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,920
 whose life does it belong to?

260
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:13,520
 Do you sit there and just say, "A part of it is mine,"

261
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,240
 or, "Lord, here's my entire life.

262
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,040
 "Here's all my skills that you've given me.

263
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,440
 "Here's all my talents.

264
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,800
 "Here's everything I'm able to achieve

265
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,880
 "because of your name, and I lift it up to you."

266
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,260
 Whose life do you belong to?

267
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,880
 That's one aspect of wrestling

268
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,040
 between two different opinions.

269
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:34,960
 What's the other one?

270
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,040
 Here's another one that's kind of new,

271
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,520
 that's emerging as well, too,

272
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,220
 that I really wanna talk with,

273
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,860
 because I'm not sure, I bet you some of you guys here,

274
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:47,560
 especially living in the US and being in America,

275
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,680
 you probably see, it's this.

276
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:56,300
 We are disenchanted by the local church.

277
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,140
 We get frustrated by Christians.

278
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:02,780
 We get frustrated by what we see

279
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:06,680
 on behalf of the church in America and over the world.

280
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,400
 That has created a new phenomenon

281
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,700
 that we've started seeing in the last 10 years.

282
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,800
 Let me give you some examples of what I mean by that.

283
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,080
 And I wanna land on that.

284
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,480
 That's one of the reasons why I wanna spend

285
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,720
 some time on this.

286
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,140
 There's this whole aspect of limping

287
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:23,040
 between two different opinions, black and white.

288
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,620
 One way in the world, one way of following Christ,

289
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,940
 but there's another one where we're limped

290
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:31,000
 between two worlds, and it's a little more gray.

291
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,120
 What do I mean by that?

292
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,280
 Let me talk about this.

293
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,320
 It's this whole idea.

294
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,680
 I don't exactly like this word,

295
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,800
 but people have been using it,

296
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,280
 calling it the deconstruction of the Christian faith.

297
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,920
 Here's what we're beginning to see a lot.

298
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:49,920
 Church attendance over the last 10 years

299
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,600
 have continued to decline at a rapid rate.

300
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,600
 Here's some reasons.

301
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,060
 We're dissatisfied with many of our church options.

302
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:04,040
 I'm not, and this is not Urban Voice, please,

303
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,800
 but this is just a general church in America.

304
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,720
 People in America are frustrated

305
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,740
 by the behavior of church members.

306
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:15,720
 We don't know how to disagree anymore.

307
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,880
 We fight too much.

308
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,040
 In too many churches, the whole idea of proclamation

309
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,400
 refers to justice, politics play a role in it,

310
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,420
 everything like that.

311
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,480
 People are frustrated.

312
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,280
 People are frustrated with what they see

313
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,320
 and the behavior of different church members.

314
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,960
 People are frustrated because they feel like

315
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,880
 when they come to church, it's just a show.

316
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,920
 We sit there, we listen to music,

317
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,960
 and some of these guys just have all these different pizzazz

318
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:45,240
 and lights and smoke shows and all these different things.

319
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,200
 We feel like it's a show,

320
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,400
 and we're frustrated by what we see.

321
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,340
 More and more, you're hearing about

322
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,600
 the controversy of pastors,

323
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,960
 the things that they do,

324
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,760
 the things, times when they get in trouble.

325
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,560
 We're frustrated by how much that we read in the news

326
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,360
 about how bad pastors are.

327
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,440
 The church is intolerant and exclusionary to people

328
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,000
 who do not believe like them or act like them.

329
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,020
 The church in America is unwilling to engage

330
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,500
 in contemporary issues.

331
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,240
 We don't talk about the role of the church

332
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,280
 as dealing with migrants.

333
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:30,120
 We don't deal with church issues in dealing with racism.

334
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,200
 We do talk a lot about black, white.

335
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,120
 Sometimes we have a hard time with that.

336
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,240
 We don't talk about Asian hate

337
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,600
 a lot of times in many churches.

338
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,160
 Churches struggle with talking about LGBTQ.

339
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,520
 We don't talk about cultural issues in churches.

340
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:51,180
 There is an overemphasis on political and social agendas.

341
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,920
 There's many belief that if you're a Christian,

342
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,560
 you have to be a Republican.

343
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,800
 You can't be a Democrat.

344
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,240
 Democrats disagree with all of these things.

345
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,220
 And people may say,

346
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:03,160
 "Hey man, it's been really developing

347
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,760
 and building up since COVID."

348
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,720
 No, no, it's been building up for over 10 years.

349
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:12,240
 Back in the early 80s and 90s,

350
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,600
 a few churches, a few pastors in the US

351
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,940
 began to experiment with a new way of doing church,

352
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,260
 according to different people who are out there

353
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:24,580
 in terms of Barna studies and also Gallup studies.

354
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:29,060
 These ministries began to design a church experience

355
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,860
 that will be available to everyone

356
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,420
 in which it reaches out to everyone.

357
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:38,620
 It would draw and make church attractive.

358
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,380
 One author writes this,

359
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,740
 "The logic was simple.

360
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:45,420
 If the baby boomers in the US

361
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:48,780
 did not feel the need to connect with God,

362
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:51,660
 then perhaps another felt need

363
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,880
 would draw them into the church,

364
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,640
 the need for community, entertainment,

365
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,120
 help with their children and their marriage.

366
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,620
 They would include music, improve the music,

367
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:06,820
 support groups, drama, sermons

368
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,660
 that reached out and ministered to you.

369
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,640
 And hopefully you will find God as well."

370
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,980
 And that was a strategy.

371
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:19,820
 And that strategy worked very well in the 80s and 90s.

372
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:23,380
 Evangelical churches began experimenting

373
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:26,760
 on Sunday morning services with worship experience

374
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,460
 with the emphasis on production.

375
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:33,440
 In the 1990s, the emphasis starts shifting

376
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,260
 to program, art, and services

377
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:41,500
 that really excited and drew in different people.

378
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,580
 New churches strip religious icons from their exteriors

379
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:49,580
 and interiors and gravitated toward an architectural style

380
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:53,500
 that blended the feeling of a mall,

381
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:58,500
 a university campus, movie theater versus a church.

382
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,420
 Church could be anything

383
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:05,380
 as long as it wasn't boring.

384
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:08,380
 But the problem is,

385
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:11,500
 the problem with creating a church that attracted people

386
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,180
 that we saw in the US in the 80s and 90s,

387
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,960
 created another problem.

388
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,000
 The growth and direction of the modern church

389
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,460
 was fueled and influenced by money

390
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:26,380
 donated by all of these people

391
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,220
 who were attracted by this model

392
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:30,060
 because the plan worked.

393
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:33,300
 People started coming to church

394
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,940
 and there started being a lot of money

395
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:39,100
 flowing into churches.

396
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,980
 And now churches began to really fall

397
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:45,100
 in the temptation of consumerism.

398
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,580
 And soon, many other churches,

399
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:50,140
 not only in the US but around the world,

400
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:55,040
 began to copy this model and it worked.

401
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,060
 But there was a cost.

402
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,020
 One author writes this,

403
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,460
 "Instead of the church becoming a place

404
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:04,420
 "where the people of God are equipped for work and service,

405
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:08,300
 "showing up to church began to be an end in itself

406
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:11,160
 "and instead of a launch pad into the world,

407
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,140
 "Christianity became a belief system

408
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:16,020
 "that insulated us from the world.

409
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,440
 "Through consumer Christianity,

410
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,140
 "the value of God in our lives became predicated

411
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:25,620
 "on how well he fulfilled our needs."

412
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:29,040
 And now you started creating a church

413
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,260
 full of different consumers.

414
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,880
 In a church as entertainment culture,

415
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:38,100
 instead of seeking to be equipped as disciples of Jesus,

416
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,900
 we are slowly formed into consumers and others

417
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:44,620
 who give ratings and reviews on local church performance.

418
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:48,380
 But when we expect the church to entertain us,

419
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,980
 it limits the church's ability to challenge us.

420
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:55,800
 And now here we are for what we have.

421
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,080
 And we've seen it now,

422
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,400
 church attendance becoming a drop.

423
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,020
 And in some sense, actually,

424
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,880
 you would think that as a drop of attendance,

425
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,620
 people actually are walking away from religion.

426
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,420
 They're not walking away from religion.

427
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:13,640
 They're still saying they're Christ followers.

428
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,740
 They're still saying they pray.

429
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,220
 They're still saying they read the Bible

430
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,060
 and all that stuff.

431
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,220
 They're still religious.

432
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:24,500
 They just don't go to church anymore

433
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,180
 because they just wanna be consumed and entertained

434
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,420
 and go from one place to another to another.

435
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,500
 And when it doesn't fulfill them, they just don't go.

436
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,940
 But you know what's going on instead of that?

437
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:37,220
 Even though they're no longer going to church

438
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,860
 and some of you guys may feel that way,

439
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,780
 this is what's happening in the American church.

440
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:45,540
 Even though they don't go to church,

441
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,140
 you know what's still happening?

442
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:50,700
 They're still watching cable news.

443
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,620
 They're still paying attention to their social media.

444
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,660
 They're still watching YouTube

445
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:59,320
 and they're still watching and listening to their podcasts.

446
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:04,320
 But the accountability, the community,

447
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:09,580
 the fellowship, the guardrails are no longer there.

448
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:14,460
 And so they're listening to what they want on cable news,

449
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:17,100
 on podcast, on YouTube,

450
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:21,420
 and they now have become a different person.

451
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:24,700
 Theologically, they're changed,

452
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,020
 but they have no accountability anymore.

453
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,220
 That's what's going on.

454
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,780
 There's one aspect of living

455
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,740
 between two different opinions,

456
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:36,100
 one foot in the world, one foot following Christ,

457
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,700
 but there's another part of us

458
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:43,900
 in which we're frustrated by the church experience.

459
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:47,020
 We don't want anyone to tell us what to do anymore.

460
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:49,060
 And if we don't like what we hear,

461
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,880
 then we'll move on to something else.

462
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,180
 But yet at the same time,

463
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:56,520
 we're still consuming things that reinforces our view.

464
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:01,300
 And now we're limping between two different opinions.

465
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:05,560
 And that's where the current state of the church is at.

466
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:09,660
 Are you limping between two different opinions?

467
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:14,420
 For me, that the second option is where I struggle with.

468
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:18,260
 I have grown as a Christ follower,

469
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,620
 as I sit, stand here with you,

470
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,780
 disenchanted with the church.

471
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,340
 I get frustrated with the church.

472
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:30,220
 I've been in ministry doing this for about 20 years now.

473
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:34,860
 I get frustrated by the pastors that I meet,

474
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,940
 not Mark, I love Mark,

475
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:41,820
 but there's so many pastors who I read when I was a child,

476
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,420
 who I sat there and listened to.

477
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,100
 And when I meet them, I'm sitting there,

478
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:50,260
 seriously, you're all consumed about money and power.

479
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,460
 The people that I, all the things that they're,

480
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:55,420
 I get frustrated when I sit in a church,

481
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:59,980
 I get frustrated by the politics that they talk about.

482
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,900
 I get frustrated by Republican party.

483
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,540
 I get frustrated by the Democrat party.

484
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,620
 I get frustrated when we ignore

485
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,500
 all of these different things.

486
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:11,540
 You know why I also get frustrated at?

487
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,940
 The conversations, even when we, as Christians,

488
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,580
 we dwell on the race.

489
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:19,940
 I sat there with Latino pastors, African-American pastors,

490
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:20,900
 all of us are Asians.

491
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,900
 Well, most of us are Asians,

492
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:27,100
 but I get frustrated sometimes even as Asians,

493
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,900
 because as Asian Christians,

494
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:33,380
 we're expected to be the quiet, obedient culture.

495
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:36,460
 We're expected not to cause trouble.

496
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,340
 I had a pastor who says to me,

497
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:42,460
 "Tommy, racism here in America is a black brown thing.

498
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:45,780
 "You Asians, you have it easy.

499
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,660
 "You guys are the ideal culture.

500
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,380
 "You guys get everything."

501
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,220
 And I had to explain,

502
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:54,380
 "Hey, look, when my parents immigrated here in 1972,

503
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,740
 "they worked hard to get to where we are."

504
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,980
 And so a lot of times, you can't expect us,

505
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,540
 as Asian Christians, to take a back seat

506
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,660
 and be the stepping stone.

507
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:08,100
 I get frustrated by all of these conversations.

508
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:12,120
 Are you limping between two different opinions?

509
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:17,140
 Are you seeing the problems that you have?

510
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:20,640
 And for the Israelites, when Elijah challenged them,

511
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,900
 they said nothing.

512
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:25,980
 Do you even wanna do anything about it?

513
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,540
 And the answer is yes.

514
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,820
 What are you gonna do about it?

515
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,740
 In light of how God has gifted you and all of that,

516
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,380
 what are you gonna do about it?

517
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:37,180
 Or you'd be like the Israelites,

518
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:39,700
 who had nothing to say.

519
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:44,420
 And you were quiet.

520
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,860
 And maybe some of us who are sitting here,

521
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:46,900
 it says, "I'm good.

522
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,660
 "I'm good, I see the problems of the church,

523
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:50,820
 "I see the problems of my faith,

524
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:53,840
 "but you know what, I'm happy with coming in on Sundays.

525
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,400
 "I'm happy just to be sitting here,

526
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,260
 "and then once I walk out of here on Sunday,

527
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,140
 "I'm gonna do my own thing.

528
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,220
 "I'm good, I'm good, I'm good."

529
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:03,580
 Because if that's your answer,

530
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:06,540
 then there's nothing for us to say.

531
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,380
 Then we're done.

532
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,580
 Go do your own thing.

533
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,420
 But if you're sitting there,

534
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,860
 I wanna do something about it.

535
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:16,120
 What are you gonna do about it?

536
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:19,660
 Elijah goes in, in verse 30,

537
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,760
 and he said to all the people,

538
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,740
 "Come near to me."

539
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:25,260
 And all the people came near to him.

540
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,000
 And he repaired the altar of the Lord

541
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 that had been thrown down.

542
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,500
 He took 12 stones according to the number

543
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,620
 of the tribes of the son of Jacob,

544
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,760
 and with the stones he built an altar

545
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,080
 in the name of the Lord.

546
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,520
 If you wanna do something about it,

547
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,560
 you're wrestling between,

548
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,560
 you're limping between two different opinions.

549
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,100
 If you wanna do something about it,

550
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:48,520
 how do you rebuild and repair your altar?

551
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:52,000
 How do you rebuild and repair your altar?

552
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,720
 I wanna find one way that you could do it.

553
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:00,120
 Do you have people in your life

554
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,000
 that speaks truth to you?

555
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,440
 Do you have people in your life

556
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,200
 that says no to you?

557
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,560
 Do you have people in your life

558
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,880
 that stretch you to become the version

559
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,920
 that Christ Jesus wants you to be?

560
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,240
 Do you have people in your life

561
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,100
 that pushes you?

562
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,440
 Or do you surround yourself

563
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,700
 with people in your life

564
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,640
 that tells you what you want to hear?

565
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,840
 Let me tell you one story.

566
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:32,580
 Back in late November,

567
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,920
 right after Christmas,

568
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:38,240
 my friend Sharon was a paralegal

569
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,060
 who was diagnosed with stage four cancer

570
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:44,260
 right on her last day of work.

571
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,060
 Her goal was to retire early.

572
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:48,580
 She retired early at 48.

573
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,080
 On her last day of work,

574
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,180
 she was diagnosed with cancer.

575
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:57,860
 And there she had to battle for two years

576
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:00,420
 through chemo, radiation, and all of that.

577
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:03,180
 On a Thursday night,

578
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,900
 the first week of December,

579
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,140
 she was slowly struggling,

580
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:11,140
 slowly just not doing well.

581
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,180
 The doctors had told her

582
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:14,580
 she did not have time to live.

583
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,100
 She wanted all her friends,

584
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:16,940
 different friends,

585
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,220
 to stay with her at night,

586
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,200
 and it happened that on that first week,

587
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,120
 right after Thanksgiving,

588
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,280
 on that Thursday night,

589
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,180
 I was assigned to stay with her.

590
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,040
 And I walked in,

591
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,320
 and I actually did not want to be there.

592
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,000
 I had just gotten back from out of town,

593
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,200
 did not want to be there,

594
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,480
 but my wife says to me,

595
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,280
 "You don't know what's gonna happen.

596
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,560
 "She's not doing well.

597
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,300
 "You need to go see her."

598
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,920
 So I got all my stuff,

599
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,480
 was gonna stay there with her that night,

600
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,000
 and I got to the hospital,

601
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,240
 and when I walked in,

602
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,120
 her face was white,

603
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,640
 and she was just staring out

604
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,440
 into the darkness.

605
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,560
 And the nurse and doctor says,

606
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,580
 "She has not been doing well."

607
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:58,480
 And I said, "Okay."

608
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,680
 And her oxygen was dropping,

609
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,820
 she stopped breathing,

610
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,360
 she was having a hard time breathing,

611
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,200
 all of that stuff,

612
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,040
 and she got stabilized that very night.

613
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,840
 And it was about midnight,

614
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,540
 and she had fallen asleep,

615
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,720
 and she was snoring, actually.

616
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,140
 And the nurse comes in and says,

617
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,740
 "Wow, that's pretty good.

618
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:16,760
 "She's snoring."

619
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:20,120
 And at 12 midnight,

620
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:24,520
 her oxygen started dropping,

621
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,800
 and it was about 90-something,

622
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,920
 and it kept dropping.

623
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,040
 I was the only one in the room.

624
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,120
 It's midnight.

625
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,280
 I was the only one in the room.

626
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:38,560
 And it kept dropping from 90,

627
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,080
 to 80,

628
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,280
 to 70,

629
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,120
 to 60.

630
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,800
 Suddenly, all these nurses,

631
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,720
 all of these guys,

632
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,620
 there was about 20 people in the room,

633
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,880
 and as it was dropping to 59,

634
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,400
 the nurse says to me,

635
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,360
 "Whoever you have to wake up,

636
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,800
 "call them."

637
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,000
 Because when I lift this ventilator,

638
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,880
 this mask off her,

639
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,900
 she has three minutes before she dies.

640
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,820
 And now I had to call everyone.

641
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,000
 And there,

642
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,440
 she never,

643
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,340
 her family came,

644
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,240
 her friends came,

645
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,560
 she never made it,

646
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,540
 and there she died in front of me.

647
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:14,340
 But the week before,

648
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,520
 when I saw her,

649
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,540
 on that Sunday,

650
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:20,900
 Sharon knew that her time was about to be gone,

651
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,300
 and she grabbed my hand,

652
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,140
 and she says,

653
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:26,140
 "I am angry at God.

654
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:30,020
 "How did God allow this to happen to me?

655
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:36,580
 "How did God allow me to suffer so bad?

656
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,040
 "Help me understand."

657
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,380
 And that's where we sat there,

658
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,220
 and we talked,

659
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,780
 that sometimes we don't understand

660
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:45,500
 how God does things.

661
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,900
 God never promises that he'll save us.

662
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:51,120
 He promises that he'll be with us,

663
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,540
 but he doesn't promise us pain-free.

664
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:56,940
 He doesn't promise that we're gonna be free of trials.

665
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,100
 He promises that he'll give us strength,

666
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,460
 he'll be with us.

667
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:04,720
 How do we rebuild and repair the alters in our life?

668
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,740
 Do we surround ourselves with people

669
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,420
 who are willing to tell us things

670
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,840
 that we don't wanna hear?

671
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,700
 Are we willing to surround ourselves

672
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,940
 with people who tells us no,

673
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:17,900
 who guides us,

674
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:21,980
 who tells us and help us see God clearly

675
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,380
 in the midst of all these things?

676
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:28,500
 If we're limby between two different opinions,

677
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,020
 whether it's with the world or with our faith

678
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,540
 or with what we're seeing in the church,

679
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,740
 that's great,

680
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,820
 I totally understand.

681
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,500
 What are you gonna do about it?

682
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,700
 'Cause if you don't wanna do anything about it,

683
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,780
 then we don't have to do it.

684
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,660
 There's nothing for us to talk about.

685
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:47,060
 But if you wanna do something about it,

686
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:51,740
 what are you gonna do?

687
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:54,980
 How do we repair and rebuild the alter?

688
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:59,640
 And lastly, as we look at things,

689
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,020
 once they rebuild the alter,

690
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:05,380
 he praises one thing in verse 36.

691
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,020
 "At the time of the offering,"

692
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,660
 and so the bowels and all prophets bowed,

693
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:12,460
 they couldn't call their God, no one came, all right?

694
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:15,060
 They doused it with water, everything, nothing came.

695
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,940
 And at the time of the offering of the oblation,

696
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,380
 Elijah, the prophet came near and says,

697
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:22,140
 "O Lord, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel,

698
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:26,840
 "let it be known this day that you are God in Israel

699
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,300
 "and that I am your servant

700
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:33,560
 "and that I have done all these things at your word.

701
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:36,900
 "Answer me, O Lord, answer me,

702
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:42,220
 "that this people may know that you, O Lord,

703
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:47,080
 "are God and that you have turned their hearts back.

704
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,500
 "Then the fire of the Lord fell

705
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,340
 "and consumed the burnt offering

706
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,880
 "and the wood and the stones and the dust

707
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,600
 "and licked up the water that was in the trench.

708
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:01,400
 "Are you praying that God will show up in your life?"

709
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,760
 Elijah prayed and asked the Lord,

710
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:08,960
 "Let it be known this day that you are God in Israel

711
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,680
 "and that I am your servant.

712
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,400
 "I need you to show up.

713
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:17,700
 "Are you praying that God will show up in your life?"

714
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:21,080
 Now, here's one thing, God is always at work in your life.

715
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,680
 God is always present in your life.

716
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,340
 But sometimes what you and I need

717
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:31,060
 is that we're praying that God show up in our life.

718
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,820
 Make it known.

719
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:33,940
 Show us that you're real.

720
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:34,780
 Show us that you're,

721
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:38,060
 because you know what, we need to be reminded.

722
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,940
 Because life is hard.

723
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,940
 It's not easy.

724
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:45,040
 We get discouraged.

725
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:48,260
 The things of the world drives us crazy,

726
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:50,520
 the discouragement, the things that we face

727
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,580
 each and every single day.

728
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:54,660
 And there are times in the midst of following the Lord,

729
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:55,980
 we're gonna need strength.

730
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,420
 For those who are sitting online

731
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,720
 and for those who are sitting there,

732
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,220
 we're gonna need some encouragement along the way.

733
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:08,940
 Are we praying that God will show up?

734
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,040
 Because if we don't,

735
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:15,480
 we're gonna struggle along the way.

736
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,080
 Can I read you one more story?

737
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,480
 Or one more email that I got?

738
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:22,200
 And I apologize that this,

739
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,160
 all my illustrations have been on death and struggles,

740
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,600
 but here's one more of an email

741
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,840
 that I actually received this week that actually struck me.

742
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:35,160
 And it's this guy who is an inter-varsity staff worker,

743
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,600
 and he has been working inter-varsity

744
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,720
 for a while, he says,

745
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,920
 "Some of you have prayed for me for my whole life.

746
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,280
 "Ever since I joined inter-varsity as a freshman

747
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,760
 "at the University of Illinois in 1992.

748
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,320
 "Thank you to your prayers, love, and support.

749
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,400
 "God's ministry through me has touched

750
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:57,120
 "over 100,000 people because of through you.

751
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:02,120
 "The true extent won't be known until we reach heaven.

752
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:06,160
 "And now heaven is where we will meet next."

753
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,840
 As I've lost my 27-year-old health battle

754
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,880
 with migraines, with Crohn's disease, with all of that.

755
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,800
 He talks about all the wonderful things

756
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,200
 that God has allowed him to do through their support.

757
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,480
 But my death will have been several days ago

758
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,360
 by the time you get this.

759
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:27,480
 God will judge me by the 50 years of my life,

760
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,000
 not the moment of my death.

761
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,280
 When I read this email,

762
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,800
 I actually had to read this a couple of times.

763
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,440
 I said, "Did he just say what he just said?"

764
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,280
 He did.

765
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:41,280
 This guy who has been serving for 27 years of his life

766
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,040
 needed some encouragement from God.

767
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:50,160
 And he didn't, he couldn't find it.

768
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:56,080
 And he ended his life earlier this week.

769
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:59,960
 And now he's sending an email to all his supporters saying,

770
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,000
 "It has been a couple of days and you will soon,

771
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,720
 "by the time you read this, I will be dead."

772
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,640
 Yes, I will have passed.

773
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:11,880
 Our life, and the thing is, for a guy who struggled cancer,

774
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,040
 and some of you guys know I've struggled cancer,

775
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,800
 I know what that means.

776
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,640
 I know what he's dealing with.

777
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,480
 Every day I wake up, my body aches.

778
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,880
 Every day I wake up, I have chills throughout my body.

779
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,080
 I probably don't have what he had.

780
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,260
 Every day I struggle migraines.

781
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:33,600
 Every day I have no saliva, no tears, all that.

782
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,280
 My head is just pounding.

783
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,080
 I just dealt with three weeks of a sinus infection,

784
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,920
 and since I've weakened the immune system,

785
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:45,600
 my sinus and my headaches were just attacking me.

786
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:49,500
 It just kept painful, pounding and pounding and pounding.

787
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,880
 This guy had to deal with 27 years of it.

788
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:57,920
 He lost sight, and he ended his life because of it.

789
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,420
 We have to ask God to show up in our life.

790
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:06,340
 We need God to give us strength.

791
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:10,620
 The reason why we're not, we're wrestling between two,

792
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,980
 we're limping between two different opinions.

793
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:16,220
 The reason why we don't have the strength to follow God.

794
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:18,860
 The reason why we're so attracted by the world.

795
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:21,100
 The reason why we get attracted

796
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,980
 and disenchanted by the church

797
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:27,980
 is because we don't know how to repair or rebuild our altar,

798
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:30,860
 and one of those ways to rebuild and repair the altar

799
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,620
 is the community of believers,

800
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:35,060
 but also praying that God will show up

801
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:38,380
 and that we will see God every aspect of our lives,

802
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:42,680
 because you and I are in a journey of following Christ,

803
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:48,520
 and that journey is not easy.

804
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:54,300
 If anything that the story of Mount Carmel teaches us

805
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:59,300
 as we wrap up is that what it means to follow in Christ

806
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:02,660
 is that you're gonna go through tough times.

807
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:05,300
 You're gonna have to have choices that you have to make.

808
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,940
 You're gonna have to make decisions

809
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:09,220
 about what you're gonna do with my faith,

810
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,740
 because you can sit there and say,

811
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,860
 "I'm a Christ follower," and go through the routines,

812
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:17,860
 but if you truly wanna make a difference with your faith,

813
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,700
 you're gonna have to surround yourself

814
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,340
 with believers who pushes you,

815
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:25,020
 but you're gonna have to ask God to make himself known,

816
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:27,140
 to show up in your life and remind you

817
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:30,820
 of what it means to follow after him,

818
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:34,220
 and before I pray, I wanna say one thing,

819
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:36,460
 and later on as we look at that story,

820
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:39,380
 the fire comes down, and Elijah, as he prays,

821
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:44,100
 the fire comes down and burns up the burnt offering

822
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,860
 because it's a simple reminder

823
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:51,220
 of what happens when Jesus comes,

824
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:53,660
 because the fire could have destroyed

825
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:57,500
 and killed all the Israelites that were gathered there

826
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,740
 for their disobedience.

827
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:00,220
 It could have killed all the folks

828
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:02,940
 that bowed for their disobedience,

829
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:05,720
 but no, the fire destroyed the burnt offering.

830
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:11,300
 When Jesus came, the judgment of God

831
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,980
 could have been placed on all of us,

832
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:20,300
 but no, the judgment of God was placed on the sacrifice

833
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:25,180
 in the form of Jesus Christ that was found on the cross.

834
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:28,340
 That's the gospel message.

835
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:31,500
 That's what Jesus reminds us of.

836
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:35,180
 That's why we follow after him.

837
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:37,700
 Let's pray.

838
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:40,420
 Father, thank you for the message of Elijah.

839
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:43,860
 Thank you for how this Tishbite of Tishbe and Gilead

840
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:46,560
 continues to teach us all these wonderful lessons,

841
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,620
 and the lesson today of what it means

842
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,820
 to live between two worlds,

843
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:57,480
 what it means to repair and rebuild our altar,

844
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:02,140
 and what it means for you to show up

845
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:05,100
 and for us to pray that you will show up.

846
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,920
 Give us a strength.

847
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,260
 Let us draw that strength.

848
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,540
 Let us see you.

849
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:12,820
 In Christ we pray, amen.

850
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:15,320
