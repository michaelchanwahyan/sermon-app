1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,960
 Hey family, it's good to be with you again.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:08,260
 I hope that you are well and that you're safe and that you're experiencing God's presence

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:10,280
 and His goodness at this time.

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,320
 I know I say that every week, but I mean it.

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,320
 I pray those things for you, that God will protect you, keep you healthy and safe, and

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,520
 also just keep you encouraged and keep you in His peace and in His comfort and in His

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,520
 joy.

8
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:27,800
 Today, we're continuing on with this study we've been doing, looking at kingdom values

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,680
 that Jesus taught us in the Beatitudes, which is a part of the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew

10
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,560
 5.

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,440
 And specifically, we're looking at verse 4 today, Matthew 5, verse 4, and it says this,

12
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,760
 "Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted."

13
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,880
 Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.

14
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:55,380
 Now this verse has a lot of really deep meaning for us and deep meaning for what it means

15
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:00,920
 to be a follower of Jesus, a disciple, for what it means to have a right relationship

16
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,120
 to God.

17
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:08,040
 And in a really deep way, it tells us a lot about what it means to have a right relationship

18
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,520
 to the people around us and to the world around us.

19
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,680
 We're going to get into some of those things today.

20
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,520
 But to start, I want us to just think about what it means.

21
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,960
 What does it mean when it says that blessed are those who mourn and that they will experience

22
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,960
 comfort?

23
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,000
 What do those words mean?

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,320
 Well, the word for mourning in the original language is a lot like what you might think.

25
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,400
 It's a word that communicates grief or lament.

26
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:43,040
 And so it's communicating a sense of sadness or grief, but it's a very strong word.

27
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,480
 It's communicating a strong sense of sadness or grief.

28
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:53,800
 It was a word that was used often when someone had died and people were mourning and really

29
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,400
 grieving deeply over that loss.

30
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:03,720
 And the word for comfort in the original language communicates a sense of receiving encouragement

31
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:08,960
 or consolation or strength being strengthened.

32
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,400
 And so again, it means kind of what we might think.

33
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:18,400
 It means receiving some comfort, some care, some encouragement, some consolation.

34
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,720
 That's what it's referring to.

35
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,040
 But this verse is more than just the words.

36
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,760
 It's the ideas that are in this verse that are really significant for us.

37
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,480
 So we're going to start out just talking about a few of the things that it doesn't mean,

38
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,020
 a few of the things that we might assume about this verse initially that aren't necessarily

39
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,360
 what this verse is talking about.

40
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:45,400
 And first of all, it doesn't mean that we're supposed to be unhappy or kind of sad people

41
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,400
 as Christians.

42
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,040
 That's not what this verse is communicating.

43
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,840
 It's not saying that it's a kingdom value for the followers of Jesus just to be sad

44
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,120
 all the time or to be in despair all the time.

45
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,200
 That's not who we're supposed to be.

46
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,560
 And we know from other parts of the Bible, it's clear the Bible talks about the fact

47
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,480
 that we have the joy of the Lord as our strength, that we're supposed to be rejoicing in what

48
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,880
 God has done for us.

49
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,440
 We're supposed to be joyful people.

50
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,120
 And this verse reminds us that that joy that we have as believers in Christ is not a fake

51
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,120
 joy.

52
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,120
 It's not a false joy.

53
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,440
 It's not the type of pretentious thing we put on where we pretend to be happy when we're

54
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,240
 not or where we're kind of out of touch with reality and when there's tragedy or hurt going

55
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:30,680
 on around us, we're just kind of got our head in the clouds and we don't even care and we're

56
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,440
 like, "Oh, I'm still great.

57
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,520
 Everything's fine," even when things are not fine.

58
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:42,200
 We're not supposed to be like that as believers, but we can and should have joy that is beyond

59
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:48,640
 our circumstances because it's resting in our security in God, not in our circumstances

60
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,640
 themselves.

61
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,920
 We can have joy beyond the things we experience.

62
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,640
 And we've talked about that some in the past.

63
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:00,840
 But even though we know that the Bible communicates that we're supposed to be joyful people, still

64
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:07,960
 this verse tells us that it's a kingdom value to mourn and to experience God's comfort.

65
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:12,840
 So what does it mean when it says that we should mourn?

66
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:19,800
 And again, this is not just talking about simply grieving or being sad over loss or

67
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,800
 tragedy.

68
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,560
 I think sometimes that's one of the things we assume about this verse.

69
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,480
 When we just look at it initially, we think, "Well, it's just saying that when we go through

70
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:36,240
 loss or tragedy and we mourn and we're sad and we're grieving, that God cares and He

71
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,080
 comforts us and He takes care of us."

72
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,720
 And that is completely true.

73
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,920
 The Bible makes that clear in so many other places, but I don't think that's what this

74
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,560
 verse specifically is talking about.

75
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,280
 But I want to stop there for a second and be real clear about that.

76
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,840
 God does care about our grief.

77
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,920
 God cares about the pain in our lives.

78
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,260
 God does want to comfort us in those things.

79
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:07,640
 And that's clear in so many places in the Scripture.

80
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:14,800
 Hebrews 4, verses 14 and 15 talk about how Jesus is our high priest and how He has been

81
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:21,000
 touched with the feelings of everything that we go through because He went through it Himself

82
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,580
 when He was here on the earth living as a human.

83
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:31,200
 And that verse tells us crystal clear that Jesus cares about what we feel and what hurts

84
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,920
 us and our pains and our grief.

85
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:37,480
 He cares about those things and He wants to meet us there and comfort us and encourage

86
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,480
 us.

87
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:44,360
 Psalms 34, verse 15, we talked about this a few weeks ago, such a beautiful verse that

88
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,280
 says, "The eyes of the Lord are toward the righteous and His ears are listening to their

89
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,280
 cries."

90
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,880
 What that verse is saying, His ears are toward their cries.

91
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:56,360
 It's saying that God is looking and listening to our need and He cares about our hurt and

92
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,200
 our pain and our grief.

93
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:04,040
 Second Corinthians, chapter 1, verses 3-7 talks about how God is the God of all comfort

94
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,840
 and He comforts us in all of our affliction, all of our pain.

95
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,360
 So I want to be clear about that.

96
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:17,120
 It is a biblical truth that God cares about your pain and your grief and your tragedy

97
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,120
 and your mourning.

98
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,280
 And when you experience that, God wants to meet you in that and bring you comfort and

99
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,280
 peace.

100
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,840
 That is a biblical truth.

101
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,880
 And if you're experiencing that right now, grief and mourning, then God wants to meet

102
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,960
 you in that and bring you comfort and peace.

103
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,060
 But while that is a biblical truth, again, I don't think that's necessarily what this

104
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:41,520
 verse is specifically talking about.

105
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,760
 So we're going to dig a little bit deeper into this and we're going to go for a little

106
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:52,080
 drive and talk more about what it means to mourn, what it does mean to the followers

107
00:06:52,080 --> 00:07:00,000
 of Jesus, to disciples of Jesus, to mourn, and what it does mean to receive God's comfort.

108
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:08,080
 As we talk today about what it means to mourn and what it means to be comforted, I want

109
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,440
 us to look out.

110
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,080
 I'm sure you're tired of looking at me every week.

111
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,580
 I'm tired of looking at me every week.

112
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:19,960
 So today we're going to go for a drive and since we're in my neighborhood, we're going

113
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,120
 to look at my neighborhood.

114
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,920
 But more than that, we're going to look at ourselves.

115
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,920
 We're going to look at Chicago.

116
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,960
 We're going to look at us.

117
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,920
 We're going to talk about what it means to mourn over our brokenness and we're going

118
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:39,400
 to talk about the comfort that God has for us in that mourning and the hope that we have

119
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:44,640
 for God's solution, God's redemption, God's rescue.

120
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:59,760
 Last week, as we discussed Matthew 5.3, I said that the Beatitudes build on one another.

121
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:05,960
 So to understand the meaning of verse four, we're actually going to start with verse three.

122
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,560
 Last week we talked about what it means to be poor in spirit.

123
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,680
 The fact that it means we are aware of our need for God.

124
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,840
 We're aware of our spiritually bankrupt state without Him.

125
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,480
 Our need for Him is profound.

126
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,280
 It's inescapable.

127
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:26,480
 And we discussed how poverty of spirit is an essential kingdom value because it's necessary

128
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,200
 for entrance in the kingdom.

129
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:34,900
 Entrance into the kingdom of God comes by God's grace through faith in the forgiveness

130
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:39,640
 of our sins through the sacrifice of Jesus on our behalf.

131
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,400
 God gives the grace.

132
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:48,240
 We're supposed to exercise our faith in Him and that's how we enter into God's kingdom.

133
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,300
 But it can't even happen if we don't know we need Him.

134
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:57,640
 If we're not aware of our need for God, if we're not aware of our own sinfulness and

135
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:03,560
 the bankrupt state of our own virtue apart from God, then we'll never ask forgiveness.

136
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,720
 We'll never seek repentance.

137
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:11,680
 We'll never accept God's grace and we'll never experience the all-encompassing and

138
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,840
 completely sufficient solution of God's redemptive plan.

139
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:21,560
 None of that will happen unless we're aware of the problem of our own brokenness.

140
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,320
 So you have to become poor in spirit to even enter the kingdom.

141
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:31,160
 However, being poor in spirit is also a primary value in the kingdom because even once you've

142
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:36,280
 entered the kingdom, once you have relationship with God, you won't grow in that relationship.

143
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,160
 You won't become more like Jesus.

144
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,680
 You won't grow in love and joy and peace and the other fruits of the spirit unless you're

145
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,520
 aware of your continuing need for God.

146
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:51,520
 Unless you're acknowledging your need for Him and asking for God's activity and work

147
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:57,760
 in your life and asking for God's activity and work in your life to increase.

148
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,080
 This is when we first begin a relationship with God.

149
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:06,520
 As we continue following Jesus, we still need to be aware of our own brokenness and need

150
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:12,480
 in order to experience the solution of God's grace, God's strength, and God's transformation

151
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,240
 in our lives.

152
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:20,560
 We have to remain poor in spirit to grow and progress in our relationship with Him and

153
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,600
 in the kingdom of God.

154
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:28,680
 Now, all this awareness of our own brokenness can be a little bit discouraging.

155
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:35,160
 And that brings us back to the meaning of Matthew 5, 4, the verse we're looking at today.

156
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:40,560
 See when this verse talks about mourning, I believe that it's talking about a mourning

157
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:50,600
 over sin, a mourning over brokenness, a mourning over the reality that we as humans have colossally

158
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:55,000
 wrecked our lives and our world.

159
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,600
 Remember that God created this world as a perfect place and He created us as perfect

160
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,240
 beings in it.

161
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,880
 Originally, there was no sin.

162
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,820
 There was no suffering.

163
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,920
 There was no disease.

164
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,440
 There was no hatred.

165
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,280
 There was no murder.

166
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,540
 There was no racism.

167
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,480
 There was no poverty.

168
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,000
 There was no hunger.

169
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,760
 There was nothing painful or hurtful in that original plan.

170
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:30,160
 But we humans wrecked it with our own selfishness and we've been hurting ourselves and hurting

171
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,520
 one another ever since.

172
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:41,240
 And the more we begin to grasp the reality of this brokenness, the more grief we'll feel,

173
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,100
 the more lament we'll feel.

174
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:49,280
 And just like this verse describes it as mourning, it's a deep grief.

175
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:55,980
 It's a deep lament as we really grasp the depth of our need for God, the depth of our

176
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,680
 bankruptcy without Him.

177
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:03,160
 But this isn't just some type of hopeless despair because there is hope.

178
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,400
 And we'll get to that in a minute.

179
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:11,840
 But it is a very real assessment of the reality of our brokenness.

180
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:15,480
 We need to have that.

181
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:22,080
 And when we get that real, when we get that up close with our brokenness, it's ugly.

182
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,040
 It makes us sad.

183
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,900
 Humans don't like to mourn.

184
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,960
 We don't like to be sad or uncomfortable.

185
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:38,720
 And a lot of times our first immediate temptation is just to look away, just to ignore the brokenness,

186
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:45,600
 just to act like it isn't there and try to find something happier to look at.

187
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:52,660
 But Jesus is telling us in this verse that that behavior isn't acceptable for His followers.

188
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:56,640
 We can't just ignore the brokenness.

189
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,240
 We can't just imagine it away.

190
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:04,120
 We need to be honest about it and we need to allow ourselves to feel the sting of its

191
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,240
 reality.

192
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,200
 That's true in our own lives.

193
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:12,120
 We can't just ignore our brokenness or imagine it away.

194
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,800
 But it's also true as we look at the world around us.

195
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:22,440
 As we're looking at Chicago today and more specifically at my neighborhood, you can see

196
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:26,240
 with your eyes some physical manifestations of brokenness.

197
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:32,160
 There's boarded up houses that have been left to deteriorate over many years as property

198
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,520
 values have declined precipitously.

199
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:39,120
 There's empty storefronts that used to hold bustling businesses and they're now sitting

200
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,120
 silent.

201
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:45,320
 A few of those have been boarded up in the last few months because of the COVID-19 pandemic,

202
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,720
 but the truth is most of them have been shut for years, even decades.

203
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:57,360
 And the few small businesses that were here when the pandemic began, sadly, probably will

204
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,120
 not survive the economic downturn.

205
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:07,720
 That's a physical manifestation of brokenness in my community, in our city.

206
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:12,200
 There are boarded up churches with no worshippers.

207
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:18,920
 That's a physical manifestation of brokenness in my community, in our city.

208
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:24,440
 Pay attention when you see the police barricade with officers standing around it and manning

209
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,680
 it.

210
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,840
 That's the block in front of Roseland Community Hospital.

211
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:32,160
 It's a small neighborhood hospital with only 134 beds.

212
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:37,560
 And they've been so overwhelmed with the COVID-19 patients that they had to set up triage tents

213
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:43,120
 in the parking lot to process people who are walking up and they had to use their ER as

214
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,920
 an overflow for their ICU.

215
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:55,280
 That's a physical manifestation of brokenness in my community and in our city.

216
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:59,600
 Keep looking and you'll also see the human toll.

217
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,200
 That's the most devastating part of it all.

218
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:08,320
 People whose lives have been wounded by the pain of poverty, the bondage of addictions,

219
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,560
 the trauma of abuse or violence, the sting of abandonment.

220
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:19,600
 You can see those things written in people's faces.

221
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,120
 And it hurts to see those things.

222
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,600
 But don't just look away.

223
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,000
 Remember, Jesus ruled that out in verse 4.

224
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,600
 We need to see, we need to mourn.

225
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,600
 That's what he said.

226
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,200
 "Blessed are those who mourn."

227
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:38,640
 It's a kingdom value to see, to mourn.

228
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:43,560
 But if the first temptation of seeing our brokenness is just to look away, then the

229
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:48,980
 second is to shift blame from ourselves, to explain away our involvement and absolve ourselves

230
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,540
 of any guilt or responsibility.

231
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,620
 It's easy to do that.

232
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,220
 It's easy to do that as we look at Chicago, as we look at my neighborhood.

233
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:03,100
 It's easy to tell ourselves that none of it's my fault and of course I don't want any of

234
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,100
 these things to happen.

235
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,940
 I don't wish for these physical manifestations of brokenness to be here, so it doesn't have

236
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,940
 anything to do with me.

237
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:13,160
 But that's too easy.

238
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:17,780
 And I believe Jesus rules out that type of thinking in verse 4 as well.

239
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:22,940
 The mourning that Jesus is talking about here always starts with my own poverty, my own

240
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:30,400
 need, my own sin, my own guilt.

241
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:36,500
 You know, when we look at a neighborhood that has a lot of needs, we often just see the

242
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,420
 superficial issues.

243
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:45,980
 We see the crime, we see issues of poverty, we see issues of homelessness or boarded up

244
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:49,060
 buildings, things like that.

245
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:54,300
 And a lot of times we can just simply assume that the only source of those issues is in

246
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:57,420
 the community itself.

247
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:04,880
 Now clearly there are issues of brokenness and sin in every community that need to be

248
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,700
 addressed by that community.

249
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,860
 And that's certainly true here in my neighborhood.

250
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:15,640
 But there are also many external issues involved as well.

251
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,420
 This neighborhood is an excellent example.

252
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:23,760
 It went from thriving to struggling by means of a multi-decade process that started with

253
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:29,540
 racial prejudice and fear, discriminatory and predatory housing practices that were

254
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:35,980
 motivated by racial prejudice, disinvestment in community businesses and institutions that

255
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:42,300
 followed discrimination, even a loss of jobs due to changes in the global economy.

256
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:47,660
 And along the way there were breakdowns in the relational health of families, collapses

257
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:54,980
 in the moral health of churches and religious leaders, plus a heaping helping of personal

258
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:58,940
 and political selfishness and greed and corruption.

259
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:01,740
 That's the Chicago way, right?

260
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:05,920
 Well maybe so, but it's more aptly the human way.

261
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,600
 That's really all of us.

262
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:15,220
 And it's so easy for us to look at a specific community or a specific person or place, especially

263
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:19,900
 if that community or that person or that place is different than we are, and just assume

264
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:23,360
 that it's their problem, not mine.

265
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,340
 But that's not true.

266
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:29,520
 It's hard to see all of those other things when we look at a boarded up house, but it's

267
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,840
 all there.

268
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:36,600
 All that human brokenness wrapped up and reflecting us, ourselves.

269
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,160
 Because no one actually tries to make these broken things happen.

270
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,680
 No one wishes for them or wants them to happen, but they do happen all the time.

271
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:50,140
 And they happen while a lot of us are so busy rushing in pursuit of our own success and

272
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:55,760
 comfort and happiness that we end up running away from the places of need as fast as we

273
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,440
 can.

274
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:04,880
 Even many of us who are followers of Jesus and who know better and who should be involved

275
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:11,600
 in serving Jesus in those places run away to pursue other things.

276
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:16,880
 And in that way, we're all a part of the brokenness.

277
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,640
 Because honestly, we're all wrapped up in selfishness.

278
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,080
 And as we spoke about a few weeks ago, we're all wrapped up in building our own little

279
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:29,240
 kingdom where we're the monarch and everything is custom made for our own happiness.

280
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:33,420
 So we can't just shift the blame and absolve ourselves.

281
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,280
 We can't just say, "It's not my fault.

282
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,640
 It has nothing to do with me."

283
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,880
 We need to be able to see our own brokenness reflected in the brokenness of the world around

284
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,880
 us.

285
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,560
 That's what Jesus calls us to do.

286
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:55,960
 Jesus calls us to see, to be aware of our need for Him, to be aware of the need around

287
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:02,980
 us, to mourn, not to blame others, but to mourn our own need, our own poverty, our own

288
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:03,980
 brokenness.

289
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:11,740
 Now, at this point, you might be thinking, "Wow, this is kind of a heavy message.

290
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:16,620
 I think I'm ready to turn it off and go watch some cartoons or something."

291
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,020
 But stay with me.

292
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,580
 This is heavy.

293
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:25,740
 Jesus was challenging us with some deep and honestly offensive truth here.

294
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:29,580
 But don't give up yet because there is hope.

295
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:33,780
 See we're only halfway through this verse.

296
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:38,580
 And in the second half of the verse, Jesus promises that those who mourn will experience

297
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,580
 comfort.

298
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:42,900
 Now, what does that mean?

299
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:48,580
 What does this phrase, "They shall be comforted," mean?

300
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:56,860
 Well, when we visualize comfort, sometimes we think of God putting His arm around us

301
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:00,980
 and patting us on the back or patting us on the shoulder and saying, "Hey, it's going

302
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,660
 to be okay."

303
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,860
 And it does mean that.

304
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,740
 That's a part of what it means in this verse, but it means more than that.

305
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,460
 It means so much more.

306
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:17,500
 It means that God has a solution to our brokenness, a solution that is so beautiful and so perfect

307
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:23,500
 and so complete that when we turn from seeing our brokenness to beholding God's solution,

308
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:29,980
 we will literally go from mourning to dancing, as Psalms 30 verse 11 says.

309
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:33,100
 The solution is redemption.

310
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:38,980
 Through Jesus, we can be personally healed of our brokenness and have the ashes of our

311
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:45,380
 failure transformed into the beautiful threads of His robes of righteousness.

312
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:49,140
 That is true and complete comfort.

313
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:56,220
 As we are made aware of our brokenness, we are comforted by the resolution of His redemption.

314
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,780
 And that's true for the world around us as well.

315
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:03,340
 It's true for our neighborhoods, our families.

316
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:09,220
 The hope for transformation in my neighborhood and in yours is the redemption of Jesus, the

317
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:18,220
 transformative power of the gospel, healing one heart, one family, one block at a time.

318
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,580
 You see, Jesus wasn't a politician.

319
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:25,420
 He didn't promise a chicken in every pot or more shovel-ready jobs.

320
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:32,460
 Jesus was the Savior of humanity and He promised something infinitely better.

321
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:40,580
 He promised love in every heart, peace in every home, healing for every wound.

322
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:46,220
 And as we, the followers of Jesus, become aware of the brokenness around us, we can

323
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:52,500
 be comforted by the understanding that we get to be a part of the solution.

324
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:59,620
 We can be a small part of the grand redemptive plan of God.

325
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:03,100
 We can be a part of this kingdom of heaven that we've been talking about these past few

326
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:08,340
 weeks being present in the right here and right now.

327
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,340
 How does that happen?

328
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:13,140
 Well, remember, the kingdom of heaven is the rule and reign of God.

329
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:19,540
 As we obey God and as His presence is active in our lives and we bring the kingdom of heaven

330
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:27,140
 into contact with our friends, our families, our neighbors, as we serve them and care for

331
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:32,100
 them and share the love of Jesus with them, we have the opportunity to invite them to

332
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:37,820
 begin a relationship with God through grace and faith.

333
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:42,020
 They'll have the opportunity to experience the redemptive work of God in their life and

334
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:46,580
 to experience the healing and restoration of Jesus for themselves.

335
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:51,420
 Followers of Jesus get to be a part of God's solution because they're able to participate

336
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:54,100
 in the redemptive plan of God.

337
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,060
 That is true and complete comfort.

338
00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:01,580
 You get to be a part of God's solution in your neighborhood, on your block, in your

339
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:04,940
 family and in your own heart and life.

340
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:10,840
 You get to be a part of the work that God desires to do around you to rebuild hearts

341
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:17,700
 and lives and homes and through those rebuilt lives to rebuild the schools and the businesses

342
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,500
 and the hospitals and everything else in the community.

343
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:24,140
 You get to be a part of the solution.

344
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:28,820
 Now, I understand we don't want to mourn because it offends us.

345
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,140
 It offends our sense of comfort and security.

346
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,420
 It offends our pride.

347
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:38,700
 But if we don't learn to mourn, we never get to be a part of the solution.

348
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,700
 So let's do it.

349
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,960
 Let's be poor in spirit.

350
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:46,740
 Let's be aware of our need for God.

351
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:51,900
 Let's allow ourselves to see the brokenness in our own lives and the lives of those around

352
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,900
 us.

353
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:56,740
 Let's even allow ourselves to feel the sting of that brokenness.

354
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,140
 Let's not blame others.

355
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:02,780
 Let's acknowledge our guilt and our part and our sinfulness.

356
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:08,780
 Let's mourn and then let's move to be a part of God's solution.

357
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:13,260
 Let's rejoice in the beauty of God's comfort.

358
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:16,860
 Rejoice in the beauty of God's solution.

359
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,500
 Rejoice in the beauty of God's redemption.

360
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:23,340
 Let's go out and love and serve and care for those in need.

361
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,980
 Let's share the hope of Jesus.

362
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:28,100
 That is true comfort.

363
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:44,260
 Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.

364
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:49,980
 I want us to close out today by reading from Isaiah chapter 61.

365
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:54,820
 This is another scripture passage that talks about mourning and comfort and I think it

366
00:25:54,820 --> 00:26:00,220
 summarizes that relationship between those two things really well as we've been talking

367
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:02,620
 about it today.

368
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:10,300
 Now Isaiah was a Hebrew prophet that lived hundreds of years before Jesus and he wrote

369
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:18,180
 this book and this chapter to God's people who had been in mourning and chapter 61 is

370
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:24,820
 a prophetic look forward towards a time when the comfort will come and it's actually about

371
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:25,940
 Jesus himself.

372
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:29,420
 He's talking about the coming Savior, the coming Messiah.

373
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:35,140
 This is what it says, "The spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord has anointed

374
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:38,620
 me to bring good news to the poor.

375
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:43,700
 He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives and the

376
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:48,780
 opening of the prison to those who are bound, to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor

377
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:54,580
 and the day of vengeance of our God, to comfort all who mourn, to grant to those who mourn

378
00:26:54,580 --> 00:27:01,060
 in Zion, to give them a beautiful headdress instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead

379
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:07,040
 of mourning, the garment of praise instead of a faint spirit, that they may be called

380
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:13,340
 oaks of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he may be glorified.

381
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,040
 They shall build up the ancient ruins.

382
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,600
 They shall raise up the former devastations.

383
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:23,780
 They shall repair the ruined cities, the devastations of many generations."

384
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:26,420
 And that's just the first four verses.

385
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:30,060
 I'd encourage you to take some time later today and read the rest of that chapter.

386
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:32,460
 It's such an encouraging chapter.

387
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,660
 But here's the cool thing.

388
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:38,220
 The Bible records a story where Jesus himself read that chapter.

389
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:44,100
 In Luke chapter 4, it talks about at the very beginning of Jesus' ministry, he goes to the

390
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:51,360
 synagogue in his hometown in Nazareth, and he reads those words that we just read.

391
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:57,580
 He reads Isaiah 61, and for the first time, those words were read by the person they were

392
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,060
 written about.

393
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:02,660
 Jesus was there to fulfill them.

394
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:07,420
 This is what Luke chapter 4, verses 20 and 21 says.

395
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:13,420
 After he read that passage, it says, "And he rolled up the scroll and gave it back to

396
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:16,540
 the attendant and sat down.

397
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:20,700
 And the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him.

398
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:28,900
 And he began to say to them, 'Today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.'"

399
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:31,860
 That is true comfort.

400
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,500
 That is something to rejoice in.

401
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,780
 Jesus is the comfort.

402
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,140
 He brought the victory.

403
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,700
 He brought the kingdom.

404
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:44,780
 And that's something worth rejoicing in, worth being excited about.

405
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:49,140
 You can go ahead and shout about that, and it's not going to bother anybody but your

406
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:53,120
 neighbor, so go right ahead and shout.

407
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,900
 That scripture, the comfort, has been brought.

408
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,740
 It's been fulfilled in our hearing.

409
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:01,020
 Jesus brought it with him.

410
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:05,260
 Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.

411
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:11,300
 They'll experience the comfort of God's redemptive plan through Jesus Christ.

412
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,580
 Let's pray.

413
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:18,980
 God, thank you that you're honest with us.

414
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:24,820
 Thank you that you tell us the truth, that you don't let us just look away from our brokenness

415
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:28,180
 or from the brokenness of the world around us, that you don't let us just ignore it and

416
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:30,460
 try to wish it away.

417
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,620
 You're honest about our need for you.

418
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:35,980
 And God, I pray that you'd help us to be honest about it too.

419
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,340
 Help us to be poor in spirit.

420
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:40,460
 Help us to see and acknowledge our need for you.

421
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:46,580
 God, help us to see it so deeply that it even causes us to mourn and that it breaks our

422
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:51,620
 heart because of how broken we are and how broken the world around us is and how wrecked

423
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:57,900
 everything is because of sin and selfishness and all the terrible things that are in our

424
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:00,540
 world, God.

425
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:05,180
 But as we mourn, God, I pray that we would not be hopeless, we would not be in despair,

426
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:12,300
 but we would look to you and find your hope, that we would find your solution, that we

427
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:17,940
 would rejoice that your solution is present in our lives to heal us, to restore us, to

428
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,420
 change us.

429
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:25,060
 But through relationship with you, we get to be a part of your solution, a part of your

430
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:32,020
 redemptive plan, and a part of what you are doing to change the world, God.

431
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:36,540
 And I pray that we, your people, would be a part of it even now, even in this moment

432
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:40,940
 of COVID-19 with all the fear and uncertainty and all the need.

433
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:47,220
 I pray that even now, we, your people, would be a part of your redemptive plan to love

434
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:52,540
 and to serve and to care and to share hope with those around us.

435
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:58,860
 God, I pray that we would be the pouring spirit, we would see our need for you, and we would

436
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:05,540
 be comforted as you transform us and make us a part of your redemptive plan for our

437
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:10,420
 families, our communities, our neighborhoods, and our world.

438
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,060
 In Jesus' name, amen.
