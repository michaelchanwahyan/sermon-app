1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
 - Hey, welcome to all of you.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,220
 And some of our folks are actually out of town,

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,120
 so we have less people here, but that's okay.

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,180
 We're gonna worship together,

5
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:14,960
 and I pray that you will open the Bible

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,200
 and turn to the book of Proverbs,

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,840
 and we're going to think about what it means to be a father.

8
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,240
 Today's Father's Day, right?

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,960
 Yeah, happy Father's Day to all the fathers here, okay?

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,800
 That's me.

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,680
 (audience laughing)

12
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,040
 And then soon to be father, happy Father's Day.

13
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,760
 I wanna start with a question.

14
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,960
 What do you think of when you see this word, father?

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,080
 Father.

16
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:49,320
 What kind of image do you have in mind?

17
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,280
 Do you think of father, fatherhood?

18
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,280
 Do you think of courage, loyalty, faithfulness?

19
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,920
 Responsibilities, loyalty, wisdom, perhaps?

20
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,300
 Do you think of that, those terms?

21
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,440
 You do?

22
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,720
 All right.

23
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,360
 But most of the time, I think, sadly,

24
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,760
 we are in a crisis of fatherhood,

25
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:21,200
 and absentee father, probably you can think of that

26
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,520
 when you see father, or think about father,

27
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,820
 abusive father, detached father,

28
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,420
 or angry father.

29
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,760
 I don't know what you think of,

30
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,080
 especially in the Asian context.

31
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,960
 Sometimes we think of all sorts of negative images

32
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,400
 related to fatherhood.

33
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,060
 According to some of the numbers,

34
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,600
 24 million children in United States,

35
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,800
 they grow up without a biological father.

36
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,920
 So that's one in three, right?

37
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,280
 That's a pretty big number, right?

38
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,040
 One out of three children, you know,

39
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,200
 growing up without a biological dad in their home.

40
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,600
 That is the crisis of fatherhood,

41
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,180
 and that leads to all sorts of different crises

42
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,240
 about your personal development,

43
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,000
 about our personal identity,

44
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 about how we anchor who we are with our fathers.

45
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,240
 So that's a huge crisis,

46
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,720
 and that's why we need to talk about this, okay?

47
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,360
 Today's Father's Day, and I would like to think

48
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,600
 a little bit more about what it means to be a father,

49
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,760
 and hopefully this will not be applicable

50
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,640
 only to fathers, but to all of us.

51
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,360
 Think of the fathers in the Bible.

52
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,600
 Any negative examples in the Bible?

53
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,640
 Abraham, Isaac, Jacob?

54
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,640
 They're not colorful or beautiful figures most of the time.

55
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,760
 They have their own weaknesses and brokenness, right?

56
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,360
 Think of Jacob, right?

57
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,480
 He favored one of his sons, right?

58
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,320
 Joseph, and brings about some sort of family emergency

59
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,960
 or family crisis.

60
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:19,400
 He almost breaks apart the entire family

61
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,320
 because of his favoritism on Joseph,

62
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,280
 destroying the family of God.

63
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,160
 Without the grace of God at the end of the book of Genesis,

64
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,060
 the family cannot be safe, right?

65
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,440
 So negative image of father.

66
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,320
 And then probably you can think of some positive image

67
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,480
 of a father from the Bible, right?

68
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:44,480
 Joseph, New Testament, Jesus' earthly father, right?

69
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,960
 Being described as righteous, right?

70
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:52,080
 Obedient to Torah.

71
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,960
 Father Abraham, again, he believed in God

72
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,000
 and God credited him righteousness, right?

73
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,440
 He trusted in God.

74
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,920
 So there's some mixed complexity

75
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,400
 with all the fathers in the Bible.

76
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,480
 But I think this is good news.

77
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,680
 The good news is that even with our own brokenness,

78
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,680
 I'm somebody's father and I struggle with my own witnesses.

79
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:22,860
 I struggle with my, you know, there's all sorts of things.

80
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,540
 Brokenness, in order to be a father,

81
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:32,540
 I try to be a father that is pleasing to God.

82
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,600
 And I think this is good news when we see, you know,

83
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,240
 all sorts of different positive fathers

84
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,940
 or negative fathers in the Bible.

85
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:42,220
 And the grace of God is always sufficient.

86
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,060
 It's always abundant.

87
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:47,460
 And only if we have the courage,

88
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:51,540
 only if we have the humility to come before God

89
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:56,020
 to be shaped by the grace of God.

90
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:59,460
 So today, I hope the message will not be

91
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:03,500
 just applicable to the fathers, but to all of us.

92
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,700
 Now, if you turn to your Bible,

93
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:08,980
 in the middle part of the Bible, there are five books.

94
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:13,980
 Job, Psalm, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Psalms.

95
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,300
 These five books, what we call together,

96
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,220
 is the body of literature.

97
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,940
 We call them wisdom literature.

98
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,260
 Wisdom literature.

99
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:27,780
 And each of these books has its own way

100
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,660
 to show the life of wisdom.

101
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,700
 What does it mean to live wisely?

102
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:36,700
 And in the context of today,

103
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:40,340
 father is often teaching the son,

104
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,420
 like in the book of Proverbs, Ecclesiastes,

105
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:46,780
 Psalm of Psalms, teaching the son and the daughter

106
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,260
 how to behave, how to live a life of wisdom.

107
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,540
 So there we go.

108
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,660
 We have a huge body of literature

109
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,700
 right in the middle of the Bible,

110
00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:00,700
 showing us what it means to live a life of wisdom.

111
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,600
 Will you consider yourself wise?

112
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,420
 How many of you would consider yourself,

113
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,420
 I have some wisdom?

114
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,740
 You know, how many of you?

115
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,760
 All right, you guys are very humble.

116
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,900
 You know, this is interesting

117
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,940
 about wisdom literature in the Bible.

118
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,100
 You know, wisdom literature, if you read carefully,

119
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,900
 if you think about it carefully,

120
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:29,340
 it is different from all other different writings

121
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,360
 of the Bible, like the prophetical books.

122
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:38,740
 Some of the writings are written in such a way

123
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:42,980
 that truth comes from above.

124
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,940
 Thus says the Lord, right?

125
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,420
 The prophet said.

126
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,860
 Thus says the Lord, this is what Yahweh said.

127
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,020
 So you have to obey, right?

128
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:54,300
 Wisdom literature is a little bit different.

129
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,900
 Actually, in terms of direction,

130
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,860
 wisdom literature from below.

131
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:03,980
 It's all, it often gives us some sort of,

132
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:07,500
 you know, from observation to insight.

133
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:13,540
 So the wise, the wise teacher in the book of Proverbs,

134
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:19,100
 for example, he moves from observation to truth.

135
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:23,580
 He observed there's a divine order in the world.

136
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:27,820
 Of course, the universe is complex and just,

137
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,180
 you know, finely tuned.

138
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,860
 It's amazing.

139
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:36,860
 But the wise teacher moves a little bit forward

140
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,260
 and says not only the universe is designed

141
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:42,940
 and created by God, and it's amazing by itself,

142
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:47,260
 he perceives there's an order in the universe.

143
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,380
 And that order is not just a physical order,

144
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:52,300
 but a moral order, a spiritual order.

145
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,740
 And that spiritual order, he perceives and he observed.

146
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:00,700
 And then he got some insights and spiritual insights

147
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:05,460
 and lessons to how to live a godly life.

148
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,300
 That is what wisdom is all about.

149
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,580
 Wisdom in the biblical sense is practical skill,

150
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,340
 how to live a beautiful life,

151
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,820
 how to live a life, a godly life that is pleasing to God.

152
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,740
 That is wisdom in the Bible.

153
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,620
 So because you guys are all wise,

154
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:24,500
 I want to give you some questions, okay?

155
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,220
 So I'll give you a picture,

156
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,900
 and you tell me what kind of insight

157
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,820
 you can get out of it.

158
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,900
 All right, you ready?

159
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,500
 All right, let me show you this.

160
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,420
 So when you see something like this,

161
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:40,500
 okay, when you see something like this,

162
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,020
 what kind of insight can you get?

163
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:47,860
 Where you see this picture?

164
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,500
 Home Depot, right?

165
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,340
 A door hinge, right?

166
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,060
 A door hinge.

167
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,220
 What kind of practical wisdom can you get out of it, right?

168
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,220
 It's kind of strange, right?

169
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,460
 Why you show me this picture on the worship?

170
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,420
 And, right?

171
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:05,420
 What do you see?

172
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,900
 The wise teacher will come and observe something,

173
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,580
 and how the door hinge works,

174
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:16,580
 and he will understand the order of life,

175
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,860
 you know, spiritual lesson, so-called.

176
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,460
 Let me show you.

177
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,500
 Proverbs 26, 14.

178
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:27,260
 As the door swing back and forth on his hinges,

179
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:32,260
 so the lazy guy turns over in the bed, right?

180
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,420
 That's what he's getting at, right?

181
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,620
 From observation to truth, remember?

182
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,740
 From observation to insight.

183
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,700
 From observation of how the world works.

184
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,700
 And then he gets some spiritual lesson

185
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,940
 that is applicable to all of us.

186
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:50,940
 You gotta work hard, otherwise you will be like a hinge,

187
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:55,260
 moving left and right, and you are not moving anywhere.

188
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,860
 And your life will not be

189
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:00,660
 contributing to the community.

190
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:04,380
 That's what the wise is getting at, right?

191
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:07,300
 So from observation to truth, okay?

192
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,860
 You get what it means, right?

193
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,220
 You get what I mean.

194
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,460
 So I give you a second picture,

195
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:15,420
 and then you tell me what kind of insights

196
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,540
 or spiritual lessons you can get, okay?

197
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:22,100
 Now this second picture I took two weeks ago,

198
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,940
 and I was in Israel, and as you know,

199
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:29,940
 I was leading about 27 people for two weeks in Israel.

200
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,580
 So we were in Bethlehem, and as you know,

201
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,100
 we tour around the country,

202
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,740
 and sometimes we need to do shopping, okay?

203
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,580
 We need to do shopping.

204
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,100
 So we were in a shop,

205
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,820
 and it was owned by a Palestinian Christian family,

206
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,900
 and we spent a little bit of time in there,

207
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:51,220
 and they got some souvenirs, some olive wood,

208
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,500
 craft, all sorts of things.

209
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,580
 And don't ask me, I didn't buy anything for you.

210
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:00,140
 But they all bought something, right?

211
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,580
 So by the time I told the group,

212
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,180
 okay, we gotta go, right, we gotta go.

213
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,380
 The time's getting late.

214
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,860
 You know, we need to move on to the next stop, right?

215
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,800
 So everyone is exiting the shop

216
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,780
 and ready to get onto the bus, right?

217
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:17,080
 And then right at that moment,

218
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:21,040
 a street merchant ambush us

219
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,140
 and came with some sort of, you know,

220
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:28,020
 souvenir items and trying to sell those

221
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,620
 to some of the people who got extra money.

222
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:36,420
 So that delayed us from getting onto the bus.

223
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,060
 So right there, I was trying to tell them,

224
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:42,260
 you know, we gotta go, we gotta go, you know?

225
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,580
 You know, we're running out of time.

226
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,500
 And then I took this picture.

227
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,300
 (audience laughing)

228
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,180
 So they were on the ground,

229
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,180
 they were on the ground with all this scarf

230
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,540
 and, you know, textile products,

231
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:57,300
 and then bookmarks, you know, fairly cheap.

232
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,500
 And I think the merchant, you know,

233
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,860
 got some of our weaknesses.

234
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,100
 You know, he's like, oh, I'm gonna sell you,

235
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,660
 like, you know, it was originally $10 for five,

236
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,740
 and then now it's $5 for five, okay?

237
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:13,980
 And then all this, you know, team members,

238
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:17,420
 as you know, they got delayed, you know?

239
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:21,020
 We actually, we are frozen in time.

240
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:24,060
 And then they are trying to get all of these things.

241
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,740
 It's actually very nice, it's very nice.

242
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:29,240
 It's just not, this is not me.

243
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,700
 So, this is the picture I took, okay?

244
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,700
 So, from observation to truth,

245
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,140
 what kind of insight did you get?

246
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:43,300
 Immediately, I thought of one verse in the Bible

247
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:47,140
 that talks about this picture, exactly, right?

248
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:50,860
 It's this one.

249
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,580
 2014 Proverbs.

250
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,820
 The buyer heckles over the price,

251
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,580
 saying it's worthless, it's worthless.

252
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:00,420
 Then, brag about getting a bargain.

253
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:03,340
 (audience laughs)

254
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:07,540
 So, the wise teacher is making some observations

255
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,300
 about human nature.

256
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,020
 He's trying to describe human nature, right?

257
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:15,460
 What is the human nature that he describes?

258
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,580
 He observes humanity.

259
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:21,300
 We are all beings of contradiction, right?

260
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,380
 When they were looking for the different colors

261
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,260
 of textile products, this is not good,

262
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,660
 this is not good, this is not good, this is not good.

263
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:31,420
 And, by the way, it's not just ladies, men too.

264
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,780
 Yeah, this is not good, this is not good,

265
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,340
 this is not worthless.

266
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:36,380
 They try to heckle the price, right?

267
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:39,900
 And after they got it, they got onto the bus,

268
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,860
 they say, "Oh, this is so good.

269
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,020
 "This is so nice."

270
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:48,660
 Now, what the Book of Proverbs is trying to get at

271
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,080
 is that we tend to be prival.

272
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,180
 We tend to be proud.

273
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:57,600
 That's our natural tendency.

274
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,760
 Our natural tendency has always not been humility.

275
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,520
 You don't have to work on yourself,

276
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:11,120
 you don't have to work hard in order to be a prideful person.

277
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,920
 You are a prideful person, right?

278
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,080
 And that's why our inner self is often contradicting

279
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,160
 ourselves.

280
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,280
 So that is what the wise teacher is trying to do.

281
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,960
 From observation on earth, and then he gets

282
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:32,200
 some spiritual lesson to understand who we are

283
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,480
 and understand the way of wisdom.

284
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,220
 So there are two big points I wanna show you.

285
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:43,080
 First is biblical wisdom is understanding

286
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,920
 the order of creation.

287
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:49,280
 There is a certain order, spiritual order,

288
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,000
 moral order in this universe.

289
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,760
 And the wise teacher, the wisdom literature,

290
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,520
 is trying to get at, is to observe carefully

291
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,520
 and then get some spiritual lessons out of it.

292
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,120
 And the second point, which is important,

293
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:08,280
 is that wisdom begins with obeying the voice of God.

294
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,800
 So let me show you the first point.

295
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,300
 Understanding the creational order of God.

296
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,360
 I'll show you this picture.

297
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,100
 What do you see here?

298
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,140
 Stone fallen, right?

299
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,860
 Stone fallen wall.

300
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:29,560
 It's very simple, right?

301
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,120
 And what do you get?

302
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,040
 Again, observation to insight, right?

303
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:34,880
 2430.

304
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,520
 Here the teacher says, "I walked by the field

305
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:43,680
 "of a lazy person, the vineyard of one with no common sense.

306
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,640
 "I saw that it was overgrown with all sorts of nasty weeds

307
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,640
 "and the walls were broken down.

308
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:55,000
 "And then I look and then I reflect upon it

309
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,720
 "and I learn this spiritual lesson.

310
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:02,080
 "A little extra sleep, a little more slumber,

311
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,560
 "a little more folding of hands to rest,

312
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,640
 "then poverty will come.

313
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:10,000
 "It will pound on you like a bandit.

314
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,160
 "It will come to you and attack you like an armed robber."

315
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,720
 So that's what he's trying to get at.

316
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,880
 If you slumber a little bit more,

317
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,240
 if you're lazy a little bit more,

318
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,920
 you should know that life always works this way.

319
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,440
 That is the principle of life.

320
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,280
 He passes by a lazy person's vineyard.

321
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,400
 You know how many years do you need

322
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,560
 to grow a mature vineyard?

323
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,080
 How many years of hard work?

324
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,280
 What, six years?

325
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,840
 (audience laughing)

326
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,640
 20 years would be very mature, very mature, very valuable.

327
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:53,000
 You know, you go to a wine store, you get some good wine.

328
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,960
 Those are from a very, very old,

329
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,560
 a very, very mature-grown vineyard.

330
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:01,040
 But what I'm telling you is at least six years,

331
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,960
 24/7, 365 days a year.

332
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:08,280
 You have to work on the soil, you have to work on the wall,

333
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,920
 and you have to retain the soil, the good soil,

334
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,760
 and then you have to fertilize it, you have to water it,

335
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,000
 take care of it, prune it, and grow it.

336
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,760
 For six years of sweat and labor.

337
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,400
 And then you get a vineyard.

338
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,720
 But if the vineyard is in the lazy person's hand,

339
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,060
 the vineyard will be ruined.

340
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:33,120
 You'll find weeds.

341
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,480
 You'll find your vineyard being destroyed.

342
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,360
 Just naturally being destroyed.

343
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,120
 Doesn't mean there's enemies trying to attack it,

344
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,760
 trying to break down the walls.

345
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,160
 It's just naturally.

346
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,280
 Stone will always fall down.

347
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,400
 Stone from the stone wall will always fall down

348
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,520
 and the wall will be broken,

349
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,840
 and you lose all the soil and all your produce.

350
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,760
 So the wise teacher is a spiritual teacher.

351
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,480
 He's not a natural scientist.

352
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,840
 He observes how the world works and he learn a lesson.

353
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:10,320
 If you're a little bit lazy in your spiritual life,

354
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,440
 in your relationship with God,

355
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:16,600
 if you stop working, there's always forces of chaos

356
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,800
 that will destroy you.

357
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,960
 That is the natural order of things.

358
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,800
 And the order will naturally give way to chaos.

359
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:31,760
 The wise teacher is saying, in your life,

360
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,920
 the world has always been this way, order to chaos.

361
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,200
 Always order to chaos.

362
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,600
 Unless you work hard and you work against

363
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:47,800
 the forces of darkness, forces of chaos.

364
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,240
 You put the fallen stone back on the wall.

365
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,080
 You input, you work and you labor.

366
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:59,100
 You sweat, repair and maintain your life.

367
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,400
 Otherwise you will not enjoy the fruit of your labor.

368
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,560
 Spiritual life, or life in general, does not come easy.

369
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:14,280
 That's what wisdom is trying to say to you.

370
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:18,440
 There's always an insistence of emphasis of diligence.

371
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:23,680
 You know, wisdom does not come easily.

372
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,520
 It can only be earned.

373
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,520
 It can only be earned by your hard work.

374
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,680
 Spiritual maturity, character formation.

375
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,200
 You want to be like Christ.

376
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,360
 You want to be making advances in your spiritual journey.

377
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,600
 It doesn't come naturally.

378
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,600
 What comes naturally is ruin, chaos.

379
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,560
 If you fold your hands, fold your arms,

380
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,720
 naturally you will be destroyed.

381
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,520
 And the wise person is saying,

382
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,680
 you need to put sweats and tears into your spiritual life.

383
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:03,680
 Think about it.

384
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,760
 I've been a Christian for a long time.

385
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:10,920
 Whenever I got lazy, I don't do anything about it.

386
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:17,360
 I don't work against my own weaknesses, my own old self.

387
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:22,880
 All sorts of sinful nature will come out.

388
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,640
 You have to guard your heart.

389
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,360
 In fact, the Old Testament and New Testament,

390
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:30,040
 the entire Bible often advises and command us

391
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,280
 to guard our heart.

392
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,960
 And guarding is a military term.

393
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,600
 It's a military term.

394
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,840
 You stand on a tower to guard against the enemies.

395
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,480
 They will come any time to destroy you

396
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,840
 and your life will be ruined.

397
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,080
 And you have to guard your own life.

398
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,920
 And how do you do that?

399
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,120
 That is wisdom calling.

400
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,920
 Calling you to form your character,

401
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,400
 to mold yourself so that you are on the right track

402
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,040
 in your spiritual relationship with God.

403
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:03,440
 So wisdom is understanding the creational order

404
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,600
 and then you learn some spiritual insight out of it.

405
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,680
 For those of you who have the blessing

406
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:15,840
 to be born and to grow up in a Christian environment,

407
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:21,080
 I want to tell you, you cannot take it for granted

408
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,480
 because the forces of darkness will destroy you.

409
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,640
 It will ruin you unless you work really, really hard.

410
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,880
 That is Proverbs 24.

411
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:38,240
 So second point is, wisdom is listening and obeying God.

412
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,920
 Now don't get me wrong.

413
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:46,520
 Wisdom literature is not about self-help, self-improvement.

414
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:50,960
 It's about drawing us closer to God himself.

415
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,380
 So Proverbs 19.27.

416
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:59,080
 It says, "If you stop listening to discipline, my child,

417
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,560
 "you will stray from the words of wisdom,

418
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,600
 "words of knowledge."

419
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,440
 Words of discipline, think about it.

420
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,280
 The Hebrew word means,

421
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:13,680
 actually it can mean chains, you know, boundaries.

422
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:18,800
 Something you can think of,

423
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,720
 but it's not some comforting words.

424
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,540
 Words of discipline.

425
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:30,360
 It's gonna be tough to listen to,

426
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,640
 but you have to listen to it.

427
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,160
 You have to be obedient.

428
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,360
 You have to be open to discipline.

429
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,520
 Strayed, it means unable to walk in a straight line.

430
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:46,280
 Have you ever got drunk?

431
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,280
 Yeah, you did, right?

432
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,760
 You had before, right?

433
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,040
 You got drunk and you cannot walk in a straight line.

434
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,880
 You just wander, wander, you waste your time and energy,

435
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,080
 and then you probably will fall, right?

436
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,600
 Fall and stumble, right?

437
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,080
 Strayed is unable to walk straight.

438
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,920
 It's actually describing people who got drunk.

439
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,320
 But what it says is,

440
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,320
 if you stop listening to words of wisdom,

441
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,740
 even tough words, discipline,

442
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:25,200
 then your life will be in ruin.

443
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,080
 Now, we often misunderstand spiritual growth

444
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,560
 in some sort of rosy picture.

445
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,400
 We always think, okay,

446
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,120
 how do you grow your relationship with God?

447
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,560
 Okay, how do you grow?

448
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,760
 Well, we're talking about going to a retreat, right?

449
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,840
 To St. Louis, going to a retreat,

450
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,960
 you know, going somewhere else.

451
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,720
 And probably there will be times

452
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:48,200
 we will do some, you know, devotion, right?

453
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,200
 Quiet times.

454
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,920
 When you think of quiet times, spiritual reflection,

455
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,600
 what kind of picture you have in mind?

456
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,200
 You probably have this kind of picture in mind, right?

457
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,000
 Ah, so nice, you know, go to a lakeside

458
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,640
 and you just sit there and open up your Bible

459
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,360
 and, you know, you turn to some of the passages

460
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:11,940
 that may be your favorite passages, right?

461
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:16,800
 You don't want to turn to any passages

462
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,120
 that will yell at you, right?

463
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,640
 That will discipline you.

464
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,040
 You don't turn to that, right?

465
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,160
 Because, you know, we're in the retreat, right?

466
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,880
 We want to feel nice.

467
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,840
 So, oftentimes we think of spiritual growth

468
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,960
 or spiritual relationship with God in this sort of picture.

469
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:36,160
 I want to tell you today, this is a wrong picture.

470
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,960
 You raise it.

471
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,720
 It doesn't happen that way.

472
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:44,160
 Spiritual growth, your spiritual life, your character,

473
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,240
 it doesn't grow this way.

474
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,520
 This is a lie.

475
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:52,000
 It doesn't work that way.

476
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,760
 Now, think of spiritual growth not in this sort of picture.

477
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:00,240
 Think of spiritual growth in this picture.

478
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,120
 This is spiritual growth.

479
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,240
 This is character formation.

480
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,640
 This is spiritual formation.

481
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:11,120
 I remember years ago, I was in a region college in Vancouver

482
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,440
 and I was taking MDiv, right?

483
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,560
 I was preparing myself for ministry.

484
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:18,640
 And I have so many classmates, other seminarians,

485
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:25,080
 they were taking the program of a spiritual theology, yeah.

486
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,400
 Spiritual theology or spiritual formation.

487
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,800
 I never heard of any one of those

488
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,240
 would talk about spiritual growth this way.

489
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,080
 I never.

490
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,040
 To sweat?

491
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,960
 I mean, to labor?

492
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,640
 I mean, to work hard, right?

493
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,560
 Difficult?

494
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:50,320
 Being tough?

495
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,000
 I never heard of that.

496
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,400
 You know, I came out and I really have a big question.

497
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,240
 You know, how do you grow yourself?

498
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,120
 How do you grow in your character, in your spiritual life?

499
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,640
 They always think this way.

500
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,080
 Oh my God.

501
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,640
 Oh my God, I need to grow.

502
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,320
 Okay, I need to go away and to reflect, right?

503
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,960
 On the calm, you know, weather.

504
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:18,120
 It doesn't work that way, guys.

505
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,840
 I'm not saying there's no room for your spiritual growth

506
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:25,840
 to have some quiet times and spiritual reflection.

507
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,960
 We all do, right?

508
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,880
 Put out 15 minutes a day, 10 minutes a day.

509
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,840
 It's necessary.

510
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,120
 But most of the time, it's like this.

511
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:42,000
 The Bible is very clear to all of us, you know?

512
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,560
 And the spiritual teacher is showing us

513
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,760
 that character growth, spiritual formation,

514
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,240
 requires hard work.

515
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,360
 There's no shortcut.

516
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:56,400
 If you forget about it, if you fold your arms,

517
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,480
 your life will be in ruin.

518
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:03,520
 And your relationship with God will go down the pit.

519
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,240
 Spiritual growth requires sweat and tears

520
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,040
 by a hardworking farmer.

521
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:16,640
 Proverbs 1:7, it says, "Fear of the Lord

522
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,200
 "is the foundation of true wisdom,

523
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:25,080
 "but fools despise knowledge and discipline."

524
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:28,760
 My child, my child, listen.

525
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,240
 When your father corrects you,

526
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,840
 what you learn from them, from wisdom,

527
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:39,080
 will crown you with grace, and you will have honor.

528
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:43,760
 Now, how do you earn a life of wisdom and life of honor?

529
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,440
 You've got to listen.

530
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,560
 And listening is hard work.

531
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:52,120
 You've got to work against your own natural tendency, right?

532
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,760
 When someone says some words of discipline,

533
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:59,440
 correction to me, you know, I don't have to work on it.

534
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,000
 I will naturally resist, right?

535
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,200
 I will naturally resist.

536
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,760
 But you've got to work against that tendency,

537
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:12,120
 that sinful tendency, in order to get that honor,

538
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,560
 to grow your life and grow closer to God.

539
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:20,120
 So to all the fathers today, or soon to be father,

540
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,320
 I want to challenge you and want to remind you

541
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,760
 to grow in the way of wisdom.

542
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,880
 And that's going to be hard work.

543
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,000
 There's so much work in there, right?

544
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,120
 And work hard to build a godly character.

545
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,600
 Because as father, I think fatherhood

546
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,120
 is the embodiment of spiritual wisdom.

547
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:45,080
 And there's no excuse.

548
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,760
 There's no excuse for us to say,

549
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:50,120
 oh, no, I'm not a good Christian, that's okay.

550
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,680
 You know, that sort of excuse will only lead to

551
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,600
 ruin and chaos and disorder.

552
00:28:55,920 --> 00:29:00,520
 Do your best and run in the way of wisdom.

553
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:04,600
 Even though it will require you to work hard.

554
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:08,600
 And to all of you, to each and every one of you,

555
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:12,680
 I want to remind and challenge you to grow spiritually.

556
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:15,600
 And what I meant is not that rosy picture.

557
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,680
 No, no, no, no, no, no, erase that.

558
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,520
 This one, I want to remind you,

559
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:26,560
 we need to work hard to build godly character.

560
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:30,880
 To build a community of God, to build a church.

561
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,920
 This is the picture.

562
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,920
 And that is the picture of honor.

563
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,520
 And that is the future of honor.

564
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:42,360
 So let's work on it and walk in the way of wisdom.

565
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,240
 Let's pray and recommit ourselves

566
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,560
 before the God of wisdom.

567
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:53,680
 It is his pleasing will, his pleasing desire

568
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,840
 for you and for me to grow in wisdom.

569
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,760
 Let's all pray.

570
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,600
 And I'll ask the team to come back up.

571
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:07,560
 Father, we come before you and humble ourselves.

572
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:10,960
 And may your spirit humble our hearts,

573
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,480
 knowing that we are sinful

574
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,040
 and we resist the word of wisdom.

575
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,640
 And I pray and I beg for your grace.

576
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:25,400
 I pray that you will change us and mold us

577
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,800
 so that we'll be teachable.

578
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:32,720
 Our spirit will be obeying to the voice of you.

579
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:38,160
 Speak the word of wisdom in our lives

580
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:42,240
 and grow us and mold us in the way of wisdom

581
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,680
 so that we can grow closer and closer to you.

582
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:51,200
 Perhaps we need to get back to reading your word

583
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,640
 and just work hard on understanding your word.

584
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,400
 Help us, Father.

585
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:02,600
 Perhaps we need to get on our knees to pray,

586
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:08,520
 to pray that we will grow in holiness,

587
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:12,880
 grow in godliness, and to humble ourselves before you

588
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,920
 and acknowledge that you are our God.

589
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,680
 (soft piano music)

590
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,560
 So I pray that you will continue to help us to grow,

591
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,640
 even though it will take hard work.

592
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,920
 We will not be lazy.

593
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:30,040
 We will cling to your mercy

594
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:34,440
 and to grow spiritually and wisely

595
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,160
 so that your name will be honored in our lives.

596
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,120
 In Christ, we pray.
