[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   Welcome to all of you.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   I have a very short message to you.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   This is a very important message, okay?
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   Even though it's a short message, but a very, very important message.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   And this verse in the Bible says,
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   "Give thanks in all circumstances,
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you."
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   Now, you have to pay attention.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   The Bible does not tell us that we have to give thanks for everything,
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   including evils, including injustice, including sufferings in our lives.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   The Bible is not telling us to do this.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   The Bible does not tell us to give thanks for everything.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   The Bible is telling us, "Give thanks in all circumstances,
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   including unhappy circumstances,
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   including some of the painful moments that we have."
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   We can give thanks, and we have the resource
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   to give thanks in all of these circumstances.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   That's what the Bible is talking about.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Now, we thank God.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   We can thank God to be with us,
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   to be present with us in hard times, in difficult times.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   And we can thank God that nothing,
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   including unhappy moments, all of this happened outside,
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   nothing outside of his wisdom for us.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   I don't know if you have played this game called "I Spy."
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   And I give you an amazingly detailed picture,
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   and you have to find what I want you to find.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Have you ever played that, "I Spy"?
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Something like this.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   In a very complicated picture,
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   you have to find the happy, smiling onion, all right?
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Can you see that on the right?
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   You can find it, right?
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Why don't we do this game right now?
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Of course, you can find it right now,
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   but I'm going to show you a picture, the first picture,
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   and you have to find me the happy, smiling onion, all right?
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Why don't we do it by table, okay?
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Why don't we do it by table, okay?
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   See if the people around the table can find the happy onion, all right?
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   The first one is this one, all right?
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   So let's find the happy onion, all right?
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Happy onion.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   If you find it, raise your hand, okay?
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Now, I must tell you there are three.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   There are three happy onions here, okay?
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Where is it?
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Where is it?
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Okay, is it on the right?
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Is it on the right?
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   On the right or on the left?
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Okay, there's a big one right there,
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   and then there's a right one in the lower right.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   And can you find the third one?
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   This table can find the third one.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Where is it?
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Bottom left, yes, yes, yes.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   Can you find it?
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Yeah, these are the happy onions.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Okay, now you have to pay attention.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   Okay, now how many of you couldn't find it?
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   I'll give you a second chance, all right?
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Second one, ready?
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Okay, we do it by table, all right?
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Here's the second one.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   All right, I'm sure you can find the first two.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   Yeah, where's the third one?
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Where's the third happy onion?
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   Where is it?
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   You can find it?
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Okay.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Why is it taking so long?
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Oh, you got it?
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Where is it?
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Oh, there are many.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Okay, all right, here we go.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   All right, there you go, there you go.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   How many of you find it?
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Go on, happy onion.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Well, let me give you the last one, okay?
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Let's try it, all right?
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   Ready?
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Here.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   Where are the onions?
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   Of course, you can find the first one and the second one.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   Where is the third one?
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Again, you guys?
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   Oh, because they're closest to the TV, all right.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   Yeah, right there.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Wano, where is it?
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   It's like right there, right there.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   Okay, all right.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Here are the onions.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   The happy onions, happy onions.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Well, this is something what we do when we give thanks, all right?
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   The exercise of giving thanks or finding things to give thanks for
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   is kind of like finding the onion, the happy onion,
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   in the complicated picture.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   Now, it's much the same way, okay?
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   The Bible is not trying to tell you positive psychology.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   The Bible is telling you there is an understanding of God
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   behind giving thanks.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   God has everything in control.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   Now, what happened this year for you,
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   I'm sure it's kind of like this picture, very complicated.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   So I want you to do one thing for me,
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   to look for ways that you should be thankful for this year.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   So far, we have gone through 11 months in this year.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Now, you have to think.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   You have to rewind.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   Rewind what happened this year.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   And look for things you might have missed.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   And things you can be thankful for.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   Now, this is what the Bible says.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   It's a cultivation of your life.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Cultivate your spirit so that you can center on God
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   who is in control and God who is leading you all the way through.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   There's a famous African-American writer called Alex Haley.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   And in the office of Alex Haley, he's a very famous novelist.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   And in his office, there was a picture called "Turtle on Fencepost."
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   "Turtle on Fencepost."
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   And why does he hang this picture in his office?
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   He says, "Every time I begin to feel proud of myself,
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   I look at the turtle on top of the fencepost,
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   and remember, the turtle did not get there on his own.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   He had help."
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   Now, I think this is the perfect analogy for our life.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   Of course, this phrase "post-turtle" is often used politically.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   Talk about dumb politician.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   But this is an analogy for our life.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   We didn't get there by ourselves.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   We had help.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   And ultimately, God has helped you.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   God has brought you to this place, to this spot.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   So, in the season of Thanksgiving,
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   we can call this "Give Thanks Because Of."
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   Give Thanks Because Of, because every time you look at this picture,
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   as Alex Haley said,
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   we don't get there by ourselves.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   We had help.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   And ultimately, God had helped us.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   That's why we thank God.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   Now, we can call this Thanksgiving exercise
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   "Give Thanks Because Of."
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   Give Thanks Because Of.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   You have success and you have come to this place
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   because of the well-being God has granted you,
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   because of shelter and security.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   That should not be taken for granted.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   Because of the opportunities that is right in front of you
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   so that you can grow, and that is granted by God.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   And the small joys in your life,
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   that should not be taken to be granted.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   And ultimately, Jesus Christ and His cross,
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   the love of God, the grace of God to be with you,
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   that should not be taken granted for.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   This is what we call "Give Thanks Because Of."
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   Right?
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   So try to rewind this year.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   What had happened to you?
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   What have you gone through?
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   Think about the grace of God.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   Think about the providence of God.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   And then there's another level of giving thanks.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   Not only giving thanks because of.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   It's giving thanks even though.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   Giving thanks even though.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   Even though there were challenges and setbacks in your life,
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   there's more inconveniences, frustrations that happened this year.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   Unanswered prayers, perhaps many of those.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   Imperfections in your life.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   Imperfection struggles, flaws that make you more real.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   Make people more real.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   Make your family and your relationships more real,
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   more authentic.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   So think about some difficulties you have faced this year
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   to help you grow in resilience,
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   to help you grow in patience.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.340]   the encouraging prayers
[00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:04.460]   that knows how to be rejected.
[00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:09.300]   These things...
[00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:11.480]   God gave to us.
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.760]   God made us go through
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.880]   these trials and 1957
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:20.980]   these hardships when we were university student so we could go forward
[00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:45.300]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:50.740]   We must remember Jesus Christ and His cross
[00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:53.700]   even though all this happened
[00:15:53.700 --> 00:16:04.100]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:06.540]   A life of thanksgiving
[00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:08.660]   Now as we close our today's worship
[00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:12.060]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:15.220]   I want to invite you to give thanks
[00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:18.940]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:21.700]   And we want to do something together as a church, as a family
[00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:23.420]   as a spiritual family
[00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:26.820]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.620]   And on your tables
[00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:30.580]   you find some ribbons
[00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:32.780]   some broken ribbons
[00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:35.780]   some strips of ribbons
[00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:37.820]   these ribbons are for gifts
[00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:40.340]   okay, wrapping up a gift
[00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:43.900]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:48.420]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:53.740]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:56.780]   Now I want you to do something together
[00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:57.740]   let's do something together
[00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:59.740]   let's rewind what had happened this year
[00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:03.020]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:05.740]   What is worthy of giving thanks?
[00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:08.500]   Right, either setback or challenges or opportunities
[00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.340]   or something that is good
[00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:12.900]   some blessings in your life
[00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:16.540]   count the blessings and count the things that we should be thankful for
[00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:19.820]   and I want to invite you to use the permanent marker
[00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:22.940]   to write it on the ribbon
[00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:27.700]   alright, this is your gift of giving thanks
[00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:30.540]   alright, let's take a moment
[00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:36.740]   to think about what we can give thanks for this year
[00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:39.020]   and think about it, it takes time
[00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:40.820]   look into the details
[00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:45.220]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:53.980]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:17:53.980 --> 00:18:00.260]   Now I want to invite you to do so right now
[00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:02.740]   it can be very general
[00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:07.580]   in the well-being, health, success
[00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:11.540]   small successes in your life
[00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:24.940]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:30.940]   I want you to write it on the ribbon
[00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:34.980]   I want you to do one thing today
[00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:37.940]   if God has reminded you
[00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:42.180]   at least one thing you should be thankful for
[00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:46.700]   maybe one thing you have missed to give thanks for
[00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:52.140]   I want you to write it on the ribbon and then you bring it up here
[00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:56.860]   you can leave your seats and after you have written
[00:18:56.860 --> 00:19:00.380]   the items of Thanksgiving on the ribbon
[00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:03.940]   you can hang it on the cross in front of me
[00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:10.740]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:13.300]   or do a small prayer
[00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:15.980]   you say, "God, thank you"
[00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:17.860]   you write it down and bring your ribbon
[00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:21.340]   and hang it on to the cross in front of me
[00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:29.980]   [speaking in Cantonese]
[00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:34.980]   [music]
