[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   [Music]
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   Hello, everyone! I'm Miss Rebecca. Welcome back to Family Sunday School.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   This time we're going to review what we talked about last time.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   Last time we talked about Last Supper.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   And one of the points, one of the themes was "Jesus is the Bread of Life."
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   Last time we talked about a lot of buns, right?
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Have you played the bun game?
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   Have you learned that there are many different cultures and people all over the world that need buns?
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   I'll give you a book to read. It's a cover and there's a little bit of content in it.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   I'm using this book for my kids to read.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   But you can also use other books in the library about buns or how to make buns.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   This book actually talks about a lot of different kinds of buns.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   If I give you a quick summary, you'll know how people need buns.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   Why is the bun in Last Supper so important?
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   The symbolism of the bun is that it represents Jesus' body.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   Jesus' body represents the bun.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Why?
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   We need to look at Old Testament.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   In Old Testament, the God/Goddess was tied up by the Egyptians.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   When they were slaves, they were God/Goddess.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   They were taken out of Egypt.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   They were taken out of Egypt and they could leave Egypt.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Leave slavery, flee Egypt.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   They crossed the Red Sea. Moses crossed the Red Sea.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   God/Goddess walked across the Red Sea.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   They had to wait.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Wait for when to make a promise.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   What did they eat?
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   God/Goddess said,
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   "It's better to be a slave. At least I have food. I'm starving."
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   God/Goddess heard them complain.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   If God/Goddess could bring you out of Egypt, what else couldn't God/Goddess do?
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   At that time, manna would fall from the sky.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   It's like a food bun falling from the sky.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   In Old Testament, we see that the bun, the manna,
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   if you eat it, you will be full that day.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   But it doesn't mean you won't die.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Fast forward to the New Testament.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   The Savior has come.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Jesus is born.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   If you eat the bun, you will live forever.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Very different, right?
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   What kind of bun can live forever?
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Pineapple bun? No.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Hamburger bun? No.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   The rabbit bun? No.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   The cow bun? No.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Only Jesus.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   So why did Jesus tell the disciples,
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   "My body is like a bun.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   If you eat this bun, you will live forever."
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Because he knew the culture and the history of the bun.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   He remembered to slowly connect with it.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Okay, this is the bun.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Next one.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   The second point I mentioned last time is
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Do you remember Judas left the group to betray Jesus?
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Remember? Jesus' family.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   I asked you last time,
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Why did Judas do that?
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   What will happen next?
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Jesus knew.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Why did he do that?
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Why did he allow that?
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   Remember?
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   This is the great saving plan.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   God's great plan to save people.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   God's plan must be fulfilled.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   God said he would do it.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Jesus said it would happen.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   It will happen.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   But does it have to be so bad?
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   We will continue the story today.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Answer a lot of different questions.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   And refer to different points.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   I will ask you questions too.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   But before we start, let's play a game.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Come with me.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   Hello, let's play a game.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   What am I?
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   I will show you different photos.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Ready?
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Hmm, a wheel.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Hmm, a screw.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   Hmm, what is this?
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   Can you guess?
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Let's start.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Art rack.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   We need to dry our paintings in art class.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   There are many art class teachers.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   You can dry many paintings in this rack.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   You can open and close it.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   Okay?
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Next one.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   What am I?
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Focus.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   Hmm.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   Hmm.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   Can you guess?
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   Hmm, what is this?
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   Hmm.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   Hmm, what is this angle?
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   What angle is this?
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Hmm.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   Can you guess?
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   Hmm, a big circle.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   What is this?
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   Let's start.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   It's a stool.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Ha ha.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   Can you see?
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   This is the seat.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   This is the angle.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   This stool can be turned.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   This is the screw.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   This is the plate.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   This is a foot.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   Ha ha.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   Okay, next one.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   I guess you can guess.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   Let's start.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   Hmm, what is this?
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   It looks old.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   Hmm.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   This is the screw.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   This is not the screw.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   This is a nut.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   Hmm.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   Hmm?
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   What is this?
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   What is the hint in this picture?
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   This angle is a bit different.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   What is this?
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   Can you guess?
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   Let's start.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   Maybe many children have not seen this.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   Or adults, parents have seen it.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   Okay, let's start.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   Radiator.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   It's a radiator.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   It's not a central air radiator.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   There are many gadgets on the side.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   This is the angle.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   This is the coil.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   This is the switch.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   This is the big screw.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   Wow.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   We have so many "What am I?"
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   I want to remind you.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Hmm.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   If you look at it from different angles,
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   you can't see the whole picture from every angle.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   Right?
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   We think with this mentality.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   We will talk about the Bible story.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   Perspective.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   Point of view.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   Angle.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   Alright?
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   Bible story time.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   Hi, it's story time.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   Where did we leave off last time?
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   Where did Jesus tell Judas,
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   "Do what you have to do."
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   What did Judas do?
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   He betrayed Jesus.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   Telling others where Jesus is.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   Because many leaders don't want Jesus there.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   They want Jesus to leave.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   But they can't find Jesus.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   They are afraid.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   Because the public loves Jesus.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   They like him.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   Because he did a lot of good things.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   But they can't find out where he is.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   Only the people inside will know.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   Right?
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   In this video,
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   Judas went to find Jesus.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   Jesus went outside.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   He called other leaders.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   "The time is here."
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   "I will be caught."
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   "You have to protect yourselves."
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   "Don't sleep."
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   "Pray to the Lord to help you."
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   "You can resist all the attacks."
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   "All the temptations."
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   But they fell asleep.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   Jesus started praying.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   He asked God,
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   "I know this plan must be fulfilled."
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   "But if it is possible, can we not do it?"
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   "But I know your will is my command."
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   "God, whatever you want."
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   He finished praying.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   What happened next?
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   Judas told the soldiers,
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   "Hey, the one I love is Jesus."
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   Wow!
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   Let's see.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   This is Judas.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   The people next to him.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   "I know this is Jesus."
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   Not everyone has seen Jesus.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   Not everyone knows who to catch.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   Now he knows.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   What happened next?
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   Peter.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   Jesus said to Peter,
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   "Peter, you will deny me."
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   "Pretend not to know."
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   "Deny."
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   "You know me."
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   "You pretend not to know me."
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   "Of course it's not me."
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   "Never."
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   This is Peter.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   He picked up a sword.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   Jesus said, "Protect yourselves."
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   "Bring the swords."
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   "Because there will be an attack."
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   Before, they went around with Jesus.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   They talked to people.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   They didn't need swords.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   Now they need them.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   Peter took out his sword.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   What did he say?
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   He didn't say anything.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   He just cut open the soldier's ear.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   First, was his aim good?
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   Wow, he cut it open.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   I don't think the soldier expected this.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   But we know from Peter's perspective,
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   from his perspective,
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   he loves Jesus very much.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   He loves Jesus very much.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   He is a good friend.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   He must defend Jesus.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   No matter what, he will protect Jesus.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   "Hiyah!"
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   What do you think of Jesus?
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   What do you think of Jesus?
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   "Put the sword down."
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   "Put the sword down, Peter."
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   The soldier's ear was cut off.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   Remember, he was bleeding.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   He was bleeding.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   Ouch, it hurts.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   What does Jesus do?
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   He didn't take him to the hospital.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   He didn't need stitches.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   He didn't need to do much.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   He just put his hand on the soldier's ear.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   Healed.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   Right?
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   Right?
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   If Jesus can be blind,
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   he can also be able to see.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   If he can cut off the soldier's ear,
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   he can also be able to see.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   Wow.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   Jesus said,
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   "I have to go."
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   "This is part of the plan."
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   "This has to happen."
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   "I just had last supper with you."
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   "I just had last supper with you."
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   "This has to happen."
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   "This has to happen."
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   Look, Jesus followed the soldier.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   "Arrest."
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   He arrested him.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   We are in the modern world.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   In the modern world,
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   what is "arrest"?
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   Right?
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   Is it tying his hands?
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   Or using a rope?
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   Or carrying him out?
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   No, no, no.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   The Bible says,
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   Jesus followed them.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   He allowed them to arrest him.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   He allowed them to arrest him.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   Because if Jesus didn't allow it,
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   how could he do it?
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   He could cut off his ear
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   and touch it.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   He could do it.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   He could do it.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   But if he tied his hands,
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   tied his hands,
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   tied his hands,
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   he couldn't tie him up.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   Big point here.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   Right?
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   Hmm.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   I wonder.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   I wonder.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   What are these two soldiers
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   thinking?
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   From their perspective,
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   what's happening?
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   What are they thinking of?
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   What are they thinking of?
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   From their perspective,
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   they are thinking,
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   "Hey, we are here to arrest you."
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   "By accident,
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   someone cut off your ear."
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   "The blood is flowing."
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   "But I want to arrest that person."
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   "Wow,
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   he is a fake."
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   "He is not a real son of God."
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   "Why did he touch my ear
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   and it healed?"
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   Hmm.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   We said
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   we should think from perspective.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   Right?
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   I will give you some time.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   Let's talk about it.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   This soldier
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   was cut off his ear.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   He was touched by Jesus.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   His ear healed.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   But what about this soldier?
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   Remember,
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   this story is about
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   perspective.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   Angle.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   Point of view.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   From different angles,
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   we see the same thing.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   Just like the game.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   We will understand
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   the whole story
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   more completely.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   The Bible did not say
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   how this soldier
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   saw the story.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   But we can think about it.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   We can guess.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   We can imagine.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   Right?
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   I will pause the video
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   with this question.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   If you are
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   this soldier,
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   you see so many things.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   What is your perspective?
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   What is your story?
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   What will you think?
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   What will you say to your wife
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   when you get home?
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   What will you say to your children
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   when you get home?
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   What will you say to yourself?
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   Pause. Discuss.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   I told you to pause.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   Why did you pause?
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   Pause. Discuss.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   What will this soldier see?
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   What angle?
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   Perspective.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   He has different perspective from Peter.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   Different perspective from Judas.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   Right?
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   I expect you paused.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   I will discuss with you again.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   Here we go. Let's continue the story.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   Do you remember who said,
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   "Jesus, where are you going?
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   I will follow you."
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   Do you remember who said that?
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   Yes. Peter.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   And do you remember
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   who said that?
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   When we first started talking about the story,
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   the story of Last Supper,
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   Jesus asked this soldier to set up a table
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   for the people to eat.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   Who was that?
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   John.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   John is often
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   the one
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   who loves the most
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   in the Bible.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   The one who Jesus loved.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   That was John.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   What will they do?
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   After all these things happened,
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   what will they do?
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   What will they do?
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   Can you see where they are?
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   Look!
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   There is John.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   He is the youngest
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   among the people.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   Youngest.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   Who is this?
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   Peter is holding a sword.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   They are following him.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   They are following him.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   Right?
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   His beloved Jesus was taken away.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   But what are they forgetting?
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   What is he forgetting?
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   Who is this?
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   Jesus!
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   Jesus was taken away
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   by them.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   Do you think Jesus will be in trouble?
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   Do you think
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   what will John and Peter
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   do next?
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   What are they thinking now?
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   Let's talk about this
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   when we debrief.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   This is the end of the story.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   We will continue next time.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   We just finished
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   the story of the Bible.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   Today's topic is
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   perspective.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   Point of view.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   Now, let's think about
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   the story just now.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   If we look at it from different perspectives,
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   different perspectives,
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   different point of view,
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   from different perspectives,
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   there are many different angles.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   Do you remember our game?
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   We have many different perspectives
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   to build a comprehensive story.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   to build a comprehensive story.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   to build a comprehensive story.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   If we don't have a comprehensive story
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   or we can't see it in detail,
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   we are not comprehensive enough.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   Right?
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   In the Bible,
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   when Jesus was taken away,
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   when Jesus prayed
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   in the garden,
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   there are many different accounts
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   in the Gospel.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   In the Gospel,
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   we see
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   there is Luke,
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   John, Matthew, Mark.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   But if we
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   can use our brain
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   to think from different angles,
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   what will we think?
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   Although
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   it is not necessarily mentioned in the Bible
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   that John has a perspective,
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   because John is
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   an author in the Gospel.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   He is a writer.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   We can also see
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   a little bit of Jesus' perspective
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   a little bit of Jesus' perspective
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   because he is in the garden.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   Right?
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   We can imagine Peter's perspective.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   We can imagine Peter's perspective.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   We can also imagine
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   Judas' perspective.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   Judas' perspective.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   Let's take some time
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   to think about it together.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   First, we have
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   Jesus.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   So, pretend.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000]  假設你是Jesus
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   Hello, my name is Jesus.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   現在發生這件事,你會想什麼?
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   If you were Jesus,
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   what would your story be like?
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   如果你是耶穌的時候,
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   你的故事會怎樣變?
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   你的角度會怎樣?
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   從Jesus的角度
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   會怎樣看這個故事?
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   Pause
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   想一想
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   再回來,我告訴你
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   One version of
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   耶穌可能會有
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   這樣的角度來看
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   第一個
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   If I were Jesus
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   記得我們看到他在
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   花園裏面嗎?
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   他還在祈禱
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   他的角度就是
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   A bit of
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   什麼?
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   Exhausted
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   是不是? 很累喔
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   神啊
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   如果你這個計劃
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   可以沒有這一部分
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   可不可以呢?
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   這麼辛苦,可不可以呢?
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   其實,耶穌
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   會不會真的很累?
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   他做了這麼多神蹟,救了這麼多人
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   但也有人
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   要追殺他
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   還有門徒好像
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   怎麼說都不明白
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   叫他不要睡覺
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   祈禱
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   因為那些人會來抓我
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   要保護自己
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   祈禱完,發生什麼事?
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   睡不著
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   他的角度,耶穌的角度
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   會怎麼說這個故事呢?
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   我們想起
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   Judas,即是出賣耶穌的那位
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   用錢來交換
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   告訴別人
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   耶穌是誰的那位Judas
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   我們未必很清楚
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   當時的那一刻
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   出賣耶穌
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   出賣耶穌之前,他在想什麼
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   但我們可以幻想
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   我們可以想想
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   如果假設我們是Judas
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   我們會在想什麼呢?
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   我就帶他們去找耶穌
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   我親那口,那個男人
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   那個就是耶穌
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   就是這麼多
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   哇!
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   剛剛親完他
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   彼得就去
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   把那個男人的耳朵切下來
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   不知道是不是很壞呢?
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   耶穌還救回那個soldier
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   還弄好他的耳朵
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   覺得很矛盾
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   為了這麼少錢
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   出賣耶穌
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   好像很壞
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   我們再想想
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   如果從另一個角度來看
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   另一個角度
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   第二個觀點
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   彼得
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   彼得就是
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   把耳朵切下來的那個
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   記得他嗎?
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   就是那個
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   耶穌,你去到邊,我跟你去邊
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   耶穌,你死,我跟你去死
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   我永遠是你的朋友
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   我不會否認你的
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   I won't deny you
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   我不會否認你的
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   到這個地步
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   如果彼得要說這個故事
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   他會怎麼說呢?
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   你們休息一下
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   你們大家談吧
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   如果我是彼得
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   我怎麼會說這個故事呢?
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   我怎麼重複給人聽呢?
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   If I were Peter
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   How would I tell the story?
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   是啊
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   耶穌就祈禱完
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   找我們滿堂
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   但是很失望,我們又睡著了
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   他明明叫我們不要睡
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   叫我們祈禱
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   但是,期期下,真的很累
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   我都不以為我會睡覺
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   由這麼多人之中
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   我當然要為了耶穌祈禱
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   當然要為了大眾祈禱
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   當然要為了大眾祈禱
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   但是,又不是睡著了
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   之後,哇,大件事了
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   之後,哇,大件事了
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   朱迪斯來
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   親了耶穌一口
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   帶了一些不知道什麼軍人來
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   抓耶穌
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   哇,真是大件事
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   但是呢
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   我呢,就不會
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   站著不做事的
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   生氣得我
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   拿著劍
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   斬了那個軍人
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   蘇州的議席下來
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   怎麼樣?生氣吧
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   這樣對待耶穌
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   耶穌做了多少好事
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   耶穌愛多少人
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   這樣對待他,不得了
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   不行,我是不會容許的
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   對了
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   又是衰衝動
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   又是衰衝動
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   又是衝動
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   耶穌就說,叫我放下劍
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   這樣,很厲害
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   他一碰那個人的耳朵
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   哇,明明在那裡流血
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   這樣碰一碰,好像
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   魔術
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   但是,耶穌不是魔術師
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   耶穌是神的兒子,就是神
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   當然可以治好,對吧?
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   哇,治好了,叫我放下劍
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   那我當然
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   聽聽話,放下劍
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   但是,我還是不服
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   我也要跟蹤他們
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   看他帶耶穌去哪裡
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   我會永遠跟著他
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   永遠跟著耶穌
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   看他帶他去哪裡
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   OK,現在有很多
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   不同的角度看,對吧?
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   剩下誰?
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   剩下誰?
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   John,是不是剩下約翰?
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   對了,John就是
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   剛開始的故事
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   他幫人
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   設置桌子,對吧?
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   耶穌叫他擺好位置
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   我們要吃 Passover
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   乖乖地,你知道John
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   是全部
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   門徒之中最小的
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   經常John寫
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   福音的時候
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   他說
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   Jesus is most loved, Jesus is beloved
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   就是耶穌最疼的那位
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   其實我們看到他的故事
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   玩到
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   Love, and follow,對吧?
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   那如果他
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   故事怎麼說呢?我們其實知道
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   因為聖經裡面
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   有John的帳號
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   我們可以讀,但是假設
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   如果你是John
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   你會怎麼看呢?
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   關一鈊,你們聊聊
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   回來
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   我給你我的版本
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   我的版本給你聽
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   但是我們有聖經可以看
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   可以看John
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   是有哪些細節有
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   哪些細節沒有
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   如果我是John
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   If I were John
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   我會怎麼說這個故事呢?
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   OK
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   耶穌祈禱完就出來
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   我就
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   起了身
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   我已經睡了
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   然後很多事發生
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   明明
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   要跟隨耶穌
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   去很多不同地方
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   為什麼有這麼多事發生?
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   吃
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   吃宵夜之前
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   祂就每個人幫我們洗腳
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   哇
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   祂真的很疼我們
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   之後又說了很多事
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   說祂要走
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   說我們要吃祂的身體
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   要吃麵包
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   喝酒
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   喝酒要吃祂的血
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   說著說著
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   都好像重複很多不同的東西
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   但是又不是太清楚
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   祂想說什麼
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   祂出來祈禱
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   不知道祂想說什麼
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   貿貿然
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   來了一個Judas
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   Judas吃了他一口
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   彼得又
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   割了人家耳朵
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   耶穌又救了他
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   又治好他
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   然後耶穌就
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   跟著那兩個軍人走
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   只是這樣走
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   跟著他們走
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   我就很愛耶穌
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   耶穌那麼疼我
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   我當然要跟蹤他們
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   看他們帶我和耶穌去哪裡
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   我一定會在他們旁邊
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   他們那麼疼我
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   我一定會聽他們的話
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   他們一定有東西要告訴我們
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   知道是什麼來的
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   因為
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   我們那麼愛他們
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   他們那麼愛我們
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   一定要跟蹤他們
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   慢慢小心地跟蹤他們
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   OK
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   我們回想起來
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   有那麼多不同的角度的時候
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   你覺不覺得這個故事
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   這樣看是比較全面一點呢
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   我們不會知道
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   為什麼有某些部分
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   聖經裏面沒有說
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   為什麼某些角度聖經沒有說
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   但是我們作為人
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   我們作為想到東西的人
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   感覺到東西的人
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   其實可以幻想的
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   我們讀其他故事書也是
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   是不是
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   如果讀Three Little Pigs
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   那我說
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   如果一個狼說一個故事
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   會怎麼說一個故事呢
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   那變了是你可以
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   不同的角度去看一個故事
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   好像我們玩的遊戲一樣
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   你反轉一個故事
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   來參考、來了解
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   反轉看一個比較深入的細節
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   你會看到些什麼呢
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   看到很多不同的東西
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   我們可以求神
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   祈禱說神啊
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   幫我們看到這個故事
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   雖然很多次聽過這個故事
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   但是如果用不同的角度來看
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   可以
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   多認識一些東西
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   可以了解你多少呢
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   求你幫我們
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   謝謝耶穌
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   故事怎麼繼續
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   耶穌跟了那兩個軍人去哪
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   之後會發生什麼事
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   哇
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   下一集再說
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   OK 大家準備好了嗎
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   中文時間
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   我整個episode
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   就講角度
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   Perspective
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   Angle
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   其實中文角度
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   即是甚麼意思呢
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   其實就是
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   角度
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   中文角度即是甚麼意思呢
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   角
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   角度即是角
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   Corner
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   度
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   角度
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   你可以說
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   一個triangle
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   一個triangle
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   三角形
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   三
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   一二三
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   三個角
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   Three corners
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   三個angle
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   角度
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   角度和
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   角
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   同樣的
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   周圍看看
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   你周圍的東西
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   哪些有角呢
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   甚麼東西有角呢
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   我就叫我兒子去找
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   你們可以
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   拍住他
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   OK
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   我叫我兒子去找東西有角
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   甚麼東西有角呢
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   你告訴別人
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   你找到這本書的角在哪
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   這裡
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   即是corner
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   這裡有角
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   這本書的形狀
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   是長方形
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   長方形有多少個角呢
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   How many
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   四個
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   你數吧
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   一二三
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   四
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   四個角
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   角又可以想corner
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   角又可以找角度
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   angle
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   或者perspective
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   在我的可以
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   例子就是在我的角度
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   來看
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   我覺得
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   應該日日吃雪糕
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   So from my point of view
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   From my angle
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   I think everyday we should eat ice cream
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   Who thumbs up
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   You agree
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   但或者媽咪會講
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   唔係喎
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   從媽咪的角度來看
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   日日食雪糕
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   唔健康喎
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   媽咪says wait
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   From a mom's point of view
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   Eating ice cream everyday
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   Isn't healthy
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   Or
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   Agree
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   Disagree
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   Or so so
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   我們可以有唔同個角度
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   Let's see
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   What else is a 角
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   Corner
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   Street corner
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   街角
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   So when you say I'll meet you at the corner
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   我喺街角等你啦
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   Corner
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   角
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   Right
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   And then when you go to the corner
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   Stand in the corner
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   Or put it at the corner
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   角一頭都係有個角字
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   Challenge
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   If
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   如果三角形
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   Triangle
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   係叫三角形
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   Hexagon
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   係乜嘢
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   中文hexagon
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   係點講
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   下次你答我
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   See you later
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   Bye
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000]   大家而家到返
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   At home extension
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   喺屋企點樣可以深入啲
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   講呢個故事俾小朋友聽呢
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   我就呼籲大家
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   攞返大型嘅成經
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   Your Bible
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   去返John 18
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   約翰第十八章
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   讀返嗰度係講返Jesus is Arrest
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   之前都可以睇返
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   Last Supper 嗰啲
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   我就想你讀俾小朋友聽
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   或者一齊讀都好
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   讀完就想問你哋
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   睇下
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   Miss Rebecca 做嗰個
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   edition, 嗰個 version
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   Of John 嘅角度
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   同其實神想我哋讀John
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   嘅角度有啲咩出入
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   有啲咩唔同呢
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   點解
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   One, Teacher Rebecca 係幻想
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   但係喺
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   聖經裏面嗰個 perspective
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   嗰個角度 from John
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   咁就我哋知
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   亦都可以講俾小朋友聽
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   其實福音, Gospel 有四個 account
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   係咪?
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   都係可以講緊 Last Supper
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   都係可以講緊 Jesus is Arrest
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   都係可以講緊 Easter Story
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   點解要四個呢?
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   有
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   Matthew, Mark, Luke 同埋 John
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   一個咪夠囉
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   點解要咁多個?
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   嗱, The Bible 唔會錯㗎嘛
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   係咪?
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   連 Easter Story 嘅 Gospel 都有四個 account
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   證明
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   神都想我哋睇唔同個角度嘅嘢
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   係咪?
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   抽出唔同嘢出嚟
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   係一個 story 都可以抽出唔同嘅嘢
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   變咗點呀?
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   嗰個 story 會有多啲意思, more meaning
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   嗰個 story 會豐富啲, richer
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   [Music]
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   [Music]
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   [Music]
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   [Music]
