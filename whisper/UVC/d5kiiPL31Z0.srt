1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
 Pastor Mark for our spiritual today. Hey guys, good morning. Uh, one wish it has to one another

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:12,000
 some of the neighbors, uh, right next to you. Um, good to be, uh, together as the people of God to

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:21,360
 worship together. And, um, yeah, today, uh, we're going to, uh, talk about this topic. Uh, we're

4
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:27,600
 going to continue this series on new, new heaven and new earth. Try to picture what heaven looks

5
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:34,720
 like. Try to picture what heaven is like. Right. And, um, there were a lot of different images

6
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,120
 found in the Bible, especially in the new Testament that talks about what our future home

7
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,640
 looks like. I will like the, uh, the weekly devotional is tied to our preaching series.

8
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:51,600
 Uh, it's on our future home. Uh, last time we were talking about John 14 and, uh, Jesus was saying,

9
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:59,760
 I'm going to, uh, prepare homes for you and a place for you in heaven, in my father's house.

10
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,880
 And we're going to continue this topic because the Bible has so much to say about our future home.

11
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:12,880
 In the old Testament, in the book of Isaiah, it talks about the future kingdom, new cosmos,

12
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:19,680
 new creation is going to be without pain and without tears, without crying, without all this

13
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,760
 suffering. And it will be a righteousness dwelling in the new heaven and new earth.

14
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:32,400
 That's the book of Isaiah. And then in the book of Revelation, the last book of the Bible also

15
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,080
 talks about the new heaven and new earth. And we'll get to that in the future. But today we're

16
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:46,000
 going to understand one of the images of new heaven and new earth that Jesus gave. Uh, it is

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:54,240
 about wedding, a wedding banquet. All right. Um, I'm sure you have been to a wedding banquet, right?

18
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:03,200
 Haven't you? To a wedding banquet, to a wedding feast, uh, go to a ceremony and all that. And

19
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,880
 Jesus has something to say about it. So there are three points I want to cover today. It's the

20
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:16,480
 importance of the banquet in Jewish wedding, especially. And the second point I have is the

21
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,640
 invitation to the, to the wedding banquet. And then the third one, how do we prepare to be part of

22
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:29,520
 the wedding banquet in heaven? The first thing is the background. We need to understand how

23
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:37,600
 important this for the Jewish people in Jesus' days, how they see, uh, the Jewish, uh, wedding,

24
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:46,480
 you know, uh, the entire, uh, Jewish wedding and marriage custom can be understood in three stages.

25
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:55,840
 The first stage is, uh, what we call the arrangement. Now in the, uh, in the old days,

26
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:02,960
 in, in the first century, uh, people would have their marriage arranged when they were about,

27
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:11,600
 for guys, uh, about 17, 18 years old. They're going to build a family together. And girls

28
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:18,880
 probably would get married about 14, 15 earliest. So it's pretty, pretty, uh, early compared to our

29
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:25,040
 modern, modern lifestyle. Uh, well, when you are 17, 18 year old, you know, you're building a family,

30
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:31,680
 you're an adult, right? Today is kind of different, right? You know, men who are probably 50 years

31
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,920
 old, they're still adolescent. Uh, they're still teenagers. Uh, today is different, but, uh, in

32
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,040
 the first century, uh, before you're 20 years old, you're, you're, you're going to get married and,

33
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:49,920
 uh, you're going to build a new family. And that is what the, uh, parents of both sides,

34
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,280
 they will come together and do some arrangement. And the arrangement is very, very serious because

35
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:01,920
 in the first century in the Jewish society, marriage is a transaction. It's an economic,

36
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:08,320
 financial transaction, especially for those who are, uh, from the rich families, uh, those who

37
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:16,160
 are from the priests or the sacred families. Uh, they will, uh, have a lot of terms to lay out,

38
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:23,760
 especially for both sides of the parents. They will come together and talk about money. Now, uh,

39
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:30,640
 today, how much do you spend average on a wedding? How much spend on a wedding?

40
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:38,800
 You remember? How much do you spend on your wedding? Today, probably, uh, I think the low,

41
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:50,000
 the low end is about maybe 50,000. No? 50,000. Yeah. Uh, something like that. Right? Well, the,

42
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,320
 the, the sky is a ceiling. Uh, it's a lot of money. So in the old days as well, when they talk

43
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:02,880
 about marriage, when they talk about wedding, they need to talk about finance and usually, uh,

44
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:08,720
 because it was in the patriarchal society, usually you think the man's side going to pay for it or

45
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:15,920
 the, uh, the, uh, the bride's side going to pay for it. Who's going to pay for it in Jesus day?

46
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:26,960
 Usually the man's side going to pay for all the major expenses. Right? Now, if, if, if I live in

47
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:33,440
 that kind of society, I better not have my son get married. Uh, my daughter is okay. Yeah. Um,

48
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:40,640
 so this is the arrangement side. And after they lay out all the terms and then, um, they were

49
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:47,200
 going to the second stage, be troval, which is kind of like today's engagement. But in those

50
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:53,120
 days it was a little bit more serious. You remember Joseph and Mary, Jesus, father, mother,

51
00:05:53,120 --> 00:06:01,840
 Irving, father, mother. Yeah. They were in, in this stage, they were engaged and legally speaking,

52
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:10,000
 they were already husband and wife. So, uh, so it was kind of tricky when Mary report to Joseph,

53
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,600
 Hey, I got pregnant by the Holy spirit. Uh, it's going to big bomb for, for Joseph. Right? So he

54
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,960
 has to go to the court, uh, probably some local court to get some certification to a divorce.

55
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:27,520
 Right. But he didn't, right. He didn't. Anyways. Uh, so this, this is the second stage and it's

56
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:35,360
 kind of like today's, uh, engagement and from, uh, our, our first part of this series, I talk,

57
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:42,160
 I talk about the farewell discourse of Jesus. Remember the book of John chapter 14 to 17,

58
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:49,680
 there was long passage talking about, uh, recording Jesus' speeches to the disciples. He said,

59
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,360
 I'm going to leave you now, but I'm not going to abandon you because I'm going back to the

60
00:06:53,360 --> 00:07:00,720
 father's house to prepare a home for you. And this is what the, uh, the, the groom will do

61
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:08,480
 in this stage after they were engaged. After they enter into the second stage of betrothal,

62
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:17,280
 the groom, the man will, will promise the bride, I'm returning to my father's house and by my

63
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:23,920
 father's house, I will build another house. I will prepare a place for you. And, but I will come back

64
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:32,240
 usually one year later to take you. I will come back for you. This is the background why Jesus

65
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:38,480
 was talking, uh, in such terms to his disciples. I'm going to prepare a place in the father's

66
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,720
 house for you. There were many places for you, but I'm not going to abandon you. I promise you,

67
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:50,880
 I will come back and we'll take you. And the, and the groom also beside, you know, preparing a place

68
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:58,800
 in the father's house is to make some deposit, usually in some valuables, maybe a wedding ring,

69
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:08,880
 maybe, maybe there were some properties, uh, some commodities that would, uh, give the bride

70
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:16,560
 some sort of promise, some sort of security. Um, so, uh, not only building the father's house,

71
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:24,000
 but also, you know, deposit, depositing some gifts as a security deposit, so-called. Um,

72
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:31,600
 you remember the farewell discourse. Actually, that's what Jesus did. He said, I'm going away,

73
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:37,760
 return to my father's house to prepare a place for you. And also there was some other sermons,

74
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,240
 some other things that Jesus said. If you check one of the key words

75
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:50,080
 occurring in the farewell discourse in those chapters, one of the key words always pop up

76
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:57,840
 is giving. I'm going to give you this, and I'm going to give you that. For example, he said,

77
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:03,920
 I'm going to give you the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit, the counselor will be with you.

78
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:10,560
 So you will not feel abandoned. God is with you. The Spirit of God will be with you.

79
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:19,040
 In chapter 14, Jesus said, I leave you my peace, peace that I grant and I give to you.

80
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,360
 In this world, you shall have tribulation, remember, but you will have peace.

81
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:32,080
 And that is the background of Jesus' farewell discourse. That is the second stage.

82
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:37,760
 And the third stage of the wedding custom is about one year later, the house is ready,

83
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:45,920
 and the groom will go to the bride's village and to take the bride. And of course, in this stage,

84
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,320
 wedding, wedding ceremony, and then of course, come to the conclusion in the banquet,

85
00:09:52,320 --> 00:10:01,360
 the focus is on the couple, right? Focus is always on the couple. Actually today as well,

86
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:08,480
 you know, some weeks ago, I was officiating a wedding for a couple, a lovely couple. And

87
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,840
 we were about to start because everybody gets so, you know, so, so, so,

88
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:24,480
 they want to make sure their wedding, wedding service and wedding program goes well, right?

89
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,720
 So everyone is so tight. Everyone is talking about, okay, we have to do this,

90
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,440
 we don't get it wrong and make sure the order of service is correct, right? And I was,

91
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:40,640
 I was staying there and a couple of photographers, I'm sure they're not very experienced,

92
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:49,280
 new young people doing photography for the wedding. And they come to me and say,

93
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:56,000
 because I'm the officiant, right? And the girl said, "Hey Pastor, your shirt has some wrinkles.

94
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,800
 That is not right. Yeah, can you cover it or something like that?" Right? And you know,

95
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:09,280
 as an experienced pastor, you know, I officiate a lot of weddings. I, you know, I gently remind her,

96
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:17,360
 I said, "Nobody would pay attention to me because everyone's attention is on the couple, right?"

97
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:23,200
 So lo and behold, after the wedding, you know, I got all the photos, right? I got all the pictures,

98
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,480
 very beautiful pictures on the bride and the groom. None of the picture has me on it.

99
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:34,560
 Nobody actually pay attention to the pastor, you know, but that's okay. I officiate it.

100
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:45,360
 So everyone focus is on the couple. It was so in Jesus' day, but of course the,

101
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:55,360
 when the groom going to take the bride to his home, there was a big processional going on,

102
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:01,280
 right? All the people and all the bridesmaid and all the groomsmen, all the relatives and friends,

103
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:11,120
 they were in the processional. And when the bride and the groom about to enter, return to home,

104
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:19,520
 in their hometown, in their home village, they will have an other team of bridesmaid coming out

105
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:26,880
 to meet them, right? Remember the parable of 10 virgins? That's what happened. The 10 virgins,

106
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:35,680
 they prepare oil and they oil them and they were about to receive the new couple into their home

107
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:41,840
 and they will enter into the big banquet hall and there will be a big celebration.

108
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:54,000
 And in this stage, the last stage, probably, the banquet stage and the host family will prepare

109
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:03,760
 all the food and all the wine and all of the items that is needed to give honor to the new couple.

110
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:11,840
 That is the background of John 2. Remember the miracle of Jesus turning water into wine,

111
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:21,600
 right? That is not some magical thing that Jesus did. When they were running out of wine,

112
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:31,200
 in those days, as in today, in those days, it was a big social shame. And Jesus did that miracle,

113
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:37,120
 turning water into wine is to save them from social shame. He displayed His glory,

114
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,480
 at least in the sense that would give the host family the social honor that is needed.

115
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,520
 But remember that miracle is only the first miracle recorded in the gospel of John,

116
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:56,320
 right? First of the seven. And remember what John says? Something along that line of,

117
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:03,040
 you know, this is the first miracle, but it is a pointer to something more glorious coming.

118
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:08,800
 And the gospel of John is the second part. It's the most glorious of all miracles.

119
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:19,440
 It's Jesus dying on the cross, feeling no shame, but glory, glory and honor from God,

120
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:27,280
 because He loves us so much. He was willing to die. And that is the most glorious moment

121
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:33,360
 in the gospel of John. But you remember the, if you keep that in mind, the cultural background,

122
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,240
 the context, you understand what is going on, right? It's not an isolated story.

123
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:48,480
 For those who are invited to the banquet, they had already RSVP. They were already invited.

124
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:54,800
 They got the invitation. And as I said, the host family will prepare everything that is ready

125
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:02,560
 for all the guests to come. And of course, if we enter into the banquet, if we go to the banquet,

126
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,960
 what do we need to do? What do you need to do when you go to a wedding banquet?

127
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:16,000
 You need to bring some money, right? You better bring some money, right? Some gift money, right?

128
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,800
 Because this is a social honor, right? You don't go there empty-handed, empty stomach,

129
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:26,160
 and then you devour the food and then you leave. No, that's not how you, that's not how it goes,

130
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:35,040
 right? You need to bring some gifts, some monetary gift so that you can honor the host family, the

131
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:44,480
 couple. Without doing that, it will be a dishonor. It will be a shame. And of course, on top of that,

132
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:53,280
 if you are invited and you RSVP and you miss the meeting, you did not show up, this is a shame to

133
00:15:53,280 --> 00:16:03,280
 the host family. It's pretty much what we experience today, right? But with a, you know, a bigger

134
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:09,680
 magnitude in those days, in Jesus' day. So the wedding banquet is very, very important. That is

135
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:18,880
 the conclusion of the entire custom. You got to do a big banquet at the end. Because this is so

136
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:25,280
 important in Jesus' day in their culture. That's why Jesus picked on some of the images to describe

137
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:32,880
 the future kingdom, the future heavenly home. When we go there, when we're looking forward to go

138
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:41,760
 there, Jesus said, it's kind of like, very much like a heavenly banquet. I'm sure you've been to

139
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:51,760
 a wedding banquet. Multiply it infinitely. That is the glory of the future heavenly banquet.

140
00:16:51,760 --> 00:17:00,320
 And Jesus used this image or the New Testament Bible uses many of this wedding banquet images

141
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:06,080
 to describe our future home. And one of the passages today, we're going to read that quickly,

142
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:12,720
 is talking about the invitation to the wedding banquet. Matthew 22. Let me read that.

143
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:18,400
 Jesus also told them other parables. He said, "The kingdom of heaven can be illustrated

144
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:24,720
 by a story. A story of a king who prepared a great wedding feast for his son.

145
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:33,360
 When the banquet was ready, he sent out his servants to notify those who were invited,

146
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:40,480
 but they all refused to come. So he sent other servants to tell them, "The feast has been

147
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:46,640
 prepared. The bulls and the feline cattle has been killed. They are ready. Everything is ready. Come

148
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:54,560
 to the banquet." Now what is going on here? This story parable talking about the king preparing a

149
00:17:54,560 --> 00:18:05,040
 banquet for his people. Those who are invited, they should have the royal honor to attend. And

150
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:11,600
 they have already RSVP, right? They reply to the email or click the link, you know, "I'm going to

151
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:19,360
 come." Right? "Come in." And all that. But it's very strange. These sort of people, they are not

152
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:25,440
 willing to come. They are not willing to attend. Now in those days, in the ancient days, there was

153
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:34,160
 no refrigerator. Once you cook something, you got to consume it. Right? You have to have it.

154
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:42,640
 You got to finish it. Because you can't put it back into the fridge and then bring it out again

155
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,760
 next day or two and then put it in the microwave. No, you can't do that in the ancient Palestinian

156
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:57,040
 society. So you have to consume it. That's why the king prepare everything for the banquet and

157
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:02,640
 quickly send out his servants to the nearby neighborhood and say, "Hey, come on. Guys,

158
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:10,000
 this is ready. And you need to come right now." Usually it happen in the evening, at night.

159
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:16,320
 Now pay attention to who are being invited here. Who have RSVP here?

160
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:27,840
 It says those who are already invited. To notify those who were invited, RSVP, right?

161
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:34,000
 It's very strange. They promised to come, but they never come. They're not willing to come.

162
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,440
 What are the excuses do they have?

163
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:48,240
 The story continues. It just said, but the guest, he had invited, he had RSVP,

164
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:55,520
 ignored them and went their own way. One to his farm, another to his business. Other people,

165
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:01,680
 other guests, seized the servants, the messengers, and insulted them and killed them.

166
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:12,160
 So the king sent out another team of servants and trying to urge them, "Come now. This is the

167
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:20,000
 moment. You accept the invitation. You need to show up." The excuses are two. One's going to the

168
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:28,160
 field, to farm. The other one's going to do his business or do some trading. And these two excuses

169
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:34,000
 are lame excuses. You know why? Because I told you some of the background. The banquet happens

170
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:43,680
 at what time of the day? In the evening. At night, right? You never go to, even today, you never go

171
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:52,400
 to a wedding banquet in the morning, right? Usually it's at night. At night, there's no opportunity

172
00:20:52,400 --> 00:21:00,720
 that you have to go to your farm, right? There's no way you can do some trading, right? We work

173
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:08,080
 nine to five. It's after five, right? There's no way you can do all these things and excuse yourself

174
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:19,200
 from attending the royal banquet. The excuses reveals their idols, and the idols is in their

175
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:27,200
 heart. Essentially what they're saying is, "The banquet is not important. It's not worth it.

176
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:36,800
 I'm going back to my work. I'm going back to my farm." You understand when we are confronted

177
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:47,120
 with the heavenly invitation, when the invitation is sent to you by God, usually our excuses

178
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:59,440
 reveal our priority. What's most important? What is worthy in your mind? It is always revealed when

179
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:06,560
 we try to respond to the invitation of the kingdom. When the gospel is presented to you,

180
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:14,480
 you can think of a lot of different ways, excuses, or reasons to reject or refuse it.

181
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:23,280
 But you need to understand in the Bible, those excuses, those reasons, are usually indicators

182
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:31,920
 of what is truly your God. What is God to you? What is most important to you? Now I admit to

183
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:45,440
 all of you, myself included, we are all idols, manufacturers. Remember, I think 400 years ago,

184
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:51,200
 I think 400 years ago, 400 or 500 years ago, there was a reformed theologian called John Calvin.

185
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:59,040
 John Calvin describes human nature, human beings, as idol manufacturers.

186
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:06,960
 We manufacture our own idols. We create our own idols. And we put idols on our exotic place,

187
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:14,240
 and we worship it. And we spend all of our time consuming our energy. And that is your God. That

188
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:24,160
 is your idol. When I prepared this sermon, I was reminded of some of the books that I read from

189
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:31,360
 an atheist called John Paul Sartre. John Paul Sartre was a French existentialist.

190
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:41,120
 Now what does it mean? Existentialism, simply put, means I want to do whatever I want.

191
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:49,360
 My freedom is not, there's no boundary. There's no accountability in my freedom. That is the true

192
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:57,200
 freedom that I have. And John Paul Sartre was saying that. And many of his novels talk about

193
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:08,480
 the death of God. That God is dead. You know, we don't have to regard God as anything, anyone

194
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:14,960
 worthy in our life. You just erase it from your life. You know, reject him from your life. And

195
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:25,520
 John Paul Sartre said, "Belief in God makes my morality impossible." My morality of existentialism.

196
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:33,520
 I want to be free. I don't want to be kept accountable. If God exists, He will keep me

197
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:39,520
 accountable. That's why if I believe in God, it will make my morality impossible, Sartre said.

198
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:49,120
 To which a Dutch theologian replied, "Sartre's morality makes the non-existence of God a necessity."

199
00:24:49,120 --> 00:25:00,080
 It is a necessity for an atheist, for an existentialist, that God does not exist.

200
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:06,640
 It's not because it has been proven that God does not exist. That is not the conclusion,

201
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:12,000
 not the last part of the equation. That the non-existence of God, that God does not exist,

202
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:20,800
 God is absent, is my presupposition, not my conclusion. It is my worldview. It's my own

203
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:30,000
 belief that will etch out God. That is a necessity. I have to etch out God so that I can have my own

204
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:37,600
 life. That is what atheism in his version. Now think about it, this is not just philosophy.

205
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:44,720
 That is essentially what Jesus said in the parable. Those people who have RSVP, they reject

206
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:53,200
 to attend the banquet. It's not because they cannot attend the banquet. Essentially they will not.

207
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:03,760
 It's not because we cannot come to the kingdom. Standing in front of the foot of the cross,

208
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:12,320
 at the foot of the cross, it's not because we cannot accept the invitation.

209
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:24,560
 The invitation of love and grace is not the ability. It is our will. Whether you will come

210
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:31,440
 or not. Now it's explained in the first part. In the ancient society, in Jewish society in Jesus'

211
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:40,160
 day, being invited and RSVP and you are willing, you are not willing to show up, that is an insult

212
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:49,200
 to the host family. Remember Jesus' parable? It's not just one guy, any dude trying to create or

213
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:56,640
 set up a banquet. It's not a certain dude on the street. It's the king. The king is preparing a

214
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:03,520
 banquet for his son. Because his son is getting married. You follow that line, you understand

215
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:10,800
 what the big deal about this banquet. It's the king's son's marriage, wedding banquet.

216
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:18,960
 Now the son is getting married, that means the son will inherit the kingdom. He will have the

217
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:26,640
 kingship. The son is getting married, he will be the king of the kingdom. Not showing up

218
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:38,720
 does not mean social shame alone. It means treason. It means rejecting the kingship.

219
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:49,440
 That is treason. 22.7. The parable goes on. The king was furious and he sent out his army

220
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,960
 to destroy the murderers and burn their town. And he said to his servants, the wedding feast is ready

221
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:00,080
 and the guests I have invited are not worthy of the honor. So go out to the street corners and

222
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:07,920
 invite everyone you see. So the servant did that and they find everyone they could find, good or

223
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:17,120
 bad alike and the banquet hall was filled with all the people. Now why Jesus told this parable at this

224
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:22,000
 point? If you understand context, as we read the Bible, we have to understand context, right? It's

225
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,920
 not to isolate the story. This is chapter 22. What happened in the previous chapter, chapter 21?

226
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:39,440
 Jesus riding on the donkey entered Jerusalem as a humble king, as the loving king. Matthew 21.

227
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:49,760
 He is the king. He is riding the donkey entering the holy city. He is the true king. So he went

228
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:56,000
 into Jerusalem and he cleansed the temple and there were so many debates and controversies between

229
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:06,960
 Jesus and the authorities of Jerusalem, the Jewish people. This parable is ironic because this

230
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:16,320
 parable is trying to condense the entire Old Testament story into 10 verses. What happened

231
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:23,520
 in the entire Old Testament story, Jesus said, is that the king has already, has been inviting

232
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:34,640
 his people to come to his feast to enjoy the time together, to enjoy his food. But his people have

233
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:42,720
 been refusing to come and kill all the servants and those of the Old Testament prophets,

234
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:49,440
 from the first one to the last one, John the Baptist, they killed them all because they are

235
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:58,240
 not willing to honor the son's kingship. And finally they killed the son and crucified him

236
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:06,000
 in Jerusalem. Now this is the last week of Jesus' early earthly life. This parable is trying to

237
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:13,280
 tell us the entire Old Testament story and it ends really bad because in AD 70,

238
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:25,120
 the Romans did come and they came to destroy the temple, Jerusalem. And the temple crumbles

239
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:33,520
 and the people scattered. Jesus is trying to tell us the entire Old Testament story, God and his

240
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:40,240
 people. And because they refused, because they reject the gospel invitation, now the door is

241
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:46,880
 open to other people. Who are they? The Gentiles, right? The Gentiles would come.

242
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:52,720
 All the nations will come because of Jesus, because of the grace.

243
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:59,760
 Then they come to the banquet. That is the invitation. If you reject it,

244
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:07,520
 not because you can or cannot accept it, because you will not accept it,

245
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:14,960
 the consequences are there. AD 70. That's what happened to the Jewish people.

246
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:22,960
 Now the parable could have ended at this point, verse 10. But Jesus continues. Now this is very

247
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:29,360
 interesting because you find similar parables from other books of gospels. But Jesus put on

248
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:38,640
 a twist here. He continued with verse 11 and he talks about how do we prepare to go into the

249
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:45,280
 banquet, to be part of this banquet. Verses 11 and following. But when the king came in to meet

250
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:52,320
 the guest, he noticed a man, there was a dude who was not wearing the proper clothing for the wedding.

251
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:59,680
 He asked, "Friend, how is it that you are here without the wedding clothes?" But the man had no

252
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:07,760
 reply. Then the king said to his servants, "Bind his hands and feet and throw him into the outer

253
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:15,120
 darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. For many are called, but few are chosen."

254
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:24,240
 Now I've talked about the wedding banquet. Usually it lasts for almost seven days. Can you believe

255
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:30,560
 that? If you have a wedding banquet in the Jewish society on Jesus' day, you have to host a banquet

256
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:40,000
 seven days. This is crazy. I attended one of my friend's wedding. The groom is from the Vietnam

257
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:49,440
 family background. They did host for 10 days. It's quite a bit of food. A lot of guests coming in

258
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:57,920
 and out, in and out. But when you attend a banquet, what do you need to do in terms of preparation?

259
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,000
 At least you need to dress up a little bit, right? You can't just go with a fit flop, right?

260
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:11,280
 That would be a dishonor to the guests. It's the same way in Jesus' day. They need to dress up.

261
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:18,080
 Now there are different interpretations of why this dude without the proper clothing.

262
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:28,800
 Perhaps one of the most convincing arguments is that the point is not how he ended up this

263
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:38,160
 way. The point is what his clothing, the proper wedding clothing symbolize. What does it mean?

264
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:48,640
 Now you flip the pages of the New Testament. You'll find proper clothing to enter the kingdom

265
00:33:49,680 --> 00:34:02,000
 is the robe of righteousness, the white robe that is provided by Jesus. He died on the cross. He

266
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:09,200
 sacrificed himself. He redeemed you. And so to speak, you have a new cloth on you. God is not

267
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:16,800
 looking at you. If you are in Christ, if you believe the gospel, God is no longer looking at

268
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:25,360
 you, you know, in your filthy way. You're not a sinner anymore. God look at you just as he looks

269
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:34,720
 at his own son, his perfect holy son, Jesus Christ. That is what we call justification by faith, right?

270
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:44,720
 Justify fully righteous standing in front of God. That is probably what the wedding

271
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:53,760
 cloth is all about. In any case, this parable add a twist at the end that you have believed in Christ.

272
00:34:53,760 --> 00:35:04,080
 You supposed to be sitting in the banquet, but you are not with proper clothing.

273
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:09,280
 That means your relationship with God is a little bit shaky.

274
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:18,160
 Maybe you really don't know Christ. You have not really accepted him as your Lord and your Savior.

275
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:27,760
 Now there are phrases like outer darkness, you know, gnashing and weeping.

276
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:36,880
 Now, what does it mean? If you turn to other passages in the gospel of Matthew, you would

277
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:45,200
 not be surprised. Same phrases are being used as so often in the context of going into entering to

278
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:52,400
 future kingdom. And you find those places, you understand Jesus is saying,

279
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:59,840
 I don't really know you. Who are you? You go out to the outer darkness.

280
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:10,720
 Gnashing of teeth, right? Weeping. You are not going into my banquet because you do not know me.

281
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:19,600
 You have not really put in your faith in me. Now this parable ends with this twist.

282
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:27,440
 It's a great reminder for you and me that we come to the church and we even think that

283
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:35,040
 we are sons and daughters of the King. Are we really? Right? Are we really?

284
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:43,520
 In the gospel of Matthew, it talks about believing in Christ is much more than lip service

285
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:54,080
 in the Word of God. To listen and to walk, right? Of course, God is not looking for a perfect man or

286
00:36:54,080 --> 00:37:01,440
 woman. We can never be perfect in this life. In this side of heaven, we cannot be fully sanctified,

287
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:07,680
 100% sanctified, right? We are clothed by Christ's righteousness. That's why we can enter

288
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:15,120
 into kingdom. But foundationally, in the bottom of your heart, you have this inclination,

289
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:23,760
 the willingness to say to God, yes, you are my Lord. I come before you constantly, regularly.

290
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:32,400
 I want to turn my life to you. I want to obey you. Yeah, help me. Help me. That is your most

291
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:37,840
 fundamental change when you come to Christ. And that is the robe of righteousness. That is what

292
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:44,720
 this parable is all about. You see in the banquet, you better be making sure that you are part of the

293
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:56,560
 honored guest, properly clothed. The future kingdom is like a banquet. If we refuse the invitation,

294
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:05,280
 it's essential, it's essentially, it's like you can try it. Stand at the foot of the cross

295
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:12,160
 and you look at the cross. Jesus sacrificed himself and shed his blood for you.

296
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:19,600
 That you are unworthy. You don't deserve it. But you stand in front of the foot of the cross.

297
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:26,800
 You're saying to the Jesus who died for you on the cross, you said you're not worth it.

298
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:36,640
 Come on. You know, I don't care. This is essentially what the refusal of the kingdom

299
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:46,880
 is like. How can we turn away such a great salvation, such a great, wonderful grace, right?

300
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:54,160
 The parable reminds us we better be sure right now, right? It has been said that

301
00:38:54,160 --> 00:39:02,960
 there will be three wonders when you go to heaven. Three wonders when you step into heaven,

302
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:08,320
 you know, the new world, the new heaven and new earth. The first wonder is that

303
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:19,120
 you will see many in the kingdom whom you did not expect to see. You step into the kingdom, hey,

304
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:27,600
 why are they here? I didn't expect that. But they were here indeed because of the grace of God.

305
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:36,960
 That's the first wonder. The second wonder is that you do not find many whom you expect to see.

306
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:45,760
 I thought they should be here, but they're not here. Why? Because essentially they rejected the

307
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:57,120
 king. That's the second wonder. The third wonder is the greatest wonder of all. When I step into

308
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:09,040
 the kingdom, the greatest wonder should be I find myself there with my robe of righteousness,

309
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:17,680
 credited to me because of what Christ has done for me and knowing I don't deserve.

310
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:28,080
 And that is the greatest wonder. And friends, I want to end this note just as Jesus ended.

311
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:38,080
 The invitation is out there. You are our SVP. You are our SVP by your faith in Christ.

312
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:46,800
 Make Jesus Christ your Lord today. Make him your leader, the leader of your life.

313
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:59,200
 Bow before him and say, "My heart is right here. Please be my Lord. Guide me and help me listen to

314
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:08,800
 you. Help me obey you." We're going to end today with a chameleon. We'll do it once a month.

315
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:15,920
 And we'll put it right at the end today. And there's a long tradition in the church that

316
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:26,160
 chameleon is a foretaste of the future heavenly banquet. And let us pray and prepare our hearts.

317
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:33,120
 This is a foretaste. It's like an appetizer. The future kingdom, the banquet, the perfect,

318
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:44,800
 glorious banquet is ready for us. Take it. Let's all pray. Lord Jesus, we ask that you will make us

319
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:55,760
 one as your church until the final victory of the second coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

320
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:04,240
 We want to give you thanks because we are invited. We can be at your table. We can feast at your

321
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:11,200
 banquet table. All honor and glory to you. And once again, we pray that

322
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:20,640
 that Jesus Christ, our Lord, will be the Lord of all. He is the one

323
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:26,640
 who has the lordship over everything in our lives.

324
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:36,720
 We're going to school, but our school life is under your lordship. Please help us to do so,

325
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:44,240
 to glorify you. Our family, our marriage, our church, our ministry, everything, our career.

326
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:53,680
 You are the Lord. You are the Lord of all. And I pray that today we'll accept this invitation

327
00:42:54,640 --> 00:43:02,880
 to taste, to foretaste of your glorious, heavenly banquet. Thank you for the invitation.

328
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:10,160
 And we're going to accept it with our will. In faith, we put our trust in our dependence

329
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:17,600
 on our Lord Jesus Christ. All glory to you in Christ's name we pray. Amen.

330
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:25,600
 We have a communion table back there. If you're ready to take this foretaste, the appetizer

331
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:31,840
 of the future banquet, you can go ahead and go to the table and get the packet.

332
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:35,840
 And we're going to partake together.

333
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:42,800
 So,

334
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,760
 so,

335
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:59,760
 so,

336
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,720
 so,

337
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:16,720
 so,

338
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:29,680
 so,

339
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:36,080
 but this is the foretaste of the kingdom, the kingdom banquet. Let's partake the bread together.

340
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:49,120
 And the cup as well.

341
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:57,680
 Let's pray a final time. Father, once again, we give you thanks because of the great love that

342
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:04,480
 you have for us. We are standing at the foot of the cross and we are amazed and wonder by your love.

343
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:14,800
 Thank you for accepting us. Thank you for, for, for your righteousness, that we are fully justified

344
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:21,520
 because of what your son has done for us. And thank you for this hope of future banquet.

345
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:30,240
 And I pray that our life will turn to you, will obey you, will listen to your word.

346
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:39,280
 In Christ name we pray. Well, God bless you all and grant you peace in this Labor Day weekend.

347
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:44,480
 Right? Yeah. Thank you for coming. And I hope to see you next week. And we're going to have some

348
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:51,120
 normal Bible study. We're going to have some fun as a fellowship. Okay. You're invited,

349
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:55,840
 right? But you have to pay for it, pay for your own. We're going to barbecue next.
