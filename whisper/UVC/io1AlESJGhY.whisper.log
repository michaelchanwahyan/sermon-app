[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.800]   Hey, thanks Kelly.
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.840]   Let me get my PowerPoint ready, alright.
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.240]   Why don't we pray together?
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.840]   Father, we want to pray to you because you are the King, you are the Lord.
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.680]   Even though sometimes we cannot see your hands, we know that you are still in control.
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.760]   You are still the Lord of history, Lord of our lives.
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.200]   That's why we come before you to worship you.
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.960]   That's why no matter if it is sunshine or it is raining, we come to acknowledge your
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:32.960]   Lordship.
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:39.160]   And we pray that you will help us to put our trust in you, to believe in you.
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.280]   I pray for each and every one of us.
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.640]   Perhaps we are facing some life challenges or crisis.
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:54.760]   I pray that you will grant us the grace to see your authority, your power.
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.160]   You are bigger than all the problems and challenges that we have.
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:09.480]   So pray that we will put our faith in you, wholeheartedly trust you with our full heart,
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:15.000]   no reserve, because you are the Lord, you are God.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.280]   And pray that you will speak to us, pray that you will awaken our soul, our spirit, we will
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.960]   draw closer to you in your presence, in Christ and pray.
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:34.880]   Well we are talking about Apostles Creed and this is a very, very ancient Creed, uh, lasts
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.320]   for over 1,800 years.
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.640]   I mean, can you think of any movement in human history that will last so long, right?
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:52.240]   That will last so long, that would last for all the rise and fall of empires on the earth.
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.920]   But Christianity, the Jesus movement, lasts for so long, right?
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.080]   And this Apostles Creed we're going to go through together, uh, we started last week,
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.520]   uh, lasts for almost 2,000 years, right?
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:16.960]   The Roman Empire, who used to persecute the early churches, they fell in the 5th century.
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:23.720]   But the churches are continuing their movement and they still exist until today.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.220]   And that's why this is so valuable as we look at, uh, the Apostles Creed, uh, going back
[00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.260]   to almost 2,000 years.
[00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.880]   And we said that, uh, the Apostles Creed believes in statements, uh, it begins with statements
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.080]   with "I believe this" and "I believe that."
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:48.080]   And we said that "I believe" does not mean intellectually agreeing upon some proposition.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.960]   In the Bible, "I believe" means "I am believing into God."
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.440]   That is to say, I commit myself to God.
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:02.360]   I'm not just putting checks on check boxes and say, "Okay, I believe in this and I believe
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.360]   in that."
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.140]   It's not an intellectual proposition only.
[00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.200]   It is "I am committing myself to the relationship with God."
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:20.280]   And last week, well, we said, um, "I believe in, uh, God, the Father Almighty, Creator
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.560]   of heaven and earth."
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.760]   And we clarify one thing in the Bible, faith is not making something true.
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.960]   Faith is affirming something that is already true.
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.920]   Okay, can you repeat after me?
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.100]   Faith is not making something true.
[00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.080]   Faith is affirming something that is already true.
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.360]   I believe.
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.140]   I affirm something that is already true.
[00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.060]   So that's why you don't find any passages in the Bible trying to prove to you the existence
[00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.060]   of God.
[00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.060]   The Bible don't do that.
[00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.940]   Instead, in the Bible, you find a God who exists.
[00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:04.460]   You never find the Bible, never find the Bible or in Christian faith that "I believe in the
[00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:05.860]   existence of God."
[00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.220]   No, we don't affirm that.
[00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.700]   Instead, we affirm, "I believe the God who exists."
[00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.500]   Can you repeat after me?
[00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.460]   We don't affirm the existence of God.
[00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:20.460]   You say, "What?
[00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:21.460]   That's a church."
[00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:22.460]   Right?
[00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.460]   No, we don't.
[00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.020]   We don't affirm the existence of God.
[00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.460]   We believe in the God who exists.
[00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.300]   That's a totally different thing.
[00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:37.100]   The first statement, "I believe in the existence of God," is just an intellectual thing.
[00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.980]   But if I believe or I'm believing into the God who exists, who relates to you, who loves
[00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.740]   you, who redeems you, that's a totally different ballgame, right?
[00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.260]   So that is what faith is all about.
[00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:57.220]   And today, I would like to unpack the first statement here and using Psalm 119.
[00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.220]   Sorry, Psalm 19.
[00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.140]   Psalm 19.
[00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.700]   Let me read the first six verses.
[00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.260]   The heavens declare the glory of God.
[00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.340]   The skies, the heavens, proclaim the work of His hands.
[00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.340]   Day after day, they pour forth speech.
[00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.060]   Night after night, they display knowledge.
[00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.460]   There's no speech or language where their voice is not heard.
[00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:30.020]   Their voice goes out into all the earth, worse to the ends of the earth.
[00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.780]   In the heavens, He has pitched a tent for the sun.
[00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:34.780]   God has done that.
[00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.300]   God has pitched a tent for the sun, which is like a bridegroom coming forth from his
[00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:45.300]   pavilion, like a champion rejoicing to run his course.
[00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:52.820]   It rises, talking about the sun, at one end of heavens and make a circuit to the other.
[00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:57.260]   Nothing is hidden from the heat of the sun.
[00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.060]   Now Psalm 19.
[00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.820]   This is only the first third of it.
[00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:08.100]   Psalm 19 is a creative rendition of Genesis 1, the seven days of creation.
[00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:15.660]   And here the Psalm says, the creation of God, the entire cosmos, the entire universe is
[00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:20.940]   like a choir, like a symphony, like an orchestra.
[00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:25.300]   Have you ever been to a symphony theater?
[00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:29.340]   Have you ever done that?
[00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:35.180]   It's like a symphony, singing day after day and night after night.
[00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:40.340]   And this is some spiritual music playing, mysterious music playing, and you have to
[00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:44.020]   listen to it with years of faith.
[00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:49.900]   This is not normal speech, not normal verbal language.
[00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:51.300]   But there it is.
[00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.460]   The creation is proclaiming something.
[00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.080]   It's declaring something.
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.620]   It's singing about God who exists.
[00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:04.200]   God who is behind everything.
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:10.500]   Some years ago, I was listening to a debate.
[00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.740]   It happened in Great Britain, in UK.
[00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:14.740]   So it was some years ago.
[00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:23.740]   I was listening to a debate online between a Jewish Rabbi called Jonathan Sarick.
[00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:32.020]   And then he was debating with the very famous, very well-known atheist, Richard Dawkins.
[00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:43.020]   Both of them are UK people, so they did kind of a radio debate, online debate.
[00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:48.660]   So I was listening to this, and it was a really, really heated debate.
[00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:53.560]   And of course, the Jewish Rabbi, Jonathan Sarick, he was very famous.
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.600]   He passed away not too long ago.
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:00.120]   He was the chief Rabbi of Judaism in Great Britain.
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.320]   And he was debating Dawkins.
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:10.880]   And Dawkins was also a British scientist, and he is known for his atheist standpoint,
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:11.880]   right?
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:16.020]   That there's no God and everything is just matters, right?
[00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:20.920]   And everything is just coming together randomly, and that's why we have life.
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:29.400]   And then, Sax was debating with him, and it was kind of a very heated, engaging conversation.
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:35.920]   I remember one thing Jonathan said with Dawkins.
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:44.040]   The Jewish Rabbi said, said to Richard, "Richard, religion is music, and you are tone deaf."
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:46.080]   And Dawkins said, "Yes, it is true.
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.720]   I am tone deaf, but there's no music."
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:57.720]   I tried to sink in what the Rabbi is trying to say.
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:05.080]   Faith is music, but if you're tone deaf, you cannot hear the music.
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.560]   That's what Psalm 19 is trying to say.
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:16.040]   The heaven is proclaiming, proclaiming the God who exists, the God who loves you, the
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:19.920]   God who made all of this, who is behind everything.
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:25.560]   Faith is the ability to hear the music beneath the noise.
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:33.800]   There are a lot of noises we hear today from our culture, from our social media.
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:40.760]   It's a great thing we have great technology, but also create a lot of noises in our life,
[00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:41.760]   right?
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:51.320]   In order to hear God, you need to understand faith is the ability to hear, to penetrate,
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:56.160]   to hear the music beneath all this noises.
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.640]   The Psalm says there is spiritual music of creation.
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:06.280]   The sun rises in the east every morning and travels to the, to the west.
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:12.760]   Okay, this is a normal, typical, ordinary language.
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:16.080]   The Psalm is not teaching cosmology.
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:21.280]   The Psalm is teaching us theology, talking about God.
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:29.760]   In 1905, looking at the sun traveling from the east to the west, it's like a bridegroom
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:38.600]   coming forth from his tent or pavilion, like a champion rejoicing, running his course.
[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:44.280]   The pavilion behind it, it was the Hebrew word, hopa.
[00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.880]   All right, can you repeat after me?
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:47.880]   Hopa.
[00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.200]   Now, what is that?
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:53.320]   I always find it funny the Chinese would translate like that, all right?
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.000]   If you know Chinese, you know what I'm saying.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.680]   I don't know why, yeah.
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:01.000]   But behind it, it was the Hebrew word, hopa.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   And what is it?
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:09.440]   Now, if you Google that, if you know a little bit about Jewish wedding custom, even today,
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:15.240]   the Jewish couple would come under a tent with four corners, with the rabbi, with the
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.240]   officiant of the wedding.
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:25.600]   So in the entire wedding ceremony, okay, the Jewish couple will come under that tent with
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:32.560]   the rabbi, with the officiant, and they will go through the entire ceremony under the tent.
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.480]   The tent is called hopa.
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:43.160]   All right, so they will officiate the wedding, the Jewish wedding, under that hopa.
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:51.680]   And then when the ceremony concludes, the bridegroom with the bride will go out of the
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:53.920]   hopa.
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:12:00.560]   And in Jewish tradition, it means a new creation, a new family is being created, right?
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:07.520]   A new relationship, new marriage has been launched.
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:16.060]   So when they come out of the chamber or the pavilion, the hopa is a new creation.
[00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:21.240]   So with that picture in mind, Psalm 19 is trying to say, every single morning when you
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:26.680]   wake up today, when you wake up this morning, the sun rises and will follow this course
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:30.240]   across the sky to the west.
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:33.780]   And every day is a new creation of God.
[00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:35.840]   Every day the sun comes out of the east.
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.960]   It's like the bridegroom coming out of the hopa.
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.940]   It is a new song for God.
[00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:44.100]   It is a new song for his love, for his power.
[00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.760]   So every day is a new day.
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:52.920]   And then Psalm 19, not only use that kind of imagery, you know, in the ancient days,
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:13:01.220]   in the ancient Jewish society, or even today if we go to Israel, going to some traditional
[00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:07.060]   Palestinian villages, they will have weddings.
[00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:14.620]   And like in the ancient days, all weddings happening in the village is a public event.
[00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:16.640]   It's an open event.
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:18.740]   Everybody in the village is invited.
[00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:20.740]   Now it's totally different from today, right?
[00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:25.800]   Today if you are getting married or your friends are getting married, usually the people are
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:29.100]   being invited are very selective, right?
[00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.220]   Right?
[00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:32.780]   You have your list of guests.
[00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:37.960]   You're trying to invite, you know, not as many as possible, right?
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.380]   It's always a private, selective event.
[00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:45.920]   But in the ancient days, wedding is always a public event.
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:48.920]   Everybody knows who is getting married next week.
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:51.140]   Everyone is invited to the banquet.
[00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:53.700]   And everyone is a witness.
[00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:57.780]   Because nobody would be so stupid and say, "Who's getting married today?"
[00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:01.420]   It's a totally public event, right?
[00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:09.140]   Psalm 19 is saying, "The music the creation is playing is a public event."
[00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.260]   There's no way you can miss it.
[00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.840]   There's no way you cannot listen to the music.
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:24.700]   If you put on hearing ears of faith, then you will pick up the spiritual music.
[00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:32.500]   There's a guy in United States, very famous, very important person, Francis Collins.
[00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:40.580]   He is the head of the NIH, National Institutes of Health, for some years.
[00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:46.060]   And then he was also the head of the genetic research in the United States, the human general
[00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:48.140]   research.
[00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:56.820]   In 2020, when the pandemic just started, in 2020, Francis Collins was awarded with the
[00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:59.180]   Templeton Prize.
[00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:06.740]   Now the Templeton Prize was an award given to intellectuals who have made significant
[00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:10.220]   contributions to science and faith.
[00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:15.980]   In that sense, these intellectuals who have received the prize every single year, in 2020,
[00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:18.300]   it was awarded to Collins.
[00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:26.820]   He has made a lot of contribution to integrate science and faith, technology and faith.
[00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:35.820]   And by the way, Jonathan Sachs, the UK Jewish Rabbi, he received the same prize in 2016.
[00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:41.660]   So when Collins received that prize, he talked about how he came to faith.
[00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:47.060]   Some years ago, he was a medical doctor and he visited one of his patients who was an
[00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:51.940]   old Christian lady on sickbed.
[00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:57.700]   The lady was suffering enormously because of her conditions and she was dying.
[00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:05.020]   And one day when Collins, as a medical doctor, he went into the room to talk to this lady.
[00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:09.900]   This old lady asked Dr. Collins.
[00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:13.980]   He asked him, "Doctor, I know I'm dying.
[00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:15.500]   I'm going somewhere else.
[00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:17.940]   I know where I'm going.
[00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:20.340]   I know what I believe.
[00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:25.100]   But doctor, what do you believe in?"
[00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:34.300]   And it just dawned on him, as a medical doctor, this cosmic question confronted him and he
[00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:37.180]   didn't know how to answer.
[00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:43.380]   And after that conversation, he took some time to really dig into what this faith is
[00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:48.540]   all about and why this lady who's dying should have no hope at all, right?
[00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:50.140]   Should have no hope at all.
[00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:54.340]   But she is full of hope, right?
[00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:57.980]   And he, as a medical doctor, he couldn't do anything about it.
[00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:02.660]   And he see this lady with hope beyond death.
[00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:07.980]   And he asked himself, "What do I believe in?
[00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:09.980]   What is my belief?
[00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:12.580]   How do I answer that cosmic question, right?
[00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:13.900]   The life and death question.
[00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:14.900]   What do you believe in?"
[00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:17.820]   I will ask you, "What do you believe in?"
[00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:18.820]   Right?
[00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:21.040]   You've been to church.
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:25.220]   You probably grew up in a Christian family.
[00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:27.100]   Good Christian family or bad Christian family.
[00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:29.340]   It really doesn't matter.
[00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:33.620]   You've probably been to church, good church or a bad church.
[00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:35.500]   It really doesn't matter.
[00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.140]   What do you believe in?
[00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:45.140]   And then Dr. Collins spent some, just a little bit, maybe a few years, and then he read C.S.
[00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:51.060]   Lewis' Mere Christianity and find the faith.
[00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:52.060]   So he came to Christ.
[00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:53.700]   He came to believe in Jesus.
[00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:57.620]   And he's still very vocal about what he believes.
[00:17:57.620 --> 00:17:59.620]   He's an evangelical.
[00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:00.620]   He's a believer.
[00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:01.620]   Very good guy.
[00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:02.620]   Very good guy.
[00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:10.900]   In one of his books, The Language of God, you see the DNA there, double helix.
[00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:12.420]   He wrote this book.
[00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:16.240]   And there's one paragraph I want to share with you.
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:23.500]   He said, "While the long history of religious oppression and hypocrisy is profoundly sobering,
[00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:29.140]   the earnest seeker of truth, if you're earnest seeker of truth, must look beyond the behavior
[00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:34.780]   of flawed humans in order to find the truth.
[00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:41.340]   Would you condemn an oak tree because its timber had been used to build battle ramps,
[00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:43.180]   weapons to kill other people?
[00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:46.620]   Would you condemn the tree?
[00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:51.220]   Would you blame the air for allowing lies to be transmitted through it?
[00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:58.220]   Would you judge Mozart's Magic Flute on the basis of poorly rehearsed performance by fifth
[00:18:58.220 --> 00:18:59.220]   graders?"
[00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:00.700]   Have you ever been one of those?
[00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:02.460]   The fifth graders?
[00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:11.580]   "If you had never seen a real sunset over the Pacific, would you allow a tourist brochure
[00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:13.660]   as a substitute?
[00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:19.140]   Would you evaluate the power of romantic love solely in light of an abusive marriage next
[00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:21.140]   door?"
[00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:23.140]   No.
[00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:25.260]   No, you don't.
[00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:33.060]   A real evaluation of truth of faith depends upon looking at clean, pure water, not at
[00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:38.340]   the rusty containers.
[00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:41.540]   What do you believe in?
[00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:47.500]   Now I picked this paragraph because I really echo with some of the things that he said.
[00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:59.140]   It's indeed really sad to see churches, some human institutes, corrupt by power, corrupt
[00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:01.660]   by sin.
[00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:04.460]   They rise and they fall.
[00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:10.700]   Sometimes when you hear news like that, you're just shaking your head, right?
[00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:13.380]   SMH, shaking your head.
[00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:16.020]   You just cannot live with that.
[00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:18.260]   You just cannot live with that, right?
[00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:20.540]   How could people do that, right?
[00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:22.260]   How could people do that?
[00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:25.260]   But it really strikes me.
[00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:37.260]   He said about oppression, about hypocrisy, but he also invite us, if you're really earnest
[00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:43.020]   seekers of truth, you need to look beyond that, right?
[00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:47.940]   Sometimes we put our faith in human institutions.
[00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:55.500]   Sometimes we put our faith in flawed humans, including your pastor, including your leader,
[00:20:55.500 --> 00:21:00.660]   including anyone that you look up to.
[00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:04.060]   These people are as broken as we are.
[00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:08.740]   Leaders and pastors, including myself, we all needed grace.
[00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:11.740]   We all needed the love of God.
[00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:14.180]   Every one of us.
[00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:17.860]   Don't you want to put your faith in flawed humans?
[00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:23.100]   You put your faith, you put your trust in God and God alone.
[00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:26.300]   Psalm 19.
[00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:29.420]   We read the first six verses.
[00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:37.780]   The first third is talking about the word of creation, the speech of creation, general
[00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:38.780]   revelation.
[00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:39.780]   Everyone knows it.
[00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:40.780]   It's universal.
[00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:49.660]   And then seven to ten, it changed to words from the creator, words of creators, the special
[00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:53.660]   revelation, especially for you.
[00:21:53.660 --> 00:22:00.820]   The words in the Bible, the words in scripture, those are the words from the Lord, the creator.
[00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:06.260]   Then the last third is our response.
[00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:10.700]   We as creature, how do we respond to the word of God?
[00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:16.500]   Let's read through it and we're going to go through the Apostles' Creed together and then
[00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:18.900]   we're going to sing a response song.
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:19.900]   Okay?
[00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:22.860]   So Psalm 19, seven to ten.
[00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:25.400]   The second half, second third.
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:30.340]   The Lord of the Lord is perfect, reviving the soul.
[00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:34.180]   The statue of the Lord are trustworthy, making wise the simple.
[00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:39.060]   The precept of the Lord are right, giving joy to your heart.
[00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:43.620]   The commands of the Lord are radiant, giving light to the eyes.
[00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:47.060]   The fear of the Lord is pure, enduring forever.
[00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:51.620]   The ordinances of the Lord are sure and altogether righteous.
[00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:56.140]   They are more precious than gold, more precious than pure gold.
[00:22:56.140 --> 00:23:01.020]   They're sweeter than honey, than honey from the comb.
[00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:04.580]   The words from the Lord.
[00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:07.660]   And then our response.
[00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:13.180]   By your word, by them, is your servant wanted.
[00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:16.620]   And keeping them there is great reward.
[00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:22.940]   Who can discern his own errors, forgive my hidden faults.
[00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:27.020]   Keep your servant also from willful sins.
[00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:29.700]   May they not rule over me.
[00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:35.180]   Then will I be blameless, innocent of great transgression.
[00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:36.900]   What a humble prayer.
[00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:41.340]   And he answered prayer with verse fourteen.
[00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:47.740]   May the words of my mouth, the meditation of my heart, be pleasing in your sight, O
[00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:48.740]   Lord.
[00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:50.740]   My rock and my redeemer.
[00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:54.940]   Well, we're going to recite the Apostles' Creed together.
[00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:56.580]   Let's do that.
[00:23:56.580 --> 00:24:00.900]   Why don't we stand and do that, alright?
[00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:07.860]   If you will believe, we recite it together as if we will believe I'm believing into this.
[00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:09.580]   Let's recite the Creed together.
[00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:14.860]   I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth.
[00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:18.620]   I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord.
[00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:23.980]   He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary.
[00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:30.620]   He suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried.
[00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:32.260]   He descended to the dead.
[00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:35.100]   On the third day, he rose again.
[00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:38.780]   He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father.
[00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:42.780]   He will come again to judge the living and the dead.
[00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:48.920]   I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy universal church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:53.780]   of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting.
[00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:54.780]   Amen.
[00:24:54.780 --> 00:25:01.780]   Rachel is going to sing, and we're going to join her together.
[00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:08.780]   I believe in God, our Father.
[00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:12.780]   I believe in Christ, the Son.
[00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:15.780]   I believe in the Holy Spirit.
[00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:19.780]   God, the truth, three in one.
[00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:22.780]   I believe in the resurrection.
[00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:26.780]   Heaven will rise again.
[00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:34.780]   For I believe in the name of Jesus.
[00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:40.780]   Let's do that together, I believe, from the beginning.
[00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:44.780]   I believe in God, our Father.
[00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:47.780]   I believe in Christ, the Son.
[00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:51.780]   I believe in the Holy Spirit.
[00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:54.780]   Our God is three in one.
[00:25:54.780 --> 00:26:01.780]   I believe in the resurrection, that we will rise again.
[00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:11.780]   I believe in the name of Jesus.
[00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:17.780]   Let's all pray together.
[00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:20.780]   Father, we praise you, we believe in you.
[00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:26.780]   We are believing into you and putting our faith, our whole trust in you.
[00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:33.780]   For you alone is trustworthy, not any man on this earth.
[00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:36.780]   You are the God that we can depend upon.
[00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:39.780]   You are the God we can rely.
[00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:43.780]   For you are the almighty, you are the creator.
[00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:51.780]   Let us praise you, let us hear the spiritual music of the universe.
[00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:57.780]   Proclaiming your glory, proclaiming your awesomeness, your power.
[00:26:57.780 --> 00:26:59.780]   Thank you for loving us.
[00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:08.780]   And for the rest of the week, we are sent by your Holy Spirit to live for you.
[00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:17.780]   And put our faith in you. And do your will to please you and worship you alone.
[00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:19.780]   In Christ's name we pray, Amen.
