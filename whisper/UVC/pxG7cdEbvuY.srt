1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
 All right, today we will start a new series.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,260
 Last weekend I was not with you.

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:09,800
 I know Pastor Sam Johnson was here

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,960
 and I really appreciate for his World Ministry Award

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,060
 and I was in Minnesota for the weekend

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,980
 and from Friday to Sunday, yes, Friday to Sunday,

7
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,580
 I was speaking in the church retreat over there

8
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:29,800
 and as always, sometimes I go to different churches

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,520
 and get to know some of the people

10
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,380
 and sisters and brothers in Christ

11
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,860
 and learn about their stories

12
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:39,280
 and I was encouraged by their experiences

13
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,160
 and one of the couples who host me

14
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,440
 and pick me up from the airport

15
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,280
 and drive me to the retreat center

16
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,620
 which is two and a half hours away

17
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,800
 from the airport from Minneapolis

18
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,380
 and they are such an inspiration, you know,

19
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,560
 just retire and they have been working as expats

20
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,520
 in China, in Hong Kong, in Singapore

21
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,580
 and very successful people and very resourceful people

22
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:17,740
 and they have been working tirelessly for the gospel,

23
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,740
 preaching the gospel, you know,

24
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,540
 shepherding the church, helping out with ministries

25
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,520
 and they just settled down in Minnesota

26
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,860
 for less than a year and they are working

27
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,420
 and they are one of those faithful people

28
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:34,580
 who continue to inspire you, you know,

29
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:40,440
 in the small church and they continue to serve faithfully

30
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,040
 and use their resources to advance the ministry there.

31
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,520
 So I was really, really touched by this couple

32
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,160
 and of course, by many other brothers and sisters.

33
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,960
 This church is without a pastor for some time

34
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,380
 and as you can understand, all the elders

35
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:03,680
 and all the lay leaders have to just contribute

36
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,740
 a little bit more, you know, stretch themselves

37
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:13,740
 and serve in the church and some of the brothers

38
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,020
 because they're without a pastor,

39
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,000
 so they have to preach.

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,800
 They have to learn how to preach.

41
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,100
 So that's pretty tough for them

42
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,940
 but I'm so inspired by the ministry.

43
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,180
 Can you imagine, you know, there's no pastor,

44
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,240
 there's no one preparing the message for Sunday service

45
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,820
 and you have to take turn, right?

46
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,740
 And you have to take turn next time you're gonna preach,

47
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,960
 next time you're gonna preach, right?

48
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,620
 It's pretty tough but, you know,

49
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:48,280
 I'm really inspired by their faithfulness

50
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,020
 and that's what got me thinking about

51
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,560
 this next series of messages

52
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,280
 and what should I preach on.

53
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,420
 You know, during the retreat, I have been thinking a lot

54
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:02,580
 and praying a lot about what should be the sermon series

55
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,900
 from this Sunday onward,

56
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,780
 at least for the next six, seven Sundays

57
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:11,300
 and I've been thinking about, okay, New Testament letters,

58
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,220
 maybe Old Testament, maybe the Book of Daniel

59
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,940
 because I've been working on the Book of Daniel

60
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,440
 for quite a long time because in November,

61
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:22,700
 I'm going to another church to preach in Toronto.

62
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,660
 So I've been working on the Book of Daniel.

63
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,740
 So, you know,

64
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:29,880
 checking this passage and that passage

65
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,900
 but, you know, in my prayer, in my desire,

66
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,560
 I come to this point that I want to

67
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,700
 focus on one topic for all of us,

68
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,380
 one topic for all of us,

69
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:46,880
 is that what Christ thinks of the church, right?

70
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,040
 Now, we come to church, of course,

71
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,380
 we carry our own opinions and preferences

72
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,460
 about the church, right?

73
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:55,880
 Or what is my role in the church, right?

74
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:59,640
 Maybe I see myself as such a, you know, just attendee,

75
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,740
 one of the attendees, right?

76
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,060
 I'm not part of this, right?

77
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,500
 I don't want to get involved or something like that.

78
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,400
 What is my role in the church, right?

79
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,980
 You can ask, you know, each and every one of us

80
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:13,820
 and we will give you different answers, right?

81
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:18,500
 But, you know, ultimately, what matters most

82
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:22,920
 is not how you and I see the church, right?

83
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:28,080
 What matters most is what Christ thinks of our church, right?

84
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,720
 He is the head of our church, right?

85
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,940
 He is the leader.

86
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,480
 It's not so much about what the passage says,

87
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,540
 it's not so much of the core team member

88
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,960
 that the lay leader said,

89
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,140
 it's not so much of what you say

90
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,000
 or how you see the church.

91
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,560
 And your role in the church

92
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,160
 is also depends on this question,

93
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,840
 what Christ thinks of your role in the church.

94
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,540
 And this series takes us to the last book

95
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,420
 of the New Testament, of the entire Bible.

96
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,560
 You know, the Old Testament have 39 books, right?

97
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,300
 Old Testament, 39 books.

98
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,380
 And the New Testament has 27 books, right?

99
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,280
 It's a collection of 27 books and letters.

100
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,420
 The last book of the entire Bible

101
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:11,020
 is called the Book of Revelation.

102
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,820
 That is the last book of the Bible.

103
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:16,980
 And this Book of Revelation contains seven letters

104
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:21,640
 written to seven churches in Asia Minor

105
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,820
 at that time, in the first century.

106
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,120
 Now, as we come to the Book of Revelation,

107
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,360
 I remember when I was so much younger,

108
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,680
 you know, I wanted to know what is going on in the future,

109
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,760
 right?

110
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,840
 Kind of like apocalypse, you know,

111
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,720
 kind of, you know, doomsday scenario.

112
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,200
 What is going on, right?

113
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,640
 And what does the Bible have to say

114
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,540
 about the end of the world, right?

115
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:46,280
 So I flipped the pages to the Book of Revelation

116
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,240
 and I read some of the passages.

117
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,560
 And I must admit, I could not understand it.

118
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,040
 It's just so strange, right?

119
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,540
 It opens up another, you know,

120
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,720
 another box of mystery.

121
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,560
 And I did not know how to interpret it.

122
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,600
 I did not know how to read it.

123
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,520
 And that is the Book of Revelation, right?

124
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,240
 Now, first of all, when we come to the Book of Revelation,

125
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,780
 please understand that the Book of Revelation

126
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:16,820
 is not so much about prediction of the future, right?

127
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,260
 It's not weather forecast,

128
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:22,680
 whether it's gonna rain tomorrow at 3.23 p.m.

129
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,420
 That's not what Revelation is all about.

130
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:28,000
 That's not what the Book of Revelation is all about.

131
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,240
 What it is about is that it was written

132
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,120
 to a particular situation,

133
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,060
 to a group of Christians at that time.

134
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:42,220
 And that was the late first century, about A.D. 90s.

135
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:47,620
 You know, the time of Jesus died and rose again.

136
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,960
 It was about A.D. 30, right?

137
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,060
 About A.D. 30.

138
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,080
 And then the apostles and the early Christians,

139
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,460
 they went from Jerusalem to other parts of the world,

140
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,960
 including Paul himself, right?

141
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,980
 Went to different cities and towns

142
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,820
 and preached the gospel and established churches, right?

143
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:08,600
 Small churches, small group house churches.

144
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,840
 Now, that was about 30s, 40s, and 50s, right?

145
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,940
 And then we come to the Book of Revelation

146
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,280
 is the end of first century.

147
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:21,140
 You know, if you calculate the years, the number of years,

148
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,060
 by this time, the end of first century,

149
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,060
 the second generation Christians are

150
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:32,360
 almost 70 years after the time of Jesus.

151
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,840
 And at that time, particularly at that time,

152
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,220
 the Roman Empire, they were still under the Roman rule,

153
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:43,580
 right, they have been promoting, you know, emperor worship.

154
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,420
 You know, you can imagine, if you,

155
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:49,420
 if you have a time machine,

156
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:52,900
 we can go back to the first century, the late first century.

157
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,040
 If we go to one of the house churches,

158
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:59,460
 they have the political pressure from the top, right?

159
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:03,200
 From the emperor, from the Roman Empire.

160
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,360
 They want the churches to worship the emperor, right?

161
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,980
 You can imagine walking to the church

162
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,140
 in the late first century,

163
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:19,340
 situation is kind of like the church is always

164
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:22,420
 under the pressure of the government.

165
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:27,700
 If you join the late first century church

166
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:33,120
 in the Roman Empire, probably you will find some people,

167
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,880
 they have to sing the national anthem

168
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,560
 before they sing praises to Jesus.

169
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,560
 You see what I'm saying?

170
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,140
 Do you, will you like it?

171
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,120
 If you walk in this church, you have to sing

172
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,980
 the national anthem before you do anything else, right?

173
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:50,740
 Or you will find the picture of the emperor,

174
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,400
 you know, next to the cross,

175
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,100
 or right at the center of the sanctuary,

176
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:59,060
 and the cross is put on the side, you know?

177
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:03,420
 And that was the kind of situation the early Christians,

178
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,820
 the first century Christians were facing.

179
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,660
 They were facing wave and wave of persecution.

180
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:13,120
 And of course, the pagan people,

181
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,360
 if they don't believe in Christ,

182
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,200
 they were okay with that, right?

183
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,360
 Because emperor was just one more god

184
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,400
 on top of many other gods, right?

185
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,080
 But for churches, it's not okay.

186
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,300
 Because, you know, the gospel,

187
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,700
 the gospel, the good news of Jesus Christ

188
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:35,240
 proclaims that there's only one king in this universe,

189
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,400
 and that is Jesus, who died and rose from the dead, right?

190
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,260
 And for this reason, Christians are often, you know,

191
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:46,660
 being marginalized and being pressured,

192
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,600
 or being persecuted.

193
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,320
 And John the apostle, you know,

194
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,420
 Jesus had 12 apostles, right?

195
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,820
 And the last one who died should be John the apostle.

196
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,160
 And he wrote the book of Revelation

197
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,200
 under the inspiration of God.

198
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,620
 And he said this,

199
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:08,200
 right off the bat in chapter one, verse nine.

200
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,200
 It says, "I, John," it should be apostle John, right?

201
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,940
 "Your brother and companion in suffering and kingdom

202
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:19,200
 "and patient endurance, there are hours in Jesus.

203
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,700
 "I was on the island of Patmos

204
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,960
 "because of the word of God

205
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,300
 "and because of the testimony of Jesus."

206
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,460
 So he was being persecuted,

207
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:35,540
 and he was exiled to a small island called Patmos

208
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,980
 in the Aegean Sea.

209
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:41,400
 He said, "On the last day,"

210
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,200
 which means he was worshiping, right?

211
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,000
 On the last day, on Sunday,

212
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,740
 "I was in the spirit, and I heard behind me

213
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:51,700
 "a loud voice like a trumpet,

214
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:55,440
 "which said, 'Write on a scroll what you see

215
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,940
 "'and send it to seven churches,

216
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,620
 "'to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamon,

217
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:03,660
 "'Tirethea, Thyatira,

218
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:08,940
 "'Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.'"

219
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:13,300
 So seven cities, there were churches in these seven cities.

220
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,340
 And John's being commanded to write letters

221
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:19,520
 to each of the seven churches.

222
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,720
 And where are they?

223
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,940
 You see the map.

224
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,980
 You see all of the seven cities and seven churches

225
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:29,640
 are located in the western part of today's Turkey, right?

226
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,500
 And you can see the island of Patmos, right?

227
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,940
 Can you see that?

228
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,120
 Island of Patmos.

229
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,340
 And John received the revelation,

230
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,720
 which is written in the book of Revelation,

231
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,260
 on this island because he was a political exile,

232
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:48,800
 and the Romans were going after him.

233
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,780
 And during his suffering, during his isolation

234
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,780
 on the island of Patmos,

235
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:57,620
 he received the revelation from God.

236
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,960
 And he wrote seven churches,

237
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:05,540
 wrote seven letters to the seven churches.

238
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:09,920
 And of course we know seven is a symbolic number, right?

239
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,420
 It's a complete number, right?

240
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,480
 I'm Chinese.

241
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,700
 The symbolic number eight, you know,

242
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,200
 it's very important, right?

243
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,660
 You drive around in the city,

244
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,560
 you see a license plate with 888 on it.

245
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,740
 Most likely it's a Chinese driver, right?

246
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,240
 Chinese owner.

247
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,920
 For the Hebrew culture, or even for the Christian culture,

248
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,960
 seven is the complete number, right?

249
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,160
 Seven is the complete number.

250
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,480
 So that means the seven churches

251
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,000
 represent all the churches, right?

252
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,160
 And the first few chapters of the book of Revelation

253
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,220
 contain letters addressed to the particular

254
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:51,360
 faith communities and apply to them, right?

255
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,860
 And this letter, we shall see,

256
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,620
 we will read letter after letter,

257
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:01,660
 and we shall see the format of each letter is similar.

258
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:06,020
 Christ, first of all, he will introduce himself,

259
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:10,760
 and then he will give an evaluation of the church,

260
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,920
 saying that I know what is going on in your church.

261
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,760
 And then, thirdly, the letter, which is very short,

262
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,840
 Christ, Jesus, will advise the church

263
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:24,560
 to change the course of action,

264
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,800
 or keep on doing some of the good works

265
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,560
 they have been doing.

266
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,140
 And then the letter will close with a promise,

267
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:36,300
 a promise particularly relevant to the local church,

268
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:42,420
 and advise the audience to listen and to obey the word.

269
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,120
 To obey the message.

270
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:48,420
 So today, we're going to go through the first letter first.

271
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,260
 Okay?

272
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,520
 The first letter is written to Ephesus,

273
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,560
 to the Christians in Ephesus.

274
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,420
 It says chapter two, verse one.

275
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:02,340
 "To the angel of the church in Ephesus write,

276
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:05,720
 'These are the words of him who holds the seven stars

277
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,540
 in his right hand and walks among

278
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,560
 the seven golden lampstands.'"

279
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,700
 So these are all symbols, right?

280
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,200
 Symbolic language.

281
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,540
 And they represent some of the reality, right?

282
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:22,760
 And Christ introduced himself as someone

283
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:27,420
 who holds the seven stars in his right hand, right?

284
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,540
 And what does it mean?

285
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:31,860
 You can try to imagine Christ himself,

286
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,900
 who is king over the entire cosmos,

287
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:38,580
 and his right hand is holding seven stars, right?

288
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:41,820
 Now we know, in the late first century,

289
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:46,200
 if you go to different archeological sites,

290
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,360
 and you find some of the coins mint by the emperor,

291
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:56,080
 and one of those coins, if you look at it,

292
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:00,080
 there is the image of the emperor in the center,

293
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,460
 and there are seven stars surrounding him.

294
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,320
 And that emperor is called Domitian.

295
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,300
 And he ruled the Roman Empire and persecuted Christians

296
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,860
 in the late first century.

297
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,600
 So verse one of chapter two says,

298
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,760
 "It is not Domitian, it is not the emperor

299
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,740
 that holds seven stars.

300
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:23,500
 Christ is the one who holds seven stars.

301
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,000
 Christ is the one who holds the entire cosmos

302
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,700
 in his sovereignty.

303
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:31,200
 He is someone who is in absolute control."

304
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:38,720
 And Jesus introduced himself as someone who is walking

305
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,400
 among the seven golden lampstands.

306
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,820
 Now the golden lampstand, called menorah,

307
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:49,540
 is one of the oldest symbols of Judaism, right?

308
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,680
 You can see the picture on the right.

309
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,840
 When you go down to the Western Wall in Jerusalem,

310
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:00,480
 you see a huge, life-size golden menorah

311
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:04,280
 to remember this symbol, right?

312
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:08,600
 This represents the nation of Israel, the people of Israel.

313
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,360
 And this is applied, now this menorah is applied

314
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,880
 to the people of God in the church.

315
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,580
 Now for the Israelites, or for the Jews,

316
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,780
 menorah reminds them they are being called by God

317
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:26,040
 to be the light unto the nations, right?

318
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:30,540
 Israel, or the Jewish people, are being elected by God.

319
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,620
 It's not because they're better.

320
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:36,120
 They are just like other pagan nations.

321
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:41,120
 But they are specially elected by God to be the channel,

322
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,520
 to be the instrument of God among the nations.

323
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,780
 And they will be like the menorah.

324
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:49,880
 They will be the lampstand to shine the true light

325
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,820
 to all the nations around them, right?

326
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,900
 And that was Israel was supposed to be.

327
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:59,900
 However, here, Christ is saying that the church

328
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,900
 is the true Israel, right?

329
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:08,840
 The church is the true Israel, composed with believers

330
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:14,960
 who are Jewish and who are Gentiles.

331
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:21,060
 So Jews and Gentiles together, they proclaim that Jesus

332
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:25,260
 is the true Lord, and now they are like the menorah, right?

333
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:28,340
 They should be used by God to shine the light

334
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:30,280
 to the nations.

335
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,580
 And Christ introduced himself in such a way,

336
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:37,540
 and he command the church in Ephesus to do such and such.

337
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:40,740
 Now remember the format of the letter?

338
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:44,700
 This is the first letter to the Ephesian Christians, right?

339
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,520
 After introducing himself as someone who holds the seven

340
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,020
 stars and walk among the seven lampstands,

341
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:56,640
 in verse two, Christ says, "I know your deeds,

342
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,760
 "your hard work, your perseverance.

343
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,280
 "I know you cannot tolerate wicked men,

344
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,980
 "and you have tested them, those who claim to be apostles

345
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:10,320
 "but are not apostles, and found them to be false.

346
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,620
 "And you have persevered and have endured hardship

347
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:17,880
 "for my name, and have not grown weary."

348
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:22,120
 So is it praise or is it condemnation?

349
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:24,780
 It's not praise, right?

350
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,700
 It's very positive, right?

351
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,680
 So Christ looking at the church in Ephesus,

352
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:33,540
 and he praises them for their hard work,

353
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,840
 for their good work.

354
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,560
 So the Ephesian Christians are very, very busy

355
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,620
 and hard-working Christians, and they build a ministry.

356
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,340
 They block by block, right?

357
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,640
 Break by break.

358
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:49,480
 And the Christians in Ephesus have been trying

359
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,020
 to building the body of Christ.

360
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:59,240
 And by the time John writes the letter of Ephesians,

361
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,660
 by the time John writes this letter,

362
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:06,760
 the book of Revelation, it was in the late first century,

363
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,320
 right, 1890, and the Ephesian church

364
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,520
 was already 40 years old, right?

365
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:17,320
 Yeah, the church was already 40-some years old, right?

366
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,640
 Remember I told you last weekend I went to the other church

367
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,720
 in Minnesota.

368
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,600
 They have 40 years of history.

369
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,660
 They have a long history, right?

370
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:31,420
 Much longer than our church, right?

371
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:35,120
 Our church is only eight years old, right?

372
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,540
 We are like a little kid, right?

373
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:41,140
 We are not grown, right?

374
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,700
 They have, right?

375
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:47,100
 And the church in Ephesus is also a grown church.

376
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,860
 And you see, in this community, there are many, many people

377
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:53,520
 who are working so hard to build a ministry.

378
00:19:53,520 --> 00:20:00,420
 When we first started Urban Voice, it was hard work.

379
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:04,560
 It was very hard work.

380
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:10,700
 Physically difficult because you have to set up

381
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,860
 and you have to do running around.

382
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,220
 And mentally, it was challenging.

383
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,060
 Spiritually, it was challenging.

384
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:21,040
 Emotionally, it was difficult.

385
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,100
 I really appreciate, eight years ago,

386
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:28,260
 many of the leaders who started this church with me,

387
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:31,920
 and I really appreciate their perseverance,

388
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,040
 their hard work, right?

389
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:37,220
 When we first started this ministry, we wanted to raise,

390
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,020
 we had nothing back then.

391
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:43,200
 We wanted to raise, well, we calculate some of the numbers,

392
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,400
 right, we punch in some of the numbers,

393
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,840
 this is what we need, right?

394
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,840
 So we had to raise, in order to start this church,

395
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,100
 we had to raise 120K to get us started.

396
00:20:53,100 --> 00:21:00,280
 I remember it was late 2015, and we had zero, we had zero.

397
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:09,180
 But within six weeks, we raised that amount, right?

398
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:13,840
 Praise God for the commitment, right?

399
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,080
 And the perseverance, the contribution of the people

400
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:20,180
 who started the church, right?

401
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,960
 And Christ will get the church in Ephesus.

402
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,920
 Yes, you guys are very, very good, you know, way to go.

403
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,300
 Your perseverance, the hard work, right?

404
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,480
 And I wanna encourage all of you.

405
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:35,020
 We still need to do all the hard work.

406
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:39,300
 We still need to work harder to persevere, right?

407
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,080
 Because all we do is the good work,

408
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,280
 we try to hold fast to the gospel,

409
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,360
 we try to preach the gospel, we try to build the church,

410
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,080
 and it's not an easy task, right?

411
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,660
 And there's no quick fix, right?

412
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:54,420
 All ministries require hard work.

413
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:59,920
 And you see the Ephesian Christians,

414
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,980
 not only they work hard, but they know the truth, right?

415
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:08,060
 They know who are the, who the wicked men are, right?

416
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,600
 Some of the apostles, some of the people

417
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,820
 who claim to be apostles, but they are not.

418
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,860
 Indeed, they are not apostles.

419
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:18,920
 You know, we find some of the early documents

420
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,000
 that we know some of the early churches,

421
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,160
 they're trying to tell which guy is the true apostle

422
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:29,540
 and which guy is not the true guy, the false apostle, right?

423
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,880
 And some of the criterias they lay out

424
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:36,380
 for the leadership team is to test whoever come our way

425
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:39,800
 to preach the gospel and their behaviors.

426
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,300
 And one of the criterias says,

427
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:46,900
 if the preacher, the itinerary preacher,

428
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:50,700
 comes to your church and you're gonna host them, right?

429
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,980
 You're gonna host this preacher,

430
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,900
 and if you host him for three days,

431
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:00,760
 and he ask to be staying longer,

432
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:07,400
 the document says he is the false apostle,

433
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,180
 because he's trying to take advantage of you.

434
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:13,620
 And after preaching, if he ask for money,

435
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:16,280
 he is definitely a fake apostle.

436
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,440
 And we have some of the early documents

437
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,820
 that help the early churches to discern

438
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:26,700
 who is true apostle and who is false apostle.

439
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,660
 And for the church in Ephesus, they tested them

440
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:32,420
 and know their doctrines, right?

441
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,640
 They know what they believe in,

442
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,180
 so that's why they can discern what is right

443
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:40,220
 and what is wrong, what is orthodox and what is cultic,

444
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,660
 what is not orthodox.

445
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:45,260
 And Christ praises them.

446
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:48,820
 And this letter continues, after praising them,

447
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:52,660
 Christ said, "However, I hold this against you.

448
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:55,480
 "You have forsaken your first love.

449
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:59,040
 "Remember the height from which you have fallen.

450
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,640
 "Repent and do the things you did at first.

451
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,880
 "If you do not repent, I will come to you

452
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,620
 "and remove your lampstand from its place."

453
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:12,320
 This is a very stern warning, right?

454
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,940
 Yes, they are hardworking.

455
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:17,280
 However, there's one thing Christ holds against them

456
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:21,440
 is that this is a church that has abandoned love, you know?

457
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:28,020
 Abandoned love for God, abandoned the love for others, right?

458
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:31,960
 And it says, what kind of love?

459
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,460
 First love, right?

460
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,260
 First love.

461
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:40,480
 Somewhere in the past, you had that, right?

462
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,680
 First love, talking about love in the past.

463
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:48,040
 Now, we all have similar experience, right?

464
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:52,120
 For those of us like me, you know, I have been in Christ,

465
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:56,520
 I have known Christ and served Christ for many years.

466
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,680
 In my faith journey, there were a time

467
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:03,560
 I was really touched by the love of God

468
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:12,620
 and I was motivated and compelled by God's love.

469
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:17,360
 So I'll do everything out of my experience of God's love

470
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,220
 and I'll do everything out of love, right?

471
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,900
 I want to care about other people, right?

472
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,800
 And not asking for some benefits.

473
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,740
 I want to invite other people to the church.

474
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,640
 I want to invite other people to experience

475
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:33,340
 the grace of God, all because I have taste

476
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,260
 the love of God, right?

477
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:38,980
 The redeeming grace of Christ.

478
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:43,120
 But the church in Ephesus has lost it all.

479
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,520
 How old is this church, remember?

480
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,060
 40 years, right?

481
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:50,040
 More than 40 years.

482
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:53,040
 And this is kind of a mature church.

483
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,960
 But Christ says, "I have this against you.

484
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,880
 "You have forsaken the first love."

485
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,680
 You remember there were point in your faith journey

486
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:09,280
 that you're so compelled by the love of Christ, right?

487
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:13,020
 Maybe when you were younger, maybe there were

488
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:17,180
 different period of time in your past journey in faith.

489
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:21,960
 You were so touched by the love of God

490
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:26,260
 and you are willing to do everything because Jesus loves you

491
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,740
 because you know that God loves you, right?

492
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:32,740
 The Christians in Ephesus have forsaken the first love.

493
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:35,680
 And these are very, very strong words.

494
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:40,340
 And it doesn't mean that they're being forgetful,

495
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:43,540
 like you lost a wallet or something.

496
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,720
 You have forsaken your first love.

497
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,480
 These are very strong words.

498
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,640
 It's like intentionally you trash it.

499
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,380
 There's something very valuable,

500
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:57,380
 but you throw it into the trash can.

501
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:00,720
 You say, "I don't care anymore."

502
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,780
 Right?

503
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:04,580
 That kind of action, that kind of attitude

504
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,860
 that they're holding.

505
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:10,660
 There's no wonder why that Jesus write this letter

506
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:13,160
 to the church and warns them,

507
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:16,100
 "Hey, if you do not recover this first love,

508
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,200
 "I will remove you.

509
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,540
 "You are no longer my lamp stand

510
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:24,540
 "and you cannot shine the light to the nations."

511
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,840
 Jesus continues.

512
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:32,040
 He says, "Remember the height from which you have fallen

513
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,960
 "and you have to repent

514
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,780
 "and do the things you did at first.

515
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,840
 "If you do not repent, I will come to you

516
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,140
 "and remove your lamp stand from its place."

517
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:45,460
 These are very, very strong warning words.

518
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:48,400
 If the church is without love,

519
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,040
 it is no longer a church, right?

520
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,540
 You agree with that?

521
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:56,700
 If a Christian is no longer motivated by the love of God,

522
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:01,440
 he is not a follower of Jesus Christ anymore.

523
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,400
 Right?

524
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:07,300
 You're just going through some motions, right?

525
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,560
 Routine, right?

526
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,480
 Muscle memory.

527
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:16,860
 Jesus said, "If you do not recover that,

528
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:19,700
 "you cannot be the lamp stand."

529
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,860
 If we do not recover that, we cannot be God's church.

530
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:26,720
 I remember some years ago,

531
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,140
 I attended a regional meeting for pastors

532
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:34,300
 in the network in Chicago.

533
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:38,900
 There were about 30, 40 pastors and church planters.

534
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:42,820
 We gathered together in north side of the city.

535
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:47,880
 We invited a Jewish rabbi to give a testimony.

536
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:52,500
 He's a very, very old rabbi.

537
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:57,040
 He believed Jesus is Christ,

538
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,980
 and what we call Messianic Jew.

539
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:01,580
 He was invited to give a testimony.

540
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:04,240
 He lived in Skokie, north of us.

541
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,580
 I don't know the real number now,

542
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:13,160
 the number of Messianic Jews in the Skokie community.

543
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:16,160
 Back then, I heard it was about 100,

544
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:20,720
 about 100 Jewish people who professed

545
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,360
 Jesus is the Christ, the Messiah.

546
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,840
 I don't know the real number now,

547
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,920
 but this rabbi, very old and retired,

548
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:32,760
 and came to faith, came to know Jesus as his Lord,

549
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,140
 and he shared his testimony.

550
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:38,140
 He lived in Skokie, and he had broken marriages,

551
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:43,160
 and had not seen his daughter for over 10 years,

552
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:46,120
 because of broken relationship.

553
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:50,040
 In his brokenness, in his pain, in his darkness,

554
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:55,260
 a Christian came along and cared for him,

555
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:58,080
 and stayed with him.

556
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,760
 It's not imposing the Bible upon him.

557
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,080
 It's not using the Bible to bang on his head.

558
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:09,240
 This Christian man just came along to this old man,

559
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,480
 and cared for him, and listened to his story,

560
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,720
 and tried to be his friend.

561
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:20,020
 And that's how this Jewish man came to faith,

562
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:24,300
 came to know Jesus, all because of love.

563
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:30,360
 You know, I think the biggest threat in our church

564
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:34,340
 is indifference, indifference.

565
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:37,920
 Indifference, the spirit of indifference.

566
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,020
 It says, "I don't care."

567
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:43,060
 Well, you have Bible study, I don't care, right?

568
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:45,380
 You have this good work, or that good work,

569
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,300
 you know, I don't care.

570
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,920
 You can share the gospel, and preach the gospel,

571
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,600
 build a ministry, build a youth ministry,

572
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,580
 or whatever happening in the church,

573
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,660
 I just don't care, right?

574
00:30:55,660 --> 00:31:00,860
 I just follow motion, and you know, in and out, right?

575
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:04,700
 I think this is the biggest threat to our life.

576
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,340
 Not just the church community, but to every one of us,

577
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:10,260
 our individual spirituality.

578
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:13,440
 That is the biggest threat, the biggest danger.

579
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,100
 It's not because you're anti-gospel,

580
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:19,460
 it's not because you're anti-Bible, or anti-God.

581
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,880
 It's just indifference, right?

582
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:29,340
 And that's what Christ is saying to the Christians

583
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,820
 in Ephesus.

584
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:33,380
 I hold this against you.

585
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:36,140
 Yes, you are doing very, very good works,

586
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:40,300
 but this I against you, because this will destroy you.

587
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:44,940
 This will take you, remove you from the lamp stand.

588
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:48,700
 Now, I like the English paraphrase translation

589
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:51,100
 called Message.

590
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,540
 You heard about it?

591
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,780
 Message by Eugene Peterson.

592
00:31:54,780 --> 00:32:00,340
 Back in the '90s, I was in Regent College, Vancouver,

593
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:03,060
 and Eugene Peterson was the professor

594
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:05,620
 of spiritual theology there.

595
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:08,460
 And he translated the whole Bible,

596
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:12,660
 and the translation is called paraphrase,

597
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,780
 because it's not a literal translation.

598
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:17,820
 It's not like, kind of like word for word,

599
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:21,980
 very close to the original language, like ESV, or NIV.

600
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:27,860
 But he did his translation with paraphrase.

601
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:32,020
 It's very loose, but you still get the meaning

602
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:35,260
 of the phrases and of the language.

603
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:40,140
 And in Message, Eugene Peterson translate this verse

604
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,640
 as this, and let me read this.

605
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,020
 Christ said to the church,

606
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:47,860
 "But you walk away from your first love."

607
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,380
 Why?

608
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,740
 What is going on with you anyway?

609
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:55,260
 Do you have any idea how far you've fallen?

610
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,500
 A Lucifer fall.

611
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,160
 Let's read it again.

612
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,300
 Jesus said, "I have this against you,

613
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,620
 "because you walk away from your first love."

614
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:05,460
 Why?

615
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:08,260
 What the heck is going on with you?

616
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:11,860
 Do you have any idea how far you have fallen?

617
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,700
 Do you have any idea how far,

618
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,900
 what the distance of your fall?

619
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,140
 It's a Lucifer fall, right?

620
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:22,180
 You know, in the Jewish mind, especially in time of Jesus,

621
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,900
 they had this tradition saying,

622
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,740
 you know, Satan fell from the sky

623
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:31,340
 to the ground, to the earth, right?

624
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:35,260
 And that is the biggest distance of one's fall.

625
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:39,460
 Because of his pride, he was the angel of light,

626
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:42,180
 but he was being cast down from heaven

627
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,940
 and fell to the earth.

628
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:48,180
 That was part of the Jewish tradition and their theology.

629
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:52,340
 And they believe Satan, Lucifer, fell to the earth.

630
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,500
 He fell in such a way.

631
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,760
 And that is the biggest distance of fall

632
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:04,540
 in history, in the entire cosmos, right?

633
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:07,540
 No one thought so much as Satan did.

634
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:12,540
 And Eugene Peterson, I think he got it right.

635
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,780
 In his kind of loose paraphrase,

636
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:17,100
 "Do you have any idea how far you have fallen

637
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:21,260
 "if you have forsaken, you have abandoned the first love?"

638
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:25,580
 It's like the fall of Satan, right?

639
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:27,940
 It's a huge deal here, right?

640
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:31,500
 It threatens your whole life, your eternal life,

641
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:35,020
 your eternal destiny, your position,

642
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:38,260
 your role in the kingdom of God.

643
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:41,260
 So Christ says, "Remember the height

644
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:44,780
 "from which you have fallen,

645
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:48,780
 "and repent and do the things you did at first."

646
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:54,180
 Please, sister and brother, I want to urge you today.

647
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:58,580
 Remember how far we have fallen

648
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:01,500
 if we have forsaken the first love.

649
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:07,300
 Remember how the love of God has touched you before, right?

650
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:11,420
 Perhaps years ago, perhaps some months ago,

651
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:15,100
 but along the way, you have tasted the real love of God,

652
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:18,600
 right, but somehow you have fallen, right?

653
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,000
 Right?

654
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,880
 Repent and do the things you did at first, right?

655
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,520
 If you do not repent, Jesus said,

656
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:30,520
 "I'll come to you and remove you from the lamb stand.

657
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:33,560
 "You're no longer my people.

658
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,720
 "You're no longer my lamb, my menorah."

659
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:41,600
 This letter closes with this verse.

660
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,520
 You have this in your favor,

661
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,680
 you hate the practices of liquidation,

662
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,600
 liquid, the Goliathans.

663
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,400
 This group probably is the cultic group

664
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,760
 that infiltrate into the church

665
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,920
 and using the gospel as an excuse for sexual immorality.

666
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,280
 And that's much we know, right?

667
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,560
 Again, they know the truth, right, the Ephesian Christians.

668
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:09,040
 However, they have fallen from the first love,

669
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,920
 and it has threatened them as a church.

670
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,400
 The last verse, "He who has an ear,

671
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,280
 "let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.

672
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,360
 "To him who overcomes, we cover our first love,

673
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,760
 "repent and do the things we did at first.

674
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,360
 "I will give you," Jesus said,

675
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:29,160
 "the right to eat from the tree of life,

676
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,000
 "which is in the paradise of God."

677
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,200
 All right?

678
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,000
 You are the menorah, and we are the menorah.

679
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,760
 The church is the menorah.

680
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,920
 But in order for us to play this role,

681
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,880
 to be the light to our neighbors, to the world,

682
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:50,520
 we need to recover our first love.

683
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,720
 Let me close by asking you,

684
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,560
 when was your first love with God?

685
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:59,600
 When did that happen, right?

686
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:03,040
 Maybe you were a student.

687
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:07,240
 Maybe before you had a family, right?

688
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:12,520
 Somewhere along the line, you know.

689
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,840
 Where is that first love?

690
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,120
 And Jesus said, "We cover that."

691
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,120
 You know, we cover that.

692
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:22,800
 We repent and change our course.

693
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,160
 Let's all pray together.

694
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:33,360
 I want to spend some minute to pray to God,

695
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,840
 to remember the heights from which we have fallen.

696
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:45,240
 Repent and do the things we did at first.

697
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:56,720
 Our loving God, how much do we call?

698
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:02,220
 We call in our past, sometime in the past.

699
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,960
 We were touched by your grace, touched by your love.

700
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:15,920
 But somehow we have forsaken it.

701
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:21,520
 Help us to remember, remember that your love is still real.

702
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,300
 Your grace is still glorious.

703
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:30,960
 Your love is so authentic, and still changes us.

704
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,640
 It still changes us.

705
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:39,860
 Remind us where we have fallen.

706
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:45,800
 We come before you to repent.

707
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,360
 Thank you for being our loving God

708
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,280
 and forgiving our sins.

709
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,040
 Forgiving our forgetfulness,

710
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:56,200
 forgiving our intentional abandonment of your grace.

711
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,780
 Help us to repent.

712
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:08,020
 And help us to redo the things that we did at first.

713
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:11,880
 Help us to recover that first love,

714
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,960
 that pure love, that pure motivation.

715
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:19,680
 Purely compelled by the love of God.

716
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,860
 To serve you, to follow you.

717
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,560
 God, I pray that you have mercy on us.

718
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,220
 Mercy on our church.

719
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:35,900
 Help us to remember, to repent, and redo.

720
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:41,080
 And thank you for being our gracious Lord.

721
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,400
 And you are always there, walking among us.

722
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,320
 And know our situation.

723
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:50,120
 Yes, we come before you.

724
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,120
 We change and we repent.

725
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:57,120
 Help us to taste your grace and your love once again.

726
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,880
 Anew.

727
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,480
 Renew our spirit,

728
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,980
 so that we can be your faithful followers.

729
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:08,120
 To continue to serve you,

730
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,720
 continue to love you,

731
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,280
 and to love other people.

732
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,440
 In Christ's name, we pray.

733
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:18,920
 Well, thank you for worshiping with us.

734
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,040
 I hope to see you next Sunday,

735
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:24,120
 when we continue to serve God with our first love.

736
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,280
 God bless you.
