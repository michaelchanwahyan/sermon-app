[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160]   to join us and we're going to have some fun time together.
[00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.300]   Exploring the land, we're going to, I guess,
[00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.120]   finish our series on this city called Jericho.
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.620]   So today we're going to talk about Jericho
[00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.320]   and I have two main points.
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.320]   One main point is I'm going to explain to you
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.020]   what Jericho is all about.
[00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:24.860]   It's a little town, not Bethlehem,
[00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.120]   but little town of Jericho.
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.900]   And then the importance of little things, all right?
[00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.360]   And I'll get to that.
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.700]   So first of all about Jericho.
[00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.540]   Jericho is a very well-known city,
[00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.080]   well-known story in the Bible,
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.240]   and who would you associate with when I talk about Jericho?
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.820]   Who is the guy who conquered Jericho?
[00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.620]   Who is the military general?
[00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.660]   Joshua, oh yeah, right, there you go, Joshua, right?
[00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.560]   Joshua led the Israelites to conquer the very first city
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.700]   as they entered the land of Canaan,
[00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.560]   and the land of the life of God, right,
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.900]   in the presence of God.
[00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.140]   So the first city that they conquered or took over
[00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.980]   was Jericho, and it's a very famous city.
[00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.520]   Not only is this a very well-known story in the Bible,
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.860]   the kids know it and the adults know it,
[00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.920]   but not only that, it is actually in human history,
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.160]   in the secular world history,
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.660]   Jericho is one of the most famous towns in the world
[00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.840]   because it is being known as the oldest city in the world.
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.840]   Oldest city.
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.020]   Now what I meant was humans, before they settle down
[00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.880]   and build their own city, for years, for centuries,
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.180]   there have been hunters and gatherers,
[00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.820]   and they go from oasis to oasis,
[00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.760]   from water source to another water source or food source,
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.020]   and they don't have their own home,
[00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.160]   until they somehow, they got together
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.460]   and organized themselves and built their own city.
[00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.700]   And the first city that they built
[00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.740]   by ancient people was Jericho.
[00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.040]   You're going back to 10,000 BC.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.340]   That's kind of crazy, right?
[00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.340]   Those who went to a few museums,
[00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.080]   you read some signs and you find some display
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.520]   that are so old, right?
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.120]   Very, very old.
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.400]   So Jericho was the oldest city in the world.
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.560]   And then you have to understand why they gathered together
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.540]   to organize the first urban society in Jericho,
[00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.400]   because Jericho had a spring.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.140]   And the spring, later tradition associated with Elijah.
[00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.940]   It's called Elijah's spring,
[00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.620]   because there was a story in later scripture,
[00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.020]   talks about the prophet Elijah,
[00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.720]   he did a miracle to heal the water of the spring.
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.920]   So that's why later traditions associate Elijah,
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.600]   the prophet, with the spring in Jericho.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.060]   In any case, that is the oldest city in the world,
[00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.760]   and also because there's Elijah's spring.
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.400]   And the spring is still working, it's still operating today.
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.080]   So this is Jericho, and think about Jericho,
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.980]   especially for those who grew up in the church.
[00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.620]   You pick up the children Bible,
[00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.820]   and sometimes you find some pictures in the Bible,
[00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.820]   talks about Joshua and the Israelites conquering,
[00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.220]   taking over the city of Jericho.
[00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.620]   You will find some pictures like this.
[00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.200]   Big city wall fell down, right?
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.360]   As they shout out, cry out the victory,
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.500]   they are blowing the trumpet,
[00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.340]   and then the huge wall of Jericho,
[00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.180]   all of a sudden they fell,
[00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.080]   and then they took over the city.
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.260]   It's a dramatic, wonderful story to remember, right?
[00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.940]   It tells you the power of faith.
[00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.400]   If you really believe in God,
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.500]   if you really believe in the promises of God,
[00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.080]   and you act by faith, then the biggest city,
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:32.140]   the biggest wall, the tallest wall,
[00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.780]   will fall down in front of you.
[00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.620]   Now, but as I emphasize one thing,
[00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.420]   we have to read the Bible story in its own context first.
[00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.160]   All right, if you go back to the time of Joshua,
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.400]   it was about 1200, 1300 BC.
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.740]   What kind of city was Jericho?
[00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.300]   It was actually a very, very small town.
[00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.940]   This is the aerial picture of Jericho.
[00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.340]   You see the curvy road on the lower left?
[00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.020]   Above that curvy, modern road,
[00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.320]   is Jericho.
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.860]   Ancient town, the oldest town of Jericho.
[00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.700]   And it's not that big.
[00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:22.500]   It was, according to the most accurate estimation,
[00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.240]   it was just one acre.
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.580]   How big is one acre?
[00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.280]   How big is one acre?
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.080]   Any good student here?
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.920]   One acre.
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.520]   How big is one acre?
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.020]   It's smaller than a city block in Chicago.
[00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.560]   Smaller than one city block, right?
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.960]   It's a very small town.
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.620]   It's about 200 feet by 200-some feet, right?
[00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.600]   It's actually smaller than Chinatown.
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:56.660]   That is Jericho.
[00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:59.500]   It's actually a small town, right?
[00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.580]   So by some, most of the most reliable calculation,
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.380]   in the time of Joshua, Jericho had about
[00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:13.980]   probably 200 to 300 people, and that's it.
[00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:18.880]   It's a little town, but a strategic place.
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:19.720]   You know why?
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.420]   Because if you check the Bible map,
[00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:27.260]   you understand it is guarding the eastern entrance
[00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:28.760]   of the land of Kingdom.
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.500]   That is Jericho.
[00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.260]   And Jericho is a strategic place,
[00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.100]   although it's a small, small town.
[00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.540]   Now that may be surprising to all of us,
[00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.460]   because I grew up in the church,
[00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.700]   and I read Children's Bible,
[00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.200]   and Jericho was being imagined
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.920]   as some sort of very, very big city,
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:54.120]   and the wall is like the Great Wall of China.
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.920]   And then the Israelites circle around the city,
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.920]   and then every single day,
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:03.420]   and then the last day they circle around it for seven times.
[00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:06.120]   And then finally the wall just fell down, right?
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.420]   It's a very dramatic story,
[00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:11.260]   and we exaggerate the scene by later tradition,
[00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:15.460]   by later imagination.
[00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:17.740]   You go back to the Bible,
[00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:21.040]   the Bible is quite careful in describing
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.540]   some of the cities of those days.
[00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:28.040]   For example, after they took over Jericho,
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:32.680]   the next city to be taken over was Ai, Ai.
[00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:33.780]   Ai, Ai.
[00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:37.880]   And you see the description in 7.3.
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.820]   When the Israelites returned,
[00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:44.060]   the spies returned and informed Joshua,
[00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:47.220]   they said, "There's no need for all of us
[00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.520]   "to go up and attack Ai.
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:54.100]   "It won't take more than 2,000 to 3,000 men to attack Ai,
[00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:57.940]   "since there were so few of them in the city of Ai.
[00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.200]   "Don't make all of our people struggle to go up there."
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.900]   All right, so take it easy, guys,
[00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.580]   because Ai is such a small town, right?
[00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:07.580]   It will only take 2,000 to 3,000 people.
[00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:10.740]   And by the way, the word "thousand"
[00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:14.080]   should be translated as "military unit."
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:18.620]   So the people are saying to Joshua,
[00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.860]   "Well, we checked out Ai already.
[00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:23.660]   "If you want to take it over, you just need, what?
[00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:26.660]   "Two to three football teams, right?
[00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:28.960]   "And that's all you need.
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.400]   "You will take over Ai."
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.900]   But of course, they fail at the end.
[00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:34.680]   However, you see the description.
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:36.900]   The Bible actually is very careful
[00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.780]   to describe some of the targets,
[00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:41.140]   Joshua and the Israelites,
[00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:43.280]   as they conquer the land of Canaan.
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.680]   The second town is Hathor.
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.280]   Hathor, 1110 in Joshua,
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:52.920]   it talks about Hathor killing the king and captured the city.
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:56.360]   Hathor had one time been the capital
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:01.260]   and the head of all these kingdoms in the land of Canaan.
[00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.300]   So Hathor is a big, big city.
[00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:06.400]   That's what the Bible is telling you.
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:10.040]   It is the head of all the kingdoms,
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.740]   head of all the cities,
[00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:16.040]   one of the most, the biggest city in the land of Canaan.
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:20.380]   In fact, history tells us this is Hathor, the aerial picture.
[00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:21.920]   You see the upper city
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.820]   with some buildings on it and trees on it,
[00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:26.580]   and then the upper right,
[00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:29.280]   the flat land with some farms,
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.460]   that is the lower city of Hathor.
[00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:35.100]   Altogether, the size of Hathor is 200 acres.
[00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:36.760]   How big was Jericho?
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:39.940]   How big was Jericho?
[00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:41.100]   How many acre?
[00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.900]   Jericho.
[00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:46.160]   One, yes, one acre.
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:49.660]   Hathor is 200 acres, 200 times of Jericho.
[00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:55.060]   So chapter 11 talking about the taking over Hathor.
[00:09:55.060 --> 00:10:00.260]   In fact, Hathor is the biggest site in Israel today.
[00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:06.300]   It's a huge city in times of Joshua.
[00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:10.940]   Now, as I said, the Bible is very careful
[00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:12.420]   to describe the cities.
[00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:15.660]   And it's a small city, Ai, it tells you,
[00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:17.240]   there are only a few people there.
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:21.400]   And Hathor, it tells you it is the head of the kingdom.
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:26.240]   However, with that information in mind,
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:30.140]   you understand when the book of Joshua talks about
[00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:33.720]   the Israelites taking over different cities,
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:37.240]   it's very interesting.
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:41.080]   For Hathor, the biggest city in time of Joshua,
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:46.440]   the book of Joshua only uses 50 acres.
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.720]   15 verses to describe the battle.
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:55.460]   They did take over Hathor, but the Bible only spent
[00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:59.640]   about 15 verses to talk about the battle of Hathor.
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:05.740]   However, Jericho, the Bible used entire chapter,
[00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:11.440]   chapter six, to describe the first battle of Jericho.
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:17.320]   If you talk about the previous context, chapter six, right?
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:21.000]   The previous context would be chapter one to five.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.340]   All talking about preparation of taking over Jericho.
[00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:28.000]   So the Bible at least used six chapters,
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.940]   six chapter long content to talk about
[00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.840]   the first battle of Jericho.
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.520]   The two spies went in there and they met someone
[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:39.720]   called Rahab, the prostitute, right?
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:43.200]   And the prostitute Rahab changed side.
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:47.240]   And she sided with, she abandoned the kingdom of God
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:50.580]   and went with Yahweh, the God of Israel.
[00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:56.680]   Spent six long chapters to talk about
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.440]   one battle, the first battle.
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.060]   We're gonna read some of the verses
[00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:05.240]   and let me pick chapter six, the first five verses.
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:08.480]   Let's take a look.
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.800]   Why does the Bible spend so much time
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:15.240]   and so much content on describing the battle of Jericho?
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:18.120]   Such a small town, one acre.
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:21.620]   Now, the gates of Jericho were tightly shut
[00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:25.840]   because the people were afraid of the Israelites.
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.020]   No one was allowed to go out or in.
[00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:30.380]   But the Lord said to Joshua, "I have given you Jericho.
[00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:33.120]   "It's king, all his strong warriors.
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:36.720]   "You and your fighting men should march around town
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.760]   "once a day for six days.
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:42.080]   "Seven priests will walk ahead of the Ark of the Covenant,
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:45.020]   "each carrying a ram's horn.
[00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:47.660]   "On the seventh day, you are to march around the town
[00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:51.820]   "seven times with the priest blowing the shofar, the horns.
[00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:55.560]   "When you hear the priest give one long blast
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:59.320]   "of the ram's horns, have all the people shout
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.800]   "as loud as they can.
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:05.120]   "Then the walls of the town will collapse
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:09.280]   "and the people will charge straight into, up to the town."
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:13.600]   Now, this is the first description
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.680]   of the battle of Jericho.
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:22.060]   If you check out the entire chapter six of Joshua,
[00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:25.360]   there are only three parts.
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:28.980]   The first part is God's instruction
[00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:31.760]   to the Israelites, to Joshua.
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:34.340]   That is what we have just read.
[00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:38.080]   And the second part is the men of Israel
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.080]   executing the plan.
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.320]   And then the third part is kind of a conclusion,
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:46.480]   talking about the victory and the salvation of Rahab,
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:49.280]   the king and the knight in the town.
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:53.120]   Now, we're not going to talk about the details here.
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:57.500]   You can go home and read about the battle of Jericho.
[00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:00.520]   What I want to say is this is the first battle,
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:03.940]   first battle of a small town, right?
[00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:05.960]   And it's very interesting when you check out
[00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:08.940]   the book of Joshua, what we expect the book of Joshua
[00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:12.600]   to emphasize is strategy, military resources,
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:17.300]   how they prepare military strategy-wise,
[00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:23.160]   tactic, how to take over the first town, Jericho.
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:27.640]   Last night I was with my family.
[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:33.920]   We went to this restaurant to have dinner together
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:37.840]   because my wife, it was her birthday yesterday.
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:40.960]   Anyway, so we went out last night,
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:43.640]   and she's not here, that's okay.
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:48.260]   So we were waiting for the table, right?
[00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.520]   And there were so many people in the restaurant.
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:52.940]   So we went down a couple blocks
[00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:56.860]   and went into a used bookstore, used bookstore.
[00:14:56.860 --> 00:15:00.440]   So we went into the bookstore, and there were so many books
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:04.600]   there, and I went past the section on military history.
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:08.120]   There were so many different books
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.780]   talking about military history.
[00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:13.520]   World War I, World War II, and then the Civil War,
[00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:17.680]   Vietnam War, and all this kind of famous battles in history.
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:22.440]   So out of curiosity, I picked one of those,
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:24.940]   and then I just skimmed through it.
[00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:27.080]   And then it talks about who are the heroes,
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:31.000]   and most of the heroes are the military generals.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.160]   And most of the military history genre
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:39.180]   would emphasize on military tactics, right?
[00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:42.320]   How they move around and maneuver all these resources
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.440]   and take over some of the targets.
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:49.600]   These are what we expect from the military history genre.
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:54.760]   You take a look at the Book of Joshua.
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:57.680]   It really doesn't do that.
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.040]   It's very strange.
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:01.540]   It's a strange book, right?
[00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:05.160]   Some people would expect the Book of Joshua
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:09.040]   because it talks about battles and military stuff.
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:11.960]   It has to be a man's book, right?
[00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:13.900]   The men like to do that, right?
[00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:17.220]   Men like military stuff, don't you?
[00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:18.820]   Right, all the men here?
[00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:20.320]   You love fighting.
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:24.160]   You love wars and battles, right?
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:25.880]   The dramatic battles, right?
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:28.120]   The important battles.
[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:31.200]   Not so much for women, maybe it's just overgeneralization,
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.280]   but that's the way it is.
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:37.120]   You take a look at the Book of Joshua.
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:39.460]   It's very disappointing.
[00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:41.560]   It doesn't really talk about military tactic
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:45.140]   and all this geography and all this military strategy
[00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:46.360]   and all this stuff.
[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:47.900]   They don't.
[00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:49.620]   It's a very strange book.
[00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:52.460]   Now let me tell you some of the data.
[00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:56.620]   When the Book of Joshua talks about taking over Jericho,
[00:16:56.620 --> 00:17:00.840]   it uses 102 words only.
[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:04.960]   102 words.
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:09.980]   For such an important city, the first city, 102 words.
[00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:14.840]   However, in the previous chapter, chapter two,
[00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:18.180]   talking about Rahab, how she changed side
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:24.440]   from the Canaanite gods to Yahweh, the true God of Israel,
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:29.260]   chapter two uses 86 words to talk about a woman
[00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:33.820]   turning to the side of Israel,
[00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:37.880]   believing in God, right?
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:41.620]   And then make a big statement about the God of Israel
[00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:43.320]   being the true God.
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:44.140]   86 words.
[00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:49.160]   So it's about the same portion, same amount of words
[00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:53.800]   talking about Rahab's story, same amount of words
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:56.800]   talking about the battle of Jericho.
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:01.940]   And in fact, in the portion that talks about Rahab,
[00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:07.700]   the prostitute, chapter two uses five verses,
[00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:13.700]   five long verses giving Rahab some of the most important
[00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:17.560]   lines in the Old Testament.
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:21.140]   Some of the direct speech that Rahab said
[00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:25.300]   to the spies of Israel was actually statements of faith.
[00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:30.520]   A theologically sound, solidly scriptural words
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:36.840]   that she talks about how the Lord is the true God,
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:41.940]   the Exodus, how the Lord has given the land to Israel
[00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:44.780]   and the Lord is the true God.
[00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:46.960]   And all that stuff, five verses,
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.880]   is a public theological declaration
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:56.060]   spoken by Rahab, the prostitute, the Canaanite prostitute.
[00:18:56.060 --> 00:19:02.360]   You skim through the book of Joshua,
[00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:05.600]   it's very disappointing from a military,
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:08.520]   typical military genre perspective.
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:12.320]   The heroes, the heroes,
[00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:16.140]   the heroes are not what we expected,
[00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:22.440]   not Joshua, not this fighting man of Israel,
[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:26.120]   but a woman, prostitute, Rahab.
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:32.700]   That is what the Bible says.
[00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:36.860]   And try to emphasize the importance of small characters
[00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:43.060]   and the importance of small deeds done by them.
[00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:45.320]   They matter to God.
[00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:48.560]   And in fact, they are more important
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:52.920]   than the military fighting and dramatic content.
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:56.460]   The Bible put our focus on something
[00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:59.960]   that is more important in the sight of God.
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:03.880]   The small characters, Rahab, all these unknown,
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:07.060]   unnamed people,
[00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:11.520]   they believe in God, they act in faith.
[00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:13.180]   That matters to God.
[00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:17.880]   So there's, this is the importance of small deeds,
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:19.860]   that's my second point.
[00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:24.020]   In the book of Joshua, the small characters matter to God,
[00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:27.200]   matter to the biblical history,
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:29.980]   matter to what God is doing on earth.
[00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:33.320]   You and me, we are the small characters.
[00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:37.660]   We are not the famous people, right?
[00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:44.220]   We don't have a lot of followers on our IG, right?
[00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:46.680]   On your TikTok, right?
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:48.760]   Nobody take notes of you.
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:51.740]   But you matter to God.
[00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:56.920]   The small characters doing small deeds of faith.
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:01.340]   Couple months ago, in June,
[00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:04.140]   we took a family trip to New York.
[00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:06.600]   So we went to this military museum
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:09.140]   called Intrepid Museum in New York.
[00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:11.180]   It's a fascinating museum.
[00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:13.920]   So we went into a retired submarine,
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:17.400]   and then we went to a retired aircraft carrier,
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:19.500]   and it's just amazing, there's so much to see.
[00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:24.040]   There's so much more to see than a film museum.
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:25.760]   So I really enjoyed that day,
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:29.680]   and then I went into this gallery of aircrafts,
[00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:34.620]   and it has a one-to-one model of space shuttle.
[00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:39.180]   It's fascinating, right?
[00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:42.580]   We don't use space shuttles anymore, right?
[00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:45.280]   It's a retired program.
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:47.900]   So I was kind of taking pictures and reading
[00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:50.340]   all this information about the space shuttle program
[00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:54.080]   and all that, and then it just dawned on me
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:58.240]   there were two space shuttle disasters that happened
[00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:02.120]   in the history of the program,
[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:05.460]   both related to space shuttle accidents.
[00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:11.640]   Now, back in 1986, those who are older like me,
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:15.100]   would remember back in 1986,
[00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:18.960]   NASA space shuttle Challenger
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:23.800]   exploded seconds after launching,
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:28.920]   only 73 seconds after lifting off.
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:31.380]   And the disasters claimed the lives
[00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:34.380]   of all seven people in the aircraft.
[00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:39.220]   All people on board died, including a teacher,
[00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:43.460]   the first civilian in the space program.
[00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:47.220]   And after the disaster, investigation revealed
[00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:50.460]   what was wrong.
[00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:53.640]   It was actually a small, old rain seal
[00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:58.140]   that got brittle because of the low quality
[00:22:58.140 --> 00:22:59.900]   of the old rain seal.
[00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:03.240]   It becomes brittle in cold temperatures.
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:07.460]   And that small, old rain fail,
[00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:13.500]   and then the entire aircraft, flames broke out,
[00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:18.120]   and then the spacecraft just explode in the air,
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:20.560]   right in front of the eyes.
[00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:23.320]   Exploded, and then disintegrated.
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:26.440]   That was back in 1986.
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:30.140]   The other big disaster was 2003.
[00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:35.540]   Columbia, and other space shuttle.
[00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:39.380]   Now, this time, the accident did not happen
[00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:40.880]   when it takes off.
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:44.920]   It actually took off, and then went into space,
[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:48.460]   and did its thing, and then on the way back
[00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:50.320]   to the atmosphere.
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:53.480]   We entered the atmosphere, the space shuttle
[00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:57.640]   disintegrated into pieces in the sky of northern Texas.
[00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:03.000]   Again, killing all seven crew members.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.560]   Investigation revealed what's wrong.
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:13.240]   It's actually a small piece of foam insulation,
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:18.540]   fell off, and then it damaged the left wing,
[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:25.480]   and then, as the spacecraft continued to go
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:29.640]   in supersonic speed, it disintegrated into pieces.
[00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:33.400]   All people died.
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:37.580]   Now, the long investigation of the entire
[00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:41.960]   space shuttle program tells us there was something wrong
[00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:43.880]   actually from early on.
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:47.520]   It's that the crew members or the engineers
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:50.160]   trying to put together the aircraft,
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:52.760]   and program it, and all that,
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:56.260]   they actually made a lot of small mistakes,
[00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:58.600]   or small getaway.
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:03.120]   Some of the lower quality stuff that they used,
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:06.060]   or they didn't pay attention too much.
[00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:10.820]   And the engineers thought, "Oh, we could get away."
[00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:12.460]   And they did.
[00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:15.480]   And time after time, they got away,
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:18.400]   but at the end, disasters happened.
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:22.240]   They called the entire process of,
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:24.500]   "It's okay, we can get by."
[00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:29.080]   That sort of mentality, that sort of stuff that they did.
[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:33.260]   The entire process they called normalization of deviance.
[00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:38.400]   Deviance is deviating from the standard practice, right?
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:42.560]   It's only a small deviation from the standard practice.
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:48.360]   Not quite up to par, but a little bit less deviance,
[00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:51.160]   but they normalize it.
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:52.000]   It's okay.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.160]   We make excuse.
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:57.560]   All the small things,
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:02.360]   and the entire aircraft disintegrated.
[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:08.100]   I think this is a perfect example for all of us,
[00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:11.100]   because if you think about it, life,
[00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:15.060]   it consists of many mundane things,
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:18.980]   many routine things.
[00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:23.080]   Sometimes we speak of spiritual discipline,
[00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:25.180]   spiritual habit, right?
[00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:28.480]   All of those things are really, really small.
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:32.460]   All of these changes that God expects us to do
[00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:35.500]   are actually very, very minor, right?
[00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:38.020]   In the big scheme of things, right?
[00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:41.440]   In this generation, there's a phrase called
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:43.780]   to be voked, W-O-K-E, right?
[00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:47.140]   To be voked, what does it mean?
[00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:50.040]   To be voked means to be aware of
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:52.800]   important issues in the world.
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:55.540]   Racial justice, social justice,
[00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:59.480]   those are the big things that we need to pay attention to.
[00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:02.680]   To be voked, that is what it means, right?
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:04.880]   There's nothing wrong with that.
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:07.360]   We should concern about justice issues.
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:09.520]   We should, the big issues.
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:12.340]   But you know, think about it.
[00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:13.940]   Life often operates
[00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:16.360]   on small details.
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:22.500]   The small and mundane things,
[00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:24.420]   they all matter to God.
[00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:28.580]   You think about your character growth,
[00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:32.780]   your spiritual attitude toward other people,
[00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:36.520]   your attitude toward things entrusted to you.
[00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:41.420]   Don't we all find small excuses?
[00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:44.500]   We all do, right?
[00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:45.500]   I do, right?
[00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:49.780]   And we always say to ourselves,
[00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:51.580]   what's the big deal, right?
[00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:55.240]   If I miss this, if I don't do that, right?
[00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:56.940]   If I'm less than faithful,
[00:27:56.940 --> 00:28:00.760]   I kind of deviated from the standard,
[00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:02.320]   that's all right, right?
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:04.420]   We're still alive, right?
[00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:05.700]   What's the big deal, God?
[00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:07.180]   What is the big deal?
[00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:08.680]   I can do it later.
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:10.640]   I can procrastinate, right?
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:12.780]   Because there's no big deal.
[00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:15.620]   The story of Jericho tells you,
[00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:16.960]   it's a big deal.
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:20.320]   The small deeds are big deals.
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:24.980]   Church life, the standard practice
[00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:28.200]   of a normal Christian life,
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:31.480]   how we relate to other people.
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:35.400]   When we are on the wrong, we apologize.
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:37.100]   We ask for forgiveness.
[00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:38.780]   Those are really small things, right?
[00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:40.900]   It's not dramatic.
[00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:45.100]   It's not something that will change the world,
[00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:47.020]   but they matter to God.
[00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:52.580]   The story of Jericho tells you life,
[00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:55.260]   it's like a cathedral.
[00:28:55.260 --> 00:29:00.060]   A cathedral is built by stone after stone
[00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:01.420]   and stone after stone.
[00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:03.800]   All these pieces have to fit together
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:06.780]   in order to build a big building.
[00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:08.220]   Your life is like that.
[00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:09.980]   If you're missing one of those,
[00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:11.680]   someday it will collapse.
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:13.840]   Someday it will crumble.
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:17.500]   The growth of your spiritual life is the same way.
[00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:20.240]   It's the small habit add on small habit
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:22.180]   add on small habit.
[00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:24.540]   And the habit will shape you,
[00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:27.900]   will mold you into the image of God.
[00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:32.080]   Without those habits, without those small deeds,
[00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:35.580]   your life cannot be built, right?
[00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:37.080]   Let's be reminded.
[00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:41.400]   In the sight of God, small deeds matter.
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:49.180]   The greatness or the maturity of your spiritual life
[00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:51.420]   or your character as a whole
[00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:54.580]   is measured by many, many small deeds.
[00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:58.700]   And what God expects us to do
[00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:02.380]   is to be faithful with all the small deeds.
[00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:04.380]   And it will add up.
[00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:07.720]   It will pave you a path to be successful
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:10.900]   in the sense that to be spiritual,
[00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:13.660]   to be God-pleasing, to be Godly
[00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:15.740]   in your character growth.
[00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:21.180]   Let us all remind ourselves and take a look at yourself.
[00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:26.260]   What kind of small things am I giving excuses to lately?
[00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:33.340]   That I tell myself, what is the big deal?
[00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:34.540]   Chill out, God.
[00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:36.300]   Can you chill out for a little bit?
[00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:39.460]   I just don't want to do that, right?
[00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:41.580]   Those are really, really important
[00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:43.380]   even though they are small.
[00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:45.700]   Just like Jericho.
[00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:47.460]   What is your Jericho?
[00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:51.100]   What is your Jericho?
[00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:53.100]   Let's all pray together.
[00:30:53.100 --> 00:31:02.100]   Father, we come before you and
[00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:05.180]   we know that all the details of our lives
[00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:07.060]   are important to you.
[00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:10.500]   And sometimes they are even more important.
[00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:13.460]   They're not as big issues.
[00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:17.540]   We just pray that your spirit will remind us all.
[00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:22.400]   Help us to see that we need to be faithful
[00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:26.580]   not only with the big stuff,
[00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:29.540]   but the small details.
[00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:33.660]   (piano music)
[00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:37.820]   Remind us and help us to do some self-examination.
[00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:41.260]   To look into our lives.
[00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:45.180]   Are there any habits that we have forgotten?
[00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:49.060]   Are there any small deeds that we have
[00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:51.020]   given excuses to?
[00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:52.780]   Procrastinate, delay?
[00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:57.540]   Help us to be pleasing to you.
[00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:00.980]   Thank you for being our God.
[00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:06.220]   Help us to grow in such a way
[00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:08.540]   that will build up our character.
[00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:12.140]   That our being will be shaped by your grace.
[00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:17.580]   And help us do all the small deeds faithfully.
[00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:23.020]   So that our life can be built up one stone at a time.
[00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:24.700]   One layer at a time.
[00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:29.340]   Help us to grow into the image of your son.
[00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:33.700]   Remind us how we speak.
[00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:36.220]   Every single word is important.
[00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:39.980]   Remind us all of our meditation,
[00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:43.620]   our thought life,
[00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:46.120]   all the details are important.
[00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:49.660]   How we meditate on your word,
[00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:52.740]   how we reflect on spiritual insights.
[00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:57.620]   Help us build up our habits,
[00:32:57.620 --> 00:33:01.300]   our lives so that we can be pleasing to you.
[00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:04.360]   In Christ we pray.
