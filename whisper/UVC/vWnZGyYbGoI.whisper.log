[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   (audience clapping)
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.520]   - Hello, hello.
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.160]   Okay, good morning, UV.
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.960]   Thank you for welcoming me to your church and your community.
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.740]   It was a pleasure to spend some time
[00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.320]   with the kids this morning and to be able to,
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.960]   yeah, speak from the word of God with you all today.
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.840]   So if you have some non-believer friends or family
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.580]   and you have tried to share the gospel with them,
[00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.980]   I'm sure at some point you will run into some questions
[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.920]   along the line of, if there is a God,
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.700]   or if God is really good, why is there so much suffering
[00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.240]   and evil in our world?
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.760]   Well, for some people, this are maybe just a way
[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.500]   for them to discredit the Christian God,
[00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.140]   but I feel like for the rest of the people,
[00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.280]   this is a legitimate and reasonable questions
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.900]   just coming from either their personal experience
[00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.740]   or just the things that they have seen around the world.
[00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.320]   And if I'm just being honest,
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.280]   I feel like even a lot of times as Christians,
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.960]   we don't really have any adequate answers
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.780]   to this question as well.
[00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.760]   And living in a big city like Chicago,
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.720]   if we just pay attention or open our eyes
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.880]   to our surrounding, it is not hard for us
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.560]   to see a lot of brokenness, injustice, and suffering
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.920]   that is in such close proximity with us, right?
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.120]   And at times like this, these questions of evil
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.260]   and suffering become even more relevant.
[00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.640]   So my questions for today is, as the people of God,
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.920]   how should we face the suffering and pain in our lives?
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.720]   As believers, how do we suffer differently
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.080]   than the rest of the world?
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.240]   So today, we're going to take a look at Psalm 39
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.840]   and see how it approaches these questions.
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.560]   I will be reading from the NIV version,
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.160]   so if you have a different version,
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.160]   you can feel free to follow along on the screen behind me.
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.520]   So Psalm 39 is attributed to David,
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.880]   but the actual circumstances behind these Psalms
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.240]   is not clear.
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.860]   But what we can know is this,
[00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.480]   this is an individual lament to the Lord,
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.320]   and this is a Psalm that is basically lament,
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.620]   pouring out a complaint to the Lord.
[00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.520]   So let's look at Psalm 39 together.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.280]   (pages rustling)
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.080]   Verse one.
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:30.000]   I say, I will watch my ways and keep my tongue from sin.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.660]   I will put a muzzle on my mouth
[00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.540]   while in the presence of the wicked.
[00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.960]   So I remain utterly silent, not even saying anything good.
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.880]   But my anguish increases.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.160]   My heart grew hot within me.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.900]   While I meditated, the fire burned.
[00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.040]   Then I spoke with my tongue.
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.360]   So before we can answer the questions
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.320]   of how, as the people of God,
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.880]   we can suffer differently than the rest of the world,
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.160]   we first need to come to terms that, as believers,
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.720]   we are actually not exempt from suffering in this life.
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.980]   Again, as believers,
[00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.080]   we are not exempt from suffering in this life.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.720]   In verse one, we see that the Psalmist,
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.800]   he chooses to remain silent and to restrain himself,
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.200]   and this is for two reasons.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.440]   First, so that he does not sin against the Lord.
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.080]   And secondly, because the evil and the wicked are present.
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.240]   Again, the actual circumstances behind the Psalmist
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.280]   is not clear, but it is very possible
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.160]   that these wicked people have somewhat contributed
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.920]   to his suffering as well.
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.100]   And one of the realities of living in a broken
[00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.320]   and fallen world is that even sometimes
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.480]   our best attempt to do the right thing
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.000]   might actually bring us undesirable results.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.440]   Maybe some of you here,
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.760]   you might lose a job promotion at your work
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.520]   because you choose to hold on to your Christian ethics
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.300]   or Christian morals.
[00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.000]   Or maybe for some of you,
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.200]   you might become a target or outcast
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.400]   in different social settings because, once again,
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.800]   you choose to remain outspoken about your faith.
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.740]   And maybe for some of you, you might lose a friendship
[00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.640]   because you choose to speak the truth and remain truthful.
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.660]   And this is exactly what the Psalmist is experiencing here.
[00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.500]   Despite his best effort to do the right thing,
[00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.100]   which in this case is to restrain himself
[00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.960]   and to not speak up,
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.400]   we see that his situation actually become worse
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.240]   and that the anguish increase within him,
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.800]   his anguish intensify.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.360]   So, can you sense the frustration
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.860]   that the Psalmist is experiencing right here?
[00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.560]   And can you think of similar situation
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.560]   in your personal life as well?
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.420]   Maybe you know that you are doing the right thing.
[00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:44.960]   You know that you are doing the way
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.020]   that God would want you to do,
[00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.720]   but the outcome of it might just not be favorable
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:50.560]   towards you.
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:56.740]   And as a result of that, we see that the Psalmist,
[00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.040]   he could no longer hold back his silence
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.340]   and he finally decide to speak up.
[00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:02.920]   So, listen to what he has to say
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.720]   when he finally decide to speak up.
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.680]   So, verse four.
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:13.140]   Show me, Lord, my life's end and the number of my days.
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.580]   Let me know how fleeting my life is.
[00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.640]   You have made my days a mere hand breath.
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.080]   The span of my years is as nothing before you.
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.380]   Everyone is but a breath, even those who seem secure.
[00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:32.120]   Surely everyone goes around like a mere phantom.
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.240]   In vain they rush about, heaping up wealth
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.480]   without knowing whose it will finally be.
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:41.060]   And so, let us just pause here for a moment.
[00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.620]   This three verse that we have just read through,
[00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.980]   the imagery that if you just try to like
[00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.200]   paint a picture of it, it is actually kind of bleak
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.900]   and in some ways hopeless, right?
[00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.960]   And so, again, before we can answer the questions
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.600]   of how as the people of God we can suffer differently,
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.920]   we need to acknowledge that suffering and death
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.080]   is part of our human experience,
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.480]   living in a broken and fallen world.
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.920]   So, what is the Psalmist's request here
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.560]   to the Lord in verse four?
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.080]   He asks, "Show me, Lord, my life's end
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.740]   "and the number of my days.
[00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:19.740]   "Let me know how fleeting my life is."
[00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.280]   In some of the more recent scholarship,
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.600]   verse four is interpreted not as a request
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.260]   to know how brief his human life is,
[00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.520]   because you already know and acknowledge that
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:29.980]   in verse five and six.
[00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:30.820]   But right here in verse four,
[00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:32.840]   this is actually a request to know
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.100]   how long his suffering would last.
[00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.120]   Again, because he understands that suffering and death
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.960]   is just part of human experience, living in this world.
[00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:44.060]   And the urgency of this request
[00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.660]   to know how long his suffering would last
[00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.300]   is then further reinforced by his own acknowledgement
[00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:50.860]   in verse five and six that,
[00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:54.540]   "Yes, surely, life is indeed brief,
[00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:57.740]   "and even our human effort can be meaningless as well."
[00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:02.740]   So, our English translation might not capture this well,
[00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:04.180]   but in these three verses,
[00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.380]   there's a Hebrew word that is being repeated twice
[00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:09.100]   that is the Hebrew word hevel.
[00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:13.300]   It is being translated as mere hand breath in verse five,
[00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:17.220]   and in verse six, it is being translated as in vain.
[00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:20.180]   So, this word hevel is actually a major theme
[00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.260]   in the wisdom literature of Ecclesiastes.
[00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:24.700]   And in a more literal sense,
[00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:28.800]   it just means something like a breath or a vapor.
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.720]   And in a more metaphorical sense,
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:35.700]   it can refer to something that is fleeting or elusive.
[00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:38.000]   So, in the book of Ecclesiastes,
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.300]   with everything under the sun being deemed as hevel
[00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.880]   or being deemed as meaningless,
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.380]   the author actually concludes at the end of the book
[00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:50.340]   that, "The end of the matters, all has been heard.
[00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:53.060]   "Fear God and keep his commandment,
[00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:55.140]   "for this is the whole duty of man."
[00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:58.820]   In other words, the author of Ecclesiastes
[00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:01.140]   is trying to say is that,
[00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:03.940]   "The only things that truly give meaning and purpose
[00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:08.500]   "to this life is a life that is live with God,
[00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.040]   "a life that is live with God,
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:12.880]   "that is fear God and keep his commandment."
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:16.960]   So, similarly here in Psalm 39,
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.680]   we see that by acknowledging
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.240]   how short and transient human life is,
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:22.900]   the psalmist is actually agreeing
[00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:25.320]   with the book of Ecclesiastes that,
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:30.320]   "Yes, life apart from God is indeed meaningless or hevel."
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:35.100]   And we will actually see this being more clearly
[00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:37.180]   pan out in the second half of the Psalms.
[00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:43.980]   So, now knowing that sin, suffering, and death
[00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:46.420]   are just inevitable part of our human life,
[00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:50.860]   where does this leave us as the people of God?
[00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:53.380]   Where does this leave us as believers?
[00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:56.900]   And what is the main thing that actually differentiate us
[00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.800]   than the rest of the world in the way that we suffer?
[00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:02.760]   If we continue to look in verse four,
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.920]   I think the psalmist actually provide us with some clues.
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.680]   So, look with me in verse seven.
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:09.900]   So, verse seven,
[00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:12.480]   "But now, Lord, what do I look for?
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.380]   "My hope is in you."
[00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:19.180]   So, yes, we know that sin and suffering
[00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:21.540]   are just inevitable part of our human life
[00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:23.380]   because we live in a fallen world.
[00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:26.160]   However, as the people of God,
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.740]   we do not have to face these realities
[00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.900]   with despair or hopelessness.
[00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:33.760]   As the people of God,
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:37.240]   we have a greater hope in the eternal God himself.
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.600]   So, today, what I really want to press in on our heart
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:44.160]   is this, that even in the midst of our sin and suffering,
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.980]   we can hope in the Lord.
[00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:49.440]   Even in the midst of our sin and suffering,
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.160]   we can hope in the Lord.
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:55.200]   And this is a difference, brothers and sisters.
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:58.420]   This is the thing that actually set us as believer,
[00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:01.800]   as people that believe in the Lord,
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.540]   that believe in Jesus.
[00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:05.520]   This is the thing that sets us apart
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:08.360]   from the rest of the world in the way that we suffer
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:11.200]   because with God as our eternal hope,
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.080]   we can put our hope in him,
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.820]   even in the midst of our sin and suffering.
[00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:19.080]   And I want to be clear right here.
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:23.120]   The way that the psalmist used the word hope in verse seven
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:24.600]   is probably very different than the way
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:27.480]   that we use the word hope in our current day and age.
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:31.400]   Maybe some of you here are students
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:35.020]   and or think back to your time as a student,
[00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:37.540]   you might completely butcher your final exams
[00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:39.920]   and when it is time to get your grade back,
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:42.360]   you might use the word hope in this sense of like,
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.620]   "Oh man, I just hope that I can pass this test
[00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:47.240]   "so that I don't have to retake the entire class."
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:50.880]   Or maybe some of you are new parents
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.500]   that have some younger kids at home
[00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:54.140]   and you just haven't been able to sleep
[00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:57.460]   for the past, I don't know, week or two weeks,
[00:10:57.460 --> 00:10:59.940]   and you might use the word hope in this sense of,
[00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:01.480]   "Oh, I just hope that I can get
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.580]   "maybe just four hours of sleep tonight."
[00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:08.120]   Again, this is not what the word hope means here
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.800]   and this is not how the psalmist used the word hope
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.700]   in verse seven here.
[00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:16.220]   In contrast to the meaningless or the heavel of life
[00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:19.180]   that he talks about in the previous verse,
[00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:20.940]   right here in verse seven,
[00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:23.860]   the object of the hope is actually anchored
[00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:28.200]   in the one that is from everlasting to everlasting.
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.580]   The object of our hope is anchored
[00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:33.340]   in the one who never fell on his promises
[00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:35.100]   and the one who will never change.
[00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:38.020]   In other words, the object of our hope
[00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:40.900]   is anchored in the eternal God himself,
[00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.620]   just as the psalmist confidently proclaimed,
[00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:46.200]   "My hope is in you, Lord."
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.820]   So, what are some of the grounds
[00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:51.140]   of our confidence in the Lord
[00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:55.020]   and why is he our only hope as the people of God?
[00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:56.460]   So, let's follow along the psalmist
[00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:59.660]   as he pour out his request to the Lord.
[00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:01.780]   Verse eight.
[00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:05.580]   Save me from all my transgression.
[00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:09.060]   Do not make me the scorn of fools.
[00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:13.420]   I was silent, I would not open my mouth,
[00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:15.660]   for you are the one who has done this.
[00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:18.820]   Remove this scourge from me.
[00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:21.060]   I am overcome by the blow of your hand.
[00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:26.220]   When you rebuke and discipline anyone for their sin,
[00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:28.400]   you consume their wealth like a moth.
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:32.200]   Surely, everyone is but a breath.
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:35.940]   Hear my prayer, Lord.
[00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:37.640]   Listen to my cry for help.
[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:41.460]   Do not be deaf to my weeping,
[00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:44.520]   for I dwell with you as a foreigner,
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:47.240]   a stranger, as all my ancestors were.
[00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:51.980]   Look away from me, that I may enjoy life again
[00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:54.820]   before I depart and am no more.
[00:12:54.820 --> 00:13:00.060]   So, the biggest reason that we can put our hope in the Lord
[00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:02.360]   and that he is our only hope
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:05.820]   is because ultimately, he is the only one
[00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:09.580]   who can deliver us from our sins.
[00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:11.800]   So, more than the threats of the wicked
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.580]   that we have seen in verse one
[00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:16.020]   and the threat that comes from the outside,
[00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:18.500]   the psalmist understand that ultimately,
[00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.420]   what he needs to be delivered from
[00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:23.780]   is something that is within him, that is his own sins.
[00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:28.380]   And again, I feel like a lot of times,
[00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:31.100]   speaking for myself, when things doesn't go right,
[00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:33.360]   it is easy, again, for me to point my fingers
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.220]   at things that is outside of me,
[00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:37.880]   maybe my circumstances, different people,
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:39.320]   different relationships.
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:44.140]   But how often do we actually take a look within ourself
[00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:45.780]   and to examine our own heart?
[00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:50.060]   I think this is a good practice that we should all,
[00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:52.700]   yeah, be aware of.
[00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:55.460]   A lot of times, instead of blaming the things
[00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:58.140]   that is outside of us, that is not out of control,
[00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:01.700]   we also have to take a look within ourself as well.
[00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:05.040]   So, yes, we can hope in the Lord
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.020]   even in the midst of our sin and suffering
[00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:10.400]   because he is the only one that can deliver us.
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.540]   But I also want you all to hear this.
[00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:14.980]   God's deliverance does not necessarily
[00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:17.460]   preclude divine discipline.
[00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:20.980]   Or sometimes, the way that God delivered us
[00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:23.200]   is actually through his divine discipline
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.260]   or his divine wrath.
[00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:29.340]   This is because the divine wrath and discipline of the Lord
[00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:32.620]   is actually a means of grace that is with the purpose
[00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:35.620]   to bring us into an awareness of our own sins,
[00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:38.980]   of our own shortcoming, so that we can come before the Lord
[00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:43.980]   in repentance, in confession, asking him for forgiveness.
[00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:47.420]   In other words, it is actually for our own good
[00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:49.300]   that the Lord has disciplined us
[00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:52.100]   and to deliver us from our own sins.
[00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:54.900]   And again, this is what the psalmist is experiencing
[00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:57.220]   right here from verse nine to 11.
[00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:02.460]   So, having the awareness of the futility of life
[00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:05.820]   and also the awareness of his own sins,
[00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:08.960]   it prompts the psalmist to cry out one last time
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:09.800]   to the Lord.
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.940]   He say, "Hear my prayer, Lord.
[00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:14.860]   "Listen to my cry for help.
[00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:17.320]   "Do not be deaf to my weeping,
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.580]   "for I dwell with you as a foreigner,
[00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:23.060]   "a stranger, as all my ancestors were."
[00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:26.160]   So right here, again, he cried out to the Lord,
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.680]   asking the Lord to hear his prayer,
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:31.160]   do not be deaf to his cry,
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:34.140]   and to not be silent to his tears.
[00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:35.840]   And what is the reason of that?
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:38.680]   Because he understands that, he say,
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:41.540]   "For I dwell with you as a foreigner,
[00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:45.180]   "a stranger, as all my ancestors were."
[00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:49.380]   And by comparing himself to a foreigner or a stranger,
[00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:51.260]   the psalmist understand that,
[00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:55.620]   ultimately, his final destination is not this short
[00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:57.900]   and transient life on this earth,
[00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:00.580]   but he's actually on his way to a life
[00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:02.680]   that will last for eternity.
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:06.100]   He understands that the power of sins over him
[00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:07.900]   is only temporary,
[00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.120]   because one day he will not only be free
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:12.540]   from the power and the penalty of sins,
[00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:15.900]   but when he spend eternity with the Lord,
[00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:19.000]   he will be free from the presence of sins forever as well.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.060]   In other words, he knows that he has a place
[00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:26.100]   in the family of God.
[00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:28.700]   This is why he emphasized to the Lord that,
[00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:31.620]   "I dwell as a foreigner with you.
[00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:34.880]   "I dwell with the Lord as a stranger."
[00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:39.300]   And if we just continue, in verse 13,
[00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:42.200]   we see that the psalm just sort of ends abruptly,
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:44.660]   with the psalmist asking the Lord
[00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:47.300]   to turn away his angry gaze from him
[00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:51.380]   so that he is able to enjoy the remainder of his life.
[00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:53.100]   And we actually find no resolution
[00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:56.020]   or no response from the Lord in the psalm itself.
[00:16:56.020 --> 00:17:01.180]   So, we've come to the end of these psalms,
[00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:04.140]   but I want to turn our attention to this.
[00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:08.340]   The silence that the psalmist is facing from the Lord,
[00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:12.060]   pouring out his request before the Lord,
[00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:15.100]   but hearing no response, at least within the psalmist.
[00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:18.300]   I think the psalmist is actually not alone
[00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:20.740]   in facing this deafening silence from the Lord.
[00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:23.980]   I know last week we observed Good Friday
[00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:26.660]   and celebrate Easter Sunday.
[00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:29.580]   So, we're probably very familiar with this.
[00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:32.900]   Right before Jesus' death at the cross,
[00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:36.660]   he pours out the cry quoted from Psalm 22.
[00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:40.860]   "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
[00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:44.820]   And I feel like a lot of time we can just
[00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:47.700]   kind of like brush off the magnitude
[00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:49.780]   of this cry from Jesus.
[00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:53.900]   But this person that make this cry at the cross,
[00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:58.020]   this is the outcry of Jesus, the Son of God,
[00:17:58.020 --> 00:17:59.660]   bearing the sins of the world
[00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:02.580]   and facing kind of like the wrath
[00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:04.980]   from his own Father as well.
[00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:07.740]   But we know that as the obedient Son of God,
[00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:10.100]   Jesus understands that the only way
[00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:13.100]   to resurrection and glorification
[00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:15.500]   is actually through his suffering at the cross.
[00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:18.380]   So, speaking about this, the book of Hebrews
[00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:21.060]   described that Jesus, as the author
[00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:23.140]   and perfecter of our life,
[00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:26.260]   "For the joy sets before him,
[00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:29.460]   "he endured the cross, despising its shame."
[00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:32.660]   And so Jesus' example actually becomes a paradigm
[00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:35.940]   for all of us as believers on how we are
[00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:40.260]   to make our journey on our life on this earth
[00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:43.500]   with all his suffering, with all his pain.
[00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:46.140]   And we are able to endure our journey through this life
[00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:49.620]   because Jesus not only provide us with the way
[00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:52.780]   through his death and resurrection at the cross,
[00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:56.660]   but Jesus actually also sets an example of endurance
[00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:57.860]   for us to follow.
[00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:01.140]   And this is why he is our only hope
[00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:03.660]   in the midst of our sin and suffering.
[00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:06.020]   The reason that Jesus is our only hope
[00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:07.540]   in the midst of our sin and suffering
[00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:11.300]   is because he is the only one not just providing
[00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:13.620]   the means for us to be reconciled to God
[00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:15.740]   through his death and resurrection,
[00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:19.100]   but he's also the only one that lives a perfect life
[00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:20.060]   for us to follow.
[00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:22.820]   So from the time that we put our faith in Jesus
[00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:25.420]   to the time that Jesus comes again,
[00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:28.820]   Jesus basically model for us on how we are
[00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:29.980]   to live our life.
[00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:32.580]   And he is the only perfect example for us.
[00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:38.180]   So maybe some of you here,
[00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:41.180]   you're in a season where you're just standing face to face
[00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:44.500]   with suffering or just with a lot of brokenness,
[00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:47.740]   whether it is physically, relationally,
[00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:50.060]   emotionally, or mentally.
[00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:53.700]   Or maybe are you in a season
[00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:56.500]   where the realities and pressure of life
[00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:58.220]   just feels so overwhelming.
[00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:04.820]   Or maybe like the psalmist here in Psalm 39,
[00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:07.300]   you are currently just facing the deafening silence
[00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:10.660]   from the Lord, despite countless days and nights
[00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:12.740]   of prayers and fasting.
[00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:18.860]   And if I'm being honest, I am familiar with this currently.
[00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:25.300]   Or perhaps there's just a particular sin
[00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:28.700]   or addiction in your life that you have prayed
[00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:31.700]   and asked the Lord to kind of like remove you from,
[00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.820]   but you're just struggling to overcome.
[00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:37.100]   Of course, I want to acknowledge
[00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:40.820]   that all of these experience are true and real,
[00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:42.460]   and I don't view them lightly.
[00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:46.740]   But maybe, just maybe at the same time,
[00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:48.580]   this might be an opportunity for us
[00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:50.980]   to learn how to hope in the Lord.
[00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:54.380]   How to put our faith and trust in Jesus.
[00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:56.620]   Again, because our faith does not just get perfected
[00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:58.060]   in an instance.
[00:20:58.060 --> 00:20:59.460]   To be able to hope in the Lord
[00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:02.180]   actually requires a lot of practice.
[00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:06.100]   It requires constantly coming before the Lord,
[00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:10.180]   asking Him, and in some ways, when He responds to us,
[00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:13.060]   that are the basis of our future hope in Him as well.
[00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:15.780]   So once again, before I end,
[00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:18.340]   I want to encourage you all with the truth
[00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:20.500]   that the psalmist here in Psalm 39
[00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:24.660]   that even in the midst of our sin and suffering,
[00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:28.100]   we can put our hope in the Lord.
[00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:32.100]   So I'm gonna pray us, so let's bow our head in prayers.
[00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:42.500]   Heavenly Father, we just want to give our praise
[00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:45.300]   and give our thanks to you.
[00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:48.260]   For you are our hope,
[00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:50.020]   and we are grateful to you.
[00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:56.060]   For you are the only one that we can put our hope in,
[00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:58.340]   and the only one that would never fail us.
[00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:04.540]   Jesus, we praise you,
[00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:08.300]   for you are the only one that provide the means
[00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:11.060]   for us to be able to reconcile to the Father again.
[00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:17.140]   And you're not only a God, but you are fully human as well.
[00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:20.380]   A great high priest who is able to empathize
[00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:22.020]   with our weakness,
[00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:24.700]   because you have been tended in every way,
[00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:27.540]   just as we are, yet without sin.
[00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:33.020]   So even when we face just a different suffering
[00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:35.260]   and challenges that life thrown at us,
[00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:38.780]   we know that Lord, we know that Jesus,
[00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:40.380]   you know how he feels,
[00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:43.860]   and you are with us in the midst of our sin and suffering.
[00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:48.420]   Holy Spirit, we thank you for,
[00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:53.420]   you are the living and active spirit living in us.
[00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:56.740]   You intercede for us when we do not know
[00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:59.340]   what we ought to say or what we ought to pray for.
[00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:03.100]   And yet, you know our hearts,
[00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:06.900]   and you pour out your prayers on our behalf before the Father.
[00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:11.180]   Lord, would you just teach us
[00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:13.740]   to learn how to put our hope in you
[00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:16.620]   in a way that honors you,
[00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:19.100]   in a way that brings glory to you,
[00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:21.820]   in a way that show the broken world
[00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:26.820]   that our God is a God that is worthy of all the praise
[00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:29.500]   and all the glory and all the honor.
[00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:32.940]   So we pray this in your son's name, amen.
[00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:35.440]   (piano music)
