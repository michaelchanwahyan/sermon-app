[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700]   Good morning, welcome to our worship service.
[00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.420]   This is the first sermon of the year 2023.
[00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.720]   As we say goodbye to 2022,
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.020]   welcome to the new year 2023.
[00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.380]   We are probably thinking about a lot of different things.
[00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.420]   The Christmas season was just over.
[00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.420]   Probably your life or your house was in chaos or in a mess
[00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.340]   and you're trying to fix it
[00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.700]   and trying to put your house or your life back in order.
[00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.860]   The vacation mode is over
[00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.620]   and we're back to the so-called reality.
[00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.340]   And we should thank God in our calendar,
[00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.140]   in our daily life pattern,
[00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.140]   there's always time and always opportunity
[00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.380]   for us to say goodbye to the old and welcome the new.
[00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.280]   And for us to transition from one period to another period.
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.940]   I think this is a God sent moment
[00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.260]   for us to think about what our lives should be
[00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.420]   and where our life is heading to.
[00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.300]   In the new year, many of the people, including ourselves,
[00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.020]   are probably thinking about some resolutions, right?
[00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.660]   Some new year's resolution, probably losing weight.
[00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.180]   Any of you are thinking about this?
[00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.060]   Or quit some of the bad habit, going back to gym,
[00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.860]   paying off some debts or saving more money,
[00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.800]   building up a better or good habits.
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.700]   This kind of new year's resolutions.
[00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.660]   And I keep thinking about this question.
[00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.080]   I'm sure you do as well.
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:52.100]   What, as questions, should be thinking about
[00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.860]   in terms of new year's resolutions?
[00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.180]   As we transition from one period to another period,
[00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.420]   as we say goodbye to the old and welcoming the new year,
[00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.580]   what kind of new year's resolution
[00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.460]   should we be thinking about as the people of God?
[00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.620]   So I have chosen a fairly familiar passage
[00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.220]   to share with you, to reflect upon,
[00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.460]   so that we know what Jesus wants us to do.
[00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.660]   What kind of new year's resolution
[00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.660]   should we be keeping in mind at this time of the year?
[00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.420]   So as we welcome the new year,
[00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.460]   why don't we just read through this passage
[00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.460]   and see what we can take out of this passage?
[00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.780]   What kind of lessons we can learn?
[00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.340]   Here is Matthew chapter six.
[00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.420]   Now, Matthew chapter six is a familiar passage.
[00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.920]   It's actually the, sort of the conclusion
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.860]   of Sermon on the Mount,
[00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.180]   the famous, well-known sermon of Jesus
[00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.060]   giving to his disciples while on earth,
[00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.260]   teaching us what kingdom living is all about.
[00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.980]   So right at the end, almost the end of this long sermon
[00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.980]   from Matthew chapter five, all the way to chapter seven,
[00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.020]   we come to the end of chapter six.
[00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:26.020]   Six, 25, it says, "Therefore I tell you," Jesus says,
[00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.740]   "do not be anxious about your life,
[00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.340]   "what you will eat or what you will drink,
[00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.280]   "nor about your body, what you will put on.
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.020]   "It's not your life more than food
[00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.620]   "and the body more than clothing.
[00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.820]   "Look at the birds of the air.
[00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.880]   "They neither sow nor reap
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.960]   "nor gather into bonds,
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.840]   "yet your heavenly Father feeds them.
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.980]   "Are you not more value than they?
[00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.880]   "And which of you, by being anxious,
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.880]   "can add one single hour or cupid to his span of life?"
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:14.380]   So Jesus said, "Don't you worry about your essential needs,
[00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.480]   "the money, your bank account, your investment,
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.140]   "all this earthly concern that we have."
[00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.900]   Now, Jesus is not saying that we should be irresponsible.
[00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.060]   That's not the teaching of the Bible.
[00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.340]   Jesus is saying our mind and our heart
[00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.340]   should not be so fixed upon things like these.
[00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.560]   He says, "Look at the birds of the air.
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.480]   "The Father is feeding them.
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.360]   "They don't work as hard as we do.
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.700]   "They don't gather into bonds, they don't harvest,
[00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.600]   "but the heavenly Father is feeding them
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.620]   "and keeping them alive."
[00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.860]   And he compares that to our lives.
[00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.860]   "And which of you, by being anxious, just worrying,
[00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:11.520]   "working so hard, right, or overworking,
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.820]   "how many of us can do this, being anxious,
[00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.820]   "can add one single hour to the span of our life?"
[00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.940]   Now, the original word behind the word hour is cupid.
[00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.360]   Cupid is the arm length of the king,
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.820]   most probably Egyptian king, Pharaoh,
[00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.000]   using his arm as the standard of measurement
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.920]   in the ancient days.
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:45.920]   Cupid is arm length, is the smallest unit of measurement,
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:52.300]   smallest unit of length.
[00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:57.880]   So Jesus is saying, by having anxiety,
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.880]   cannot add a single cupid, cannot add the most basic,
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:08.400]   the smallest unit to the span of life of hours.
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.320]   So he keeps on saying,
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.100]   "Why are you anxious about clothing?"
[00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:19.100]   Right, what we wear, the outward appearance,
[00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.560]   the outward things.
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.000]   He said, "Look at the lilies of the field, how they grow.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.440]   "They neither toil or spin."
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.880]   But I tell you, even King Solomon in all his glory
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.740]   was not to be compared to one of these,
[00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:42.240]   to the bird or the wild flowers, the lilies of the field.
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:48.340]   "But if God so clothes the grass of the field,
[00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.600]   "which today is alive, tomorrow will be gone
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.300]   "and thrown into an oven,
[00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:57.280]   "will he not much more clothe you,
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.180]   "O you of little faith?
[00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:04.960]   "Therefore, do not be anxious, saying,
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.360]   "What shall we eat?
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.720]   "What shall we drink?
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.260]   "What shall we wear?"
[00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.940]   For the Gentiles, those people who do not follow Jesus,
[00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:17.940]   do not know God, they seek after all these things,
[00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:23.200]   all this eating, drinking, clothing,
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.320]   but your heavenly Father knows what you need,
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.740]   that you need them all.
[00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:34.300]   But seek the kingdom of God and his righteousness
[00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:37.000]   and all these things will be added to you.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.540]   Now, therefore, do not be anxious about tomorrow,
[00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:45.420]   for tomorrow will be anxious for itself.
[00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:48.740]   Enough for the day, sufficient for the day
[00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:50.580]   is its own trouble.
[00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:56.160]   Now, this is the one unit, one of the units
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.700]   of the Sermon on the Mount,
[00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:02.300]   talking about how the disciples should be living.
[00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:08.340]   What is the disciple of Christ should be seeking after all.
[00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:13.340]   Jesus is comparing some of the things
[00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:18.340]   that those people who don't know Jesus,
[00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:21.540]   what they're seeking, what they're going after,
[00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:24.820]   and compared to what a disciple of Christ
[00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:26.820]   should be seeking and pursuing.
[00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:29.780]   I remember years ago,
[00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:36.580]   I left Israel after my trip.
[00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:39.820]   It was about more than 10 years ago.
[00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:43.340]   I left Israel and I was waiting for the flight
[00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:46.060]   in the Tel Aviv airport.
[00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:51.060]   So I was walking around in the hallway of the airport
[00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:54.380]   and then I bum into a map
[00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:59.260]   outside of the Elor Airlines.
[00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.700]   Now, the Elor Airlines, as you can see here,
[00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:06.900]   is the national Israeli airline
[00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:11.900]   and it's one of the most well-known airlines in the world.
[00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:16.220]   So I went by the counter
[00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:19.420]   and then I saw this map.
[00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:23.220]   You know, this map, I was pretty curious,
[00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:28.120]   why is there a map like this by the counter of Elor?
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.680]   Can you guess what this map is all about?
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.120]   What is this map?
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.640]   Now, I have some options here.
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:39.420]   A, intercontinental highway system.
[00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:44.420]   So this Elor is intercontinental Africa to Asia or Europe,
[00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:49.920]   probably a highway system road map
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:52.680]   or the airline route map
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:54.920]   or none of the above.
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.880]   Which one do you think this map is all about?
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.940]   Is it the highway system?
[00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:02.880]   Is it the route map?
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.040]   Or is it none of the above?
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:09.560]   Now, the answer is, it's none of the above.
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:13.360]   It's not the highway system.
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:18.320]   This is not a map of the Elor airline route map.
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.000]   And now what this is all about
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.720]   is actually routes or map of routes
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:29.540]   of the migratory birds in Israel.
[00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:33.400]   Migratory birds, as we know,
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.240]   they fly from south to north and north to south,
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.360]   depending on the season.
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:43.360]   When it is in the winter, it's getting so cold,
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:48.820]   the birds will migrate down to the warmer climate, right?
[00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:52.620]   In the continent of Africa.
[00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:55.800]   So this map is very interesting,
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:11:00.800]   just right outside of Elor airline back then 10 years ago.
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.100]   It's not there anymore.
[00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:03.100]   So I took a picture.
[00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:07.760]   So I took this picture because as I saw this map,
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:12.420]   I immediately thought of Matthew 6,
[00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:15.120]   when Jesus said, "Do not worry about what you eat
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.480]   "and what you drink."
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:22.400]   Look at the birds of the air, check them out,
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:23.960]   see how they fly.
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:27.840]   And I immediately thought of this passage
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:28.840]   of the Sermon on the Mount,
[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.600]   because Jesus was saying,
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.960]   referring to the birds of the air.
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:38.960]   And this is not by accident that Jesus knew something
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:43.200]   about the geography of Israel,
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.360]   because the birds are traveling north to south
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.000]   and south to north.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.040]   They have to travel through the narrow strip of land
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.540]   of Israel Palestine.
[00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:58.080]   As you can see on the left or the west side
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:02.000]   of this long narrow strip is the Mediterranean Sea.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.920]   And on the right is the desert of the Syrian,
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:15.360]   Saudi Arabia desert on the right or in the east.
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.980]   Now let me show you a map here.
[00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:21.660]   As you can see, this is the Google map.
[00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:25.520]   And you can see Israel is right here.
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:29.400]   And this long narrow corridor is the land bridge
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:34.360]   of all the continents, Africa, Asia minor and Europe,
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:35.920]   and Asia.
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.640]   This is the land bridge.
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:43.640]   And on the left is the huge Eastern Mediterranean Sea.
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:49.480]   And then on the right is the Saudi Arabia or Syrian desert.
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:53.580]   So the birds have to travel through from north to south
[00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:56.880]   or south to north, they have to fly through
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.160]   the land of Israel.
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.440]   In fact, in the land of Israel,
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:07.380]   just north of the lake of Galilee or Sea of Galilee,
[00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:12.760]   here there's a small strip of flat land called Hula Valley.
[00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:17.640]   This Hula Valley is famous for bird watching.
[00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:22.180]   In the end of the year, around the month of November
[00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:26.620]   or December, bird watching people would gather
[00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:30.140]   in this Hula Valley north of Sea of Galilee
[00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:33.700]   in order to just look at the birds,
[00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:38.220]   look at all this beautiful migratory birds
[00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:41.040]   flying through Israel.
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:45.940]   As you can see this beautiful pictures of birds
[00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:50.940]   and migratory birds are flying through the land of Israel,
[00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:58.100]   particularly through that corridor of Galilee.
[00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:02.620]   Migratory bird flying through Mount Hermon right here.
[00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:07.140]   So Jesus was saying, pointing to the birds
[00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:11.140]   and the disciples knew about this.
[00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:12.740]   It's about time of the year
[00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:15.940]   when the migratory birds will fly through
[00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:19.380]   this strip of land and they can see all sorts
[00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:24.380]   of different birds and different big and small
[00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:30.260]   flying creatures going through the land.
[00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:35.260]   So they are not unfamiliar with all of this
[00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:40.420]   beautiful birds and different migratory pattern.
[00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:46.540]   Jesus was pointing to something that they could see
[00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:51.540]   and they could observe and just ask them to open your eyes
[00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:56.660]   and see how the creatures of God, how the animals,
[00:14:56.660 --> 00:15:02.940]   how the birds are being taken care of by the heavenly father.
[00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:09.660]   So compared to our own lives, we are so much more valuable
[00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:13.220]   than one of these sparrow or birds.
[00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:18.940]   And then he take another example from the field.
[00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:23.220]   So the first example was to direct our eyes,
[00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:25.860]   direct our perspective toward the sky,
[00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:28.500]   see the migratory birds, right?
[00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:30.900]   They are being taken care of by the heavenly father,
[00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:33.180]   just like God will take care of you.
[00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:39.180]   And also he direct the perspective on the field.
[00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:42.060]   On the land.
[00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:45.140]   So we look up and then we look down
[00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:47.700]   and we see all kinds of wild flower,
[00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:49.060]   the lilies of the field.
[00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:53.500]   The wild flower growing in every single season,
[00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:56.580]   every single month, they have different colour
[00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:58.700]   in every month.
[00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:03.060]   Sometimes it's red, sometimes it's white,
[00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:07.180]   sometimes it's yellow, sometimes it's like
[00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:09.300]   this beautiful purple.
[00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:13.700]   So he was saying to these disciples, saying to us,
[00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:17.580]   look at the wild flower growing almost by themselves
[00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:20.820]   because the heavenly father is taking care of them.
[00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:24.020]   Look at the flower, how glorious
[00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:25.740]   and how beautiful they are.
[00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:33.500]   He said, compare the beauty of the wild flower in gallery.
[00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:36.860]   And you will notice how beautiful they are
[00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:41.620]   compared to the time of Solomon.
[00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:42.940]   Remember Jesus said,
[00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:47.460]   you see the wild flower, the lilies of the field,
[00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:49.220]   how glorious they are.
[00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:52.140]   They are more beautiful, more glorious,
[00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:56.060]   more majestic than the time of Solomon.
[00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:58.740]   In times of Solomon,
[00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:04.740]   the royal purple or the royal building
[00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:06.660]   were the glory.
[00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:11.500]   Now, if you know about something,
[00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:14.460]   if you know something about purple dye,
[00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:18.700]   the colour purple is really hard to obtain,
[00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:20.460]   even these days.
[00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:25.460]   Purple is the hardest dye,
[00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:27.500]   the hardest dye to obtain.
[00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:29.980]   Now, back in Jesus' day,
[00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:33.860]   when people need to have the purple dye,
[00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:37.220]   they have to go to the Mediterranean seacoast
[00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:41.220]   to gather the myrrh shells.
[00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:46.220]   And one of the, take the shells and open it up
[00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:49.420]   and you harvest the gland,
[00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:52.700]   a very small part of the myrrh.
[00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:55.980]   And then you gather all the glands
[00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:58.900]   and you can get some purple dye.
[00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:01.860]   Now, as you can see in this picture,
[00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:04.180]   you have to do that one by one
[00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:06.140]   in order to have purple,
[00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:10.380]   in order to have the most valuable,
[00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:13.780]   most royal colour in Jesus' day.
[00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:18.740]   How many do we need in order to dye purple?
[00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:23.740]   How many do we need in order to dye clothing into purple?
[00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:29.380]   Now, as you can see in this formula,
[00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:34.060]   you need 54 kilogram of myrrh shell
[00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:38.500]   that is equal to 119 pounds
[00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:43.460]   of different, many myrrh shells
[00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:48.460]   in order to produce only one gram of purple.
[00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:52.100]   One gram of the colour.
[00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:55.540]   It's so hard to get, right?
[00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:56.660]   It's so valuable.
[00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:59.580]   But look at the lilies of the field.
[00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:01.180]   Look at the pictures.
[00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:05.420]   Look at pictures how the purple flowers
[00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:07.940]   are just growing on the field.
[00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:11.060]   And God is taking care of them.
[00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:14.860]   God is clothing them with the best colour on earth.
[00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:21.220]   You cannot compare the beauty of this wildflower,
[00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:24.020]   this purple flower, red flower,
[00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:28.020]   with all these different kinds of beautiful colours.
[00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:31.780]   Compare them to the time of King Solomon,
[00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:34.100]   what he was wearing, right?
[00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:38.540]   These flowers is more beautiful
[00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:41.740]   than what Solomon has on his body.
[00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:44.580]   So don't you worry.
[00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:48.620]   Don't you overwork so hard
[00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:52.220]   in order to obtain one of these colours, right?
[00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:53.380]   One of these glories.
[00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:55.180]   Because you know that the heavenly father
[00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:56.300]   is taking care of you.
[00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:59.180]   Now, not only the purple colour
[00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:02.940]   was such a valuable in Jesus' day,
[00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:06.220]   even the buildings, the royal buildings, the temple,
[00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:11.220]   they were the most magnificent buildings
[00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:12.980]   on earth in those days.
[00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:19.220]   Here I show you a picture of a model of Jerusalem.
[00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:21.940]   The ratio is one to 50.
[00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:24.140]   You can see that in Israel Museum.
[00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:26.980]   As you can see this man here,
[00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:32.100]   you know, this model of Jerusalem is already,
[00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:35.300]   is very, very, very big.
[00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:38.340]   And the scale is only one to 50.
[00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:40.460]   Now, as you can see this model,
[00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:43.460]   it is gigantic temple mount.
[00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:48.300]   It is a glorious golden building of the temple.
[00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:50.420]   Now, when people think of Solomon,
[00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:55.420]   they think of the most glorious period of Israel's history.
[00:20:55.420 --> 00:21:02.340]   I remember I had a dinner with some of the classmates
[00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:05.740]   when I was studying in Jerusalem.
[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:07.620]   And we had the opportunity to sit down
[00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:09.260]   with some of the most,
[00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:17.260]   the best Israeli Jewish teachers in Jerusalem.
[00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:22.140]   So I remember one time we were sitting down around the table
[00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:26.700]   with one of the teachers that I really respect.
[00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:31.340]   He is Israeli Jewish teacher.
[00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:34.380]   And we were, you know, chit-chatting
[00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:36.460]   and talking about different things.
[00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:39.940]   And then one of the classmates asked the teacher,
[00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:41.380]   the Jewish teacher,
[00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:44.660]   and if you had the opportunity,
[00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:49.340]   if you can travel back to the Old Testament time
[00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:51.980]   or the history of Israel,
[00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:56.740]   which period would you choose in order to witness
[00:21:56.740 --> 00:22:00.980]   the glory or what happened in those days?
[00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:03.220]   And without even thinking,
[00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:05.300]   he respond by saying,
[00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:10.300]   I would want to travel back to the time of King Solomon
[00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:12.700]   when he dedicate the temple,
[00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:15.660]   when the glory of God fills the temple
[00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:17.860]   and people cannot even enter.
[00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:19.900]   You know, that sort of glorious day,
[00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:21.340]   the good old days,
[00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:25.860]   was the time of King Solomon.
[00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:27.900]   But what was Jesus saying?
[00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:29.500]   Jesus was saying,
[00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:32.420]   even when you consider the most glorious,
[00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:34.700]   magnificent building,
[00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:37.380]   magnificent period of your history,
[00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:42.420]   this cannot be compared to the lilies of the field.
[00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:48.060]   How the father has clothed the field
[00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:51.580]   with all sorts of different valuable colors.
[00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:55.660]   You cannot compare them to one of these.
[00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:59.500]   One of these purple flowers or different kinds.
[00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:02.340]   They grow by themselves
[00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:05.900]   because the heavenly father is taking care of them.
[00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:10.980]   Now, the take home for us, as Jesus said,
[00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:14.180]   is that do not be overly anxious about
[00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:17.020]   what we eat and what we drink.
[00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:19.580]   Or housing, right?
[00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:21.100]   What kind of house do we have?
[00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:24.740]   What kind of house do we buy?
[00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:26.540]   What kind of car do we drive?
[00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:31.060]   Again, it's not suggesting
[00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:36.380]   in any way that we should live irresponsibly.
[00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:37.660]   We should be good stewards
[00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:41.340]   of all the resources God has given to us.
[00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:44.780]   But Jesus is saying, do not be overly anxious.
[00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:49.300]   Do not be just overly worrying.
[00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:53.740]   Or work just so hard on where you live,
[00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:58.340]   what you wear, and how you look.
[00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:01.380]   God is taking care of you.
[00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:08.100]   But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness.
[00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:13.620]   And all these things, what we eat and what we drink,
[00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:16.540]   where we stay, will be added to you.
[00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:19.940]   Seek first the kingdom of God.
[00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:22.300]   I think a better translation would be
[00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:24.700]   pursue the kingdom of God.
[00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:30.380]   Run after first the kingdom of God.
[00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:35.060]   Be concerned about the name of God.
[00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:36.980]   Making God's name famous,
[00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:40.540]   it should be our first and foremost concern.
[00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:44.100]   And his righteousness, all the things
[00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:46.300]   that the word of God is teaching us to do.
[00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:51.620]   Be concerned and pursue above all
[00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:56.020]   the righteousness of God, what God requires us to do.
[00:24:56.020 --> 00:25:00.260]   And then all these things will be provided for you.
[00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:03.420]   The priority of our lives,
[00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:09.460]   as we say goodbye to the old time, 2022,
[00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:12.140]   and welcome a new year, 2023,
[00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:17.980]   let us be reminded, seek first, run after,
[00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:22.860]   be the first and foremost concern
[00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:26.860]   in our desire to glorify God, to serve him.
[00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:29.940]   So talking about New Year's resolutions,
[00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:33.060]   how do you fill in the blanks?
[00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:35.140]   How do you fill in the blanks?
[00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:39.940]   What are those things that we should first seek after
[00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:43.340]   and desire most?
[00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:45.620]   Let me suggest to you five of them,
[00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:49.700]   before considering any other things.
[00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:53.260]   First, live in the word of God.
[00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:56.500]   Read the word of God, meditate on it,
[00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:58.860]   reflect upon it, so that the word of God
[00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:02.860]   can fill our lives and inform our living.
[00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:06.700]   That is the first and foremost thing we can do
[00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:10.100]   and we have to do as disciples of Christ.
[00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:12.460]   When the word of God is filling your lives,
[00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:17.460]   your priority is correct, and your priority of lives,
[00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:22.340]   you know what is your foremost concern and desire.
[00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:27.340]   Then everything else will be configured correctly.
[00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:31.660]   Live in the word of God, read the word of God daily,
[00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:34.220]   every single day, meditate upon it.
[00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:37.780]   I'm not saying you have to read the word of God 24/7.
[00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:42.020]   I'm saying that should be our consistent pattern of thought.
[00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:46.180]   Think about what the Bible says,
[00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:48.180]   how we should make any decision,
[00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:51.740]   how we can please God.
[00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:54.780]   These are all coming from scripture.
[00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:58.020]   So we have to live in the word.
[00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:02.100]   And then secondly, I suggest that we have to pray daily.
[00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:04.980]   Pray for ourselves and most formally,
[00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:07.820]   and pray for others.
[00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:10.260]   Not just be concerned about our own needs
[00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:13.140]   and most of the time our own wants.
[00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:15.020]   You know, those are really insignificant
[00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:17.740]   compared to the eternal kingdom of God.
[00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:19.580]   Pray daily for other people,
[00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:21.700]   those who are in need around us.
[00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:23.300]   Pray for them and care for them.
[00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:27.220]   And third, worship wholeheartedly.
[00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:29.780]   Worship God with all of our heart
[00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:32.580]   and all of our soul and all of our strength.
[00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:36.580]   You know, we worship God because whenever we worship,
[00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:41.020]   we are reminded who is really the king,
[00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:43.180]   who is really the leader of our lives,
[00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:46.540]   not ourselves, God himself.
[00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:51.460]   And we can reset our priority on a weekly basis.
[00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:56.420]   That's why we insist on church not closing, right?
[00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:58.900]   Not be so concerned about, you know,
[00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:03.620]   what kind of pandemic out there and disease out there.
[00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:07.700]   A church should be operating every single week.
[00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:11.140]   We worship God every single week, right?
[00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:11.980]   Wholeheartedly.
[00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:16.860]   Fourth, build up the family of a church,
[00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:17.860]   the family of God.
[00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:22.940]   The New Testament and the Old Testament
[00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:25.780]   regularly, consistently reminds us
[00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:31.380]   our number one concern to live socially
[00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:33.820]   is to build up the family of God.
[00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:38.820]   Use our gifts, use our talents to build up the church,
[00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:44.740]   to plan a church, to strengthen our church.
[00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:51.060]   Go to a fellowship and pray with other believers.
[00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:52.980]   Let other believers encourage you
[00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:56.860]   and let your presence be an encouragement to other people.
[00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:59.460]   Build up the family of the church.
[00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:04.220]   Fifth, practice stewardship, faithful stewardship.
[00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:09.220]   The Bible tells us use our time faithfully to serve God.
[00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:13.140]   Use our talent to serve God.
[00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:19.140]   Use our treasure, our money, our offering
[00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:24.460]   to build up the ministry for the glory of God.
[00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:27.700]   So seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness.
[00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:30.180]   Let this be our priority.
[00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:35.180]   Let us reset our list of things that we wanna do,
[00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:40.660]   our list of resolutions so that we can glorify God together.
[00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:43.420]   Let us all pray together.
[00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:46.940]   Father, we wanna give you thanks for a time of renewal.
[00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:52.740]   As we say goodbye to year 2023 and welcome a new year,
[00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:59.500]   let this be a reminder to all of us to reset our priority,
[00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:04.940]   to seek first your kingdom and your righteousness.
[00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:09.360]   And let us not be too concerned and overly anxious
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:12.260]   about the essential things,
[00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:15.180]   because we know that you will take care of us
[00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:19.940]   and help us to serve you, to worship you wholeheartedly.
[00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:23.280]   Help us to live faithfully according to your word.
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:24.320]   In Christ, we pray.
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:34.320]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
