[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.980]   >> Thanks, it's always good to see you.
[00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.400]   Why don't we say hi to your neighbors?
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.360]   Say hi and give them a fist bump or something.
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.360]   Greet them in the Lord.
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.880]   It's always good to worship together as a church.
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.160]   This is what we are being called to.
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.520]   One thing is very important that Muir announced is that the new devotion series on Apostles
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.520]   Creek.
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:35.000]   All right, so if you don't know anything about Apostles Creek, I hope you will enjoy the
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.960]   devotional.
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.680]   Every single day we're going to send it out to your chat group, to your social media group.
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:51.020]   So please read that because in the following weeks I'm going to go through sermon series
[00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.000]   on the Apostles Creek, which is very, very important.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.400]   Apostles Creek is a summary of our faith.
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.720]   How many of you have read through the Bible, the whole Bible?
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.000]   From cover to cover, from Genesis to, wow, that's great, that's great.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Two, all right, three, four, all right, are you sure?
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   Four, five, okay, more hands, okay, six.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.240]   All right, how many of you have read through the entire Bible but you don't understand
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.240]   much of it?
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.520]   Yeah, I mean, right?
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.680]   We all struggle to get to know the Word.
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.760]   We believe that the Bible is written for us.
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.800]   It's for all generations of Christians, all right, even though it's not directly to us,
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.400]   but it's for us, it's written for us.
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.640]   However, when you read the Bible, there are tons of things that we may find confusing
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.760]   or we just don't have enough background information to know about it.
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:53.440]   However, the Apostles Creek is a summary to help us, it's like a big scale map to understand
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.520]   what the Christian faith is all about, all right?
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.280]   So it's very important, so make sure you go through the daily devotional on Apostles Creek,
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.280]   all right?
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:11.400]   So today, we're going to continue our series on the last days, the eschaton, what we call
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.880]   eschatology, right?
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.280]   So we're going to read the passage from 1 Thessalonians 4, but before we read that,
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.960]   let's look at this chart.
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.680]   This is a very popular understanding of what is going on in the last days, what is going
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:33.240]   on before, right before the yellow arrow, the second coming of Christ.
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:39.840]   This is very popular in our American culture especially, even in Chinese churches, even
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.320]   in our culture.
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:49.600]   There are many, many people who promote this kind of understanding.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:56.640]   Now as you can see, the kind of the light blue line is the timeline from left to right.
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.560]   So we're going ahead into this timeline, going into some sort of future, right?
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.000]   And the church is right there, we are right in between.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.280]   I have talked about the already and not yet concept.
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.640]   Christ has already come.
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.200]   He died on the cross and he rose again.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.300]   And then there are generations of churches, right?
[00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:24.880]   And before that yellow arrow, the really glorious second coming of Christ, most people will
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:31.760]   find that this kind of popular understanding is what you hear a lot of time.
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.000]   Is that before the second coming of Christ, before the yellow arrow, before the glorious
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.760]   second coming of Christ, there will be seven years of tribulation.
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.280]   There will be unprecedented suffering on earth.
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.040]   And then, right before the seven years of tribulations, there will be something called
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.040]   rapture.
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.100]   Something called secret rapture.
[00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.520]   So Christ is coming in this scheme, in this kind of understanding, Christ is going to
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.320]   come two times.
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.480]   The first time is in secret, alright?
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.900]   Suddenly in secret, nobody knows.
[00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.240]   And then rapture the believers, rapture the church, disappear out of the world, okay?
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.360]   Out of the world and taken us to heaven, alright?
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.560]   And then the seven years of tribulation will kick in on earth.
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:25.920]   And there will be wars and there will be tons of, you know, crises happening on earth for
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.520]   seven years.
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.960]   And then after the seven years, after this crisis, Christ will come again.
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.840]   That's the yellow arrow.
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:44.600]   And then the new heaven and new earth will be launched, will be escort on earth.
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:52.400]   Now this is, as I said, a very popular understanding of what is going on in our days, alright?
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.320]   Especially in American culture.
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.720]   There are many people who talk about rapture.
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:06.640]   You can see on the upper left is the left behind series.
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:13.880]   This is a very popular novel series trying to put together a story of some kind to talk
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:19.000]   about the secret rapture and then seven years of tribulations.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.680]   Very popular and millions and millions of copies are being sold.
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:29.040]   And even being translated into different languages, including Korean, including Chinese, and all
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.080]   sorts of Asian languages.
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.480]   Very popular.
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:41.680]   And also there are on the lower left is some sort of bumper stickers.
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.400]   You can buy and talk about rapture.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.240]   In case of rapture, can you see that, the white one?
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:55.760]   This car will be unmanned because you will disappear according to the scheme.
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:04.440]   And then at the lower center, warning in case of rapture, this Facebook page will no longer
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.440]   be updated because you will disappear, right?
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.680]   As the church, as believers, you will disappear.
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:17.960]   And then on the right, on the background, there is a rapture ready index webpage.
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.640]   You can go check it out.
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:26.000]   But I advise you not to because this is a popular cultural understanding of second coming.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:33.160]   It may not be the right, correct understanding because when we read the Bible, we need to
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:39.240]   understand there is a background to every single passage, including the passages we
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.280]   are going to read, the so-called rapture passage.
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:49.800]   So we're going to read this passage line by line together and see how it applies to us.
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.640]   So I'm going to set it right out front.
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:57.680]   I'm going to debunk this popular understanding.
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.320]   There's no secret rapture of this kind.
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.120]   So what this passage is all about.
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.200]   Let's do this.
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.040]   First Thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13.
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.880]   We're going to start from there.
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:18.960]   "Brothers, we do not want you to be ignorant about those who fall asleep or to grieve like
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:22.960]   the rest of men who have no hope."
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:27.720]   Now you need to understand when we read the letters to the churches, Paul's letters to
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:35.960]   churches or other letters to the church in the New Testament is always a reply email.
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.640]   What do I mean by that?
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.800]   You do all, you all do emails, right?
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.600]   Let's say you get the reply emails only.
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.440]   You don't get the original email.
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:51.640]   But from the reply email, you kind of figure out what the original email is all about,
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:52.640]   right?
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:53.640]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.140]   That's how you read the letters.
[00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:57.520]   That's how you read First Thessalonians.
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:01.680]   Paul wrote this stuff to the church in Thessalonica.
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:07.200]   It's because he is trying to answer some of the questions that they have asked.
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.800]   So the churches in Thessalonica, they have some problems.
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.440]   They have some issues.
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:16.200]   So they wrote to Paul or they have a messenger sent to Paul.
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:23.240]   And Paul is writing First Thessalonians chapter 4, this passage as a reply to tell them what
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:27.060]   the answers are to address their questions.
[00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:32.640]   So what he's saying is that there seems to be some vital concern for the early Christians
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:34.360]   in Thessalonica.
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:41.200]   The early Christian church, they, of course, they had hope for the future coming of Christ,
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.900]   the future resurrection, right?
[00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.880]   Because Christ has already rose from the dead, right?
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.520]   Someday he will come according to his word.
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:56.400]   And the return of Christ in glory, everyone in the early church, in all churches would
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.240]   believe that.
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:06.080]   So before these things happen, some of the people in the Thessalonian church have passed
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.080]   away.
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:12.800]   Some of those in Christ, brothers and sisters in Christ, they have passed away or some of
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:17.640]   those even martyr, died for their faith.
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.580]   A few of them.
[00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:26.260]   So obviously the Christians in Thessalonica were doubting because they have no hope.
[00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.140]   What about these people?
[00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:33.680]   Would they miss, would they miss out the glorious coming of Christ?
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.920]   If he comes anytime, right?
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:42.240]   If human history will conclude with the end, the eschaton, right?
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:46.900]   God, God's son will come in glory.
[00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:49.320]   Those of us who receive Christ, right?
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:52.400]   Will welcome Christ in glory.
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:58.480]   What about those who have passed away in Jesus?
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.880]   What about those Christians, brothers and sisters who have passed away?
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:05.120]   Will they miss the glorious coming of Christ promised to us?
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.520]   Will they?
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:11.680]   And Paul is saying, absolutely no way.
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:18.320]   Paul is saying, we do not want you to be ignorant about those who fall asleep.
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.680]   Those who have passed away.
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:26.400]   Now falling asleep is a metaphor, meaning dying in Christ.
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:29.240]   So Paul is saying, absolutely no way.
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.520]   Let's see how he answer the questions.
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:37.700]   Verse 14, we believe that Jesus died and rose again.
[00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:43.760]   So we believe that God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in him.
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:52.560]   According to the Lord's own word, we tell you that we who are still alive, who are left
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:59.760]   to the coming of the Lord, will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep.
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.560]   Now what is he talking about?
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:07.720]   He said those who have fallen asleep, again it's a metaphor for dying in Christ.
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:12.040]   They will not miss out the glorious second coming of Christ.
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:18.360]   They will actually be the first in line to welcome Christ, to see Christ, to see his
[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:19.600]   glory.
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:29.440]   So the apostle is saying, the dead in Christ, they will rise from the dead first, followed
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:32.000]   by us, right?
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.780]   They will rise first.
[00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:37.040]   They will be taken up into the air.
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:45.240]   And we who are alive as coming, will also be taken up in the air to join the Lord, so
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:52.920]   called to meet the Lord in the air as Jesus is coming down in trumpet sound and glory.
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:12:00.560]   Verse 16, for the Lord himself, he's talking about second coming, will come down from heaven
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:07.280]   with a loud command, with the voice of archangel, with the trumpet call of God, the dead in
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.520]   Christ will rise first.
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:20.040]   After that, we who are still alive and the left, will be caught up together with them
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:25.080]   in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:31.400]   So you got a picture, at the end of human history, when Christ comes again, it will
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:38.640]   be the appearance of a public appearance, a loud command, the voice of archangels, the
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:43.600]   trumpet call of God, the dead in Christ will rise first.
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.920]   They will welcome Christ first.
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:53.680]   Now it's not that Christ will come so far in the mid air, and then some of those will
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:59.080]   rise from the dead and meet him in the air, and then we turn back to heaven.
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:04.640]   No as you see the context here, Christ is on the way from heaven to earth.
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:06.880]   It's a one way street.
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:12.560]   He is on the way coming, and then those who are on earth, those who are dead in Christ,
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:17.760]   they will rise first and will meet him in the air as he coming down.
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:25.200]   So it's kind of being sent to rise and then to meet Christ in the air and then come back
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.420]   to earth.
[00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:36.640]   So the imagery is this, we who are still alive, when the second coming happens, we will be
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:41.200]   with those who have died in the Lord.
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:50.280]   We will be meeting the coming Christ, descending Christ as he is returning in glory.
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:59.920]   Actually this is the technical term here, to meet the Lord in the air, to meet, to meet.
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:02.240]   What does it mean?
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:08.680]   It is a technical term frequently used in the Roman Empire.
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:19.040]   For a city, they will have a welcome committee, get ready and prepare to welcome a governor
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:27.580]   or a victorious general or the Caesar, the king, the emperor to come to town.
[00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:34.520]   When emperor comes to town, when an important government official comes to town, the city
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:38.480]   will organize a welcoming party, a welcoming team.
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:46.440]   They will go out in the midway to meet the emperor first, okay, to worship him, to meet
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:52.760]   him and then escort him back to the city, back to the town.
[00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:58.380]   That is what it means to meet the Lord in the air.
[00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:06.680]   So Paul is using a first century political scene to talk about the coming of the true
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:08.660]   king.
[00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:12.780]   The true king is Jesus, is Christ himself.
[00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:19.360]   Now when the Roman armies come back from a campaign, when the Roman armies go out to
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:25.400]   the east or west or north or south, when they conquer their enemies, they have taken some
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:30.640]   captives and they will return to the city of Rome and before they will enter the city
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:37.320]   of Rome, they will camp outside of the city, about a mile or so away.
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:45.340]   And then they will send a messenger into the city and talk to the senate of Rome to announce
[00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:54.920]   the immediate arrival of the victorious king, of the general, of the victorious army.
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:57.040]   Then they will give the city some time.
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:05.040]   The city planners will put together some sort of people to decorate the city and to prepare
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:12.240]   for a parade for the conquering king, the hero for homecoming.
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:17.360]   So this is the sort of the political scene that often happens in the city of Rome and
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:20.240]   many different cities in the Roman Empire.
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:27.900]   And then after the planning, there will be a trumpet blast being made.
[00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:38.520]   And then the signal will be for the armies to march in triumphant into the city.
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:45.520]   That's the meeting committee, the welcoming committee, to welcome the king into the city.
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:52.080]   So the citizens of Rome sometimes are being invited to join the welcoming committee, to
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:57.480]   be invited to go outside of the city, outside of the city wall, to join the parade and march
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:05.160]   back through the arch of triumph with the victorious army.
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:11.680]   Some of the officials, some of the high status citizens will participate in this kind of
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:15.320]   victory march.
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:20.960]   Now this sort of things actually also happen in our days.
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:26.160]   When I first came to Chicago, it was about 20 some years ago, some of the locals who
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:31.400]   know all the local history here, they told me some interesting stories.
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:38.840]   And I remember this part, we were driving in South Loop.
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:42.200]   He told me this story, a local friend.
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:48.120]   He said in the mid '90s, in the mid '90s, those of you who are old enough to remember
[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:58.880]   this, right, in Chicago, mid '90s, when President, ex-President Clinton came to Chicago, he landed
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:05.440]   in Grand Park with a military helicopter in the mid '90s.
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:08.360]   And then there were a party of people welcoming him.
[00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:15.200]   In order to prepare for his arrival, the city of Chicago actually renovate part of Roosevelt
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.200]   Road.
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.600]   Have you been there?
[00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:24.920]   There was a stretch of Roosevelt Road nicer than the rest of it.
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:25.920]   You know why?
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:31.320]   My local friend told me it was because the city, in order to prepare for the arrival
[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:38.600]   of the ex-President, arrival of Clinton, they renovate this entire stretch of Roosevelt
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:44.880]   Road so that when he comes for the National Convention, there will be honor, there will
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:48.200]   be a glory, right?
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:49.200]   It's kind of a celebration.
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.200]   Do you know that?
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:52.880]   You didn't know that, right?
[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:53.880]   You pay for it.
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:59.360]   (Laughter) Now this is a sort of the political scene
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:01.480]   Paul was using.
[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:07.180]   And he was obviously using the first century political scene from the Roman Empire and
[00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:15.240]   trying to tell you who is the true king and how we should prepare ourselves for his second
[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:16.240]   coming.
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:24.640]   Now you can see throughout Paul's writings that he often borrows or subverts the Roman
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:32.680]   political images and apply them, subvert them, apply them to Christ.
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:36.880]   Because Christ is the only true king, not Caesar.
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:44.440]   Now you can imagine Paul is trying to use that scene to talk about the arrival, second
[00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:48.640]   coming of Christ in a horizontal way.
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:58.320]   Like Christ is like the victorious general, the victorious king marching toward the city.
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:04.720]   And then we as a city, we will prepare ourselves for the arrival of the true king.
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:09.640]   We will go out midway to meet him, right?
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:16.120]   And then the first in line to meet him would be those who are already dead in Christ.
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:23.840]   Now in the ancient days, when you die, your tomb is often outside the city wall.
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:24.840]   You got it?
[00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:25.840]   Because it's unclean, right?
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:26.840]   It's unclean.
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:29.140]   It's always outside the city wall.
[00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:36.840]   So you go out of the city, out of the city gate, you look around, there are tombs, right?
[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:40.400]   That is the picture in Jerusalem, there is a picture in Rome, there is a picture in a
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:44.360]   lot of ancient Mediterranean cities.
[00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:47.160]   The tombs are outside the city wall.
[00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:49.480]   So you can see what Paul is doing.
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:55.800]   When the king is coming toward the town, the first to meet the victorious king of course
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:58.220]   are those who are dead already.
[00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:00.000]   They will rise first.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.280]   They will be the first in line to meet the true king.
[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:11.840]   And then we who are still alive within the city, we will join the welcoming committee.
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:14.920]   And we go out midway to meet Christ.
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:16.920]   Now that's the horizontal picture.
[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:23.960]   Now I want you to turn it 90 degree, vertical.
[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:28.280]   That is the picture of the second coming of Christ.
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:31.240]   Of course Christ is not coming horizontally.
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:32.240]   Christ is coming vertically.
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:33.240]   He is from heaven.
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:35.240]   He is from above.
[00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:42.280]   So when Christ comes in the time of second coming, midway, those who are dead in Christ,
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:48.200]   they will rise first, be the first to meet Him in midair.
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:51.200]   Not to go away and disappear.
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:22:01.520]   But as He is descending, as He is coming on earth with glory, we rise with those who are
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:09.800]   dead in Christ, will come in midway to meet Him and come down.
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:12.160]   You see what I'm saying, right?
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:18.200]   We will be joining the welcoming committee to welcome the true king.
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:21.880]   Now as you can imagine, Christ coming in glory from heaven.
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:26.960]   Those who die in the Lord will go up and meet Him in the air.
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:32.880]   That is the second coming Paul is talking about.
[00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:36.600]   Now why does he talk about these things?
[00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:41.400]   As I told you again and again, in this series when we talk about the book of Revelation
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:51.560]   or the second coming of Christ, eschatology, eschaton, the end of time, the last days.
[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:56.200]   You need to understand in the New Testament when it talks about the second coming of Christ,
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:58.760]   it's not some abstract idea.
[00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:06.000]   It's not for us to, okay let's figure out, are there any things happening, what kind
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.520]   of terrible things will happen, is it a weather forecast or something like that.
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:12.600]   It's not abstract idea.
[00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:17.280]   It is not newspaper written ahead of time.
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:21.120]   It's actually a very practical teaching.
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:23.480]   Eschatology is always practical.
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:26.800]   You know the end is always practical.
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:28.600]   Now why do I say that?
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:36.720]   418, remember Paul is trying to answer a question from the Thessalonians questions.
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:40.060]   What kind of questions did they have?
[00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:42.060]   Some of them are martyrs.
[00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:44.080]   They passed away in the Lord, right?
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:45.480]   And they're really really sad.
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:48.800]   They're really heartbroken.
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:54.840]   Now Paul is trying to say to them, they will not miss out the glorious coming of Christ.
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:56.880]   In fact they will be the first.
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:01.000]   They will be the first to see the glorious kingdom, right?
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.960]   Those who are dead in Christ, they will rise first.
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:06.000]   They will welcome Him first and followed by us.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:14.240]   418, he says, "Therefore, encourage each other with these words."
[00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:18.400]   How can these words, the things that we talk about, the second coming of Christ, the coming
[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:21.240]   to meet error and welcome Him back.
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:26.280]   How can we encourage one another with these words?
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:33.160]   You remember at the beginning he says, "We grieve for those who passed away in the Lord."
[00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:34.160]   We grieve.
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:41.120]   Our brothers and sisters, our family members, those who are in Christ, those who are Christians.
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:44.440]   They passed away before we do.
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:46.840]   Of course we will grieve, right?
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:52.880]   Tomorrow I'm going to a funeral, a Christian funeral.
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:54.560]   Of course we will grieve.
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:57.200]   We will weep.
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:00.680]   Because such a loss to all of us, right?
[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:04.880]   The death of your loved one is the death of part of you.
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:07.680]   It's taking away part of you, a big part of you.
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:09.680]   We will grieve.
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:17.160]   But Paul is saying, as we grieve, we don't grieve with those who are without hope.
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:21.320]   We have a hope that transcends death.
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:24.740]   That transcends all of our tears.
[00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:29.040]   Because someday Christ will come and make things right.
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:36.680]   When the new heaven and new earth come down from heaven, Revelation, the last two chapters,
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:40.440]   there will be no pain and no death and no tears.
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:43.360]   There will be no evil.
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:51.040]   That is the hope that transcends everything else, even our final enemy, death itself.
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:59.040]   I always say when I officiate a funeral, I always say in a Christian funeral, we don't
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:03.520]   say goodbye to our loved one.
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:05.880]   What do we say?
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.600]   We say, "See you later."
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:10.560]   We say, "See you later."
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:13.680]   That is the glorious hope we have in Christ.
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:16.280]   So don't forget that.
[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:18.480]   Don't forget that.
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:28.120]   Secondly, eschatology is practical because it help us to put things in perspective.
[00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:37.040]   Put our lives and our lifestyle, today's work, today's how you live, put things in
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:38.040]   perspective.
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:39.240]   Why?
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:43.400]   Because we know there's a final destination we're going to.
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:46.040]   And Christ will come again.
[00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:53.080]   The new heaven and new earth, the new kingdom, the future kingdom, is the country that we
[00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:56.240]   are going to.
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:27:02.640]   I always tell Christians, we have two passports.
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:08.720]   The first passport is our earthly passport.
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:14.240]   Maybe China, maybe UK, maybe American passport.
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:17.440]   That is one of our passports.
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:23.960]   The other passport is the kingdom of God passport.
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:31.880]   Now if you compare it side by side, the earthly passport will expire.
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:32.880]   You have to renew it.
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:36.120]   And sometimes you cannot renew it.
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:38.360]   You got to change it.
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:41.080]   That is your first passport.
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:43.520]   Your national identity.
[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:46.920]   Where you belong on earth.
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:47.920]   It will expire.
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:48.920]   It has expiration date.
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:49.920]   Did you check that?
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:50.920]   Your passport?
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:54.760]   It has expiration date.
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:28:00.200]   Your early citizenship will expire.
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:04.240]   But our kingdom of God passport will not expire.
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:05.960]   It's eternal.
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:09.580]   Okay, you don't have to check it.
[00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:15.960]   But what you do need to check is that where you are living up to, that passport, that
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:16.960]   identity.
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:22.280]   We are not so much living for our earthly identity.
[00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:28.440]   No matter what nationality you belong to, it will pass away.
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:29.440]   You know that?
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:30.440]   It will pass away.
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:36.120]   It really doesn't matter at the time of funeral.
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:42.360]   What will last forever is your heavenly citizenship.
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:43.360]   That you belong to God.
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:48.120]   You belong to true king, Jesus himself.
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:52.560]   So it's practical in that sense we need to remind ourselves.
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:57.920]   Are we really the heavenly citizen?
[00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:03.760]   So as you can tell, there were a lot of passages we have worked through in the past many sermons
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:05.080]   of this series.
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:10.320]   Be it book of Revelation or book of Matthew or other passages.
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:14.200]   When Jesus talks about the last days, when Paul talks about the last days, he always
[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:17.760]   talks about how we live today.
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:21.080]   How we live in light of the future.
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:24.720]   How we live in light of the coming kingdom.
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:28.680]   How we live in light of that future.
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:31.480]   Remember the gospel of Matthew?
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:35.000]   He talks about, Jesus talks about his coming.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.080]   It's a list of signs, right?
[00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:42.160]   There are many things that will tell you his coming is imminent.
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:44.800]   His coming anytime.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:49.040]   And that's always followed by some sort of practical teaching.
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:50.560]   The parables.
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:54.280]   Remember the parables of ten bridesmaids, right?
[00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:56.280]   Five of them prepared the oil.
[00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:59.160]   Five of them did not prepare for the oil.
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:04.640]   So when the groom comes, finally they have to go, again the same picture.
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:07.960]   They go halfway out to meet the groom, right?
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:11.640]   To join him and escort him back to the banquet.
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:15.160]   Five of those who are prepared, they can enter the banquet.
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:19.700]   The five of those who thought they have prepared, but they did not.
[00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:22.720]   So they could not go into the banquet.
[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:26.560]   The master said, "I don't even know you."
[00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:27.560]   That's the first parable.
[00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:30.880]   The second parable is the talent parable.
[00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:36.200]   With the master going away, and give his talents to his three servants.
[00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:40.600]   Five thousand, two thousand, and one thousand.
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:46.360]   Those who have five thousand and two thousand, they took the risk and invest and increase
[00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:49.160]   the asset of their master.
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:55.480]   And they are prepared when after a long time, after a time of delay, finally the master
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:57.040]   comes back.
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:02.240]   Those who had, he who had the five thousand and he who had the two thousand, they are
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:04.640]   prepared to give an account.
[00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:09.040]   Because they did serve the master, increase his asset.
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:16.000]   The last one, with the one thousand, didn't even bother to take the smallest risk to increase
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.480]   the master's asset.
[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:26.040]   So always, when Jesus talks about the last days, always reminding us how you should live
[00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:27.320]   today.
[00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:31.520]   Are you living in light of that future?
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:39.240]   Are you living worthy as a citizen of heavenly kingdom?
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:48.200]   You know, whatever the kingdom characterize should be our characteristics.
[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:54.680]   If the future kingdom is full of love, then our life should live in light of that, right?
[00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:57.680]   We will practice love.
[00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:05.840]   If the future kingdom is nothing but justice, but righteousness, then our lives, our decisions,
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:11.160]   our choices should reflect that set of values.
[00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:13.960]   Right?
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:18.080]   Live according to the future.
[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:21.200]   Some people said, and I'll close it with this thought.
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:25.760]   Some people said questions are actually aliens, right?
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:29.840]   Aliens, not the monsters, okay?
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:32.160]   Foreigners, okay?
[00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:34.040]   Where are we from?
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:37.920]   We are from the future.
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:41.040]   Because we are heading to the future, we belong to the future.
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:45.840]   And we bring stuff from the future to the present.
[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:49.240]   We are aliens in that sense.
[00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:50.240]   We live differently.
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:51.240]   Why?
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:56.800]   When people look at your lifestyle, look at your marriage, look at your family, look
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:01.560]   at how you work, look at how you make decisions, they will wonder why you are different.
[00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:06.720]   Well, you are different because you belong to the future kingdom.
[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:10.280]   You don't belong to the earthly kingdom.
[00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:13.040]   You make decisions differently.
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:15.240]   You set a priority differently.
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:17.240]   Why you come to worship today?
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:22.000]   Instead of, you know, just get a couple more hours of sleep, right?
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:30.160]   Because your decisions is affected by your hope, by your future.
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:33.040]   Let's do that.
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:35.880]   Share the gospel.
[00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:38.540]   You see the gospel is a huge thing.
[00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:44.960]   Because it talks about, it affects your eternal destiny.
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:47.560]   Live according to the future kingdom.
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:50.120]   Prepare yourselves to meet the Lord.
[00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:55.440]   Alright, one question, final question you need to ask yourself.
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:34:03.600]   If Jesus comes today, or if you are being called back home to see, one cosmic question
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:13.840]   you need to ask yourself is that will God see you and you can give an account?
[00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:20.120]   And Jesus will say, "You are my faithful and wise servant.
[00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:21.800]   You can enter the kingdom."
[00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:26.000]   Right, that is a cosmic question for you this week.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.160]   Live according to the future.
[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:30.280]   Let's all pray together.
[00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:38.960]   Father, we give you thanks because of your grace you have called us into your kingdom.
[00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:44.000]   It is your grace we have been called your children.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:51.200]   And I pray that each and every one of us will prepare ourselves knowing that our identity
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:54.120]   belongs to the future kingdom.
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:59.720]   That we need to prepare ourselves to give an account to you, Master.
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:07.040]   To serve you, to increase the value of the kingdom, to build up your church, to build
[00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:10.200]   our lives so that you get to grow.
[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:18.040]   And I pray that when you come, you ask us whether we are being faithful to what you
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:19.800]   have entrusted to us.
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:24.360]   And we'll say, "Yes, we have been faithful, Master."
[00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:30.880]   So pray that we'll grow spiritually in this way, to live according to our future hope.
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:35.920]   To live according to the future eschaton.
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:41.080]   Help us to live as your citizens, as your heavenly citizens.
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:45.400]   That when Christ comes back, we'll be able to give an account.
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:48.280]   We praise you week after week.
[00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:54.880]   We strive to be a better citizen of your heavenly kingdom.
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:58.600]   And pray that you will continue to transform us with your grace.
[00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:01.120]   That we'll be more like your son.
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:03.680]   In Christ's name we pray.
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:05.080]   Well, thank you.
