1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
 Well, it's really great to be here and as Pastor Mark said, I've known him for a while

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,080
 but some of you have not seen me before.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,040
 I actually live in the northwest part of the city, but this is where I grew up, so it's

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,960
 like coming back to home.

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:20,400
 I also found out that I've reconnected with Mir, who I've met before, so it's nice to

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,360
 see her and realize that actually some of you are part of a group that's come to UV

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:31,000
 from another congregation and Jayuk is actually a former classmate of mine, so it's nice to

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,920
 have that multiple overlap that I realize.

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,680
 And I actually saw Jayuk before after moving back into the city from Trinity, where we

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,520
 were at seminary, and realized that his kids were going to the same school as our kids,

11
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,960
 and so it's nice to have just these multiple connections.

12
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:56,920
 When Pastor Mark asked me to preach today, I asked him what scenes or what books he might

13
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:03,240
 be covering so that I can maybe stay consistent with the message and maybe how I should cater

14
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:08,260
 what I was going to preach, and he wittingly replied that he had taught some things in

15
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:13,120
 Genesis before and then he's taught some things in Revelation, so pretty much anything in

16
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,760
 those books or in between is anything that I can choose from.

17
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:26,040
 So that left me with a lot of freedom and a lot of no direction, but I hope that what

18
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,360
 I chose today will be helpful and relevant.

19
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,940
 And the topic that I chose for today is actually something that we as Asians do not like to

20
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:40,360
 address very much, and it's the topic of, the softer topic of emotions.

21
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:47,560
 And some of you are already probably thinking, emotions, feelings, what good are those?

22
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,680
 Why talk about it?

23
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,400
 And I think in my younger years, I would probably be on your side as well.

24
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:01,720
 I would think how emotions and feelings were not really convenient and weren't really useful,

25
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:09,240
 and if anything, might be a liability in making decisions and just journeying through life.

26
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:15,880
 But I think that this is really colored by our Asian perspective, and we tend to focus

27
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:21,560
 on things that are just more practical and monetarily profitable.

28
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,880
 What I've come to discover over the years is this is actually rather unbiblical.

29
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,080
 This is not how we're meant to be.

30
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:34,600
 And emotions are very much part of how God designed us and how he wants us to be.

31
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,200
 He wants us to feel.

32
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:42,520
 And so the title of my message today is actually An Emotive Lord, because our God is emotive

33
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,840
 and expresses a range of emotions.

34
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,440
 We who are also created in his image are also meant to display the range of emotions that

35
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,360
 we see him express in the Bible.

36
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,520
 But because of our brokenness, we fall into elevating and prioritizing what is our cultural

37
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:08,280
 upbringing and what is our cultural lens, and that just affects how we live.

38
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:14,360
 We fall short of fully living out how God designed us to be and how we're meant to emotionally

39
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,600
 also express our faith.

40
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,960
 And I know that over the past several years, it's been a really hard time.

41
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:26,640
 The pandemic has taken a toll physically, mentally, spiritually, and emotionally on

42
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,680
 us.

43
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,880
 And people are really feeling very anxious, and they're feeling the fragility of life.

44
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,880
 And I actually observe this often through the teammates that I have, that I interact

45
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,880
 with in my work.

46
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:45,780
 I actually work at a startup as my full-time job, and my team is globally distributed across

47
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,200
 the world.

48
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,920
 And in my role, I actually do a lot of these one-on-one checkups with every person that

49
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,800
 I can on a, if not weekly basis, then a biweekly basis.

50
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:03,720
 And there's a particular teammate of mine that I had a conversation with recently.

51
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,200
 And these meetings are meant to be a pulse check to just check the general mood of people

52
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,200
 across the company to see how everyone's doing.

53
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,480
 And the conversation that I had is with my teammate, who is also a fellow believer.

54
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:20,960
 It was right after Easter, and I spent some time just kind of asking him how he is.

55
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:25,600
 And there's always some personal chit-chat that happens at the beginning of these conversations.

56
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,840
 And he told me that his Easter was relatively quiet and relatively somber.

57
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:36,260
 And the reason was because his parents had to abruptly actually leave and go see his

58
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:40,960
 maternal grandmother, because they had found out that she was on her deathbed.

59
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,360
 Fortunately, his mom and dad were able to actually make it in time to see his maternal

60
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,320
 grandmother before she passed.

61
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:57,360
 I offered my condolences, and I just really tried to care for him and ask how he was doing.

62
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,040
 And he said that he was close to his grandmother.

63
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:06,600
 He said that he has really fond memories of her and how he's helped to shape his own faith.

64
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:16,040
 And he started to shift into talking about how despite her passing, because of our faith,

65
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:22,240
 because of the hope that Jesus Christ provides, that he was hopeful about the situation.

66
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,760
 And this was all true, or this is all true.

67
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:29,840
 And especially with his grandmother passing over Easter, there is this idea that this

68
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,360
 wasn't the ultimate end, that there's a hope, there's an alternative for his grandmother

69
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,720
 beyond just the passing in this earthly world.

70
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:45,840
 And it certainly made what was more of a sad and morphal situation a little bit more hopeful

71
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,920
 with this idea in mind.

72
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:56,200
 However, despite not speaking about his feelings, I could really sense this greater level of

73
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,380
 grief and sadness that was emanating from him.

74
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:04,480
 And it was masked by this cover of hopefulness.

75
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:09,840
 I felt that he was unnaturally overlooking the grief and just trying to maintain a positive

76
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,880
 outlook and then trying to shift toward work.

77
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:20,480
 I think many of us would actually appreciate this approach, and some of us have probably

78
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:25,240
 adopted this approach in handling an experience of loss.

79
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:30,280
 But this conversation actually sat with me for a while, and I think it really disturbed

80
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:35,480
 me and it caused me to reflect upon my own experiences in the past and my own dealings

81
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,960
 with sadness.

82
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,440
 I recalled my memory of my grandfather, who was 93 when he passed.

83
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,360
 And a lot of people, when they found out, expressed their sympathies, which I was very

84
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,040
 thankful for.

85
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,600
 And my reply was usually, "Oh, you know, it's okay.

86
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,440
 He lived a long life."

87
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:59,160
 And this was the response that I provided people that came to me with their condolences.

88
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:05,400
 It helped me accept the situation, but it didn't really acknowledge my true feelings.

89
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:10,720
 And over time, I've come to believe that this isn't really a biblical approach.

90
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:16,120
 It's not really the way that God had intended for us to deal with situations like this.

91
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:22,640
 And so today's passage is actually from John 11, 1 to 44.

92
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,960
 You can't, I guess you can't see it.

93
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,920
 And I was planning on reading it, but then I decided that actually what's better is for

94
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:34,760
 me to kind of just paraphrase and summarize the passage and then kind of hone in on what

95
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,060
 I want to aim in on.

96
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:42,060
 And so John 11 tells a story of Lazarus's death and resurrection.

97
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:48,260
 In the beginning part, Jesus is in the wilderness, and Lazarus is sick in a different part of

98
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,620
 Israel, you know, in Bethany.

99
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:56,680
 And this is the village where Mary and Martha are from, who are sisters of Lazarus.

100
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:02,020
 The sisters sent word to Jesus and told him that the one he loves is sick.

101
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:05,920
 These three siblings are actually described as ones that Jesus loves.

102
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,660
 And so Jesus had a very special relationship with them.

103
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:15,180
 When he heard this, Jesus said that this sickness will not end in death, but it is for God's

104
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,620
 glory so that God's son may be glorified through it.

105
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:22,300
 Jesus doesn't leave right away, but he actually does the opposite.

106
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:27,220
 He actually waits even longer to make a move and to leave.

107
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:32,500
 He says to his disciples that Lazarus has fallen asleep and he will wake him up.

108
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:37,980
 And so his disciples thought that he meant that he fell into a natural sleep and that

109
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,320
 he'll get better.

110
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:44,080
 But then Jesus then has to correct him and say plainly that Lazarus is dead, but he intended

111
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,780
 for this to happen so that they may believe.

112
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:51,980
 And Thomas actually replies, "Oh, then let us all go so that we might die together."

113
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:55,720
 So I think they really missed the point, even though Jesus was correcting them.

114
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:01,180
 And so by the time that Jesus arrives in Bethany, Lazarus had already been dead and entombed

115
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,780
 for four days.

116
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:07,500
 And many Jews had come to Martha and Mary to mourn with him and to comfort them during

117
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,440
 this period of loss.

118
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:15,000
 When Jesus saw all these people weeping, it's described that he was deeply moved in spirit

119
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,320
 and troubled.

120
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:22,380
 And in verse 35 out of the 44 verses that we have here, Jesus wept.

121
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:27,500
 He's moved by the situation and then he goes on to ask for the stone to be rolled away

122
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:32,900
 from the tomb and cause Lazarus out, which he does, fully resurrected, looking like a

123
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,740
 mummy.

124
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:42,020
 Those around come to believe and Jesus and God are glorified in this situation.

125
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:45,560
 There are actually very many preachable lessons here.

126
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,020
 It's a very jam-packed passage.

127
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:54,380
 Jesus knowing Lazarus' condition deliberately delays his visit to Lazarus until way past

128
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:59,540
 his death to magnify the impact of the miracle he knew he was going to perform.

129
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:05,300
 Jesus shows his power to resurrect the dead in dramatic fashion as he calls folks to roll

130
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:11,380
 away this stone and signals his own resurrection through this story.

131
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:16,860
 So much can be impacted and applied to our lives about suffering, perseverance, and eventual

132
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:24,460
 deliverance, how God's timing is perfect for a reason even in suffering.

133
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,940
 But my focus is actually none of this.

134
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:30,500
 What I want to hone in on is verse 35.

135
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:35,620
 And this small part is in fact the easiestly memorized Bible verse in the whole of the

136
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:38,700
 Bible because it is the shortest Bible verse.

137
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,780
 It is verse 35, which is Jesus wept.

138
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:46,340
 And so now you can all tell Pastor Mark that you've memorized today's verse because it

139
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:49,140
 is so easy to remember.

140
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:53,980
 But there is something very profound in this two-word verse.

141
00:10:53,980 --> 00:11:00,480
 It openly describes Jesus, who is fully divine and fully human, weeping.

142
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,180
 It isn't shown in a negative way.

143
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:08,380
 It shows a very human response of grief as completely acceptable.

144
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,940
 It doesn't dismiss it.

145
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,340
 It doesn't regard it as weakness.

146
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:15,140
 It doesn't try to cover it with something nice.

147
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:19,340
 It's shown as natural and completely embraced.

148
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:23,140
 Now remember that Jesus knows the greater plan.

149
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:28,700
 He knew Lazarus was going to die, but he also knew that Lazarus was going to be raised from

150
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,620
 the dead by him.

151
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:35,780
 With that in mind, many might wonder, "Well, why be sad at all?"

152
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:38,980
 Yet Jesus openly grieves.

153
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:43,940
 Maybe he grieved at the individual death of Lazarus, or maybe his grief comes from the

154
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:50,740
 idea that there will be so much death still until his resurrection and his second coming.

155
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:56,180
 But whatever the case is, we see here that he wept, that he was moved and troubled, and

156
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,340
 that he openly grieved.

157
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,620
 And there was nothing wrong with that.

158
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:07,620
 This act of Jesus affirms grief, sadness, and despair as appropriate responses and feelings

159
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,740
 that we should more readily embrace.

160
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:19,860
 Now, God really expresses a range of emotions as we see from Jesus.

161
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:25,760
 But sociologists say that it's common for people to perceive that God is like the fatherly

162
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,800
 figures in their lives.

163
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:35,540
 If God is caring, patient, and concerned, then children will believe God has those same characteristics.

164
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:41,100
 And the opposite holds true when a father, when an earthly father is harsh, judgmental,

165
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,100
 or absent.

166
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:48,500
 Fortunately for us, or unfortunately for us, a typical Asian dad is one characterized as

167
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:55,100
 a dutiful, hardworking provider, sometimes a bit emotionally distant, and one whom we

168
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:59,360
 might, who might be critical and hard to please.

169
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:05,300
 Emotionally available and accessible is not a usual description of Asian parents.

170
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:10,340
 This is important to recognize because this lens can shade our perception of how God the

171
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:13,980
 father is to us and how he's captured.

172
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:19,820
 We run the danger of projecting an idea of how God the father is through a worldly lens

173
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,820
 versus a biblical one.

174
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:27,300
 This has risks of stunting our spiritual maturity and can lend itself to unhealthy perceptions,

175
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:32,300
 especially of how God, of how we think God sees us, how we see ourselves, and how we

176
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:36,240
 think we think God wants us to act.

177
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,380
 When we perceive God the father through a traditional Asian parental profile, we can

178
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:48,700
 project him to be a figure that is harsh, unforgiving, demanding, and not easily satisfied.

179
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:54,960
 We may make him out to be emotionally distant and unconcerned and dismissive of our feelings

180
00:13:54,960 --> 00:14:00,400
 and cause ourselves to undermine our own emotional health and situations.

181
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:05,860
 We need to remember that God expresses the emotions of righteous anger, judgment, and

182
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:14,100
 disappointment, but he also shows a positive range of emotions of concern, love, pride,

183
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,500
 and joy.

184
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:22,060
 These are expressions that Asians, Asian parents, have a hard time struggling to display.

185
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:25,860
 Our earthly relationships can really cloud how we see our relationship with God the father

186
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,380
 is.

187
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:33,400
 And we can dangerously misinterpret God being dismissive of our feelings and just focusing

188
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:37,140
 on our performance like our earthly parents do.

189
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:40,780
 We are a broken people and we need God.

190
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:44,800
 And we need to be mindful of how not to be trapped in this lie that he doesn't care about

191
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,300
 our emotions and our feelings.

192
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:52,900
 It's important to observe and know that God displays a range of emotions with very positive

193
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,580
 ones as well.

194
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:58,540
 There's delight, there's satisfaction, there's joy.

195
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:03,220
 And we need to be able to embrace these as well as display these ourselves.

196
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:08,020
 We can establish that God openly expresses a range of emotions.

197
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:13,780
 And knowing that, and knowing that we are made in the image of God, we must not restrict

198
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:18,260
 how we model a potential range of emotions.

199
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:22,360
 It's not enough that we acknowledge the negative emotions that we tend to avoid.

200
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:30,420
 We also have to embrace and express the positive ones thoroughly and toward ourselves.

201
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:34,280
 You can ask yourselves, do you receive compliments well?

202
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,340
 Do you feel successful?

203
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,380
 Do you feel valued?

204
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:41,820
 Or do you often feel that you're not good enough?

205
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:47,740
 And you feel like an imposter about to be found out by someone and revealing your true

206
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,620
 nature.

207
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,980
 Now, this is also very small.

208
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,140
 It's an emotional wheel.

209
00:15:55,140 --> 00:16:03,140
 And it shows a large range of emotions from happy, sad, disgusted, angry, fearful, bad,

210
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:09,620
 surprised, from the center spanning out to just more descriptive ones of feeling isolated,

211
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:17,620
 victimized, horrified, furious, excluded, but also positively aroused, free, joyful,

212
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:22,060
 curious, successful, respected, valued.

213
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:27,720
 Just think about some of these for a while and see if you can actually articulate some

214
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:35,220
 of these or can actually say that you've expressed a range of these emotions.

215
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:41,220
 Coming from a background that is grounded in honor and shame, most of us probably inherently

216
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:47,900
 understand that we tend to be emotionally reserved, focused on gaining face, concentrated

217
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:53,580
 on our duties and responsibilities, are hard to please, and very critical of others as

218
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,860
 well as ourselves.

219
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:59,460
 And this whole sermon has actually been a difficult thing for me to prepare because

220
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:02,660
 I can't honestly say that I'm good at this.

221
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,780
 Emoting is something that doesn't come easily to me.

222
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:09,700
 And I remember when I was younger, I'm very expressive emotionally.

223
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:15,740
 But then over the years growing up, I've been conditioned to focus on what's proper and

224
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:22,580
 what I need to do in terms of my duty and focus on the family and focus on our collective

225
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:26,020
 group and to preserve face.

226
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:35,860
 It's been an even greater challenge for me as I've become a parent and how I've unwillingly

227
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:39,980
 transferred this behavior to my own children.

228
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:46,100
 And as much as I try to maintain a positive mindset over the years and be more expressive

229
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:52,180
 emotionally with my feelings, with my children, I find that I'm challenged by my past and

230
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:56,020
 I tend to revert back to just how I was raised.

231
00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:01,980
 And some of you are parents here, are preparing to be parents.

232
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,780
 Before you become a parent, you think that you're going to prepare to be the most amazing

233
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:08,300
 parent the world has ever seen.

234
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:18,300
 And we study, we seek out advice, and we plan to be the greatest in the world to our kids.

235
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:23,580
 But the truth is that when the children actually come, it's chaos.

236
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,620
 And there's nothing that can prepare you.

237
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:29,980
 And you can study all you want, but it's just a different experience.

238
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:38,060
 And what happens is that what we plan on doing in terms of best practices just turns into

239
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:41,220
 just trying to survive one more day.

240
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:47,540
 And when that happens, all the stuff that you thought about, planned out, goes out the

241
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:51,020
 window and you revert back to your natural instincts.

242
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:54,860
 You parent how you were parented.

243
00:18:54,860 --> 00:19:00,020
 And emotions for me are not given their proper attention.

244
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:04,540
 And what I see is my own children beginning to avoid expressing their feelings for fear

245
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,940
 of being dismissed.

246
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:10,540
 I don't sit with them and their emotions adequately enough.

247
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:14,980
 I don't hold space for them in their moments of hurt and sadness.

248
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,820
 And I don't offer praise as much as I should.

249
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:24,160
 I fall into this performance-oriented person that our culture has trained us to be.

250
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,820
 And even when we do something well, or even if we're the best at doing what we're doing,

251
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:31,480
 there's very little praise for us, right?

252
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:37,460
 One because that's what we were supposed to do, so why get any praise?

253
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:42,640
 Or the fear is that, well, if there's too much praise, we breed mediocrity.

254
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,020
 People get too used to it and that it doesn't really have the same level of strength that

255
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,020
 it's meant to have.

256
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:56,440
 I know someone who shared with her parents not too a while ago that she took some standardized

257
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,640
 tests and she rated in the 99th percentile.

258
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,600
 Her parents' immediate response was, "Well, why weren't you in the 100th percentile?"

259
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,760
 But she already, if you understand percentiles, being in the 99th percentile means that you're

260
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,520
 in the top 1%.

261
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,000
 But the immediate response was, "Why weren't you in the top 100?"

262
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,460
 Which you can't be.

263
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:24,260
 And the funny thing is that even though your parents don't praise you, what you see is

264
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:28,460
 that they actually brag about you in front of their friends, right?

265
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:33,020
 So they use your accomplishments and your performance as ammunition for those around

266
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,340
 them, but you get none of the credit.

267
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:42,500
 You get even more burdened because then you have to continuously deliver these expectations.

268
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:49,880
 As aspiring as Jeremy Lin was a number of years ago, I felt sorry for a whole generation

269
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,940
 that came after him.

270
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:57,560
 And I can imagine the countless conversations that were had of, "Well, not only did Jeremy

271
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:03,120
 Lin get into the NBA and is six feet plus tall, he also went to Harvard.

272
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,120
 What about you?"

273
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:12,200
 You know, I can already see the pain of all these children that had to face this reality.

274
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,560
 But more recently we had the Winter Olympics.

275
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:20,260
 And of course we know that the focal point for Asians was not the athletics, it was who?

276
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:23,040
 It was Aileen Gu.

277
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:27,740
 And I thought it was hard enough when Jeremy existed, but Aileen Gu just blows them out

278
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,480
 of the water, right?

279
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:34,760
 Here we have someone that is a multi-gold medalist in the Olympics, scored near perfect

280
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:42,160
 in her SATs, is going to Stanford, is a millionaire, is a model, reads, writes, and, you know,

281
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:47,160
 reads, writes, and speaks Chinese fluently, and then just add insult to injury, she can

282
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:50,760
 recite Chinese poetry from the Tang Dynasty, right?

283
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,160
 Like we are all condemned.

284
00:21:53,160 --> 00:22:01,160
 This just makes it incredibly hard for everybody that comes now from the Chinese household.

285
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,600
 But this is why God is great.

286
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,680
 He doesn't care about this stuff.

287
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:11,120
 He loves us for not what we can do, but who we are, right?

288
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:18,000
 We need to embrace the idea that God expresses delight toward us versus persistently projecting

289
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:25,640
 this idea that God is a critical parent and just expects us to deliver and perform all

290
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,740
 the time.

291
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,800
 We need to feel loved ourselves.

292
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:36,600
 You know, in Matthew 3, 16 to 17, it says that as soon as Jesus was baptized, he went

293
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,200
 up out of the water.

294
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:43,120
 At that moment, heaven was open and he saw the spirit of God descending like a dove and

295
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,120
 rest on him.

296
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:48,600
 And a voice from heaven said, "This is my son, whom I love.

297
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,760
 With him, I am well pleased."

298
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,360
 God delights in his son for being faithful.

299
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:02,840
 Who here has heard their parents say to them that they delight in you?

300
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:09,360
 Who here as parents have shared that same expression to their children that you delight

301
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,760
 in your children?

302
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:19,920
 God wants us to be able to feel the good, like adoration, loyalty, love, desire, peace,

303
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:24,000
 success and joy, along with the negative that we feel.

304
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,880
 The Bible clearly captures the full range of emotions.

305
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:33,000
 The clearest comprehensive collection is in the 150 Psalms that we have in the Bible.

306
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:42,680
 It speaks of lament, fear, pain, hate, but peace, joy, contentment, love, and so on.

307
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:46,360
 The Song of Songs is a full love letter.

308
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:54,880
 And Revelation starts with a grim reality but turns into expected hope.

309
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:00,720
 We need to be able to cry when we feel despair and celebrate jubilantly when there are things

310
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,440
 worth being happy about.

311
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,000
 King David is seen trapped in some pretty dark moments in the Old Testament.

312
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:14,640
 But he's also shown to be depicted as someone that can shout for joy and dance like a fool

313
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,460
 in the streets.

314
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:22,520
 It's not enough for us to start expressing the feelings now.

315
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:30,720
 And we need to express the full range, but God also wants us to, sorry, to work deeply

316
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,360
 through our emotions.

317
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:40,120
 So we are meant to see God as one who expresses a range of emotions.

318
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,880
 And sorry that I kind of blasted through that.

319
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:48,320
 But God also encourages us to express the range of emotions ourselves.

320
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:55,240
 And then thirdly, God wants us to work deeply through our emotions.

321
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:59,360
 He encourages us to work through some of our older painful emotions.

322
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,860
 We're called to dig deep into our past at times to examine some of the harder things

323
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:06,720
 that we've been through.

324
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,680
 Studies have shown that there are real physical and mental effects resulting from undealt

325
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,680
 with suppressed and repressed emotions.

326
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:20,680
 Studies show that individuals who repress their emotions and suppress their body's

327
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:25,680
 immunity, making them more vulnerable to a variety of illnesses leading from the common

328
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,620
 cold to cancer.

329
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:34,280
 There are real effects from undealt with emotions, not just on the emotional level, but that

330
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:39,800
 physically manifest themselves in physical form in our bodies.

331
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:46,960
 And it's not that dealing with emotions is a nice to have, but it's closely interconnected

332
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:53,600
 with all that we are, all that we are, with our physical, mental, and spiritual well-being

333
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,880
 by design.

334
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,080
 And we have a responsibility to address them.

335
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:05,060
 Before Jesus was crucified, he predicted Peter would deny him three times before the rooster

336
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:07,480
 cried in the morning.

337
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:13,120
 But Peter boldly claimed that he would follow Jesus both to prison and to death.

338
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:20,480
 Now we know that this wasn't true because Peter indeed denied Jesus three times, and

339
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,720
 he was bitterly ashamed of himself for it.

340
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,480
 It's described in the Bible that he wept bitterly after the rooster crowed when he realized

341
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,600
 that Jesus' prediction came true.

342
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,600
 And Peter could have wrestled with this for the rest of his life.

343
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:40,520
 But what we see captured at the end of John is that Jesus works through these shameful

344
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:46,640
 and guilty feelings that traumatize Peter.

345
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:52,880
 After Jesus is resurrected and reappears to his disciples, he's captured at the end of

346
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:59,920
 the book of John, sitting Peter down over a meal of fish that they just caught.

347
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,040
 And this is the passage.

348
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:07,640
 They had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon, son of John, do you love me

349
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,640
 more than these?"

350
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,160
 "Yes, Lord," he said, "you know that I love you."

351
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,680
 Jesus said, "Feed my lambs."

352
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:19,160
 Again, Jesus said, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?"

353
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:23,040
 He answered, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you."

354
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,620
 Jesus said, "Take care of my sheep."

355
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:30,300
 The third time he said to him, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?"

356
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:34,280
 Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, "Do you love me?"

357
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:38,040
 He said, "Lord, you know all things, you know that I love you."

358
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,700
 Jesus said, "Feed my sheep."

359
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:47,240
 We see Jesus here going deeper and deeper with Peter, probably because Peter was avoiding

360
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,240
 this.

361
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:54,440
 He doesn't explicitly bring up the denial that Peter did, but he asked him three times,

362
00:27:54,440 --> 00:28:00,420
 almost in a way, redeeming the three denials that he had.

363
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:06,140
 Jesus actively works with Peter through his emotions to bring restoration, and over a

364
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:11,820
 meal that actually physically restores him as well.

365
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:15,500
 Those who serve in ministry are not exempt from this work.

366
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:19,260
 One of the requirements to graduate seminary for me was actually go through a number of

367
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,020
 counseling sessions.

368
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:27,180
 This was very important because we have to make sure that whatever potential painful

369
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:33,020
 memories, experiences, don't surface and put our future ministry at risk.

370
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:37,420
 And there are actually some churches that are really good about this that have a requirement

371
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:43,760
 for their pastors to just get counseling every so often to make sure that they're cared for

372
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:48,840
 and that they're addressing their emotional and mental health.

373
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:54,020
 When we go through periods of dismissed emotions that get suppressed and repressed, there are

374
00:28:54,020 --> 00:29:01,340
 triggers that could derail us, that can surface in ways and at times that we don't expect.

375
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:06,620
 We are seeing a lot of the effects of isolation and depression amongst children, especially

376
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:11,860
 during these COVID times, and we have to be very mindful of the longer-term effects of

377
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:14,020
 this behavior.

378
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:17,300
 So I have a task for you.

379
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:22,900
 I want you to, and I'll leave this on here, I want you to look at this emotional wheel

380
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:27,820
 and pick an emotion here that is hard for you to express.

381
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:33,580
 And I want you to just kind of process it over this week, and if you can, by the end

382
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:37,500
 of next week, to find someone that you can trust to actually just talk about it and try

383
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:41,300
 to talk about it in a way that you haven't before.

384
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:45,100
 I challenge you to share it with someone that you can trust so that you can really, you

385
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:50,580
 know, exercise, take this exercise just really seriously.

386
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:57,660
 Well, Pastor Mark said that I could preach about anything from Genesis to Revelation,

387
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:01,580
 and the entire Bible captures the full range of emotions.

388
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:06,140
 So I think that I fulfilled my duty in spanning the whole of the Bible with emotions that

389
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,140
 span the whole of the Bible.

390
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:12,660
 And I just want to say that it's okay to not be okay.

391
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:15,020
 It's okay to not feel okay.

392
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:17,260
 And there's nothing wrong with that.

393
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:20,060
 And there's nothing wrong with feeling great as well.

394
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:25,940
 I think that sometimes being Asian, when we feel too positively, someone just wants to,

395
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,400
 you know, squash that.

396
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:34,960
 So it's okay to feel great when there's cause to celebrate and to be festive.

397
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,020
 God actually expects it.

398
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:39,100
 And God actually designed us to be that way.

399
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:44,660
 So we deny ourselves the fullness of how we're meant to live and how God created us when

400
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:49,140
 we restrict ourselves in this area of life.

401
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:54,180
 Embrace the way that the Lord has made you, understanding that it might be uncomfortable

402
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:58,580
 at times to work through some of the things that we like to avoid, especially because

403
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:01,820
 of our cultural conditioning.

404
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:08,700
 But don't allow our cultural lens, our upbringing, to shade the kingdom-centered perspective

405
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,660
 that God wants us to have.

406
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:14,040
 Be renewed through His Spirit.

407
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,660
 Have this fresh perspective.

408
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:22,140
 And don't let the worldly way that we've been brought up color the way that we're meant

409
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:27,460
 to understand the world from just a believer's perspective.

410
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:29,500
 Well, that's it for me.

411
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:33,020
 Let me just close in prayer.

412
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:39,940
 Heavenly Father, we thank you for the way that you've created us and the ways that we

413
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:42,420
 sometimes don't like.

414
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:47,140
 But we understand that that is the way that we were designed.

415
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:52,700
 Help us here to really feel the way that you want us to feel.

416
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:58,060
 And where there are maybe painful memories, help us to also work through them, through

417
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:01,180
 your strength and through your support.

418
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:05,780
 Let us embrace the way that you designed us and feel love when we should feel loved, but

419
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:12,420
 also feel the yucky things when we are meant to feel them, and to not repress them or suppress

420
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:17,660
 them, but to openly grieve and to openly support those that are going through these periods

421
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:20,180
 of negative feelings.

422
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:22,580
 We praise you and we glorify your name.

423
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,580
 In your name we pray.
