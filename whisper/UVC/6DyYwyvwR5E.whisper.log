[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   Can you say hi, like high five or whatever?
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.000]   Just wave your hand, okay?
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Good to see you all.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   And it's good to be back to think about the Lord's,
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.120]   the Lord's word, what it's gonna say to us.
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.760]   We're gonna go through our series,
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.520]   continue with our series, Faith and Time.
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.920]   Think about how we use our time.
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.940]   Think about how God will put different markers
[00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.140]   in our time, in our journey,
[00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.440]   to remind us of his work and his grace.
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.260]   Today, we're going to talk about the concept
[00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.460]   or the practice of Sabbath.
[00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.320]   Sabbath.
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.600]   Sabbath is what day of the week?
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.920]   First day, third day, fifth, sixth?
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.960]   What's your guess?
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:50.800]   The seventh, right?
[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.760]   Yeah, exactly, seventh, yeah.
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.480]   The seventh, okay.
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.480]   Well, according to Jewish calendar,
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.480]   it's Friday, sundown, you're gonna launch the Shabbat.
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.120]   And then for 24 hours until Saturday,
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.200]   which is the seventh day, right?
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.720]   Seventh day of the week,
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.240]   until the sundown of the next day on Saturday.
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.560]   So 24 hours is the Sabbath or Shabbat, all right?
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.520]   It is a regular weekly practice,
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.640]   even for many modern Jewish people,
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.600]   Israelis, or even in Jewish communities today,
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.800]   like community in Skokie or in other areas,
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.280]   Brooklyn or anywhere you get a concentration
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.640]   of a lot of Jewish people,
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.840]   they will continue the practice of Shabbat.
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.280]   Friday night to Saturday night,
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.120]   for 24 hours, they don't do any work.
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.280]   They stop anything that they do in the past six days.
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.160]   So they cease all the work,
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.000]   and then they don't do a lot of things,
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.040]   like they don't cook.
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.400]   They don't start any fire.
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.560]   So in modern day technology, they put their phone away.
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.920]   They don't push any button, you know what I'm saying?
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.560]   'Cause you push a button, the light will go up, right?
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.040]   And that is considered a violation of the Shabbat,
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.320]   because you're lighting things up, right?
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.080]   Starting a fire.
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.080]   Strange, right?
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.160]   Do you wanna live like that?
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.000]   No, right?
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.360]   (audience laughing)
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.360]   But if you ask them, many of them will be grateful
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.420]   for such a practice.
[00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.800]   Interesting, right?
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.520]   To stop anything that you're doing,
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.400]   just to take a break,
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.400]   especially in our technology tyranny.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.120]   We are living in a technology tyranny.
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.240]   We are being massacred actually by our phone,
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.920]   by technology, by a lot of different things.
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.560]   So it's a very interesting practice.
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.560]   And actually the Bible emphasizes once and again
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.480]   that the people of God should do something like that,
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.520]   should observe Sabbath.
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.320]   As I said, many modern Jewish people,
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.320]   modern Israelis, they are practicing this sort of Shabbat.
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.620]   So let me give you some example.
[00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.620]   If you go to Israel or any community
[00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.700]   that has a lot of Jewish people,
[00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.720]   you'll find a Shabbat elevator.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.200]   A Shabbat elevator is a Jewish elevator.
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.200]   So whenever there's a weekly Shabbat or high holidays,
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.240]   they already program the elevator
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.280]   so that you don't have to go into the elevator
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.160]   and push a button, right?
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.200]   Again, that's why I said, if you push a button,
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.960]   something light up, it consider violation
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.640]   because you are lighting things up, right?
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.040]   You're starting a fire.
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.360]   So here's one of them.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.280]   I think this picture was found in Brooklyn, in New York.
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:18.040]   The second one is another form of Shabbat elevator.
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.560]   So you go to a high rise, right?
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.560]   And this elevator, the one on the right, elevator A,
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.000]   and which floor do you go to?
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.280]   This Shabbat elevator, by the way,
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.240]   we will stop at every single floor and then come back.
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.640]   So you go into the Shabbat elevator,
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.240]   you don't have to press the button.
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.640]   It will close automatically.
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.560]   It will bring you to the floor that you want
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.680]   and then you will exit, right?
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.680]   And then the elevator A on the right is that,
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.080]   from basement to ground floor is zero,
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.200]   to one, two, three, four, and then come back down
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.640]   to zero and then minus two or basement,
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.000]   and then go back up.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.860]   Elevator D is a little bit different, right?
[00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.400]   If you want to go to floor eight,
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.220]   then you take A or you take D.
[00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.160]   That's right, if you take A,
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.680]   then it will take a long time for you
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.440]   because you have to come back.
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.040]   And then you find out I was in the wrong elevator.
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.080]   And then you have to go to D, right?
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.400]   So it will stop every single floor
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.400]   in order for you to cease doing any work to observe Shabbat.
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.180]   Last one I want to show you is this one.
[00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.820]   It's a warning sign in case of fire,
[00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:39.980]   do not use the elevator.
[00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.640]   Do you know that?
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.160]   We shouldn't use elevator in case there's fire, right?
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.700]   And even worse, if you go into a Shabbat elevator, right?
[00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.940]   'Cause it will bring you to the floor of fire, right?
[00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:54.940]   (laughs)
[00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.180]   And then you have to survive the floor
[00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.140]   and then you come back, right?
[00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.460]   It will be a big trouble for you.
[00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.300]   This sort of thing is very interesting.
[00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.820]   But as I said, the Bible keeps on talking about
[00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:10.900]   the marker in the lives of the people of God
[00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.420]   that they need to do something like that, all right?
[00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.080]   In their time, in their schedule,
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.640]   there has to be something that will show,
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.800]   that will mark themselves away from
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.540]   or different from other people in the world.
[00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:31.080]   Shabbat is one of the killer, one of the sure marker.
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.320]   So what does it mean?
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.900]   Shabbat means stop.
[00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:40.080]   You stop doing anything.
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.580]   You cease to work.
[00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:45.600]   One day a week.
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:50.040]   You stop doing what you have been doing for six days.
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.400]   And then you stop for one day.
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.660]   That is what Sabbath means.
[00:06:54.660 --> 00:07:00.680]   The first time the Bible mentions Shabbat is
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.620]   Shabbat is the creation story, Genesis 2.
[00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:09.060]   The creation of heaven and earth,
[00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.640]   everything is done, was complete.
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:15.500]   On the seventh day, God had finished his work of creation.
[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.580]   So he rest Shabbat from all his work.
[00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:24.760]   And God blessed and sanctified, declared holy the seventh day.
[00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:31.220]   Because it was the day when he rested Shabbat
[00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:35.000]   from all his work of creation.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.960]   So right off the bat, the very first page of the Bible,
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.860]   God works like that.
[00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:46.040]   Six days he created or he organized the entire cosmos,
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:51.400]   arranged it in such a way that is in order.
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:55.820]   And then the seventh day, God blessed and sanctified
[00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:59.980]   and set it apart, declared holy, or the seventh day.
[00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:05.200]   And then there is the fourth commandment
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.060]   in the 10th commandment passage.
[00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.140]   One of them is Exodus 20.
[00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:15.160]   Remember to observe the seventh day by keeping it holy.
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:19.240]   And by the way, this is the fourth commandment.
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:23.840]   This is the longest explained commandment of all 10.
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:27.920]   You know, other commandments are just one or two sentences.
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:32.080]   Here, talking about Shabbat, the fourth commandment.
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:35.500]   Observe the seventh day by keeping holy.
[00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:39.660]   You have six days each week for your ordinary work.
[00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:43.980]   But the seventh day is special.
[00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:48.140]   It is Sabbath, day of rest, dedicated to the Lord, your God.
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.660]   On that day, no one in your household may do any work,
[00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:56.960]   including your sons and daughters, your male servant
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.660]   or your female servant, your livestock, everything else,
[00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:03.840]   even your sheep, even your pets, your dog, your cat.
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:07.200]   They stop doing any work.
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.500]   I know your dogs and your cats don't do any work.
[00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:13.240]   You do works for them, right?
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:17.720]   In six days, the Lord made the heavens and the earth,
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.620]   the sea and everything in them.
[00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:22.440]   On the Shabbat, on the seventh day, He rested.
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:26.180]   And that's why the Lord Yahweh blessed the seventh day
[00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:29.460]   and set it apart, sanctified it as holy.
[00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:31.560]   This is how God works.
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:35.720]   Six days of work, and then one day, He set it apart,
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:40.520]   sanctified it, declared it special and holy.
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:44.680]   Holy and special, distinct from all the other six days.
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:48.940]   A six plus one, parallel, right?
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:53.920]   Six days, and then one day, six day and one day.
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:58.060]   It's like you read the music scores, right?
[00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:01.000]   You know how to read music scores?
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.920]   Kind of, right?
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:07.020]   There's always rest at some places, right?
[00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:10.560]   Good music does not mean you jam everything together
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.360]   and there's no space, right?
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:15.360]   You hear someone play piano, if he's good,
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.640]   play some sort of instrument,
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:21.800]   there has to be intentional rest in between, right?
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.280]   Do you get it?
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.120]   Right?
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:29.260]   It's like you writing a novel or something.
[00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.180]   There's always commerce in between.
[00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.780]   And then period, here and there.
[00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:36.520]   Punctuations.
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:39.180]   Sabbath is our life punctuation.
[00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:42.440]   It's our rhythm.
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:46.160]   God set the rhythm of our life.
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.160]   Six plus one, and then six plus one.
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.220]   This is how God works.
[00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:54.880]   God bless the seven day and declare it holy.
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:58.980]   Can you see what God does here?
[00:10:58.980 --> 00:10:59.820]   It's very interesting.
[00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:02.120]   I read, you read it again.
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:05.200]   I mean, there's so many familiar passage in the Bible
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:07.640]   that we thought we know what it means
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.540]   because it's so familiar.
[00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:13.500]   But if you slow down and read the key words,
[00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:15.900]   you pick up the meaning.
[00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:18.960]   Genesis one and two is one of the examples.
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.500]   We all know the creation account, right?
[00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:24.900]   We read it and we feel it's so familiar, right?
[00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:26.980]   There's nothing surprising.
[00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:31.300]   But if you come to the seventh day, chapter two,
[00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:32.140]   it's very interesting.
[00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:36.300]   God bless, incentivize, declare holy the seventh day.
[00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:40.600]   Now what's so special about it?
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.380]   God created everything, right?
[00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:44.460]   Day one to day six.
[00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:48.620]   Then found the climax is creating humanity, right?
[00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:51.580]   There were a lot of things.
[00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:54.600]   There are a lot of stuff that God put in order
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.480]   in the universe.
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:00.880]   Now those are the things that can be set apart, right?
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:04.420]   Just like the temple, you go into a holy place,
[00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:08.360]   there were something more sacred than others, right?
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:11.000]   There's always distinction between what is sacred
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.440]   and what is not sacred, what is holy and what is profane.
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.620]   Things can be set apart, right?
[00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:19.900]   People can be set apart.
[00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:23.160]   Priests serving in the temple services,
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:26.580]   they can be set apart, they can be sanctified.
[00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:29.900]   They can be declared holy, different from other people.
[00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:34.060]   So things can be set apart and personnel can be set apart.
[00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:36.640]   However, the first thing God set apart
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:39.720]   is not a person or a people.
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:42.280]   It's not a thing or things.
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:45.520]   The first thing God sanctified is time.
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:51.080]   24 hours out of one week.
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:57.680]   He bless it, seven days, and declare it holy.
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:05.040]   Find it interesting that in the creation rhythm,
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:09.240]   there is a time pattern.
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:12.660]   There is a slot of time in the entire week
[00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:16.280]   that is called sacred time.
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:22.020]   Not anything, not any person, not any object,
[00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:26.700]   but a period of time, right?
[00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:30.880]   There's one very famous rabbi
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:35.380]   who wrote a very well-known work on Shabbat.
[00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:40.640]   His name is called Abraham Herschel.
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:41.920]   Now let me give you a quote.
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:45.340]   I think this quote worth your reflection.
[00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:50.880]   He talks about Shabbat, a time that is set apart.
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.960]   Sacred time, special time.
[00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:59.640]   So Herschel said, "There is a realm of time
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:04.780]   "where the goal is not to have, but to be."
[00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:07.620]   Not to own, but to give.
[00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:14.240]   Not to control, but to share.
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:18.500]   Not to subdue, but to be in accord.
[00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:22.700]   Now think about this thing.
[00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:27.540]   Consider all things in the universe,
[00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:31.700]   all things that God created, all the small, big things,
[00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:35.860]   you know, down to the molecules, down to the atoms,
[00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:43.780]   up to the planets, right?
[00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:48.660]   The galaxy, the universe.
[00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:54.340]   But there's only one realm that is different.
[00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:57.180]   It's the realm of time.
[00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:00.760]   The realm of time is purpose.
[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:03.440]   It's not to subdue.
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:06.820]   It's not for us to control.
[00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:08.740]   That's interesting because, you know,
[00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:11.740]   like objects in the universe, you can subdue
[00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:14.500]   and you can control, you can take possession of it.
[00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:16.180]   Like this table.
[00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:17.740]   You know, I can take this table
[00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:19.740]   and you don't have this table.
[00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:20.820]   If I take it.
[00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:24.760]   Like the chair.
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:26.100]   You're sitting on your chair.
[00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:27.700]   Nobody's gonna sit on your chair
[00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:29.300]   because you're sitting on it, right?
[00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:32.700]   Unless, you know, the other person's sitting on your lap.
[00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:33.900]   You take possession of it.
[00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:34.940]   You control it.
[00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:36.860]   You subdue it.
[00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:39.940]   Now this is our desire, this is our purpose all the time.
[00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:41.900]   We take control of something
[00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:44.860]   and then nobody else can control it.
[00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:48.700]   It's kind of taking exclusive possession of something.
[00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:49.780]   Some property, right?
[00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:51.660]   Your house, right?
[00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:54.140]   You just bought a house, right?
[00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:54.980]   Somebody?
[00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:57.820]   You bought a house, it's your house,
[00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:00.940]   it's not somebody else's house anymore, right?
[00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:04.780]   Nobody can knock the door and say, "I wanna come in," right?
[00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:07.020]   You can only come in by invitation.
[00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:08.460]   It's your house.
[00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:09.820]   You take possession of it.
[00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:12.620]   But Herschel said, "Time is different."
[00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:15.540]   Think about it.
[00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:19.580]   You have 24 hours, I have 24 hours, right?
[00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:21.380]   You can take possession of 24 hours
[00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:25.380]   and take my hours out of mine, right?
[00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:27.780]   I have 24 hours, you have 24 hours,
[00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:29.740]   you have seven days, I have seven days.
[00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:35.620]   It is a realm not to own but to give.
[00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:40.420]   God created us as beings in time.
[00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:42.540]   You realize that?
[00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:44.380]   We live in time.
[00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:47.220]   We watch the clock.
[00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:50.420]   What time we go to work?
[00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:51.860]   We don't wanna be late.
[00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:56.180]   What time we go off work and then we have our time, right?
[00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:58.940]   What time do we go for dinner?
[00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:01.340]   After the service, what time are we getting there
[00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:03.340]   to have lunch, right?
[00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:05.820]   We don't wanna be late, right?
[00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:07.420]   What time is service?
[00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:09.820]   We wanna be there, right?
[00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:14.380]   But time is a realm in the entire universe
[00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:16.900]   not to control but to share.
[00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:19.980]   Think about it.
[00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:22.140]   When we have fellowship together,
[00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:25.820]   when we worship together, it's a time to share.
[00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:32.140]   That's why worship in the Bible has always been,
[00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:37.140]   has always been corporate, a group, a people together,
[00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:42.380]   not alone, right?
[00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:46.020]   Not individual enjoyment.
[00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:49.820]   We come together to share.
[00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:52.620]   It's very interesting.
[00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:54.540]   God blessed the seventh day.
[00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:57.140]   The first thing that God sanctified
[00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:00.140]   is the period of time in our lives.
[00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:06.900]   In your week of work, 24 hours, God set it apart.
[00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:14.460]   That's why when the Bible talks about Shabbat,
[00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:18.660]   it always relate to other things.
[00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:23.660]   Leviticus 23, six days each week for your ordinary work.
[00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:26.660]   But the seventh day is the Sabbath day,
[00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:30.140]   the Shabbat of complete rest,
[00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:33.260]   an official day for holy assembly.
[00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:37.700]   It is the Lord's Shabbat day.
[00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:40.740]   It must be observed whenever you live, wherever you live.
[00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:42.180]   In addition to Shabbat,
[00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:44.940]   there are the Lord's appointed festivals,
[00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:48.820]   official days for holy assembly
[00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:53.180]   that are to be celebrated at their proper times each year.
[00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:54.420]   Now, what does it mean?
[00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:59.260]   Shabbat for some other purpose.
[00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:03.660]   So in some sense, you start working,
[00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:08.660]   but in another sense, you do something together,
[00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:13.900]   which is holy assembly, to get together to worship,
[00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:15.420]   to get together to celebrate,
[00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:19.740]   to acknowledge who is in charge.
[00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:20.740]   And who is in charge?
[00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:21.660]   God is in charge.
[00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:24.300]   You go back to Genesis 2,
[00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:30.500]   when the Bible describes the work of God,
[00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:34.020]   the six days of creation,
[00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:36.900]   and then He rests on the seventh day.
[00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:39.780]   Now, it does not mean that God is tired.
[00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:43.540]   It does not mean that God is not human.
[00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:45.260]   It's not like us, right?
[00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:47.500]   We work for a whole day,
[00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:50.580]   and then we go back home and we sit on the lazy boy,
[00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:52.660]   and then we say, "We are tired."
[00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:55.220]   We want to get refreshed.
[00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:58.780]   No, God is not like human, but He rested.
[00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:00.300]   Now, what does it mean?
[00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:02.940]   Now, in the biblical world, in the ancient world,
[00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:06.980]   when they think about God resting,
[00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:13.420]   they are thinking of God being enthroned.
[00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:15.100]   Being the king.
[00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:20.340]   So whenever God rests, God rests in His temple.
[00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:24.660]   His temple is where He operates the entire world.
[00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:29.380]   So when Genesis 2 talks about God resting,
[00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:31.700]   it's talking about God being the king.
[00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:35.460]   He is seated on the throne,
[00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:40.460]   and He controls and organizes the entire cosmos.
[00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:42.780]   He operates the entire cosmos.
[00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:43.900]   That's what it means.
[00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:46.580]   Doesn't mean six days, He works so hard,
[00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:48.620]   and then the seventh day, "Oh, He's so tired.
[00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:49.740]   "He's exhausted.
[00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:51.100]   "He needs some rest."
[00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:55.300]   No, sixth day, He put together the entire cosmos,
[00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:59.300]   arranged it in such a way that it's in order.
[00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:00.860]   And then the seventh day,
[00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:04.260]   He sits in the control room in the temple
[00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:06.380]   to operate the entire universe.
[00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:09.060]   It's kind of like, it gives you a modern analogy.
[00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:14.060]   It's like, remember when the pandemic started
[00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:17.580]   about two, three years ago?
[00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:19.820]   Remember we have to switch everything back
[00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:22.100]   from in-person to online?
[00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:23.980]   So I bought a new computer.
[00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:26.260]   So I went to my basement, right?
[00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:28.580]   And then I got all the computer parts,
[00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:34.540]   my standing table, my monitors, my keyboard,
[00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:36.340]   and all the parts.
[00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:38.900]   I got everything in the basement.
[00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:42.420]   And then I spent almost like two to three days
[00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:46.900]   to put the entire computer system together,
[00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:49.740]   camera and all this stuff.
[00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:52.780]   Now, you got the wires,
[00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:57.780]   you got the different big or small parts.
[00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:00.220]   You put everything together.
[00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:01.300]   Now, if you imagine,
[00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:05.500]   we put the entire computer system together,
[00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:07.620]   what do you do after you're done?
[00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:09.740]   - Rest.
[00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:11.580]   - You rest.
[00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:13.140]   What do you do?
[00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:17.100]   The first button I push is the power on button.
[00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:21.980]   'Cause that is when the time you control, you operate.
[00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:28.340]   Same way, God put everything in order,
[00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:30.580]   like putting together a computer system.
[00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:33.700]   And then He push not the off button,
[00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:35.860]   He push the on button.
[00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:40.260]   So He's the King over the entire cosmos.
[00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:41.700]   He control everything.
[00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:44.300]   Now, that's what it means
[00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:48.260]   when the Bible talks about Shabbat.
[00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:49.420]   It doesn't really,
[00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:54.420]   it means more than we imitating God,
[00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:57.060]   'cause God works six days in one day, right?
[00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:58.860]   Six in one, six in one.
[00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:00.900]   It's more than imitation,
[00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:04.100]   but it's more on participation.
[00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:06.060]   We can participate, we can join.
[00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:08.860]   Or live under God's control.
[00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:13.660]   So we set apart one day a week to worship,
[00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:17.820]   because we know the universe, your universe, your world,
[00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:21.860]   is not controlled by you.
[00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:27.260]   It's by the one who created all things.
[00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:32.820]   That's what worship is all about, right?
[00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:34.740]   That's what worship is all about.
[00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:38.780]   Worship meaning we know we are not in control.
[00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:43.140]   We are not the ultimate operator of our lives.
[00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:46.100]   There's one who is Lord of all, right?
[00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:48.380]   Who is the God of all.
[00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:50.540]   He is involved in everything that you do.
[00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:54.140]   So one day in seven days,
[00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:59.700]   to be set apart in order to give Him honor,
[00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:04.380]   to tell Him, "Yes, you are the Lord who control my lives.
[00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:07.900]   You are the Lord who controls my career.
[00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:11.460]   You are the Lord who controls my future.
[00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:14.020]   I participate in your kinship.
[00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.940]   I participate in your worship.
[00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:20.220]   You are everything, and I want to do your will."
[00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:21.500]   Right?
[00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:23.300]   That's what worship is all about.
[00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:27.500]   You come in here to join our worship.
[00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:30.820]   It's not just going through some motions,
[00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:33.900]   you know, joining a program.
[00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:38.340]   It's to look upon God Himself.
[00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:40.260]   He is the one who set up everything,
[00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:44.940]   and He's the one who is in the ultimate control, right?
[00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:53.860]   Let me close by giving you some suggestions
[00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:57.060]   how to practice Shabbat.
[00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:59.380]   How do you practice Shabbat?
[00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:04.060]   You know, I tell you, I do that all the time too.
[00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:07.860]   Most of the people assume
[00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:11.180]   that I go to church because of work, right?
[00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:13.900]   Yeah, yeah, I work, right?
[00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:16.900]   But you know, some people would come to me,
[00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:21.860]   "Oh, pastor, do you really have your Shabbat?
[00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:24.340]   Because you come here to work, right?"
[00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:28.420]   And I want to tell you, it's not really work for me.
[00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:31.900]   Seriously, it's worship.
[00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:34.180]   I relate to God.
[00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:37.020]   Yes, I do some work, right?
[00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:38.300]   I do some preparation.
[00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:39.300]   You too do.
[00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:42.660]   You need to do some preparation too, right?
[00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:46.060]   So I come here, I really enjoy the worship service.
[00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:55.740]   So I come with a mentality, with an attitude
[00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:58.660]   that I'm not here to just output.
[00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:01.060]   I'm getting some input too.
[00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:05.020]   When I worship with the people of God together,
[00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:06.820]   you know, my spirit is refreshed
[00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:09.500]   because I draw closer to God.
[00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:11.580]   With that kind of attitude,
[00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:15.060]   this is how we practice Shabbat, right?
[00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:19.580]   Well, you know, let me explain.
[00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:22.060]   In the Old Testament, it's the seventh day of the week.
[00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:24.260]   In the New Testament, it's the first day of the week,
[00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:25.780]   Sunday.
[00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:26.900]   Why?
[00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:27.740]   Why?
[00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:32.740]   Because the real work, the real creation is in Jesus Christ.
[00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:36.940]   He rose again from the dead on the third day.
[00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:39.260]   He died on Friday, on the third day, on Sunday,
[00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:40.740]   the first day of the week.
[00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:42.020]   That's why in the New Testament,
[00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:45.660]   you always see the phrase, first day of the week.
[00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:48.180]   Jesus rose from the dead.
[00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:50.420]   First day of the week, they collect offering.
[00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:52.260]   They worship together.
[00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:53.620]   First day of the week.
[00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:56.420]   This is the weekly example.
[00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:59.220]   Now again, I come to church.
[00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:01.460]   I'm not here just working.
[00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:04.540]   I'm here to enjoy and I am here to get closer to God
[00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:08.180]   because I know this is the time that is sacred.
[00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:10.020]   This is a time that is set apart
[00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:13.940]   from all these other things that I did in the past six days.
[00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:16.620]   It's a sacred time.
[00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:17.620]   It's a holy time.
[00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:20.300]   Sanctified.
[00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:23.620]   I spend time with God in the worship service.
[00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:26.700]   So let me suggest to you,
[00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:31.220]   one thing is to adjust your mentality
[00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:34.140]   when you walk into a worship service.
[00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:36.140]   To stop your work.
[00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:38.100]   Stop checking your phone.
[00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:40.500]   Stop thinking about the stock market.
[00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:44.580]   Stop thinking about your career.
[00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:46.660]   Yeah, I know it's been stressful.
[00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:48.860]   I know it's been stressful, you know,
[00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:50.700]   being more than men and women.
[00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:55.420]   There were a lot of things that we wanna do.
[00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:58.780]   And sometimes we treat the Shabbat,
[00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:02.380]   the one day of the week, as our extension.
[00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:06.540]   Oh, for six days I have so much work.
[00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:08.700]   And then I spill over to the seventh day, right?
[00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:13.500]   Oh, I'd rather not go to observe it.
[00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:17.420]   I want another day to finish my work, right?
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:21.780]   I want another day to earn some more money, right?
[00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:24.900]   I want another day to increase my income, right?
[00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:26.540]   I mean, what other time do I have?
[00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:28.300]   I have six days of work, right?
[00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:29.220]   And then the seventh day,
[00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:31.980]   I better use it for my own purposes, right?
[00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:33.740]   I wanna earn some money.
[00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:37.740]   Now, Shabbat is a spiritual discipline, right?
[00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:42.740]   Well, ask yourself, when do you have enough money?
[00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:45.180]   When will you have enough money?
[00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:46.820]   When will you have enough salary?
[00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:49.100]   When?
[00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:50.140]   How much is enough?
[00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:53.060]   (laughs)
[00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:54.460]   When is enough is enough?
[00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:59.220]   It's never enough, right?
[00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:00.220]   You never stop.
[00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:05.820]   So Shabbat is to stop, to cease, cease our work,
[00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:10.820]   and know that God is the God of all.
[00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:12.740]   He's the God of my finance.
[00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:16.500]   He controls my finance, He controls my money.
[00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:18.220]   He controls my time, therefore.
[00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:24.380]   And I wanna set this time apart as a sacred time.
[00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:26.780]   That's a weekly Shabbat.
[00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:29.540]   So let me challenge you, let me invite you.
[00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:33.660]   Come to the worship service with your heart fully prepared,
[00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:39.380]   fully prepared for worship, right?
[00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:41.380]   Well, learn from our worship team.
[00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:45.460]   They always come early, so much early,
[00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:50.260]   as early as they can in order to prepare, right?
[00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:53.700]   In order to prepare the worship service
[00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:55.620]   for other people, for all of us.
[00:29:55.620 --> 00:30:01.620]   We come early because we wanna set apart this time as sacred.
[00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:07.180]   Then secondly, I wanna invite you
[00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:12.020]   to do a little Shabbat every day, a little Shabbat.
[00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:18.300]   Many, many years ago, probably 500 years ago,
[00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:21.900]   there was a guy called Brother Lawrence.
[00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:24.420]   Now, Brother Lawrence was in Europe at that time,
[00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:29.380]   and he was a monk, a little monk in the monastery.
[00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:31.580]   The monastery has a lot of people.
[00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:33.900]   Has a lot of people who wanna be priests
[00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:37.060]   or wanna be pastors in the monasteries.
[00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:39.180]   And Brother Lawrence was working
[00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:41.780]   in the kitchen of the monastery.
[00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:45.620]   And he wrote a little book, "In the Presence of God,"
[00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:47.380]   or "Practice the Presence of God."
[00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:51.420]   Now, that little book, he shared his secret
[00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:55.960]   of how to live in the presence of God every day,
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:56.960]   no matter what I do.
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:01.440]   And his secret is, when he was struggling
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:02.820]   with his relationship with God,
[00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:07.740]   he find himself sometimes distant from God himself.
[00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:10.420]   So he figured out some way to keep himself
[00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:11.960]   in the presence of God.
[00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:14.020]   So this is what he did.
[00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:16.700]   Every day he was in the kitchen doing dishes,
[00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:18.260]   very mundane work.
[00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:23.620]   But he find the secret is, whenever he has time,
[00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:25.020]   he would do a little prayer.
[00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:28.500]   And that little prayer is very simple.
[00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:32.580]   It's like, "God, I wanna do this for your sake.
[00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:36.540]   "And God, I wanna do it for your honor, and help me."
[00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:39.940]   It's just that simple prayer.
[00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:42.140]   So he start his work in the morning,
[00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:46.680]   pray that prayer.
[00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:49.240]   And then he find that it's helpful for him
[00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:52.160]   to be aware that he is doing everything
[00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:53.860]   and living in the presence of God.
[00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:59.820]   And then he increase it by doing that prayer at noon,
[00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:04.680]   and then in the afternoon.
[00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:07.400]   And then pretty much it becomes his second nature,
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:11.260]   that whenever he does the dishes,
[00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:13.700]   whenever he mopping the floor,
[00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:16.700]   he will pray to God silently, quietly,
[00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:18.660]   and pray that, "God, I wanna live in your presence.
[00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:20.420]   "I wanna do this for your honor."
[00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:24.860]   That book, that secret,
[00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:28.160]   became one of the Christian classics.
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:31.680]   Everyone finds it helpful.
[00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:38.620]   Find rest in every single moment that you can in your day.
[00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:40.820]   Even when you're driving,
[00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:43.660]   even when you're doing your work,
[00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:46.600]   pray that little prayer,
[00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:49.840]   and pray that, "God, I wanna live in your presence.
[00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:51.840]   "Help me to be faithful.
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:53.760]   "Help me to love you more."
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:56.000]   No matter what you do, changing diapers,
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:01.040]   mopping the floor, doing some mundane work,
[00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:03.780]   you can live in the presence of God.
[00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:06.660]   So I wanna invite you to be more faithful,
[00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:09.220]   to really enjoy this sacred time,
[00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:13.980]   one day a week, first day of week.
[00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:16.300]   It's not just coming here to follow the motions
[00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:17.360]   and follow the program,
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:20.260]   but you really come to God himself.
[00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:26.380]   And secondly, on your daily basis, around the clock,
[00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:28.340]   starting tomorrow, Monday,
[00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:32.160]   do the little prayers.
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:34.240]   Live in the presence of God, right?
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:36.760]   Knowing that God is always there with you.
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:38.880]   Let's all pray together.
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:41.360]   Father, we wanna give you thanks
[00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:45.200]   for the fact that you are ever-present,
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:48.440]   the fact that you are everywhere.
[00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:50.760]   You are in the world.
[00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:54.360]   You are especially in our heart.
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:58.400]   And thank you, Jesus, for your cross,
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:02.340]   for the empty tomb that we can be called
[00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:03.500]   your sons and daughters.
[00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:08.380]   Now pray that we will learn how to do Shabbat.
[00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:13.580]   We'll learn every single day how to stop
[00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:16.660]   and to think about you, stop and pray to you.
[00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:20.420]   And help us to learn how to worship you,
[00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:26.380]   one day a week, to cease our works of the six days
[00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:29.220]   and to draw closer to you.
[00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:33.660]   And I pray that we wanna give you thanks
[00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:38.620]   for such a rhythm that you have set up in our life
[00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:42.420]   so that we will run in your order,
[00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:43.620]   we'll follow your order.
[00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:47.620]   And God, be with us and be present with us
[00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:52.260]   so that we'll grow in our relationship with you.
[00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:54.580]   In Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:34:56.380 --> 00:35:00.140]   Well, I'll see you next week, the next Shabbat.
