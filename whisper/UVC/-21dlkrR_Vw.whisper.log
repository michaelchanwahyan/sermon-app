[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.360]   - Well, good morning, everyone.
[00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.040]   It's nice to see everybody up here, from up here again.
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.840]   And I know that Rebecca, my wife, was here just with you
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.560]   all last month for a couple of times, and twice,
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.960]   and in an art workshop.
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.960]   And the first message she gave was--
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.560]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.880]   Was on the topic of the power of storytelling
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.560]   and Jesus being the goat.
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.480]   And her second message was diving into
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.640]   one of the parables of the wheat and tare.
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.060]   And also, she facilitated an art workshop,
[00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.560]   and I really appreciated some of the artwork
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.480]   that she had photos of.
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.740]   And my favorite was one where someone made an ice cream,
[00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.180]   given that's my favorite thing right now.
[00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.880]   Time really flies, because the last time I was up here,
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.940]   I realized when I was preparing for this message
[00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.960]   was actually last October.
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.960]   So it's already been a little over a year.
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.800]   And for that message,
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.980]   I actually prepared one called "Lightning Our Yolks."
[00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.080]   If some of you are here, you remember that in Acts 15,
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.440]   I talked about how we sometimes put on additional
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.600]   individual and corporate yolks on ourselves.
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.160]   And these are the additional spiritual restrictions
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.400]   that we prescribe ourselves,
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.720]   that kind of hinder our spiritual faith journeys.
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.480]   But instead, Jesus prescribes to us
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.320]   that he is lightening our yolks,
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.620]   and that he will give us greater joy and freedom,
[00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.440]   because we can know that we have these lighter loads
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.360]   that we carry, and he's helping us carry them.
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.420]   At the end of the message, I mentioned that
[00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.720]   even though we're afforded greater freedom and greater joy,
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.220]   there's still a yolk that we have to carry.
[00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.640]   A lighter one, but we're still expected to maintain
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.260]   proper conduct, behavior, and live our lives
[00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.180]   that are, in a way, glorifying to him.
[00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.800]   Carrying this yolk, doing this work,
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.460]   still requires a degree of focus, intention, and discipline.
[00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.940]   I really appreciate coming here,
[00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.920]   because Pastor Mark always gives me freedom to choose
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.240]   whatever topic I wanna preach up here.
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.380]   And it wasn't my intention to actually tie in
[00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.980]   what I talk about today with the message
[00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.420]   that I prepared before, but it kinda ties in together.
[00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.500]   So I really kinda like that it worked out this way.
[00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.780]   I've been praying about what message to give,
[00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.320]   and the message today is what I got,
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.700]   and it happens to still connect with what I did last time.
[00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.040]   So anything we do, especially focused work,
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.580]   requires a level of preparation, training,
[00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.020]   and right mindset.
[00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.020]   Our message today comes from 1 Corinthians 9, 24 to 27.
[00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.140]   And the sermon title, as you guys saw,
[00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.400]   is Do You Even Lift, Brah?
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.660]   The passage today is from 1 Corinthians 9, 24 to 27,
[00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:06.940]   and I'll read it.
[00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.520]   I know it's a little bit small for you all,
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.220]   but I'll read it.
[00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.320]   Do you not know that in a race, all the runners run,
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.460]   but only one gets the prize?
[00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.060]   Run in such a way as to get the prize.
[00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.700]   Everyone who competes in the games
[00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.500]   goes into strict training.
[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.660]   They do it to get a crown that will not last,
[00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.900]   but we do it to get a crown that will last forever.
[00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.140]   Therefore, I do not run like someone running aimlessly.
[00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.700]   I do not fight like a boxer beating the air.
[00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.180]   No, I strike a blow to my body and make it my slave
[00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.220]   so that after I preach to others,
[00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.780]   I myself will not be disqualified for the prize.
[00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.740]   In Rebecca's presentation and messages,
[00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.580]   she prepares very beautiful slides.
[00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.260]   I'm sorry, mine will disappoint
[00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.820]   because they're not nearly as elegant.
[00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.060]   Actually, they're the opposite.
[00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.840]   They're very, very crude.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.060]   But I lean more kind of your common pop culture
[00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.860]   cliche visual tools.
[00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.180]   So hopefully some of you will appreciate.
[00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.440]   And I know there's a broad age and generational range here.
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.860]   Some probably as young as high school or college
[00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.340]   and those that might even be retired.
[00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.220]   And so I know that my title requires
[00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.380]   a little bit of explanation for those especially
[00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.380]   that don't know what it actually means.
[00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.420]   The phrase, do you even lift brah?
[00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.220]   Is actually a mocking question used for people
[00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.060]   who attempt to look or act capable in something
[00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.860]   but actually aren't.
[00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.720]   Case in point is someone like this guy, right?
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.720]   I think that he's presenting this persona of a lifter,
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.360]   very athletic, but I think some of us question
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.520]   whether or not he has the ability.
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.820]   It's often used against people who want to give,
[00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.460]   this phrase is often used against people
[00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.300]   who give the impression that they're really strong
[00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.820]   and athletic, but in fact, they look very foolish
[00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.420]   and we kind of quickly see through their kind of facade.
[00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:05.440]   Because those who actually engage in something like lifting
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.440]   or athletic training know that it requires a lot of focus
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.600]   and a lot of preparation and training.
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.560]   I don't know the closest Mandarin translation
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.120]   to this particular phrase, but I know that in Cantonese,
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.840]   there used to be something that a lot of people use
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.020]   in the movies, in Hong Kong movies.
[00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.680]   It's like (speaking in foreign language)
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.380]   and so that question is, do you have the qualifications?
[00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.260]   And actually it kind of points out to someone like,
[00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.000]   you kind of try to look the part of something,
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.640]   but do you actually have the backing, the credentials
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.980]   to support the persona that you're presenting?
[00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:50.480]   When I mention these ideas, I'm sure some of you have
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.280]   some memories that come to mind of your own experiences.
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.000]   In my case, I remember years ago
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.760]   when I was still going to the gym.
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.360]   I don't go to the gym anymore, I have two kids
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.720]   and I have a puppy now, so all I do is just take care
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.240]   of them and that's sufficient enough exercise for me.
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.480]   But I remember that there was a time
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.960]   when I was going to the gym and this was at Export
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.000]   on State Street and I was there for an hour with my friend
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.040]   and I was lifting weights and there was a guy that came in
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.920]   and he had full track suit, he had a headband,
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.440]   he brought his gym bag and he was ready to look like,
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.880]   well he looked like he was ready to lift,
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.640]   but in fact he sat down at the bench press
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.800]   and he pulled out a whole chicken dinner out of his bag
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.340]   with a cup of soda and he just proceeded
[00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.720]   to eat dinner at the gym.
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.400]   For the whole hour I was there,
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.360]   he didn't even do one exercise,
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.920]   he was just sitting and enjoying his meal.
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.360]   So that for me is like the perfect example
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.680]   of when you would use the question, do you even lift, bruh?
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:51.680]   Because this guy is coming in and showing his athleticism,
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.880]   but really there isn't very much of it.
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:01.520]   In our passage, Paul uses the visual image of running
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.880]   and this is a metaphor, an image that connects the idea
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.680]   with our own spiritual journeys, our spiritual walks.
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.720]   He says, do you not know that in a race all runners run,
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.560]   but only one gets the prize?
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.880]   Run in such a way as to get the prize.
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.320]   He's calling us to keep our faith muscles
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:25.040]   well conditioned and activated for the Lord's work
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:28.260]   and for our faith journeys.
[00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:29.760]   Paul highlights that our faith journey
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.760]   is demonstrated through action
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.140]   and not just a cognitive process that happens in our minds.
[00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:39.480]   Living out our faith is more than the mental belief
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:43.760]   that God exists in identifying Jesus as our savior.
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.080]   It requires a manifestation of our faith
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.500]   through our actions.
[00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:52.640]   We're not just thinking about what we know as truth,
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.640]   we're living it out.
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.520]   It's not a basic matter of belief
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:59.280]   through intellectual insight,
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.600]   but it's an actively engaging process
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.440]   and Paul, in our passage, uses this metaphor
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.620]   to connect this for his original audience.
[00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:11.260]   But it also really kind of ties into what we understand
[00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.600]   in our modern times as well.
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:17.080]   Paul's audience is the Corinthian church
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.040]   and the believers are in Corinth,
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:24.720]   which was a major Greek commercial city in his time.
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.240]   The idea of running a race was actually very familiar
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.280]   to them because they had a long history
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:32.240]   of holding what were known as the Isthmian Games.
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.520]   And these were the games that I think
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:36.260]   that our Olympics are actually modeled after.
[00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.200]   These games happened every two years
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.780]   and athletic as well as musical competitors
[00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:44.360]   from all of Greece would descend upon Corinth
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.820]   and compete in honor of Poseidon.
[00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:51.500]   This happened since like 582 BC,
[00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.600]   so by the time Paul was using this example
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.040]   of running a race, people were already familiar
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.360]   with this for centuries.
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.440]   Paul takes an idea that the Corinthians understand
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:05.520]   and uses it to help them visualize
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.560]   a right perspective of Christian living.
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.780]   Paul turns around the idea as well
[00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:13.560]   of this big competition being in honor of Poseidon
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.920]   and instead attributes what we do
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:18.680]   for God's honor and glory and for his service.
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:23.540]   Throughout his letter to the Corinthians,
[00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:27.400]   Paul addresses a laundry list of specific matters
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.960]   that range from addressing disorderly church conduct
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.180]   and leadership to divisions,
[00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:35.640]   to sexual immorality in the church.
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:40.360]   He addresses things like lawsuits among believers,
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:44.320]   divorce, sexual immorality.
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.880]   And I mentioned before that Corinth
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:50.480]   was this important city of commerce in Corinth.
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:54.820]   And to make a comparison, it's not unlike Hong Kong
[00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:55.820]   or New York or London.
[00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:59.020]   It was a major port city where there was a lot of trade.
[00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:00.500]   And with trade in these places,
[00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:03.220]   it wasn't just the trade of physical goods,
[00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:06.020]   but trade of physical ideas and culture
[00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:08.180]   and beliefs as well.
[00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:11.220]   And with any big city, we know there's big city problems.
[00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:15.020]   And Corinth was definitely experiencing this as well.
[00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:18.440]   The church was, by comparison to the Jewish churches
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:21.220]   in kind of the Israeli regions,
[00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:24.060]   not as grounded in moralistic traditions
[00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:27.120]   and that culture that they had for a very long time.
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:30.720]   And so with a younger church like the Corinthian church,
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.440]   you have leaders and followers that are
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.680]   just kind of understanding the outside world
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:37.520]   and are not as mature.
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.460]   And they're bringing in the ideas that they understand
[00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:43.060]   from their usual conditioning into the church.
[00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:46.020]   And so Paul is writing the church to address
[00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.780]   the deficiencies in their theology
[00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:49.100]   and their practices.
[00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:56.260]   Paul addressed topics that are very much practical.
[00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.900]   And he stares away from the idea, again,
[00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:01.660]   of a passive idea of our faith
[00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:05.260]   and just understanding it as a concept.
[00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.360]   His belief was demonstrated by him.
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:10.460]   Well, like looking at Abraham,
[00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:13.780]   our original kind of forefather of the faith,
[00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:18.500]   we know that God credited his faith as righteousness to him.
[00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:21.020]   But this wasn't just him believing.
[00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:22.780]   It was backed by action.
[00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:26.500]   And we know that Abraham left everything that he knew.
[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.420]   He left his family, his home,
[00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:31.060]   and he went to an unknown place
[00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:34.920]   where God even called him to sacrifice his son.
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:37.260]   And he was obedient.
[00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:41.260]   So he didn't just believe.
[00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.180]   He demonstrated his belief through action.
[00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:46.140]   And what I'm saying is that genuine faith
[00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:48.660]   is exhibited through consistent action.
[00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:51.940]   And this is a way that we serve and glorify God.
[00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:55.260]   The race that Paul refers to
[00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.140]   is his race to fulfill the mission of God,
[00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:00.100]   to proclaim the gospel to as many people as he can
[00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.260]   and to save as many as he can.
[00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.300]   And I'm not trying to present the idea
[00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:07.780]   that, oh, we're trying to earn our way to salvation.
[00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:10.940]   We are justified as soon as we believe.
[00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:15.540]   This is a demonstration of what real faith is
[00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:17.620]   because it's consistent with how we act.
[00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:18.920]   It's not just what we say.
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:22.020]   I think the example of loving someone
[00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:24.620]   is a very helpful one in showing this.
[00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:27.860]   Authentic love is reinforced by how you express it.
[00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:31.020]   So if I tell my children that I love them,
[00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:33.860]   but I don't spend time with them to do the things they like,
[00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:36.580]   I don't support them, I don't encourage them,
[00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:39.820]   I can't say that my love is really genuine.
[00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:42.980]   In the same way, thinking that just belief in God is enough
[00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:45.140]   is not enough.
[00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:47.380]   We have to demonstrate it through action
[00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:50.100]   because even Satan and the demons believe in God
[00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:50.980]   and they fear him.
[00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:54.400]   If we're looking at the act of running
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:56.700]   as a metaphor for our faith journey,
[00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:00.780]   there are specific spiritual practices in our lives
[00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:03.900]   that then represent our spiritual muscles, so to speak.
[00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:09.540]   These are our actions like our prayer life,
[00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:13.020]   our devotions, our grounding ourselves in God's word.
[00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:17.300]   And like muscles, these areas need to be developed over time
[00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:20.780]   and conditioned as well so that we can run like an athlete,
[00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:23.980]   so that we can do the work God calls us to do.
[00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:27.460]   In our physical bodies, when our bodies are not engaged
[00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:31.380]   in activity and using our muscles, do you know what happens?
[00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:33.580]   There's something called atrophy that happens.
[00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:36.660]   The muscle starts to weaken and it starts to diminish.
[00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:40.620]   And because the body deems these muscles as non-essential
[00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:41.940]   'cause we're not using them,
[00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:43.920]   it just degenerates and fades away.
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:47.100]   This is especially visible, I think, in older folks
[00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.640]   where they're just less active and so their muscles
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.460]   begin to shrink and they just become smaller.
[00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:53.460]   But this can happen with younger folks too.
[00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:56.460]   If any of you have broken a limb, like an arm or a leg,
[00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:59.740]   and you put a cast on, and then at the end of your healing
[00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:02.140]   and you take away the cast, that arm or that leg
[00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:04.380]   on one side is gonna be smaller than the one
[00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:06.740]   on the other side because it's atrophied.
[00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:11.500]   And likewise, with our spiritual condition,
[00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:15.060]   our spiritual practices, if we don't keep engaged
[00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:17.500]   in things like reading God's word
[00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.460]   and grounding ourselves in prayer and fellowship
[00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:22.180]   and these type of actions, we also will begin to
[00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:24.980]   kind of degenerate in our spiritual strength
[00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:26.220]   and our spiritual muscle.
[00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:33.340]   When we engage in training and keeping ourselves
[00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:36.880]   sharp and ready, we'll be able to handle times of stress
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:40.420]   and even take advantage of times of opportunity.
[00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:42.460]   There's something called muscle memory.
[00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:44.500]   Some of you might know it if you guys are athletes.
[00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:48.140]   And it happens where when through repeated training
[00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:51.220]   of something, an action, your body just begins
[00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.700]   to know what to do in specific situations
[00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:56.180]   where you trained it to do something.
[00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:59.780]   Because your body reverts back to its conditioning
[00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:02.700]   when you might not be thinking about how to react
[00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:04.460]   in a certain situation.
[00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:07.180]   This is why athletes and soldiers train
[00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:08.820]   and train and train.
[00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:11.860]   Because in times of pressure and urgency,
[00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:15.360]   when we don't have the time to think about a certain action
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:18.460]   we wanna take in a situation, our body naturally,
[00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:21.260]   intuitively responds in the way that we've trained it.
[00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:26.740]   Likewise, as we engage in prayer and worship
[00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:29.240]   and grounding ourselves in God's word,
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.180]   when there are times of crises,
[00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:34.140]   we will naturally go to do what we've been training
[00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:35.820]   ourselves to do.
[00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:39.140]   We don't think maybe, we don't have the ability to think
[00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:40.620]   'cause we might be so stressed out,
[00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:42.740]   but we will naturally gravitate toward that type
[00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:46.420]   of behavior and why training is so important.
[00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:48.040]   And it's not just in times of crises.
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:50.860]   It could be training for times of opportunity.
[00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:52.260]   So let's say like you're on the street,
[00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.540]   you're at a restaurant, you meet a friend of a friend
[00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:56.260]   and they find out you're a Christian.
[00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:59.380]   They want to know more about your faith and what it means.
[00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:03.580]   If you have not been doing the practices that I mentioned,
[00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:06.060]   you may not have the ability to truly,
[00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:10.420]   in a well-fashioned way, articulate what the faith
[00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:12.900]   that you believe in actually means and is.
[00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:16.620]   And so the training is also to take advantage of opportunity.
[00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:21.340]   We need to remember that these spiritual muscles we develop
[00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:26.340]   serve the purpose of loving our God and loving our neighbors
[00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:29.900]   for advancing God's mission, his church,
[00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:32.620]   and to build up our fellow brothers and sisters.
[00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:36.500]   So these muscles that I'm talking about
[00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:40.020]   aren't for the vanity of our own self-righteousness.
[00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:41.540]   It's not for us to look in the mirror
[00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:42.760]   and to feel good about ourselves
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:44.780]   or to present ourselves to others.
[00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:46.620]   It's all for a purpose.
[00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:49.140]   And that purpose is to advance God's kingdom
[00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:51.940]   and to serve him and to build up his church.
[00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:54.540]   We don't engage in action for ourselves
[00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:57.060]   or for action for action's sake.
[00:16:57.060 --> 00:17:05.980]   So the second part of 1 Corinthians 9, 24,
[00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:10.100]   Paul says, "Run in such a way as to get the prize."
[00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:12.880]   There's a particular direction, a trajectory,
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:16.500]   and goal we're supposed to train and aim for
[00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:18.600]   when we're doing our training and our conditioning
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:20.540]   and our running of the race.
[00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:24.140]   Paul runs with a strong strategic purpose in his mind.
[00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:27.780]   As he says, "I do not run like someone running aimlessly."
[00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:30.380]   There's an objective to his actions.
[00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:32.060]   The problem is that we can get trapped
[00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:34.660]   in the cycle of keeping ourselves busy
[00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:36.040]   and doing very churchy things
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:41.040]   because we feel that that equals making progress.
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:44.820]   And like this example of the hamster,
[00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:46.220]   like he's just running and running and running
[00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:47.860]   and probably feels like he's going somewhere,
[00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:49.660]   but he's really going nowhere.
[00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:51.340]   And a lot of organizations today
[00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:53.020]   and in a lot of work meetings,
[00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:56.020]   they kind of go on and on
[00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:58.980]   and you might have meeting after meeting after meeting.
[00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:01.320]   And there are times when I've been in work
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:03.740]   where I feel like it's death by meeting.
[00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:05.820]   Like there's just meeting, meeting, meeting.
[00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:10.220]   And sometimes people feel like just because you're meeting
[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:12.180]   and meeting for long periods of time,
[00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:13.540]   that there's progress.
[00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:16.300]   But that's not true.
[00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:19.300]   I mean, there are probably some of you that have been in,
[00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:22.140]   I know Pastor Mark has agendaless meetings.
[00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:24.420]   And this could be for work and it could be for church
[00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:26.240]   and it goes for hours and hours and hours.
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.060]   At the end of it, you're exhausted and you wonder,
[00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:29.880]   what did we actually accomplish?
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:31.100]   It doesn't seem like we accomplished anything,
[00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:34.900]   but some folks feel like by the pure fact
[00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:37.500]   that we're together, that some progress is made.
[00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:42.500]   And we need to not confuse the flurry of movement
[00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:46.240]   or busyness as actual progress.
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:49.580]   Paul lays out a very specific goal in his running.
[00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:51.660]   His main purpose is to advance the gospel
[00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:53.620]   to as many as he can.
[00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:54.940]   He discusses this in the section
[00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:56.420]   right before our focus passage here.
[00:18:56.420 --> 00:19:00.900]   So we're focusing on 1 Corinthians 9, 24 to 27,
[00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:04.340]   but in verses 19 to 23, I'm not gonna put it up,
[00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:05.280]   but I'll just read it out loud.
[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:08.060]   He says, "Though I am free and belong to no one,
[00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:10.300]   "I have made myself a slave to everyone,
[00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:12.200]   "to win as many as possible.
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.980]   "To the Jews, I became like a Jew to win the Jews.
[00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:18.380]   "To those under the law, I became like one under the law,
[00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:20.000]   "though I myself am not under the law,
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.340]   "so as to win those under the law.
[00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:24.100]   "To those not having the law,
[00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:26.000]   "I became like one not having the law,
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.960]   "though I am not free from God's law,
[00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:29.920]   "but am under Christ's law,
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:32.300]   "so as to win those not having the law.
[00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:34.860]   "To the weak, I became weak to win the weak.
[00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:37.340]   "I have become all things to all people,
[00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:40.420]   "so that by all possible means, I might save some.
[00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:42.640]   "I do all this for the sake of the gospel
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.600]   "that I may share in its blessings."
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:48.340]   Paul is saying that he will do whatever it takes
[00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:51.100]   to achieve his goal, to proclaim God's word,
[00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:53.600]   and save as many people as he can.
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:56.240]   He's willing to become a slave and serve.
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:00.080]   He's willing to become a Jew and take on Jewish traditions.
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:03.040]   He's willing to become weak and forgo the privilege
[00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:07.020]   that he has as a Roman citizen in his particular context.
[00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:10.500]   He's willing to become one apart from the law,
[00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:15.500]   not having the law, and eat and engage in activities
[00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:19.460]   with Gentiles, something that the Jews found repulsive.
[00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:21.820]   So he acts in various ways so that he can relate
[00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:26.000]   to his target audience, and not just with words.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.160]   Paul's purpose adheres to what Jesus makes clear
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:31.980]   for all of us as our purpose in our spiritual lives
[00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:33.180]   in Matthew 28.
[00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:35.280]   And this is, I'm sure, overused,
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:38.740]   but this is the great commission that Jesus leaves us.
[00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:41.820]   He says, "Therefore go and make disciples of all nations,
[00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:43.780]   "baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son
[00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:45.580]   "and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them
[00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:47.980]   "to obey everything I have commanded you.
[00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:49.280]   "And surely I am with you always
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:50.840]   "to the very end of the age."
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:54.580]   So this is a command not just for Paul,
[00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:57.140]   but actually for all of us.
[00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:59.300]   Paul advocates engaging in action
[00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:01.780]   and engaging in action with purpose.
[00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:11.540]   Paul advocates this because also, not just with purpose,
[00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:14.980]   we also need a sense of urgency in our action.
[00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:20.260]   It's not okay to just participate in the race,
[00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:23.220]   uncaring of whether one actually aims to finish
[00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:26.180]   or cross the finish line.
[00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:29.980]   He says to run in such a way as to get the prize.
[00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:34.980]   In the ancient races, there was no second or third place.
[00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:37.220]   There can only be one.
[00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:40.060]   And maybe someone can appreciate that movie quote.
[00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:43.300]   But imagine that there's competition
[00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:44.540]   when you're running the race.
[00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:45.860]   No one waits on you.
[00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:49.340]   You have to push yourself,
[00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:51.700]   and there's a sense of urgency in all of that.
[00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:53.240]   You have to push your hardest.
[00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:56.820]   And these days we have, and I guess my children aren't here,
[00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:59.080]   these days we have diminished the need
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:02.320]   for competitive urgency in our society,
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:05.560]   especially for the sake of not hurting children's feelings.
[00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:08.080]   There are awards for everything.
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:10.440]   There's participation awards for just someone
[00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:12.800]   who participates and shows up.
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:14.520]   And everybody is crowned a winner.
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:16.800]   You might get a medal and a trophy.
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:19.260]   And I think that that bleeds into
[00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:22.000]   how our spiritual activities and lives are.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.760]   It seems enough to just show up,
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:27.120]   even when we're not fully involved.
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:31.440]   And sadly, I think that breeds spiritual mediocrity.
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:35.100]   Regularly attending church and volunteering are empty
[00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:38.520]   if our daily life does not reflect Christian behavior,
[00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:41.480]   and there are no efforts to be made
[00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:42.920]   to advance God's mission.
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:46.060]   Without the drive to strive,
[00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:48.200]   I think people fall into the danger
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:51.600]   of stopping short of completing what their holy duties are.
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:55.400]   I think the aspiration of people working hard
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:59.000]   and retiring early is also a very damaging narrative
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.400]   for people to follow,
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:02.660]   especially when it bleeds into how we behave.
[00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:05.360]   Even amongst believers,
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:07.920]   there's this aspiration to retire in our 50s
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:11.080]   and maybe in our 60s at the earliest.
[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:13.600]   And folks dream about time they're gonna spend
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:17.080]   on the golf course or on cruises they're gonna go on,
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:18.100]   vacations they're gonna take.
[00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:22.120]   But this is, in my opinion, a very modern notion.
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:24.760]   We have the luxury now to actually consider
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:27.940]   this more leisurely lifestyle in our later stages of life,
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.520]   when we couldn't do that before.
[00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:33.900]   But I don't think that's actually a very biblical notion.
[00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:38.320]   And despite modern advances in productivity
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.980]   and healthcare and safety in the world,
[00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:44.040]   there's still many problems where Christians
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:47.560]   are called to answer those issues,
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:52.560]   and where the gospel and Christian work is needed.
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:54.840]   Now, I'm not saying that we should maintain
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:57.080]   the same level of intensity throughout our lives
[00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:58.440]   and how we do God's work,
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:02.600]   but we're still meant to just keep our eyes on the prize,
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.480]   to kind of cross that finish line,
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:05.880]   really until the day we die.
[00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:09.780]   I had a friend that used to always say,
[00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:13.680]   I'll rest when I die, and he was a ministry worker.
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:18.300]   And I think that is probably the more biblical thing
[00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:20.680]   to have in mind when we're actually thinking about
[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:23.940]   how we proceed with the later stages of our lives.
[00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:26.380]   So God deserves our first fruit efforts
[00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:27.560]   in every part of our lives.
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:31.200]   And we don't need to officially win to be the winner,
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:33.120]   but we have to be in it to win it.
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:35.360]   We have to have a winner's mindset
[00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:37.420]   where we're aiming for a goal,
[00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:41.420]   we're pushing our highest, and we actually go for it.
[00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:44.000]   And that only happens with a sense of urgency
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.500]   to advance God's kingdom.
[00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:48.460]   Our faith requires action.
[00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:53.460]   That action or these actions require purpose,
[00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:55.800]   a sense of purpose, frame with purpose,
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:59.280]   and there has to be a level of urgency and immediacy
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:03.400]   to how we approach that work.
[00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:05.920]   Now, this is a picture of the tortoise and the hare,
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:09.600]   and it's a very famous fable that I assume all of you know.
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:13.400]   We need to be like the tortoise in the fable here,
[00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:16.320]   where we're constantly pursuing our goal.
[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:18.860]   Slow, well, not slow because he's slow,
[00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:21.520]   but steady wins the race.
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:24.720]   Whereas the hare here is actually just relaxing
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:27.960]   because he's relying on his talent and his abilities,
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:30.360]   but he's procrastinating, he's lazy.
[00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:34.160]   We operate in a world now where we have control
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:37.100]   over so many aspects of our lives.
[00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:40.240]   We can control so many things, even from our smartwatches.
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:44.000]   And we think that we are the ones in control,
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.280]   even of how we handle our kingdom responsibilities
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:49.360]   that the Lord has given us.
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:54.200]   Sometimes the problem is that it's not that,
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:57.560]   you know, we're slow in getting to the race
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:00.760]   or slow in the pace of our race.
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:03.240]   We haven't even started the race.
[00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:07.240]   And the most blatant experience that I've had
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:09.680]   is when I used to serve as a volunteer
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:12.160]   at a MBA campus ministry.
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:15.080]   And I overheard a student speaking to another student,
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:17.040]   and he was telling this other student
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:20.500]   that he's gonna get this very lucrative job,
[00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:22.840]   and that he's gonna make up to $10 million,
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:25.600]   and when he does, that's when he's gonna retire early
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:27.300]   and then start serving the Lord.
[00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:31.120]   He thought that it was appropriate to wait
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:34.540]   and allocate time later on in his life to serve the Lord,
[00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:36.280]   and there was no immediacy,
[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:40.000]   and there was no need to start his race anytime soon.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.160]   You know, this reminds me of the passage
[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:45.560]   in James chapter four, 13 to 15, where James says,
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:48.240]   "Now listen, you who say today or tomorrow
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:49.940]   "we will go to this or that city,
[00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:53.300]   "spend a year there, carry on business, and make money.
[00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:54.180]   "Why?
[00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:56.720]   "You don't even know what will happen tomorrow.
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:57.940]   "What is your life?
[00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:00.220]   "You are a mist that appears for a little while
[00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:01.800]   "and then vanishes.
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:04.560]   "Instead, you ought to say, if it is the Lord's will,
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:06.980]   "we will live and do this or that."
[00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:09.920]   In contrast to the MBA student,
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:13.840]   one of my inspirations is Dr. Stuart Wu.
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:16.380]   I don't know if some of you might know him,
[00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:19.460]   but he's probably one of the most dedicated
[00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:21.780]   and faithful servants I've ever met in my life.
[00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:23.220]   And I first encountered Dr. Wu
[00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:26.160]   when I was doing a short-term medical mission
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:28.160]   in Zhongshan, China.
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:30.980]   He's a retired surgeon, and he would regularly,
[00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:35.140]   more than once a year, go out to remote parts of China
[00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:37.660]   where we would have to track mountainous areas
[00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:40.620]   to get to people and provide them medical care
[00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:42.140]   and also to share the gospel.
[00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:45.220]   He did this into his late 80s,
[00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:47.940]   until he was 87 and then passed away.
[00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:49.940]   And he never made a complaint that I knew of
[00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:51.180]   when he did this.
[00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:54.060]   And so, I was less than half his age.
[00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:56.780]   I was probably a third of his age when I first met him.
[00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:59.980]   And I didn't have nearly as much stamina
[00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:02.680]   and as much zeal as he did.
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:04.640]   And I wish to be like him,
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:07.640]   because he kind of constantly had this mindset
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:09.980]   of finishing the race and finishing well,
[00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:12.140]   even until his late 80s.
[00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:16.380]   Nope, that's not it.
[00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:22.380]   I know this last slide says active rest,
[00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:27.780]   but actually, my focus pivoted toward
[00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:30.500]   making sure that we have guardrails.
[00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:33.980]   As we run the race and start doing God's work
[00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:36.860]   to spread his good news and make disciples,
[00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:38.740]   we need to make sure that we don't take
[00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:41.460]   an end justifies the means approach.
[00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:45.140]   And that how we behave in the process
[00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:46.940]   of reaching that goal matters as much
[00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:49.540]   as actually reaching that goal.
[00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:52.660]   So, even if there are great results
[00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:55.500]   of people coming to the church, of the church growing,
[00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:59.480]   it doesn't give you a pass on how you act
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:01.900]   in the way getting there.
[00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:04.140]   The Lord cares as much about that journey
[00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:08.740]   as he does about the end goal that you're striving for.
[00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:10.460]   You know, the last part of this passage,
[00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:12.720]   Paul emphasizes that he makes sure
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.580]   that he's not disqualified in his attempt
[00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:17.320]   to obtain the prize by making sure
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:19.480]   that he keeps his body in check.
[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:23.700]   In verse 27, he says, "No, I strike a blow to my body
[00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:27.440]   "and make it my slave, so that after I preach to others,
[00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:30.800]   "I myself will not be disqualified for the prize."
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:32.060]   I believe that he's actually alluding
[00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:36.400]   to keeping material and physical temptations at bay.
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:37.820]   Because earlier in Corinthians,
[00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:39.540]   he had addressed the audience to flee
[00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:42.220]   from sexual immorality in chapter six.
[00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:43.660]   And I think that he's alluding to this
[00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:45.660]   when he's talking about making sure
[00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:47.020]   that he's not disqualified.
[00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:54.340]   He makes sure that as he's fulfilling the work of God,
[00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:56.940]   that he's not discredited and doesn't discredit
[00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:59.940]   the Lord's work by his behavior.
[00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:03.300]   Sadly, in recent years, we've seen a lot of church leaders,
[00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:06.660]   even in our region, fall to sexual sin.
[00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:11.660]   And this has had severe impact on the churches themselves,
[00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:14.700]   as well as people coming to the church.
[00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:17.500]   And this is what we want to stay away from.
[00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:21.380]   And it may not be such a blatant sin as sexual immorality.
[00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:23.380]   It could be an arrogant attitude.
[00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:25.820]   It could be poor financial stewardship.
[00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:27.780]   It could be a lack of empathy for the people
[00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:30.300]   that we're actually trying to target.
[00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:32.660]   In my devotions recently,
[00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:35.980]   I'm now finishing the book of Deuteronomy.
[00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:37.700]   At the end of Deuteronomy,
[00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:41.780]   Moses is getting ready to go up to Mount Nebo and to die.
[00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:45.060]   And he will never be able to cross into the promised land.
[00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:47.100]   He gets a view of the promised land,
[00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:48.860]   but he's not allowed to cross it.
[00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:51.620]   And this happened because he actually
[00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:55.540]   did not follow God's exact orders.
[00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:59.060]   Even though he is a champion and a hero of the Bible,
[00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:01.700]   and he saved the Israelites from slavery,
[00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:04.060]   and took him into, or got him ready
[00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:05.720]   to go into the promised land,
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:07.520]   the Lord prevents him from going in,
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:10.560]   because instead of whispering to a rock
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:14.420]   to call forth water, he knocks it twice in anger.
[00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:16.560]   And this was enough for the Lord
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:19.020]   to actually prevent him and penalize him
[00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:21.780]   from going into the promised land.
[00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:24.380]   How we uphold ourselves during our work
[00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:28.580]   is as important as accomplishing the end result.
[00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:32.240]   It's not only about the end point, but how we get there.
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:33.580]   Not just about the finish line,
[00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:35.600]   but how we run the race itself.
[00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:41.960]   So, I ask all of you, do you even lift, bruh?
[00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:46.360]   If you have been diligently doing God's work,
[00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:50.360]   keep at it, and remember that we're in a continuous marathon
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:53.760]   that requires training, diligence, dedication.
[00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:56.680]   But also, the point that I want to highlight,
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:57.880]   and said that I changed,
[00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:00.560]   was also to make sure that we rest.
[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:05.480]   We, I think, especially as immigrants,
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:06.440]   or children of immigrants,
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:09.160]   there's this very strong work ethic that we develop.
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:12.000]   And sometimes we bring that also into our faith,
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.320]   and we don't rest.
[00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:15.520]   And the Lord prescribed the Sabbath for us,
[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:18.640]   so that we can make sure that we rest as well,
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:21.520]   and are recharged so we can run even stronger,
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:23.440]   and for God.
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:26.600]   Continuously train yourselves,
[00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:28.700]   keep yourselves sharp and ready,
[00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:32.040]   and your muscles going, you know,
[00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:35.200]   reading the word, praying, being in fellowship,
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:38.440]   serving actively in your communities,
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:40.100]   and then keeping yourselves accountable
[00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:42.080]   while in fellowship with others.
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:45.000]   And for those of you who are honest and say,
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.800]   no, I don't lift, now's the time to start,
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:53.300]   because there is, it's never too late to get started.
[00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:55.760]   And it's important to begin when you know
[00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:58.320]   that God's calling you to his great commission.
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:04.200]   So, go run the race, and do your part in God's great work,
[00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:07.560]   and get those muscles going, and well conditioned.
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:08.860]   Let me end this in prayer.
[00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:13.300]   Heavenly Father, thank you for this opportunity
[00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:17.640]   to preach your word, and to understand that our faith
[00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:20.480]   is one that is demonstrated through action.
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:23.760]   And Paul uses the visual of running a race.
[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:25.400]   I pray that for each one of us,
[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:28.340]   you help us to understand the areas in our lives
[00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:30.440]   where we need to be better conditioned,
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:34.040]   or to start conditioning, and to operate these muscles,
[00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:37.040]   these spiritual muscles, so that we can be ready
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:38.760]   for your work that you've called us to,
[00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:43.760]   to advance your kingdom, and to make disciples
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:45.400]   for your kingdom.
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:46.800]   In your name we pray, amen.
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:49.800]   - Amen.
