[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.840]   Here we go.
[00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.480]   Mark, it is good to see you.
[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.980]   Happy New Year to everyone.
[00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.560]   For those who are here, it is great to be back.
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.840]   For those who are online, it is great to be back.
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.860]   For those who are not familiar, my name is Tommy Lee.
[00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.160]   And I get a chance during the week, actually,
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.200]   when it's quiet here, my office is right here
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.480]   because we get a chance to share some space
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.580]   with Urban Voice and they have graciously,
[00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.400]   continuously allowed us to work here during the week.
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.200]   Born and raised here in the Chicago area,
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.280]   born in Bridgeport, born in Chinatown,
[00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.400]   and now I live right over on 35th in Indiana.
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.960]   And so a lot of times, I've been working
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.320]   on this series on Elijah.
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.000]   And so I wanna go through a passage
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.040]   that we looked at the last time I was here.
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.420]   I wanna at least close the loop and talk through
[00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.400]   some of the lessons that we learned.
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.560]   Then I wanna do one more at 1 Kings 19,
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.040]   and then we're done with the story of Elijah.
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.440]   And Elijah is this one guy who's really unimpressive.
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.800]   He's not someone who kinda, someone that you sit there,
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.360]   he's not David, he's not Solomon, he's not even Saul,
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.000]   he's not Peter, he's kinda rough around the edges.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.360]   He comes from a rural area.
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.440]   Scripture calls him, he's this Tishbit from Tishbe
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.760]   in Gilead, as 1 Kings 17 tells us.
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.640]   He's this guy who just comes out of nowhere.
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.440]   And look, I mean, the author even tells us he's from Gilead
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.560]   because we don't even know what a Tishbit is.
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.280]   We don't even know what Tishbit is.
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.000]   We know it's somewhere in Gilead,
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.440]   and that's what 1 Kings 17 tells us.
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.960]   And so he comes out of nowhere in 1 Kings 17,
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.600]   and he gets a meeting with the king,
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.060]   King Ahab of the Northern Kingdom.
[00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.520]   As we talked about the last time I was here,
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.200]   and we looked at 1 Kings 17, post-Solomon,
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.920]   post-David, post-Saul, the kingdom of Israel
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.080]   was split into two parts.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.520]   You had a northern part, northern kingdom,
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.940]   which was called Judah, and the southern part,
[00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.520]   which was called Israel.
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.260]   Israel was the site of the Babylonian invasions.
[00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.120]   That was where, when you look at Nehemiah, Ezra,
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.280]   that's where the story takes place.
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.840]   Our story with Elijah takes place actually
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.200]   right in the northern kingdom.
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.920]   And out of the northern kingdom,
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.920]   there's 19 kings who ruled for a long time post-Solomon.
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.440]   And scripture tells us all 19 kings
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.940]   were evil in the eyes of the Lord.
[00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.580]   None of them were good.
[00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.420]   All of them were bad.
[00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.440]   But the king that we're looking at today
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.520]   during the time of Elijah was King Ahab.
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.840]   He was the worst of the worst of all of the kings.
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.000]   But ironically, he actually was not the worst.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.480]   His wife, Queen Jezebel, actually ends up
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.120]   being the villain of the story, as you will see,
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.080]   throughout 17, 18, and 19, the first kings.
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.080]   And so this guy, Elijah, this Tishbit the Tishbi in Gilead
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.720]   gets a meeting with King Ahab.
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.240]   How this real guy gets a meeting with the king,
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.560]   we don't know.
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.200]   But he shows up one day and he gets a meeting with the king
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.800]   and he tells them and the king this,
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.600]   "Neither dew nor rain except by my word."
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.400]   He predicts a drought.
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.620]   He says, "You will not have dew, you will not have rain,
[00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.160]   "and it'll last for three and a half years."
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.920]   And he tells them that my motivation is
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.040]   the God before whom I stand.
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.800]   That's why I'm doing all these things.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.800]   I'm doing it on behalf of the God before whom I stand.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.060]   And so from that point on, later on,
[00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.640]   once he says that to the king,
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.600]   he then ushers him over to Cherith.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.480]   God says to him, "Go to Cherith."
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.920]   And he walks over to Cherith.
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.840]   And therefore, now he just doesn't,
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.120]   he lives there for at least a year
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.000]   or maybe a long number of months,
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.120]   not definitely, not a couple weeks,
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.840]   where scripture tells us he's fed by the ravens
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.720]   and he is drinking from the brook over in Cherith.
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.320]   Soon after, the brook dries up in Cherith,
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.760]   and God tells him, "I want you to go to Zarephath."
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.040]   And it's a hundred miles walking.
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.360]   By the way, it's the birthplace of Queen Jezebel,
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.640]   who is the villain and the queen of this entire story,
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:26.460]   married to Ahab.
[00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.680]   "Go, walk over to Zarephath,
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.560]   "and there you will find a widow."
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.520]   And he comes across this widow and she's picking up sticks.
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.560]   And this widow is picking up sticks and he approaches her,
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.240]   and she says to him, "Look, whatever you need,
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.760]   "I don't have anything.
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.200]   "I'm picking up sticks.
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.800]   "I have a little flour, a little oil.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.460]   "I'm gonna mix it with water.
[00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.420]   "I'm gonna make some bread,
[00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.520]   "and then my son and I are gonna die.
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.540]   "And we're just gonna eat and die.
[00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.260]   "That's it, we have nothing.
[00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.240]   "So Lord, you made me walk a hundred miles
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.320]   "to Zarephath for this, yes?"
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.080]   The Lord knows where you are.
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.120]   The Lord knows what you need.
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.320]   The Lord knows where you're going.
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.460]   That's the key that Elijah had to learn.
[00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.520]   The God before whom I stand, that's my motivation.
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.400]   Go to Zarephath, go to Cherith, all of those things.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.480]   We follow the Lord because one, he knows where we are,
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.420]   he knows what we need, and he knows where we're going.
[00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.840]   It doesn't go according to plan.
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.400]   It may not be where we wanna go.
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.120]   It may not be what we think that we need,
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.960]   but the Lord knows what we need,
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.520]   where we're going, and where we are.
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.760]   Later on, stories, his son dies and all that other stuff,
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.000]   and now there's a miracle that performs,
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.440]   and now today in 1 Kings 7, 18,
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.000]   which some of you guys who have been here have heard,
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.160]   and so we're gonna go through that story one more time,
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.580]   is the showdown and the battle at Mount Carmel.
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.240]   And so now it's been three and a half years.
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.120]   The drought is finally over.
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.880]   And 1 Kings 18 tells us,
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.320]   "After many days, the word of the Lord came to Elijah
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.220]   "in the third year, saying, 'Go, show yourself to Ahab,
[00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.800]   "'and I will send rain upon the earth.'"
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:29.800]   After three and a half years, go to Ahab, the drought is over.
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.060]   So Elijah went to show himself to Ahab.
[00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:37.440]   Now, the famine was very severe in Samaria.
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.480]   Samaria is the capital city of the northern kingdom
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.220]   where Ahab has his kingdom.
[00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:47.640]   The famine is very severe, the drought is very severe.
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:52.640]   It's been three and a half years of no water.
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.720]   And there later on, there's Obadiah,
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.200]   we don't have time to go through that,
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.560]   that's the chief of staff, his conversation, Obadiah.
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:04.560]   And so now he gets to Ahab and he proposes a challenge.
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:09.400]   Ahab, we're gonna meet at Mount Carmel.
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:15.160]   You bring all your prophets, Abau and Asherah.
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:19.020]   I will bring my God and we're gonna meet here
[00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:22.160]   and we're gonna call upon the name of the Lord
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.300]   and whoever, whatever happens, if the Lord brings fire,
[00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:29.400]   whichever God, whether it's Abau or my God brings fire,
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.260]   that is the true God, what do you think?
[00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.240]   Ahab says, I like this idea.
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:40.240]   You have one God, I have 450, let's do it.
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:46.240]   So they came together and they meet at Mount Carmel.
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:50.980]   450 prophets, Abau and Asherah shows up.
[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:55.700]   Elijah shows up and all of Israel, because they're curious,
[00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:57.200]   they wanna know what happens.
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:02.000]   They all show up and here's what he says.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.120]   So Ahab sent to all the people of Israel
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.060]   and gathered the prophets together at Mount Carmel.
[00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:13.040]   This is verse 20, chapter 18.
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.800]   And Elijah came near to all the people and said,
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.920]   "How long will you go limping
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:21.520]   "between two different opinions?
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.700]   "If the Lord is God, follow him.
[00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:27.820]   "But if Baal, then follow him."
[00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:33.720]   And the people did not answer him a word.
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:37.300]   The Israelites sat there and stood there.
[00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:40.440]   They had no response.
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:43.800]   They did not answer him a word.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.520]   One of the things that we talked about,
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.360]   and there's two things that I wanted to touch base
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.960]   on the second part, is are we limping
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.980]   between two different opinions?
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:56.060]   As Christ followers, as Christians,
[00:08:56.060 --> 00:09:00.320]   are we limping through two different opinions?
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.580]   Let me give you two illustrations of what that means
[00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.940]   for us in our context.
[00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:07.000]   There's the first one, there's more the black
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.440]   and white version of it, right?
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.600]   In terms of limping between two different opinions.
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.380]   The first one is that we limp between following Christ
[00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:17.160]   and we limp between the world.
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.000]   It's black and white.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.380]   We have one foot following Christ, we're all in.
[00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:24.920]   We're all in in terms of following Christ.
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:28.460]   But there's another part of our life
[00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:32.140]   where we're attracted by what the world offers.
[00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:37.020]   We're attracted by the power, the influence,
[00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:40.620]   the money, the wealth, the promises.
[00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:43.660]   We limp between following Christ
[00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:46.480]   and following what the world has to offer.
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:51.000]   Because that was Ahab and Jezebel's problem.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.360]   They wanted the prosperity and fertility
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.060]   which they believed that Baal could offer them.
[00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:01.880]   For us as Christians, we want what the world has to offer
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:05.080]   because it's the money, the relationship,
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:08.940]   the job, the status that we believe
[00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:11.880]   is the answer to all of our problems.
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:15.080]   That's what Judas believed.
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.400]   That's why he turned on Jesus.
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.960]   That's what David believed
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.400]   and that's why he made the decisions
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:23.760]   when he saw Bathsheba, he wanted Bathsheba.
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:26.540]   That's what Solomon believed and all of his wisdom,
[00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:28.760]   the wisest of all the kings,
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:33.340]   fell into a lust of women
[00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:36.840]   because for him, that gave him fulfillment.
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:41.960]   But ultimately, did Judas find fulfillment?
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:45.720]   Ultimately, did David find fulfillment?
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:50.960]   Ultimately, did Solomon find fulfillment?
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:54.840]   The rich, young ruler, when Jesus would come in front of him,
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.800]   the rich, young ruler wanted to follow Jesus
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:01.480]   and Jesus says to him, "Sell everything and follow me."
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:05.020]   The rich, young ruler had a hard time.
[00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:08.880]   The black and white issue is that as Christ followers,
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:12.480]   we limp between two different opinions.
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.400]   We limp between the opinions of following Christ
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:19.800]   versus the opinion of what the world has to offer.
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.440]   Now, here's the one thing.
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.640]   And some of you guys are sitting here right now.
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:26.880]   So it's like my friend who I was texting
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.720]   and when I was originally did this sermon,
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.660]   this one friend texted me and she says,
[00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:33.720]   "You know, I have a hard time following
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:36.260]   "and giving up my life because I actually,
[00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.520]   "do I really wanna sell everything
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:42.400]   "and be poor all my life just to follow Christ?"
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:45.520]   I actually think sometimes people believe that.
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.680]   I believe that a lot of times with Christians,
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.160]   we sit here and we say, "Okay, following Christ
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:51.760]   "means I have to sell everything,
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:53.560]   "I have to be poor and give up everything."
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:54.920]   Is that what, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:57.720]   I don't think that's really what God is trying to say.
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:00.080]   Being a Christian does not mean that you sit there
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.320]   and you sell everything and you become poor
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.360]   and you give up everything.
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.040]   For some of us who are sitting here,
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:08.160]   God has placed us in a position,
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.720]   whether it's your job, your gifts, or your creativity,
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:15.440]   all of those things, he has given you certain things.
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:19.120]   Some of you guys who are sitting here right now
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:23.160]   have the capability of making money.
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:26.000]   If God is giving you the skills and the gifts
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.500]   to make money, make money.
[00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:32.160]   If God has given you the skills to be a pharmacist,
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.120]   be the best pharmacist that you can.
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.560]   If God has given you the skills to be an engineer,
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.080]   be the best engineer that you possibly can.
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:42.780]   Whatever you do, thrive and be successful at it.
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.680]   That doesn't mean that you can't have vacations
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:48.400]   or have nice stuff and all that stuff.
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.820]   You know what it means to follow Christ?
[00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:55.460]   It's whose life do you belong to?
[00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:59.120]   That when you sit there and look at all your skills
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:04.120]   and all your gifts and all your money and all your time,
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:08.920]   whose life does it belong to?
[00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:13.520]   Do you sit there and just say, "A part of it is mine,"
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:16.240]   or, "Lord, here's my entire life.
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:19.040]   "Here's all my skills that you've given me.
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:20.440]   "Here's all my talents.
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:21.800]   "Here's everything I'm able to achieve
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:25.880]   "because of your name, and I lift it up to you."
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:29.260]   Whose life do you belong to?
[00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.880]   That's one aspect of wrestling
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:34.040]   between two different opinions.
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:34.960]   What's the other one?
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:37.040]   Here's another one that's kind of new,
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.520]   that's emerging as well, too,
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.220]   that I really wanna talk with,
[00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:43.860]   because I'm not sure, I bet you some of you guys here,
[00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:47.560]   especially living in the US and being in America,
[00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:50.680]   you probably see, it's this.
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:56.300]   We are disenchanted by the local church.
[00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:59.140]   We get frustrated by Christians.
[00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:02.780]   We get frustrated by what we see
[00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:06.680]   on behalf of the church in America and over the world.
[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:10.400]   That has created a new phenomenon
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.700]   that we've started seeing in the last 10 years.
[00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:14.800]   Let me give you some examples of what I mean by that.
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.080]   And I wanna land on that.
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.480]   That's one of the reasons why I wanna spend
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:18.720]   some time on this.
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.140]   There's this whole aspect of limping
[00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:23.040]   between two different opinions, black and white.
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:25.620]   One way in the world, one way of following Christ,
[00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:27.940]   but there's another one where we're limped
[00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:31.000]   between two worlds, and it's a little more gray.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.120]   What do I mean by that?
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:33.280]   Let me talk about this.
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:34.320]   It's this whole idea.
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.680]   I don't exactly like this word,
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:37.800]   but people have been using it,
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:41.280]   calling it the deconstruction of the Christian faith.
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:44.920]   Here's what we're beginning to see a lot.
[00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:49.920]   Church attendance over the last 10 years
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:54.600]   have continued to decline at a rapid rate.
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.600]   Here's some reasons.
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:00.060]   We're dissatisfied with many of our church options.
[00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:04.040]   I'm not, and this is not Urban Voice, please,
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.800]   but this is just a general church in America.
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:08.720]   People in America are frustrated
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:11.740]   by the behavior of church members.
[00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:15.720]   We don't know how to disagree anymore.
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:16.880]   We fight too much.
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:20.040]   In too many churches, the whole idea of proclamation
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:23.400]   refers to justice, politics play a role in it,
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:24.420]   everything like that.
[00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:25.480]   People are frustrated.
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:27.280]   People are frustrated with what they see
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:30.320]   and the behavior of different church members.
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.960]   People are frustrated because they feel like
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:34.880]   when they come to church, it's just a show.
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:36.920]   We sit there, we listen to music,
[00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:40.960]   and some of these guys just have all these different pizzazz
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:45.240]   and lights and smoke shows and all these different things.
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:48.200]   We feel like it's a show,
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:50.400]   and we're frustrated by what we see.
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:53.340]   More and more, you're hearing about
[00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:55.600]   the controversy of pastors,
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:56.960]   the things that they do,
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:59.760]   the things, times when they get in trouble.
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:03.560]   We're frustrated by how much that we read in the news
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:06.360]   about how bad pastors are.
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:10.440]   The church is intolerant and exclusionary to people
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:15.000]   who do not believe like them or act like them.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.020]   The church in America is unwilling to engage
[00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:20.500]   in contemporary issues.
[00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:23.240]   We don't talk about the role of the church
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:25.280]   as dealing with migrants.
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:30.120]   We don't deal with church issues in dealing with racism.
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:32.200]   We do talk a lot about black, white.
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.120]   Sometimes we have a hard time with that.
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.240]   We don't talk about Asian hate
[00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.600]   a lot of times in many churches.
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:42.160]   Churches struggle with talking about LGBTQ.
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:46.520]   We don't talk about cultural issues in churches.
[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:51.180]   There is an overemphasis on political and social agendas.
[00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:52.920]   There's many belief that if you're a Christian,
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:54.560]   you have to be a Republican.
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:55.800]   You can't be a Democrat.
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:58.240]   Democrats disagree with all of these things.
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.220]   And people may say,
[00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:03.160]   "Hey man, it's been really developing
[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:04.760]   and building up since COVID."
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.720]   No, no, it's been building up for over 10 years.
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:12.240]   Back in the early 80s and 90s,
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:14.600]   a few churches, a few pastors in the US
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:17.940]   began to experiment with a new way of doing church,
[00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:20.260]   according to different people who are out there
[00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:24.580]   in terms of Barna studies and also Gallup studies.
[00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:29.060]   These ministries began to design a church experience
[00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:31.860]   that will be available to everyone
[00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:34.420]   in which it reaches out to everyone.
[00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:38.620]   It would draw and make church attractive.
[00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:40.380]   One author writes this,
[00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:42.740]   "The logic was simple.
[00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:45.420]   If the baby boomers in the US
[00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:48.780]   did not feel the need to connect with God,
[00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:51.660]   then perhaps another felt need
[00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:53.880]   would draw them into the church,
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:56.640]   the need for community, entertainment,
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:59.120]   help with their children and their marriage.
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:03.620]   They would include music, improve the music,
[00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:06.820]   support groups, drama, sermons
[00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:09.660]   that reached out and ministered to you.
[00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:12.640]   And hopefully you will find God as well."
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:13.980]   And that was a strategy.
[00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:19.820]   And that strategy worked very well in the 80s and 90s.
[00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:23.380]   Evangelical churches began experimenting
[00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:26.760]   on Sunday morning services with worship experience
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.460]   with the emphasis on production.
[00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:33.440]   In the 1990s, the emphasis starts shifting
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:36.260]   to program, art, and services
[00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:41.500]   that really excited and drew in different people.
[00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:44.580]   New churches strip religious icons from their exteriors
[00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:49.580]   and interiors and gravitated toward an architectural style
[00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:53.500]   that blended the feeling of a mall,
[00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:58.500]   a university campus, movie theater versus a church.
[00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:01.420]   Church could be anything
[00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:05.380]   as long as it wasn't boring.
[00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:08.380]   But the problem is,
[00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:11.500]   the problem with creating a church that attracted people
[00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:14.180]   that we saw in the US in the 80s and 90s,
[00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:16.960]   created another problem.
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:21.000]   The growth and direction of the modern church
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.460]   was fueled and influenced by money
[00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:26.380]   donated by all of these people
[00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:28.220]   who were attracted by this model
[00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:30.060]   because the plan worked.
[00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:33.300]   People started coming to church
[00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:36.940]   and there started being a lot of money
[00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:39.100]   flowing into churches.
[00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:41.980]   And now churches began to really fall
[00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:45.100]   in the temptation of consumerism.
[00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:47.580]   And soon, many other churches,
[00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:50.140]   not only in the US but around the world,
[00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:55.040]   began to copy this model and it worked.
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.060]   But there was a cost.
[00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:58.020]   One author writes this,
[00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:00.460]   "Instead of the church becoming a place
[00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:04.420]   "where the people of God are equipped for work and service,
[00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:08.300]   "showing up to church began to be an end in itself
[00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:11.160]   "and instead of a launch pad into the world,
[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:13.140]   "Christianity became a belief system
[00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:16.020]   "that insulated us from the world.
[00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:18.440]   "Through consumer Christianity,
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:21.140]   "the value of God in our lives became predicated
[00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:25.620]   "on how well he fulfilled our needs."
[00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:29.040]   And now you started creating a church
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.260]   full of different consumers.
[00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:33.880]   In a church as entertainment culture,
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:38.100]   instead of seeking to be equipped as disciples of Jesus,
[00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:40.900]   we are slowly formed into consumers and others
[00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:44.620]   who give ratings and reviews on local church performance.
[00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:48.380]   But when we expect the church to entertain us,
[00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:51.980]   it limits the church's ability to challenge us.
[00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:55.800]   And now here we are for what we have.
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:57.080]   And we've seen it now,
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:59.400]   church attendance becoming a drop.
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.020]   And in some sense, actually,
[00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:03.880]   you would think that as a drop of attendance,
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:07.620]   people actually are walking away from religion.
[00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:10.420]   They're not walking away from religion.
[00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:13.640]   They're still saying they're Christ followers.
[00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:15.740]   They're still saying they pray.
[00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:18.220]   They're still saying they read the Bible
[00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:19.060]   and all that stuff.
[00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:21.220]   They're still religious.
[00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:24.500]   They just don't go to church anymore
[00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:27.180]   because they just wanna be consumed and entertained
[00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:29.420]   and go from one place to another to another.
[00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:32.500]   And when it doesn't fulfill them, they just don't go.
[00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:34.940]   But you know what's going on instead of that?
[00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:37.220]   Even though they're no longer going to church
[00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:39.860]   and some of you guys may feel that way,
[00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:41.780]   this is what's happening in the American church.
[00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:45.540]   Even though they don't go to church,
[00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:47.140]   you know what's still happening?
[00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:50.700]   They're still watching cable news.
[00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:53.620]   They're still paying attention to their social media.
[00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:55.660]   They're still watching YouTube
[00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:59.320]   and they're still watching and listening to their podcasts.
[00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:04.320]   But the accountability, the community,
[00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:09.580]   the fellowship, the guardrails are no longer there.
[00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:14.460]   And so they're listening to what they want on cable news,
[00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:17.100]   on podcast, on YouTube,
[00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:21.420]   and they now have become a different person.
[00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:24.700]   Theologically, they're changed,
[00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:27.020]   but they have no accountability anymore.
[00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:29.220]   That's what's going on.
[00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:30.780]   There's one aspect of living
[00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:32.740]   between two different opinions,
[00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:36.100]   one foot in the world, one foot following Christ,
[00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:38.700]   but there's another part of us
[00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:43.900]   in which we're frustrated by the church experience.
[00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:47.020]   We don't want anyone to tell us what to do anymore.
[00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:49.060]   And if we don't like what we hear,
[00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:51.880]   then we'll move on to something else.
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:53.180]   But yet at the same time,
[00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:56.520]   we're still consuming things that reinforces our view.
[00:22:56.520 --> 00:23:01.300]   And now we're limping between two different opinions.
[00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:05.560]   And that's where the current state of the church is at.
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:09.660]   Are you limping between two different opinions?
[00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:14.420]   For me, that the second option is where I struggle with.
[00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:18.260]   I have grown as a Christ follower,
[00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:20.620]   as I sit, stand here with you,
[00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:22.780]   disenchanted with the church.
[00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:25.340]   I get frustrated with the church.
[00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:30.220]   I've been in ministry doing this for about 20 years now.
[00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:34.860]   I get frustrated by the pastors that I meet,
[00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:36.940]   not Mark, I love Mark,
[00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:41.820]   but there's so many pastors who I read when I was a child,
[00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:44.420]   who I sat there and listened to.
[00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:46.100]   And when I meet them, I'm sitting there,
[00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:50.260]   seriously, you're all consumed about money and power.
[00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:52.460]   The people that I, all the things that they're,
[00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:55.420]   I get frustrated when I sit in a church,
[00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:59.980]   I get frustrated by the politics that they talk about.
[00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:01.900]   I get frustrated by Republican party.
[00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:03.540]   I get frustrated by the Democrat party.
[00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:05.620]   I get frustrated when we ignore
[00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:07.500]   all of these different things.
[00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:11.540]   You know why I also get frustrated at?
[00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:13.940]   The conversations, even when we, as Christians,
[00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:15.580]   we dwell on the race.
[00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:19.940]   I sat there with Latino pastors, African-American pastors,
[00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:20.900]   all of us are Asians.
[00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:22.900]   Well, most of us are Asians,
[00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:27.100]   but I get frustrated sometimes even as Asians,
[00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:28.900]   because as Asian Christians,
[00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:33.380]   we're expected to be the quiet, obedient culture.
[00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:36.460]   We're expected not to cause trouble.
[00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:38.340]   I had a pastor who says to me,
[00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:42.460]   "Tommy, racism here in America is a black brown thing.
[00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:45.780]   "You Asians, you have it easy.
[00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:47.660]   "You guys are the ideal culture.
[00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:49.380]   "You guys get everything."
[00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:50.220]   And I had to explain,
[00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:54.380]   "Hey, look, when my parents immigrated here in 1972,
[00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:56.740]   "they worked hard to get to where we are."
[00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:00.980]   And so a lot of times, you can't expect us,
[00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:03.540]   as Asian Christians, to take a back seat
[00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:04.660]   and be the stepping stone.
[00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:08.100]   I get frustrated by all of these conversations.
[00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:12.120]   Are you limping between two different opinions?
[00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:17.140]   Are you seeing the problems that you have?
[00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:20.640]   And for the Israelites, when Elijah challenged them,
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:21.900]   they said nothing.
[00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:25.980]   Do you even wanna do anything about it?
[00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:28.540]   And the answer is yes.
[00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:29.820]   What are you gonna do about it?
[00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:32.740]   In light of how God has gifted you and all of that,
[00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:34.380]   what are you gonna do about it?
[00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:37.180]   Or you'd be like the Israelites,
[00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:39.700]   who had nothing to say.
[00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:44.420]   And you were quiet.
[00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:45.860]   And maybe some of us who are sitting here,
[00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:46.900]   it says, "I'm good.
[00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:49.660]   "I'm good, I see the problems of the church,
[00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:50.820]   "I see the problems of my faith,
[00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:53.840]   "but you know what, I'm happy with coming in on Sundays.
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:55.400]   "I'm happy just to be sitting here,
[00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:57.260]   "and then once I walk out of here on Sunday,
[00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:58.140]   "I'm gonna do my own thing.
[00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:00.220]   "I'm good, I'm good, I'm good."
[00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:03.580]   Because if that's your answer,
[00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:06.540]   then there's nothing for us to say.
[00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:07.380]   Then we're done.
[00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:09.580]   Go do your own thing.
[00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:10.420]   But if you're sitting there,
[00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:12.860]   I wanna do something about it.
[00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:16.120]   What are you gonna do about it?
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:19.660]   Elijah goes in, in verse 30,
[00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:21.760]   and he said to all the people,
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:22.740]   "Come near to me."
[00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:25.260]   And all the people came near to him.
[00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:27.000]   And he repaired the altar of the Lord
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   that had been thrown down.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.500]   He took 12 stones according to the number
[00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:32.620]   of the tribes of the son of Jacob,
[00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:34.760]   and with the stones he built an altar
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:36.080]   in the name of the Lord.
[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:39.520]   If you wanna do something about it,
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:40.560]   you're wrestling between,
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:42.560]   you're limping between two different opinions.
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:44.100]   If you wanna do something about it,
[00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:48.520]   how do you rebuild and repair your altar?
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:52.000]   How do you rebuild and repair your altar?
[00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:55.720]   I wanna find one way that you could do it.
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:27:00.120]   Do you have people in your life
[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:02.000]   that speaks truth to you?
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.440]   Do you have people in your life
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:08.200]   that says no to you?
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.560]   Do you have people in your life
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:12.880]   that stretch you to become the version
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:16.920]   that Christ Jesus wants you to be?
[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:18.240]   Do you have people in your life
[00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:20.100]   that pushes you?
[00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:21.440]   Or do you surround yourself
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:23.700]   with people in your life
[00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:26.640]   that tells you what you want to hear?
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:28.840]   Let me tell you one story.
[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:32.580]   Back in late November,
[00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:33.920]   right after Christmas,
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:38.240]   my friend Sharon was a paralegal
[00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:41.060]   who was diagnosed with stage four cancer
[00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:44.260]   right on her last day of work.
[00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:46.060]   Her goal was to retire early.
[00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:48.580]   She retired early at 48.
[00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:50.080]   On her last day of work,
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:52.180]   she was diagnosed with cancer.
[00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:57.860]   And there she had to battle for two years
[00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:00.420]   through chemo, radiation, and all of that.
[00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:03.180]   On a Thursday night,
[00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:05.900]   the first week of December,
[00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:08.140]   she was slowly struggling,
[00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:11.140]   slowly just not doing well.
[00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:12.180]   The doctors had told her
[00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:14.580]   she did not have time to live.
[00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:16.100]   She wanted all her friends,
[00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:16.940]   different friends,
[00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:18.220]   to stay with her at night,
[00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:20.200]   and it happened that on that first week,
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:22.120]   right after Thanksgiving,
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:24.280]   on that Thursday night,
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:26.180]   I was assigned to stay with her.
[00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:28.040]   And I walked in,
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:30.320]   and I actually did not want to be there.
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:32.000]   I had just gotten back from out of town,
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.200]   did not want to be there,
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:34.480]   but my wife says to me,
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:36.280]   "You don't know what's gonna happen.
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:37.560]   "She's not doing well.
[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:39.300]   "You need to go see her."
[00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:40.920]   So I got all my stuff,
[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:43.480]   was gonna stay there with her that night,
[00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:45.000]   and I got to the hospital,
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.240]   and when I walked in,
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:48.120]   her face was white,
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:50.640]   and she was just staring out
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:52.440]   into the darkness.
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:53.560]   And the nurse and doctor says,
[00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:55.580]   "She has not been doing well."
[00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:58.480]   And I said, "Okay."
[00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:00.680]   And her oxygen was dropping,
[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:01.820]   she stopped breathing,
[00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:03.360]   she was having a hard time breathing,
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:04.200]   all of that stuff,
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:07.040]   and she got stabilized that very night.
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:08.840]   And it was about midnight,
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:10.540]   and she had fallen asleep,
[00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:12.720]   and she was snoring, actually.
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.140]   And the nurse comes in and says,
[00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:15.740]   "Wow, that's pretty good.
[00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:16.760]   "She's snoring."
[00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:20.120]   And at 12 midnight,
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:24.520]   her oxygen started dropping,
[00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:26.800]   and it was about 90-something,
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:27.920]   and it kept dropping.
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:30.040]   I was the only one in the room.
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:32.120]   It's midnight.
[00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:34.280]   I was the only one in the room.
[00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:38.560]   And it kept dropping from 90,
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:40.080]   to 80,
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:41.280]   to 70,
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:42.120]   to 60.
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:43.800]   Suddenly, all these nurses,
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:44.720]   all of these guys,
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:46.620]   there was about 20 people in the room,
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:50.880]   and as it was dropping to 59,
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:52.400]   the nurse says to me,
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:55.360]   "Whoever you have to wake up,
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:56.800]   "call them."
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:59.000]   Because when I lift this ventilator,
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:29:59.880]   this mask off her,
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:02.900]   she has three minutes before she dies.
[00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:04.820]   And now I had to call everyone.
[00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:06.000]   And there,
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.440]   she never,
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:08.340]   her family came,
[00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:09.240]   her friends came,
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:10.560]   she never made it,
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:12.540]   and there she died in front of me.
[00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:14.340]   But the week before,
[00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:15.520]   when I saw her,
[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:16.540]   on that Sunday,
[00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:20.900]   Sharon knew that her time was about to be gone,
[00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:23.300]   and she grabbed my hand,
[00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:24.140]   and she says,
[00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:26.140]   "I am angry at God.
[00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:30.020]   "How did God allow this to happen to me?
[00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:36.580]   "How did God allow me to suffer so bad?
[00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:38.040]   "Help me understand."
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:40.380]   And that's where we sat there,
[00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:41.220]   and we talked,
[00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:42.780]   that sometimes we don't understand
[00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:45.500]   how God does things.
[00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:47.900]   God never promises that he'll save us.
[00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:51.120]   He promises that he'll be with us,
[00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:53.540]   but he doesn't promise us pain-free.
[00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:56.940]   He doesn't promise that we're gonna be free of trials.
[00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:59.100]   He promises that he'll give us strength,
[00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:00.460]   he'll be with us.
[00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:04.720]   How do we rebuild and repair the alters in our life?
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:08.740]   Do we surround ourselves with people
[00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:10.420]   who are willing to tell us things
[00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:12.840]   that we don't wanna hear?
[00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:14.700]   Are we willing to surround ourselves
[00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:16.940]   with people who tells us no,
[00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:17.900]   who guides us,
[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:21.980]   who tells us and help us see God clearly
[00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:24.380]   in the midst of all these things?
[00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:28.500]   If we're limby between two different opinions,
[00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:31.020]   whether it's with the world or with our faith
[00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:32.540]   or with what we're seeing in the church,
[00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:33.740]   that's great,
[00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:35.820]   I totally understand.
[00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:37.500]   What are you gonna do about it?
[00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:40.700]   'Cause if you don't wanna do anything about it,
[00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:41.780]   then we don't have to do it.
[00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:43.660]   There's nothing for us to talk about.
[00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:47.060]   But if you wanna do something about it,
[00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:51.740]   what are you gonna do?
[00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:54.980]   How do we repair and rebuild the alter?
[00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:59.640]   And lastly, as we look at things,
[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:01.020]   once they rebuild the alter,
[00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:05.380]   he praises one thing in verse 36.
[00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:07.020]   "At the time of the offering,"
[00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:09.660]   and so the bowels and all prophets bowed,
[00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:12.460]   they couldn't call their God, no one came, all right?
[00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:15.060]   They doused it with water, everything, nothing came.
[00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:17.940]   And at the time of the offering of the oblation,
[00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:19.380]   Elijah, the prophet came near and says,
[00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:22.140]   "O Lord, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel,
[00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:26.840]   "let it be known this day that you are God in Israel
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:29.300]   "and that I am your servant
[00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:33.560]   "and that I have done all these things at your word.
[00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:36.900]   "Answer me, O Lord, answer me,
[00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:42.220]   "that this people may know that you, O Lord,
[00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:47.080]   "are God and that you have turned their hearts back.
[00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:49.500]   "Then the fire of the Lord fell
[00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:51.340]   "and consumed the burnt offering
[00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:53.880]   "and the wood and the stones and the dust
[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:56.600]   "and licked up the water that was in the trench.
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:33:01.400]   "Are you praying that God will show up in your life?"
[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:04.760]   Elijah prayed and asked the Lord,
[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:08.960]   "Let it be known this day that you are God in Israel
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:10.680]   "and that I am your servant.
[00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:13.400]   "I need you to show up.
[00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:17.700]   "Are you praying that God will show up in your life?"
[00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:21.080]   Now, here's one thing, God is always at work in your life.
[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:23.680]   God is always present in your life.
[00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:26.340]   But sometimes what you and I need
[00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:31.060]   is that we're praying that God show up in our life.
[00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:32.820]   Make it known.
[00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:33.940]   Show us that you're real.
[00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:34.780]   Show us that you're,
[00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:38.060]   because you know what, we need to be reminded.
[00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:39.940]   Because life is hard.
[00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:42.940]   It's not easy.
[00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:45.040]   We get discouraged.
[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:48.260]   The things of the world drives us crazy,
[00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:50.520]   the discouragement, the things that we face
[00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:51.580]   each and every single day.
[00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:54.660]   And there are times in the midst of following the Lord,
[00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:55.980]   we're gonna need strength.
[00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:57.420]   For those who are sitting online
[00:33:57.420 --> 00:33:58.720]   and for those who are sitting there,
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:02.220]   we're gonna need some encouragement along the way.
[00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:08.940]   Are we praying that God will show up?
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:11.040]   Because if we don't,
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:15.480]   we're gonna struggle along the way.
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:18.080]   Can I read you one more story?
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:19.480]   Or one more email that I got?
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:22.200]   And I apologize that this,
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:25.160]   all my illustrations have been on death and struggles,
[00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:27.600]   but here's one more of an email
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:30.840]   that I actually received this week that actually struck me.
[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:35.160]   And it's this guy who is an inter-varsity staff worker,
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:37.600]   and he has been working inter-varsity
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:38.720]   for a while, he says,
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:41.920]   "Some of you have prayed for me for my whole life.
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:44.280]   "Ever since I joined inter-varsity as a freshman
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:47.760]   "at the University of Illinois in 1992.
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:50.320]   "Thank you to your prayers, love, and support.
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:52.400]   "God's ministry through me has touched
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:57.120]   "over 100,000 people because of through you.
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:02.120]   "The true extent won't be known until we reach heaven.
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:06.160]   "And now heaven is where we will meet next."
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:09.840]   As I've lost my 27-year-old health battle
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:12.880]   with migraines, with Crohn's disease, with all of that.
[00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:14.800]   He talks about all the wonderful things
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:18.200]   that God has allowed him to do through their support.
[00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:21.480]   But my death will have been several days ago
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:24.360]   by the time you get this.
[00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:27.480]   God will judge me by the 50 years of my life,
[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:30.000]   not the moment of my death.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.280]   When I read this email,
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:32.800]   I actually had to read this a couple of times.
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:35.440]   I said, "Did he just say what he just said?"
[00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:36.280]   He did.
[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:41.280]   This guy who has been serving for 27 years of his life
[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:45.040]   needed some encouragement from God.
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:50.160]   And he didn't, he couldn't find it.
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:56.080]   And he ended his life earlier this week.
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:59.960]   And now he's sending an email to all his supporters saying,
[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:02.000]   "It has been a couple of days and you will soon,
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.720]   "by the time you read this, I will be dead."
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:06.640]   Yes, I will have passed.
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:11.880]   Our life, and the thing is, for a guy who struggled cancer,
[00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:14.040]   and some of you guys know I've struggled cancer,
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:16.800]   I know what that means.
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:19.640]   I know what he's dealing with.
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:22.480]   Every day I wake up, my body aches.
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:25.880]   Every day I wake up, I have chills throughout my body.
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:28.080]   I probably don't have what he had.
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:30.260]   Every day I struggle migraines.
[00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:33.600]   Every day I have no saliva, no tears, all that.
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:35.280]   My head is just pounding.
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:38.080]   I just dealt with three weeks of a sinus infection,
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:40.920]   and since I've weakened the immune system,
[00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:45.600]   my sinus and my headaches were just attacking me.
[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:49.500]   It just kept painful, pounding and pounding and pounding.
[00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:51.880]   This guy had to deal with 27 years of it.
[00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:57.920]   He lost sight, and he ended his life because of it.
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:02.420]   We have to ask God to show up in our life.
[00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:06.340]   We need God to give us strength.
[00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:10.620]   The reason why we're not, we're wrestling between two,
[00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:12.980]   we're limping between two different opinions.
[00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:16.220]   The reason why we don't have the strength to follow God.
[00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:18.860]   The reason why we're so attracted by the world.
[00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:21.100]   The reason why we get attracted
[00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:22.980]   and disenchanted by the church
[00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:27.980]   is because we don't know how to repair or rebuild our altar,
[00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:30.860]   and one of those ways to rebuild and repair the altar
[00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:32.620]   is the community of believers,
[00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:35.060]   but also praying that God will show up
[00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:38.380]   and that we will see God every aspect of our lives,
[00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:42.680]   because you and I are in a journey of following Christ,
[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:48.520]   and that journey is not easy.
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:54.300]   If anything that the story of Mount Carmel teaches us
[00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:59.300]   as we wrap up is that what it means to follow in Christ
[00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:02.660]   is that you're gonna go through tough times.
[00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:05.300]   You're gonna have to have choices that you have to make.
[00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:06.940]   You're gonna have to make decisions
[00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:09.220]   about what you're gonna do with my faith,
[00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:10.740]   because you can sit there and say,
[00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:12.860]   "I'm a Christ follower," and go through the routines,
[00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:17.860]   but if you truly wanna make a difference with your faith,
[00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:19.700]   you're gonna have to surround yourself
[00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:21.340]   with believers who pushes you,
[00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:25.020]   but you're gonna have to ask God to make himself known,
[00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:27.140]   to show up in your life and remind you
[00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:30.820]   of what it means to follow after him,
[00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:34.220]   and before I pray, I wanna say one thing,
[00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:36.460]   and later on as we look at that story,
[00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:39.380]   the fire comes down, and Elijah, as he prays,
[00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:44.100]   the fire comes down and burns up the burnt offering
[00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:46.860]   because it's a simple reminder
[00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:51.220]   of what happens when Jesus comes,
[00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:53.660]   because the fire could have destroyed
[00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:57.500]   and killed all the Israelites that were gathered there
[00:38:57.500 --> 00:38:58.740]   for their disobedience.
[00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:00.220]   It could have killed all the folks
[00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:02.940]   that bowed for their disobedience,
[00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:05.720]   but no, the fire destroyed the burnt offering.
[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:11.300]   When Jesus came, the judgment of God
[00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:13.980]   could have been placed on all of us,
[00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:20.300]   but no, the judgment of God was placed on the sacrifice
[00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:25.180]   in the form of Jesus Christ that was found on the cross.
[00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:28.340]   That's the gospel message.
[00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:31.500]   That's what Jesus reminds us of.
[00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:35.180]   That's why we follow after him.
[00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:37.700]   Let's pray.
[00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:40.420]   Father, thank you for the message of Elijah.
[00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:43.860]   Thank you for how this Tishbite of Tishbe and Gilead
[00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:46.560]   continues to teach us all these wonderful lessons,
[00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:49.620]   and the lesson today of what it means
[00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:51.820]   to live between two worlds,
[00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:57.480]   what it means to repair and rebuild our altar,
[00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:02.140]   and what it means for you to show up
[00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:05.100]   and for us to pray that you will show up.
[00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:06.920]   Give us a strength.
[00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:08.260]   Let us draw that strength.
[00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:10.540]   Let us see you.
[00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:12.820]   In Christ we pray, amen.
