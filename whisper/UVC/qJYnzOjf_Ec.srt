1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Good morning brothers and sisters

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,700
 Shalom to all of you who are joining this worship through online urban voice members and all the other brothers and sisters in the world

00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:18,020
 Yeah, peace to you. God cares for us. He knows us and he is with us today

4
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:25,720
 I'm gonna share God's Word from the book of Acts chapter 1 verse 12 to 14 and verse chapter 2 verse 1 to 4

5
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,880
 two short passages

6
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:36,200
 So please prepare your Bible again the book of Acts chapter 1 verse 12 to 14 and chapter 2 verse 1 to 4

7
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,840
 If you can read the passage with me together

8
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,160
 Then they returned to Jerusalem

9
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:50,940
 From from the hill called the Mount of Olives a Sabbath days walk from the city

10
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:59,160
 When they arrived they went upstairs to the room where they were staying those present were Peter John James

11
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:05,880
 Andrew Philip and Thomas Bethlehem you and Matthew James son of Alpheus and

12
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,440
 Simon the Zillah and Judas son of James

13
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,080
 They all joined together

14
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:19,780
 Constantly in prayer along with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus and with it with his brothers

15
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,800
 second passage

16
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,800
 chapter 2 verse 1 to 4

17
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:30,400
 When the day of Pentecost came they were all together in one place

18
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:38,920
 Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting

19
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,160
 They saw what seemed to be tongues of the tongues of fire

20
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:47,020
 That separated and came to rest upon each of them

21
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:54,680
 All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them

22
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,320
 Amen, this is the Word of God

23
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,840
 Thanks be to God

24
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,840
 Let me pray briefly

25
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,080
 Father God speak to us Lord. We need you Holy Spirit

26
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,720
 More than anything else what we now need is you Lord

27
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,680
 Convict our hearts do your mighty work upon our hearts. We are waiting for you

28
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,300
 Speak to us in Jesus name we pray

29
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,000
 Amen

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,760
 My dear brothers and sisters the title of today's message is

31
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,560
 pray

32
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:37,560
 Extraordinarily to be filled with a Holy Spirit one more time. The title is the title is pray

33
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,280
 Extraordinarily to be filled with the Holy Spirit

34
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,280
 Let me ask you this question

35
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:50,000
 What is the most extraordinary experience for you in your whole lifetime?

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,240
 As some of you may know my story the most extraordinary experience for me is that

37
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:05,320
 God gave me my wedding date when I was praying and also my wife's name when I was sleeping even

38
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,360
 Before I met her I didn't meet her yet

39
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,920
 So it was very extraordinary experience for me

40
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,840
 today's story in the book of Acts chapter 1 and 2 also talks about a

41
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:24,760
 Super extraordinary story that we cannot expect in our daily life easily

42
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,520
 It can happen but it's very extra ordinary

43
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,680
 today's story happened on the day called Pentecost or

44
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:40,520
 Woosungje in Mandarin meaning 50th day. It was the 50th day

45
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,960
 after the first day of the Passover festival

46
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,520
 the Jews in Jesus with Jesus days were

47
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:56,040
 Celebrating the day Pentecost is the day of celebrating their harvest and bringing God their first fruits

48
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:03,480
 So on Pentecost one of the top three most important Jewish festivals all the Jews who were

49
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:11,720
 Scattered around the whole world whole nations for centuries. They came to Jerusalem and they celebrated this festival together

50
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:19,960
 At the same time before this day of Pentecost as you can see on the screen you'll see a map

51
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,040
 Yes

52
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,360
 Jesus died on the cross and rose on the Sunday

53
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,720
 where when counting 50 days began

54
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,760
 Then Jesus for the following 40 days

55
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:42,480
 Jesus spent with his disciples and his where he went back to the heaven on the Mount of Olives

56
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,880
 Which lies just about a one kilometer away from Jerusalem

57
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,480
 Then Jesus 11 disciples

58
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:58,000
 Because Judas is carried out who had had a sold Jesus killed himself those 11 disciples and others

59
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,840
 Around 120 people in total they gathered at a place and they had even praying together

60
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:10,640
 Constantly for 10 days as in verse 14

61
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,000
 Okay

62
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,560
 So that was the 50th day after Jesus rose again

63
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,720
 Then the most extraordinary day for the disciples began in today's passage

64
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,120
 Actually these three things happen to them

65
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,640
 What is that number one a sound like the blowing of a violent wind?

66
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:36,640
 Came from heaven and filled the whole house

67
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:44,120
 Second thing they saw what seems to be the tongues of fire that separated and came to rest upon

68
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:52,120
 It's one of them Wow and the third thing all of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in

69
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,880
 Other tongues actually in other languages as the Spirit enabled them

70
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,720
 But think about this

71
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:06,040
 Before the Holy Spirit came upon them who were the yes look at the screen that that's what happened to them

72
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:10,920
 Before the Holy Spirit came upon them who were the disciples?

73
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,360
 How were the disciples number one when Jesus went back to the heaven?

74
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:23,040
 They were very much afraid the Jewish religious leaders. They had killed Jesus at the same time

75
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:28,640
 They were still hating Jesus disciples. So they were afraid of losing their lives

76
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:36,640
 Number two, who are they? They had been following Jesus for more than three years and their teacher Jesus died

77
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:42,760
 Rose from death and went back to the heaven and that they didn't know what to do. They were at a loss

78
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,920
 They didn't know what to do number three

79
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:51,160
 They didn't have any power or wisdom to do a new thing in this situation

80
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:58,960
 In short, they were fearful not knowing what to do and powerless powerless

81
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,120
 Then

82
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:08,680
 Today after receiving the Holy Spirit into this passage, how did the disciples change?

83
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,920
 What does the change number one?

84
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:18,640
 They became so courageous and bold and they began to preach the goodness of Jesus even to the Jewish religious leaders

85
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,640
 Whom they were fearing

86
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,720
 number two the Holy Spirit

87
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:31,280
 Started the Christian Church on us on earth and the disciples were joining the most important work in human history

88
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,320
 In other words, they knew what they were doing

89
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:41,800
 Wow in the third change the disciples became also very wise and powerful

90
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:48,280
 Later when they opened their mouth and preached all the religious leaders and Jewish Jewish people

91
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,600
 They were surprised to see their wisdom and ability

92
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:57,640
 When the Holy Spirit comes upon a person what happens

93
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:06,400
 Yes a new heart driving away our fear and sadness and a new mind filled with wisdom and

94
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,080
 Good insight and a new life working with confidence

95
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:18,960
 Meaning direction and power. This is why Jesus says in Luke's gospel chapter 11 verses 13

96
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,960
 When you look at the screen, you can read it together

97
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:27,720
 If you then though you are evil know how to give good gifts to your children

98
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:34,640
 How much more will your father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?

99
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,920
 You know brothers and sisters the best gift you can ever get from God

100
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:44,840
 The best gift your God can ever give you is the Holy Spirit

101
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,400
 Please remember this

102
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,480
 then

103
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:55,920
 How do we receive the Holy Spirit if he received this greatest and most powerful gift in our lives?

104
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:02,920
 You know what when we receive it most of the problems we have will be truly solved

105
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,960
 then

106
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,200
 How do we receive the gift of the Holy Spirit?

107
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,920
 the answer is

108
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,800
 Surprisingly simple why in today's space Caesar? What did they do?

109
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,680
 prayer prayer

110
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:23,320
 Prayer when Jesus talked about the Holy Spirit as the best gift God can ever give us

111
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:29,440
 Jesus was explaining how to pray in Luke's gospel chapter 11

112
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,080
 Okay, he was explaining about prayer life in this chapter

113
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,640
 Jesus tells a parable a story in the story

114
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,600
 There was a guy who had a friend visiting him from a far place

115
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,760
 But he didn't have anything to feed his friend at midnight

116
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,400
 so this guy he went over to one of his neighbor's house at

117
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:59,080
 Midnight and then bang bang bang. He pounded on the door of his neighbor's house

118
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:06,800
 I'm sorry. I have a friend visiting me now, but I don't have anything to give him

119
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,560
 please give me three loaves of bread and

120
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,960
 Jesus says

121
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:18,880
 The neighbor cannot give the bread because this guy is his friend

122
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,400
 but he gives the bread to this guy because of his

123
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,680
 Boldness, did you hear me because of his boldness?

124
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:32,200
 How did the man receive the bread? Yes, remember these two words?

125
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,520
 absolute

126
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,240
 desperateness absolute desperateness and

127
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,080
 complete wholeheartedness

128
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:48,680
 Complete whole heartedness. He went over to his neighbor's house and midnight and banged on the door and cried out to his neighbor

129
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,480
 Give me some bread

130
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,480
 Give me some bread

131
00:10:53,480 --> 00:11:00,560
 My dear brothers and sisters actually this was the same attitude when the 120 people they were praying

132
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,480
 Constantly together for 10 days

133
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:10,440
 They were praying constantly for their receiving the Holy Spirit because Jesus promised it

134
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,920
 They were praying for it

135
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:19,880
 120 people praying together for 10 days day and night. That is the key

136
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,720
 How can you receive the Holy Spirit?

137
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,440
 You should show

138
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,440
 absolute desperateness or

139
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,360
 Complete wholeheartedness in your prayer

140
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,320
 Yes

141
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:40,480
 You need to make an extra ordinary effort in prayer. Have you ever prayed like that?

142
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,680
 Yes, you need to make an extra ordinary

143
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,560
 effort in prayer

144
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:53,680
 When you hear this part some of you may feel quite confused or just want to reject this teaching

145
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,160
 Because you have heard over and over again

146
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,960
 Our faith is all about grace

147
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:08,000
 Yes, I know. Yes, we were saved by grace. We live our daily life only by grace

148
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,880
 I know but why should we make any extra ordinary effort in?

149
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,320
 prayer apart from grace and

150
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:23,200
 This is the place you need to make a clear distinction between the two different notions

151
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,000
 one is in

152
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,080
 Dwelling of the Holy Spirit as you see on the screen in dwelling of the Holy Spirit

153
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,960
 The other one is in filling of the Holy Spirit, right?

154
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:40,000
 As you know very well the in dwelling of the Holy Spirit started

155
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,760
 When we repented of all of all our sins and accepted Jesus as our Savior and Lord

156
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,040
 The Holy Spirit began to indwell us

157
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:58,200
 So if you are a true Christian the Holy Spirit actually lives in you now. Yes very well

158
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:04,560
 However, the in filling of the Holy Spirit is totally different dimension

159
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,800
 Think about this

160
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:12,000
 Think about this even before the day of Pentecost the disciples and all the other people

161
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,840
 120 people they were already saved and technically Christians

162
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,320
 Because they saw Jesus death and resurrection

163
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,880
 They believed in Jesus and they had been following Jesus

164
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:29,080
 So I believe that when they confessed their faith in Jesus with their mouth

165
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:33,120
 The Holy Spirit began to dwell in them

166
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,840
 They already had the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. Well, what's the matter?

167
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:43,040
 Even the Holy Spirit they began to dwell in them

168
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:49,240
 They were lacking in many ways as I shared in the above like what they were fearful

169
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,400
 They didn't know what to do. They were powerless

170
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:59,400
 So what they needed was what they needed was at the moment was more of the Holy Spirit

171
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:06,480
 Not just the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, but in filling of the Holy Spirit and as in today's passage

172
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,240
 After 10 days of labor of prayer

173
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,760
 God literally filled them up with the Holy Spirit

174
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:22,760
 They were transformed by is this in filling of the Holy Spirit and they became powerful and super effective

175
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,480
 So let me summarize it here

176
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:33,360
 Indwelling of the Holy Spirit happens when we accept Jesus as our Savior and Lord and the Spirit begins to

177
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,520
 dwell in us

178
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,680
 then

179
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:44,040
 When does the infilling of the Holy Spirit happen if you are already a Christian what we now need is

180
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:51,320
 Yes, not the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, but the infilling of the Holy Spirit when we ask him

181
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:59,360
 When does the Holy Spirit empower us fill fill us up when we ask when we pray?

182
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,600
 Extraordinarily like those people

183
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,360
 My brothers and sisters

184
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,400
 Why do we need to have?

185
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:14,920
 Extraordinary prayer to receive the Holy Spirit the infilling of the Holy Spirit

186
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:19,240
 It is because the Holy Spirit is the most

187
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:24,560
 Extraordinary person. Did you hear me? Why should we pray like that?

188
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:31,080
 Because he is the most extraordinary person you can ever invite into your heart

189
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:34,960
 He's already in you, but you are inviting the empowerment

190
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:42,560
 Like what you cannot invite the president of the United States into your messy dirty and smelly room

191
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,480
 Right just like that

192
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:50,320
 If you want to invite the US president into a room you need to make proper preparation

193
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,280
 before that

194
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:58,320
 The Holy Spirit is triune God the Holy Spirit is God

195
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,840
 God is absolutely holy

196
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:05,440
 Holy meaning totally different from all other creatures

197
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,760
 So inviting the Holy Spirit into our hearts needs our

198
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:18,280
 proper preparation and the extraordinary prayer is the best way of preparing ourselves for the gift of the

199
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,680
 infilling of the Holy Spirit

200
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:25,120
 Because of the following three reasons I'm going to talk about three reasons

201
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,520
 Number one. Why should we pray?

202
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:34,960
 Extraordinarily to receive the Holy Spirit to be empowered to be filled with the Holy Spirit

203
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:40,920
 First the Holy Spirit will fill your heart when you treat him as

204
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:48,840
 He is let me repeat the Holy Spirit will fill your heart when you treat him as he is

205
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:54,920
 Again, the Holy Spirit is God not your servant

206
00:16:54,920 --> 00:17:01,340
 The Holy Spirit is the owner and the Lord of your life not your guest

207
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,160
 If you neglect the Holy Spirit in your heart and life

208
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:10,640
 The Holy Spirit already knows that if you neglect him, he knows that

209
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:16,240
 So if you are not ready to accept him as King and Savior and Lord

210
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:22,200
 He does not want to fill your heart fully and he cannot do any and it's something great

211
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,920
 Showing his presence in you

212
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,440
 In other words you should desire and treat the Holy Spirit as a

213
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:38,640
 Number one person in your heart in your life. If not, the Holy Spirit cannot do anything

214
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,120
 Okay, do you know this? Have you thought about this?

215
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:46,060
 Have you ever used to the search engine Google?

216
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:52,380
 Alright, when you when you look at the screen Google search engine, how many times do you use a day?

217
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:57,400
 Here now I have Kelly. How many times do you look at look into Google a day?

218
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,880
 Uncountably

219
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,840
 Uncountably because Google is a number one search engine in America

220
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:10,920
 But my brothers and sisters have you ever used to talk to go?

221
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:15,520
 What is that doctor go doctor go is one of the most used?

222
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:21,640
 Search engine in America number one Google number two being number three. Yeah

223
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:27,800
 Who number four doctor go but you never heard about the name doctor go because it is number four

224
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:32,160
 Number one and number four it has a whole whole a lot difference

225
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:37,280
 You never heard about it and you do not use it

226
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,880
 The same thing is happening in your spiritual life

227
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:47,280
 If you do not regard if you treat God as the number one person in your life

228
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:52,960
 You never heard about it. You didn't you never know him. You have nothing to do with him

229
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,520
 That's what is happening in your life

230
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,200
 so

231
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:04,000
 Until you make the Holy Spirit the number one person in your life. God cannot do anything

232
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,520
 So through your extra ordinary prayer

233
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:13,680
 you need to remove all the other idols and you love that you love more than God and

234
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:19,040
 Prepare your heart for the coming for the infilling of the Holy Spirit

235
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:26,560
 Second reason why should he pray extra ordinarily to receive the Holy Spirit?

236
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:34,800
 The Holy Spirit cannot fill your heart when it is too dirty or just a dirty when it is dirty

237
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,400
 The Holy Spirit cannot fill you up

238
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,080
 because God is

239
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,120
 incomparably holier than us

240
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,760
 Do you like the dirty smell?

241
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:49,960
 Till like the dirty odor we cannot endure it the dirty smell just like that

242
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:55,800
 God cannot endure our dirty sins. That is why in check at in the book of Acts

243
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,760
 Chapter 2 when people asked Peter, what shall we do Peter replied?

244
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:06,760
 Repent and be baptized and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit

245
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:13,000
 Receiving the Holy Spirit and the infilling of the Holy Spirit is closely related to

246
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,240
 repentance

247
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:20,240
 Repentance does not mean mean just the easy your lips or words on your lips

248
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,160
 True true repentance should bring the true

249
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,760
 changes in your life

250
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:32,520
 If you have repented you should try not to commit the same sins again

251
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,480
 If you commit the same sin easily

252
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,640
 There is the reason God cannot enter your life

253
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:46,960
 Powerfully the Holy Spirit is not working in your life powerfully because you are repeating the same sins

254
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:51,480
 Again, and again so easily not honoring God and not fearing God

255
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,280
 My story

256
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,280
 before 2006

257
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,960
 Even though I love the Lord

258
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:04,680
 I was doing a lot of ministry in the church as a lay person and I was but I was easily

259
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:11,080
 Repeating the same sins. I didn't fear God and I was enjoying some sins in my life

260
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:15,200
 I was enjoying some sins, but to but from 2007

261
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:20,120
 2007 in my desperate prayer in my extraordinary prayer

262
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:26,640
 I began to hate my sinning and I began to fear God as if he were right beside me

263
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,160
 When I began to deal with my sins seriously like this

264
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:36,880
 Through prayer, you know what God gave me a new level of freedom and joy

265
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:43,000
 Through the extraordinary prayer God gave me a new level of freedom and joy

266
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:51,200
 That extraordinary prayer freed me from my habitual sins and I was literally I was literally

267
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,600
 filled with a Holy Spirit

268
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,160
 Last the third reason why should we pray?

269
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,000
 Extraordinarily to receive the Holy Spirit

270
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 because

271
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:10,400
 You can expect to be filled with the Spirit when you are literally again filled with him in your 24/7

272
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,600
 Do you get it?

273
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:18,400
 You can expect to be filled with the Holy Spirit when you are literally filled with him

274
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,480
 24/7 my brothers and sisters

275
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:29,760
 Becoming a Christian is done when we confess our faith with our mouth believing in our hearts

276
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,400
 Believing living as a Christian is another dimension

277
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:41,200
 It requires our ongoing true commitment in our hearts in all of our actions

278
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,760
 In all of our actions in other words to live as true Christians

279
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:54,000
 You need to be trained in your life a lot of training like what how to think how to speak to others

280
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,600
 how to work how to spend your time how to spend your money and how to how to

281
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:08,400
 Fight against your old self. Our old self is the one which is really hard to kill and then how to spend how to

282
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,040
 resist the evil spirits

283
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,120
 temptations

284
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:20,520
 Actually, there are so many areas for which you need to train yourself and then it does not happen

285
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:25,080
 Automatically you need to spend your best quality time

286
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:31,880
 How can you grow you spend your best quality time to grow yourself in faith and in godly?

287
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:37,480
 Lifestyle it requires your new heart and your new lifestyle

288
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:43,600
 So Timothy first Timothy chapter 4 second half of verse 7 says it says

289
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,120
 Train yourself to be godly

290
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:51,080
 Train yourself to be godly training

291
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:59,520
 However at the same time we all know that training ourselves in godliness is very hard

292
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,200
 This is not just a problem of spiritual matters

293
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,920
 Even think about this even taking of your body taking care of your body or

294
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:12,200
 Building a new set of a good habit is very difficult

295
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,840
 Just like now at the beginning of every year

296
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:20,720
 Sometimes you make very good plans very good goals

297
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,920
 But you know just a few days later or at most a few weeks later

298
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:31,520
 Many of us find ourselves not doing the good plan anymore

299
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:41,320
 So building a spiritually healthy habit is actually much harder than this physical habits

300
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:45,440
 Why is it so difficult

301
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:52,160
 in the same verse first Timothy chapter 4 first half of verse 7 says

302
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:58,880
 Have nothing to do with godless myth and old wives tales. Let me repeat one more time

303
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,640
 Have nothing to do with godless myth and old wives tales

304
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,680
 What is that?

305
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,640
 Apostle Paul already two thousand two thousand years ago

306
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:15,320
 He clearly realized the true main reason why people were not growing spiritually

307
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,760
 Why?

308
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:23,520
 Because they were spending all their time in listening to godless myth and old wives tales

309
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:30,840
 Greek myth the godless myth Greek myth were great stories and many even many

310
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:34,360
 Greek myths were made into films even in our days

311
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:40,720
 So like what so Greek myths were like today's blockbuster film. Do you like blockbuster film?

312
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:47,200
 I did or like great movies and how about old wives tales old wives tales were

313
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,080
 superstition

314
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,520
 superstition or

315
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:55,840
 Woman-centered stories which old woman told young women or children

316
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:01,520
 Repeatedly again and again. So like what like today's soap opera or

317
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,720
 dramas

318
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:08,160
 So my brothers and sisters, it's not a problem of our own own generation

319
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:13,640
 2,000 years ago when there is no TV or internet or cell phone

320
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:19,720
 People were already obsessed with the stories and they couldn't grow in their spiritual life

321
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:26,680
 Two forces are fighting right the story of the world and the story of God and

322
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:31,280
 How much more than how much more difficult is it?

323
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:37,600
 Is it to live a truly spirit filled life in our own generation? Why?

324
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,320
 Today people are constantly

325
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:45,780
 Literally 24/7 connected to all kinds of media

326
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,200
 So God knows this

327
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,800
 The Bible commends us to be spirit filled

328
00:26:53,800 --> 00:27:00,840
 Being filled with God's words God's thoughts God's minds and God's desire for our life

329
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:08,680
 However, most of us are actually filled with the spirit of the world, especially through media

330
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:17,040
 Many of us are quite seriously addicted to all kinds of media and the small gods small gods of the world are

331
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:21,400
 Controlling you through media most of the time you need to know this

332
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:28,220
 The small gods of the world are controlling you through media most of the time

333
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:33,560
 That's why you feel quite empty in your heart empty and your life is disorderly

334
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:40,520
 You are busy with those media fidgeting all the time, but you feel that your life does not have any focus or

335
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,480
 direction

336
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,440
 Because you are filled with the spirit of the world day and night

337
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,480
 my

338
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,720
 Dear brothers and sisters

339
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,320
 This is why we need to pray

340
00:27:53,320 --> 00:28:00,480
 Extraordinarily to get out of this addiction addiction to the world and addiction to the spirit of this world

341
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:06,280
 If you pursue them like now if you are not freed from the spirit of the world

342
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:12,000
 They will control you and drive you and they will drive you to meaningless and meaningless

343
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:19,640
 Moments and moments and your spirit and life will never grow. The problem is that you cannot grow

344
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:24,200
 Your relationship and your family life will not grow mature

345
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:29,520
 At the same time, you know this God has a special plan for each one of us

346
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:36,160
 But if you are addicted to the spirit of the world God cannot use you for his purpose

347
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:40,040
 Without being filled with the Holy Spirit God cannot use

348
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,560
 individuals or even a church

349
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:48,720
 We are all God's people whether it's an individual or a church. We need to be filled with a Holy Spirit

350
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,760
 My brothers and sisters, let me close

351
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,920
 In the beginning of every year

352
00:28:55,920 --> 00:29:02,960
 When you are wondering how to bring true meaningful good changes in your life or how to be empowered

353
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:08,200
 To continuously practice those important necessary changes in your life

354
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,800
 Growing in prayer is the greatest solution

355
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:16,560
 When you pray extraordinarily as those

356
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,080
 120 people in today's passage

357
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,320
 God will fill you up with his spirit

358
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:29,000
 You know what and your life and your heart will surely experience the greatest change and the power

359
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,040
 That you cannot get through any other way

360
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:37,800
 Being filled with the Holy Spirit is the true cure for all our inner

361
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:45,920
 Brokenness, we are all broken and sick people and then all our sins and all our broken relationship

362
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:49,960
 Being filled with the Holy Spirit. That is the true cure

363
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:57,720
 So brothers and sisters make the Holy Spirit the number one person in your heart and in your desire

364
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,920
 the number one person

365
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:04,200
 Just like a Google and repent of all your sins thoroughly

366
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:12,320
 Until you truly until you feel truly clean in your conscience and free from your habitual sins

367
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:17,640
 You need to pray until you are freed from your habitual sins. And lastly

368
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:25,160
 Set aside good chunk of time and invest in prayer until you feel until you feel you are

369
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:31,000
 Obsessed you're obsessed with spending time with God. God. I want to spend time with you. I want to pray

370
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,320
 I want to read the Bible until you are obsessed with a holy desire

371
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:40,120
 Then with any other media in your daily life

372
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,520
 God bless you

373
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,520
 so brothers and sisters

374
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,160
 Take the proper posture

375
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:50,560
 Now we are gonna sing the response song

376
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:57,440
 God spoke to you through my message and this is the time you are speaking to God

377
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,040
 God this is my heart

378
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,080

 Please have the desire in your heart Lord. I need you more than anything else

00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,840
 Oh God, how I need you

445
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:28,760
 Brothers and sisters, let's pray together

446
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:34,640
 When you pray take a right posture, you can kneel down on your floor

447
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,520
 Please lower your lower your posture

448
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,240
 We are standing in front of the greatest King

449
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:46,080
 Who knows our hearts and desires and our life?

450
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:54,420
 Who understands the darkest problems in our hearts who understand the most serious problems in our life?

451
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:58,600
 So my brothers and sisters, let's pray together

452
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:02,200
 The prayer music is their prayer music

453
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:11,440
 Okay, let's pray in your heart first prayer as I shared this word brothers and sisters

454
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:19,840
 The reason God cannot empower us the reason we cannot be filled with the Holy Spirit is that we are

455
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:26,680
 Neglecting we do not honor him in many ways. There are so many other idols

456
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:34,000
 We are addicted by all kinds of media. You cannot spend the true quality time with God

457
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:38,360
 And then our heart is filled with all kinds of dirty things

458
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:41,120
 If we are not holy enough

459
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:47,520
 God cannot intervene in our lives. If you do not welcome him the Holy Spirit cannot

460
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:55,920
 Intervene in your life. So my dear brothers and sisters now, let's pray with the right attitude and posture

461
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,280
 God come into my heart

462
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:04,080
 Remove all the dark and dirty sins and remove all the idols inside my heart

463
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:09,140
 Let's have this prayer of repentance together about our idols

464
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:15,600
 About our addictions to media and our dirty sins. Let's have this time of repentance

465
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:22,640
 Our heavenly Father have mercy on us Lord. We are broken people

466
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:29,160
 We are broken people Lord. Even we cannot keep our the best promises to you. Father God

467
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:33,800
 We are all broken people Lord and we do not have any vision in our eyes Lord

468
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:40,080
 Our life and our time is so disorderly Lord. We do not know how to honor you Lord

469
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:45,260
 We do not know how to love you Lord. Your eyes are all the time watching over us Lord

470
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:52,360
 But we are forgetting you in our lives Lord. So God would you do a new thing upon us Lord?

471
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,600
 Have mercy on us Lord. In this year Lord

472
00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:02,240
 Oh Father God do a new thing in all of us Lord. All of the brothers and sisters in our life

473
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:07,720
 What we now need is your spirit Lord. Holy Spirit

474
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:12,120
 We need you Lord. We need you. Come to your people Lord.

475
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:16,480
 Come to your people and do a new thing in their lives Lord

476
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,680
 And my brothers and sisters

477
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:26,440
 Even for the most important thing

478
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:31,680
 Even for the really great things if you do not plan it

479
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,280
 If you do not make a good

480
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:37,000
 very clean plan about it

481
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,720
 You cannot do it

482
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,040
 So after this worship

483
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:46,000
 The Holy Spirit wants to bring the change into our lives. In other words

484
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:50,400
 He wants to lead you to the extraordinary prayer life

485
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:55,760
 So my brothers and sisters now when you pray make a decision in your heart

486
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,000
 God I want to pray more than ever before
