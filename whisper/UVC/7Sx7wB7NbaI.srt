1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 Well, so happy to see all of you, and as I said, I came back last night about 9 to 10

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 p.m.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,200
 And safe and sound, good to see my family, good to see all of you.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:21,000
 And again, we went as a group, 27 people, 12 of them from this church and 15 of them

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 from all over the place, Hong Kong, West Coast and East Coast.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 And what a blessing to have all of us together for the past two weeks and to walk the land,

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 actually.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,640
 This is one of my favorite pictures, and I have tons of pictures, and I want to just

9
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,280
 give me some time to reorganize them.

10
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:48,600
 And starting next Sunday, I'll design a series and introduce to you what happened there.

11
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:55,720
 This is one of the favorite pictures I have because we do have, this round, we do have

12
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:01,600
 a couple of semi-professional photographers, and they did take some good pictures.

13
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,080
 And yeah, I don't know what I'm doing with my right hand, but in any case, this is one

14
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:12,600
 of the places that we went to in the past two weeks, and it was an additional place

15
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,600
 because we found some time.

16
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:21,240
 So I talked to the driver, "Hey, can we just take some off-track places?"

17
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,140
 And so we went.

18
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:28,680
 So we were on that day, on this day, we were going from Jerusalem, which is high on the

19
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,640
 mountain, and all the way to the east, to the Judean wilderness, all the way to the

20
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,840
 Dead Sea and Jericho and all that.

21
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,840
 Remember that, right?

22
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:44,800
 The road from Jericho down to, the road from Jerusalem down to Jericho.

23
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,480
 And there is a road, right?

24
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,800
 And today is the Highway 1 in Israel.

25
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:54,120
 So we were passing different places, and I talked to the tour guide, and I talked to

26
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,080
 the driver, "Hey, do we have time to go over there?"

27
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:06,040
 And we made a left turn into this off-track places.

28
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:13,320
 And the place was called Wadi Q, Q-E-L-T. Wadi is in Arabic.

29
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,880
 It means some dry valley.

30
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:23,760
 Usually it's just seasonal runoff will go after the, go into the valley, but usually

31
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,160
 it's dry.

32
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:31,600
 And what you see on the left is actually the Wadi Q, and it's one of the valleys coming

33
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:36,800
 out of the mountain of Jerusalem all the way to the Dead Sea Valley.

34
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,280
 So it's kind of exotic place.

35
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,760
 Yeah, because we were in this big bus, right?

36
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,760
 27, almost 30 people.

37
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,200
 And then we would drive, I wasn't driving.

38
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:53,340
 I wanted to drive, but the driver was one, just amazing driver.

39
00:02:53,340 --> 00:03:00,880
 And he drove the bus on the cliff of Wadi Q. And we can see, you know, down the window,

40
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,760
 we can see the bottom of the valley.

41
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,240
 And it's just amazing view there, right?

42
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,640
 On the left, lower left, you see a monastery.

43
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:18,200
 The monastery is called St. George Monastery, and it's a monastic community that existed

44
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,760
 since AD 400.

45
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,920
 So it's been around for 1,600 plus years.

46
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,320
 Generation after generation, there are Christians, Eastern Orthodox Christians who gather there

47
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:41,800
 and to live a contemplative life and keeping the tradition of Christianity.

48
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,560
 So it's just amazing.

49
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,880
 And this picture did not show up, perhaps it did.

50
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:52,960
 We were standing on, right on the top of the cliff and looking down to Wadi Q and St.

51
00:03:52,960 --> 00:04:01,880
 George Monastery, and on the other side of the valley, we saw a shepherd grazing the

52
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:06,840
 sheep on the cliff.

53
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,560
 And there were probably like hundreds of sheep and running up and down the cliff and, you

54
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,520
 know, finding food, right?

55
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:23,960
 And this is actually Psalm 23.

56
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:28,800
 The Lord is my shepherd, and I have lack of nothing.

57
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:35,720
 And He leads me into green pastures and quiet waters.

58
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,520
 And what do you think of when you read words like this in Psalm 23?

59
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,920
 Green pastures and quiet waters.

60
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,200
 We always think of the Scottish Highland, right?

61
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,760
 Where everything is green, right?

62
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,600
 This is actually Psalm 23.

63
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,600
 Green pastures.

64
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,780
 Can you see anything green in there?

65
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,160
 Maybe a little bit, right?

66
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,160
 Maybe a little bit.

67
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,400
 But that is the green pastures of Psalm 23.

68
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,840
 Just enough for you, right?

69
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:11,640
 If you follow a wise shepherd, the wilderness is the place for grazing sheep.

70
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,400
 You don't graze a sheep in your olive grove, right?

71
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,200
 In your wheat farm, right?

72
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,460
 Because those are for surplus, for humans, right?

73
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:29,160
 So animals, sheep and donkey and goats, they go out to the wilderness, which is just east

74
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,640
 of Jerusalem.

75
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:36,920
 Often we read of land without water, land without water and wilderness.

76
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,240
 This sort of picture is the wilderness.

77
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,160
 And you think about Psalm 23.

78
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:49,120
 Green pastures is the little green stuff underneath of the rocks.

79
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,760
 The little green stuff, you know, between the cracks and sheep can go out and find them,

80
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,760
 right?

81
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:01,320
 And then they can get just enough, the essentials to be fed on.

82
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,920
 That is the theology of Psalm 23.

83
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,640
 You see quiet water?

84
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,680
 No, just seasonal runoff, right?

85
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,000
 As I said.

86
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,520
 But if you follow a wise shepherd, you get just enough water for you to live.

87
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:21,360
 Just enough for you to survive and even thrive in a land like this, right?

88
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,360
 It's beautiful.

89
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,360
 It's beautiful.

90
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:29,560
 So, you know, in order to understand some of the passages in the Bible, I think it's

91
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,240
 so essential for us to walk the land.

92
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:38,680
 One of my professors who passed away some years ago, Anson Rainey, he's a professional

93
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,280
 biblical geographer.

94
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:46,600
 He always, you know, when you take his classes, we always go out to the field, places like

95
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,600
 this.

96
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,880
 We don't sit in the classroom.

97
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:55,440
 We don't sit in an air conditioner, air conditioner room to listen to a lecture.

98
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,280
 Most of the time we walk out there.

99
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,980
 And sometimes we walk with him.

100
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:04,160
 And Rainey would say, you know, this is the only institute, only classroom that we have

101
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,640
 a one-to-one map.

102
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,320
 Indeed, it was one-to-one, right?

103
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:15,360
 Every step of the way is not the Bible map that we found in the Bible, but it's actually

104
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,200
 walking the land, right?

105
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:25,040
 So he always emphasized one thing is that we have to read the Bible with our feet on

106
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,040
 the ground.

107
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,240
 Our feet on the ground, right?

108
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:34,000
 Not in the ivory tower, but with our feet on the ground, right?

109
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,040
 So yeah, it's beautiful.

110
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,120
 I haven't been to Waterkill for years.

111
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,520
 I've led tours for the past over 10 years.

112
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:47,040
 And usually because we want to hit different sites, different spots, and we want to go

113
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:52,280
 out there and to see as many places as we can.

114
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,520
 But it was such a unique opportunity.

115
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:59,680
 We can just pass through the wilderness and spend extended time there.

116
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,600
 So there I was actually reading Psalm 23.

117
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:11,400
 It's not the Scottish Highland, but God is always faithful, even in wilderness, right?

118
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,320
 Amen to that, right?

119
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,080
 Standing on the ground as we read the Bible, right?

120
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,400
 So yeah, that's what, this is one of my passions.

121
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,680
 And I want to thank the church for letting me and letting the pastor to go away for a

122
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,960
 little bit and to be a blessing to many other people.

123
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:35,040
 And most of the people, we go out to different sites and their first response has always

124
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:39,680
 been, "Wow, ah, yeah, I got it now."

125
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,680
 Right?

126
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,840
 Yeah, you got it now, right?

127
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:47,040
 So walking with our feet on the ground as we read the Bible, right?

128
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,520
 So perhaps next year you can go with me, right?

129
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:57,920
 (speaking in foreign language)

130
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,320
 Okay, we can go anytime.

131
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,280
 I always tell people you can go, you know, next week.

132
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:07,880
 As long as you got a passport and you got a visa card, that's all you need, right?

133
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,080
 But I did bring something back this time.

134
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,120
 So as a tour guide, I got some free gifts.

135
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:19,040
 So I got this mineral hand cream from a hover factory.

136
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,600
 Yeah, so all the way from Dead Sea, right?

137
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,720
 So you can get a little bit after the service, just like a million, you know?

138
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,720
 (audience laughing)

139
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,080
 Share, okay, share.

140
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,080
 Don't drink the bottle, all right?

141
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,840
 Don't drink the bottle, all right.

142
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:39,480
 So it's good to be here and I want to reflect on a short passage today.

143
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:45,280
 And I want to tell you, we, in order to understand the message, the impact of the passage, we

144
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,120
 have to understand the context.

145
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,000
 That's why we have this theme of walking the land.

146
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,200
 You need to understand the biblical background of scripture in order to appreciate what Jesus

147
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,280
 has said.

148
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:02,320
 And this passage is Matthew chapter eight.

149
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,440
 Let's read that first.

150
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,560
 When Jesus saw the crowd around him, he taught them, the disciples, and he instructed the

151
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,960
 disciples to cross to the other side of the lake.

152
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,440
 And this lake is called Sea of Galilee, right?

153
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,840
 The Lake of Galilee, Sea of Galilee.

154
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:22,400
 So they crossed to the other side, away from the crowd, and one of the teachers of religious

155
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:31,240
 law said to Jesus, "Teacher, Rabbi, I will follow you wherever you go."

156
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:37,180
 But Jesus replied, "Foxes have dens to live in and birds have nets, but the Son of Man

157
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:40,600
 has no place even to lay his head."

158
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:48,200
 Then other of his disciples said, "Lord, first let me return home and bury my father."

159
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,240
 But Jesus told him, "Follow me now.

160
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,160
 Let the spiritually dead bury their own dead."

161
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:02,320
 Now first of all, this is a passage, one of the passages about discipleship, about the

162
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,480
 cause of following Jesus.

163
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:10,840
 I must admit the very first time when I was much younger, when I first read this passage,

164
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,440
 I was kind of confused.

165
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:19,360
 This is actually one of the tough sayings of Jesus, one of the most difficult to understand

166
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,200
 sayings in the Bible.

167
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:29,040
 And what he said is that, especially the latter part of it, verses 21 to 22.

168
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:36,440
 Other disciples said to Jesus, "Yeah, I want to follow you, but first let me return home

169
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,520
 and bury my father."

170
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,320
 But Jesus said, "Yeah, go ahead and bury your father and follow me."

171
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,320
 No, he didn't say that.

172
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,560
 He said, "Follow me now.

173
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,560
 Follow me now.

174
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,760
 Let the dead bury their own dead."

175
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,720
 Now that's what I call really confusing, right?

176
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,400
 It's really tough.

177
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,400
 What is going on?

178
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,400
 I just want to bury my father, right?

179
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,840
 So how long would that take?

180
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,000
 Maybe a day or two, right?

181
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,800
 You think about modern burial practices.

182
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,520
 Can we just do that, right?

183
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,120
 And then I'll follow you?

184
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,920
 Because by all means, in Jewish culture, burying one's father is one of the most honorable

185
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,240
 thing for someone to do it, right?

186
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,880
 Especially for son, right?

187
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,480
 In that patriarchal culture, you have to honor your parents, right?

188
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,080
 By the way, that's one of the Ten Commandments, right?

189
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,620
 To respect and to honor your parents.

190
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,160
 And what is going on here?

191
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:36,400
 And I think in order to appreciate the impact of what Jesus has said, you have to understand,

192
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,680
 again, it's the context, the background of the Bible.

193
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:46,800
 The Bible is not something, you know, out of the blue, like a heavenly book.

194
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,800
 It's dropped down from heaven to earth, and then we can read it.

195
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,080
 And the message and the languages are magical.

196
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,400
 No, the Bible has its own context, right?

197
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,880
 In order to understand what the Bible says, we have to understand the background.

198
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,880
 And here we go.

199
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:11,160
 We have to understand in Jesus' time, burial is a huge thing, just as today, right?

200
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:17,520
 No matter you like someone or you don't like someone, if you know him and he passed away,

201
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:23,260
 you probably have to change your clothes, all black, and you go to the funeral home

202
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:27,960
 just to, you know, pay the final respects, right?

203
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:33,540
 It's a huge thing, but in Jesus' time, it was a bigger, huge deal.

204
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:41,160
 So in the Jewish culture, in Jesus' time, they would do this in their burial.

205
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:46,860
 So from left to right, when someone died, what to do with the body?

206
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,640
 What to do with the dead ones?

207
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:56,880
 First, because in the ancient days, they didn't have refrigerator and ways or technology to

208
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:02,920
 preserve the body, and it gets stinky really quickly.

209
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:10,800
 That's why someone died, and then they have to bury the body almost ASAP, almost immediately.

210
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:19,920
 They have to put the body in the tomb, and this is the typical Jewish ritual of burying

211
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,920
 someone.

212
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,280
 So first of all, someone died, all the way to the left.

213
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:29,000
 You're going to go into the burial, almost within 24 hours.

214
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,560
 And then you kick in a seven-day mourning period.

215
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,720
 It's called Shavuot.

216
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,140
 Shavuot means seven in Hebrew.

217
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:43,140
 So seven days, they would mourn at home, almost privately.

218
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:48,200
 And then, after the seven days of Shavuot, they would go into Shaloshim.

219
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,420
 Shalosh is three.

220
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,000
 Shaloshim is 30.

221
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,540
 Thirty days of mourning, and then some of the members of the family and extended relatives,

222
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:03,720
 they will come to your home and visit you, bring you food or bring you gifts and all

223
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:07,500
 that stuff, and 30 days.

224
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,860
 And then you wait for about a year.

225
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:17,420
 So you put the body in the tomb, and then it will take time for the flesh to declay,

226
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,420
 right?

227
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,600
 To be all gone.

228
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:27,860
 And then almost one year later, you will return to the same tomb and to gather the bones,

229
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,860
 right?

230
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:33,660
 If I die, you bury me in the tomb, right?

231
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:37,540
 And then one year later, you come back and you don't see me anymore.

232
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:40,000
 You see my bones, right?

233
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 And that's what they do.

234
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,740
 It's the second burial.

235
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,740
 Second burial.

236
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:50,280
 And they put the bones into some stone boxes called asherurim.

237
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:55,520
 And these boxes, you can still see all over Jerusalem.

238
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:01,500
 And this is one of the pictures of the first century tomb, and they call Kokkim tomb.

239
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,780
 Now this is what I said in the timeline.

240
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:10,860
 Once the body is there, once someone dies, and you have to prepare the body, and you

241
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:14,500
 bring the body into the chamber of the tomb, okay?

242
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:18,660
 By the way, this tomb is right next to a coffee shop.

243
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,780
 Yeah, it's very nice.

244
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:25,500
 You can have a coffee and a croissant right in front of the tomb.

245
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,500
 Interesting.

246
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,780
 It's on Mount Scopus in Jerusalem.

247
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:32,780
 Anyways, you see the entrance of the tomb, right?

248
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:38,380
 Back in the days of Jesus, 2,000 years ago, the tomb is dated to the time of Jesus.

249
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,380
 It was covered.

250
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,860
 It was a cave, actually.

251
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,260
 So now it's open air.

252
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:48,820
 Anyways, it was covered 2,000 years ago, and the ceiling of the cave did not collapse.

253
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,820
 So you go into the entrance.

254
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,820
 Can you see that?

255
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,660
 There are three side benches, right?

256
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:59,780
 And then you bring the dead body on the bench, and you put spices and whatever you need to

257
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,660
 prepare the body for.

258
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:07,580
 And then you're going to prepare it well, and then you're going to stuff the body into,

259
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:09,340
 you know, see the small holes?

260
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,980
 Those are called coke.

261
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:11,980
 K-O-K-H.

262
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:20,220
 You stuff the body in there, and then one of the cokes, or one of the kookim, or kookim

263
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,460
 is plural, coke is singular.

264
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:26,340
 So as you can see, there were a lot of kookim, right?

265
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:30,940
 Because most of the tomb is family tomb, right?

266
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:36,140
 So my father used it, I used it, my son used it, my grandson will use it.

267
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:40,540
 So there were a lot of people being buried in the same place, in the same tomb, because

268
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:43,700
 they belong to the same family.

269
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:47,100
 So that's why they were, it's like a refrigerator, all right?

270
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:52,620
 You put the body in the kookim, and then what do you do?

271
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,620
 What do you do?

272
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:57,900
 You go home for seven days of mourning, and then 30 days of mourning, and then?

273
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,020
 And then you wait, right?

274
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,100
 For one year.

275
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:07,260
 And the body stay in the tomb, in the kook, or kookim, and then let the flesh decay, and

276
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:12,100
 when everything is gone, you go back one year later for the second burial, which is the

277
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,180
 ossuary, right?

278
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:21,460
 Or you see, one year later, you open the tomb again, go inside, and gather the bones into

279
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,100
 boxes like this.

280
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:28,100
 Some of them are decorated with some geometric design.

281
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:32,860
 Some of them are bigger, some of them are smaller.

282
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:39,300
 And the length of the stone box is the length of your longest bone.

283
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,940
 Where is your longest bone in your body?

284
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:42,940
 Right here, what do you call it?

285
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:43,940
 - Femur.

286
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:44,940
 - Femur, right?

287
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,400
 Femur, yeah, this one.

288
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,400
 So for me, I probably need a bigger box.

289
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:57,540
 Anyways, it's just a matter of, it's a business of recycling, right?

290
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:02,240
 Because they are doing a lot of different stone work and stone building, especially

291
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:09,140
 Herb the Great, he built or expand the temple in Jerusalem so big, and that's why there

292
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,680
 were so many leftover stones, right?

293
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:17,560
 And they make vessels out of the stones, and one of the vessels is the ossuary.

294
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:23,560
 So they will go back one year later and gather all the bones and put them all in the stone

295
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,600
 box.

296
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:31,200
 And then you put the box by the entrance or by the, just on the side of the chamber.

297
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,400
 So the dead upon dead will be gathered in the tomb.

298
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,800
 And then the new dead will be buried in the same tomb, and then you go through the same

299
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:48,080
 cycle, three days and, what, seven days and 30 days, and one year, you go back for a second

300
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:53,700
 burial, gathering the bones and put in the stone boxes.

301
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:59,000
 So with that background, you can actually understand what happened, first of all, on

302
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 Good Friday.

303
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 All right, Good Friday.

304
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:09,120
 Good Friday, when Jesus died, his body has to be buried, buried, right, immediately,

305
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,120
 right?

306
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:13,720
 And remember what time Jesus died on Friday?

307
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,720
 Before Shabbat, right?

308
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,720
 Before Shabbat.

309
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,280
 Once Shabbat kicks in, you cannot do any work.

310
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:23,040
 You have to wait for another 24 hours, right, to continue to work.

311
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,160
 So that's what happened on Good Friday.

312
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:33,520
 Jesus died, and quite unexpectedly, and the women disciples, or the disciples, would put

313
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:43,000
 his body into one of these tombs, and the Bible says it's a new tomb, a new tomb for

314
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,800
 the important people.

315
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:52,160
 So they would put his body on the bench, and because Shabbat is coming, and they could

316
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,180
 not finish the work, right?

317
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,720
 They got to get out of the tomb, because it's Shabbat, right?

318
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:04,260
 You got to purify yourself in order to prepare yourself for Sabbath of 24 hours.

319
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:08,480
 So they exit the tomb, and then when did they come back?

320
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,720
 After Shabbat, right?

321
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,720
 After 24 hours.

322
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,600
 And then on the first day of the week, it's the first day of the work.

323
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:19,620
 So they return, the women return to the tomb, and they try to, probably they would ask someone

324
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:27,400
 to open the tomb again, and come back, and just finish off whatever they did not finish.

325
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:34,260
 It was kind of in a hurry, so they didn't finish all the ritual of mourning and burial.

326
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:37,120
 So that's what they were planning to do.

327
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:44,540
 Returning to the tomb for the first burial, put Jesus' body into what?

328
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,640
 One of the kukims, right?

329
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,640
 Stuff him.

330
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:54,720
 Stuff him into one of the holes, and wait for another year, and come back for asurery.

331
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,920
 That's what happened on Good Friday.

332
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:03,480
 With that picture, or with this timeline, you would understand what, oh this is one

333
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,600
 of the diagrams, this is better, right?

334
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:10,640
 The entrance is on top, or it's middle of the picture.

335
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:18,000
 You remove that big stone, and you get into the cave.

336
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,360
 You have the center chamber, and then you have kukims.

337
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,080
 In any case, with this timeline, you can understand what Jesus said.

338
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,200
 He said what?

339
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,120
 First of all, and other disciples said to him, "Lord, first let me return home and bury

340
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,800
 my father."

341
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:43,160
 But Jesus replied, "Follow me now, let the dead bury their dead."

342
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,840
 That's what happened here.

343
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,400
 Now I want to ask you a question.

344
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,760
 With that background, I explain.

345
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:55,040
 This and other disciple who came to Jesus and said, "Hey, first let me return home and

346
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:59,080
 bury my father."

347
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:05,800
 For this disciple, assuming his father just passed away, when did this disciple approach

348
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:10,160
 Jesus with that request?

349
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,640
 When?

350
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,880
 Is it before first burial, or before second burial?

351
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:24,120
 There's no way for this guy to have any room to come to Jesus and follow him and say, "Hey,

352
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,960
 first let me go back and bury my father."

353
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:33,160
 There's no way that he can find time before the first burial.

354
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,880
 You understand what I'm saying?

355
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:42,920
 So it has to be this guy, when he approached Jesus, he already done his first burial.

356
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:46,360
 And he's waiting for another year, right?

357
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:50,200
 Because the second burial has to be done, right?

358
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:55,600
 So when this and other disciple approach Jesus, it has to be between the first burial and

359
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,320
 second burial.

360
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:02,680
 So what he meant when he said to Jesus, "First let me return home and bury my father."

361
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:07,080
 He was referring to the second burial, the ossuary.

362
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:14,740
 So he is asking Jesus, "Hey, I want to follow you, but hey, let me have some time.

363
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:19,260
 And let me get the ossuary done first, the second burial."

364
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:23,480
 So essentially, he was asking Jesus for a year time.

365
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:29,800
 "I want to follow you, but next year, because I want to get something done, right?

366
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,800
 The second burial.

367
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,480
 It's not done yet."

368
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,920
 Do you understand what I'm saying?

369
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:38,840
 There's no way his father just died and then he would come and follow Jesus, right?

370
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:42,520
 This is the most dishonorable thing to do, right?

371
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:45,840
 His father died, indeed, it's pretty sad.

372
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:50,520
 But he has already done his first burial because first burial happened almost immediately,

373
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,520
 right?

374
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,440
 There was no time for this guy to approach and follow Jesus.

375
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:02,080
 And this, another disciple actually is between the first and second burial and asking Jesus,

376
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:08,040
 "Hey, can I have some time before I follow you?

377
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:13,040
 Let me first go back home and bury the dead."

378
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:22,200
 Now in rabbinical tradition, for all the sons, especially the firstborn son, there are three

379
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,280
 rituals in their lives that are most important.

380
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:29,200
 Think about your life, in your lifetime.

381
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:34,240
 What are the most important things that you could have done?

382
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,920
 You could have done, right?

383
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:43,800
 For the Jewish tradition, the first most important thing, most important ritual for all Jewish

384
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,800
 men, the first one is circumcision.

385
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:52,360
 It's done on the eighth day after the child is born, right?

386
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,480
 So it's done.

387
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,720
 That's the most important ritual they have to go through.

388
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:04,160
 The second most important moment in their life or ritual in their life is wedding.

389
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,160
 Get married.

390
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,160
 That is the biggest day.

391
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:14,160
 And the third one, actually according to ancient literature, Jewish literature, is the second

392
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,160
 burial.

393
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,160
 It's the ossuary.

394
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:26,160
 Because you will finish the duty, the honorable duty of the firstborn son.

395
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,240
 So it's not really the first burial that is important.

396
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:34,240
 The most important thing is wait for another year until you come back to the same tomb

397
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:39,160
 and gather the bones of your father into ossuaries.

398
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:46,840
 That is the most important ritual and most important social honors one has to gain.

399
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:51,960
 Now with this background, you understand the impact of the passage.

400
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,320
 You understand what Jesus is trying to say.

401
00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:02,520
 Because the entire Bible from Genesis to Revelation, no one can claim the authority higher than

402
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,220
 your parents.

403
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:10,360
 Remember I said one of the Ten Commandments is honor your father and your mother, right?

404
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:16,000
 Your parents, in this kind of culture, is the most important people on earth.

405
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,480
 You have to honor them.

406
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:22,360
 You have to pay respect to them, right?

407
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:29,080
 From the first page of the Bible to the last page, nobody can claim the authority higher

408
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:35,000
 than your human parents, except God himself.

409
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,800
 Only God can step in and say, "I have a higher authority.

410
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:47,640
 You honor me above all others, even your parents, even your grandparents."

411
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:55,880
 So as you can see, what Jesus is claiming is actually the authority of divinity.

412
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:59,280
 He is not a normal guy.

413
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:10,080
 He has power and authority and honor much higher, infinitely higher than any human authority,

414
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,880
 including your parents.

415
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,600
 Remember I said I quote this line to you before?

416
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,480
 Listen up.

417
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:27,680
 This line says, "Either Christ is Lord of all, or he is not Lord at all."

418
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,520
 Right?

419
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:33,480
 A.B. Simpson, founder of Alliance Church.

420
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:41,080
 Christ is all of all, otherwise he is not Lord at all.

421
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,720
 So my point is, there are two basic points.

422
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:47,280
 Let me go back to this slide.

423
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:53,560
 This passage is the priority of following Jesus.

424
00:28:53,560 --> 00:29:00,080
 Following Jesus, honoring him, worshipping him and serving him is above all.

425
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:05,960
 Above your own emotional stuff you have to deal with, above your parental authorities,

426
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,960
 above everything else.

427
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,920
 And Jesus is the highest because he is God himself.

428
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:16,240
 He is the Lord of everything.

429
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,280
 He is over everything of your life.

430
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,920
 It's the priority of following Jesus.

431
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:27,400
 And secondly, it's the timing of following Jesus.

432
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,400
 I gave you the chart.

433
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:33,960
 I gave you the timeline of a typical Jewish burial in Jesus' day.

434
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:41,160
 And I already explained how it is for this and other disciples to approach Jesus.

435
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:48,080
 This has to be after the first burial and before the second burial, the austerity.

436
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:54,440
 So this and other disciples is asking Jesus for a different timing of following him.

437
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:59,960
 He said, "Yes, I want to follow you, but let me delay for about another year and then

438
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,560
 I will decide to follow you."

439
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,560
 And Jesus said what?

440
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,360
 "Let the dead bury the dead."

441
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,160
 What does it mean?

442
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:12,400
 With that tomb picture in your mind, you understand what Jesus said.

443
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:16,580
 Because inside a family tomb there were so many dead people, right?

444
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:21,680
 In the past, your grandparents, the great-grandparents, the bones were there.

445
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:26,580
 The dead were with the dead in the tomb.

446
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:29,160
 And Jesus was saying, "Hey, you need to follow me.

447
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,640
 You have to follow me now."

448
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:39,360
 And also, if you understand the story flow, the story plot of the Bible, the Gospel of

449
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,680
 Matthew specifically, we read chapter 8.

450
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:49,960
 Chapter 8, Jesus already started his prophet ministry and he was on his way to Jerusalem

451
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:58,060
 and die on the cross, crucify, die, be buried, and rise again.

452
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:01,400
 How much time does he have?

453
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:07,760
 How much time does Jesus have between the disciple approaching him to the time of Jerusalem,

454
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,000
 his death?

455
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,800
 Less than a year.

456
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,520
 Less than a year.

457
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:18,240
 As you can tell, this another disciple did have the intention to follow Jesus, but he

458
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,920
 did not understand the time is running out.

459
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:27,920
 If you don't follow Jesus now, you will never be able to follow him.

460
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,440
 You see what I'm saying?

461
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,400
 Because he will be gone.

462
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,960
 If you really need to follow this rabbi, if you really need to follow Christ, you've got

463
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:42,080
 to do it now because according to the story of the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus had less than

464
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,360
 a year on earth.

465
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:50,040
 There's no time for you to wait for another second burial to be done, anything to be done,

466
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:53,520
 any stuff that you have to do.

467
00:31:53,520 --> 00:32:01,080
 Just a reminder for us, if we follow Jesus, we better do it now because he claims the

468
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,640
 highest priority.

469
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,640
 And also, your time is running out.

470
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,560
 You have to follow him.

471
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:13,680
 Following Jesus is the biggest deal.

472
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:22,080
 There are many matters in our lives are big deals, but there is no bigger deal than following

473
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,240
 Christ.

474
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:28,320
 There's no one greater than Jesus himself in terms of authority.

475
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:32,040
 So Jesus said, "Let the dead bury the dead."

476
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:41,360
 He's actually poking fun of the complicated burial ritual the Jewish had.

477
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,440
 It's too complicated to follow.

478
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:50,320
 It's actually challenging us to lay aside anything that is stopping us from following

479
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:59,360
 Jesus today, at this moment, not tomorrow, not next month, not next year, because who

480
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:03,040
 knows, right?

481
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:15,360
 In our past two weeks, I was with the 27 people on the trip and I think by the end of first

482
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:22,320
 week, some of the members are from Hong Kong, they received really shocking news because

483
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:31,240
 one of their relatives suddenly had a stroke and she's a young mother, 30-some years old,

484
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:38,160
 had a stroke on the street, didn't have any sign, and she had a stroke, a massive stroke,

485
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:47,720
 and she was immediately hospitalized in ICU, 30-some years old, and we were praying for

486
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:53,680
 her on our trip almost every single day, all of us, praying for her.

487
00:33:53,680 --> 00:34:00,480
 And I think she's still alive in ICU, but in a very critical condition.

488
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:07,440
 What I want to tell you is that if you want to follow Jesus, this is the time.

489
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,320
 Not wait until something has been fixed, right?

490
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:16,200
 Not wait, like, "Okay, let the church be better and then I'll follow Jesus."

491
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:24,760
 Or, "Let me take care of my relational issues and my work or my career, and even I won't

492
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:27,520
 follow Jesus until I retire."

493
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:31,200
 If that is so, I don't think this Jesus is what I want.

494
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,600
 I don't think this is the Lord of all.

495
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,800
 Jesus is not the God worthy of my following.

496
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,760
 If I have to wait and He will become my footnote of my life.

497
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:45,640
 No, Jesus is the content of your life, not the footnote.

498
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:48,280
 We are the footnotes.

499
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:57,240
 So I want to remind you, following Jesus is now, not tomorrow, not next year.

500
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,960
 Let's all pray together.

501
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:09,480
 Pray that we will return and repent from our delay, delaying our decision in ways that

502
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,480
 you can think of.

503
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:15,880
 You know, sometimes we have reservation of following Jesus because this or that, no matter

504
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:23,080
 what is this or what is that, Jesus has the highest authority and following Him is now.

505
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:33,120
 Father, we come before you, we realize that your Son, Jesus Christ, is the Lord of all.

506
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:37,880
 And I pray that at this moment, all the brothers and sisters, Christ, all the friends, we do

507
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:41,400
 have some stuff we have to deal with.

508
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:50,840
 And perhaps some of the issues in our lives, our career, our work, our study, almost anything

509
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:59,720
 we can think of can be the barrier, the barrier of following you right now.

510
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:04,200
 And I pray that you will listen to us, listen to our prayers.

511
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:17,200
 Help us see that you are the God worthy of our praise, worthy of our following.

512
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:22,840
 And I pray that at this moment, your Spirit will cleanse us, lay aside all the issues,

513
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:28,240
 worries and reluctance that will come and follow you right now.

514
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,640
 In Christ's name we pray.

515
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:31,760
 Amen.
