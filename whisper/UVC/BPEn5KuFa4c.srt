1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
 - Thank you, Kelly.

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:07,640
 Good morning, UV.

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,660
 It is good to be back here with you all,

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:14,040
 and I hope you guys get some time to enjoy the spring weather

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,840
 and just seeing different flowers blooming,

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,200
 the colors, there's like all around the streets.

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,980
 This is my favorite time of the year.

8
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,400
 Okay, this morning we're gonna continue with our series

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,480
 on Jesus' Sermon on the Mount.

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,100
 And today we're gonna look at this,

11
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:34,840
 okay, pursuing kingdom righteousness.

12
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,200
 But before that, let us pray together first.

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,880
 Heavenly Father, as we prepare to open up your word

14
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,300
 this morning, I just ask that your spirit

15
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,440
 will be in each and every one of our heart.

16
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,400
 As we receive your word being proclaimed,

17
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,840
 that your spirit will do your work in our hearts

18
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,640
 to transform us into people that represent your kingdom,

19
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,800
 into people of love, into people that the world

20
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,800
 will recognize that we belong to you.

21
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,400
 Because we know that your word is living and active.

22
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,480
 So allow your word to do the transforming work

23
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,380
 in our hearts.

24
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:22,280
 Father, I also ask that your Holy Spirit

25
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,080
 will be with me this morning as I preach your word

26
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,260
 that anything that is not from you,

27
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,460
 that you will take them away.

28
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:33,880
 And may your word and your word alone be proclaimed.

29
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,720
 I pray this in your son's name, amen.

30
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,340
 I don't know if there's the breathing voice

31
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,940
 coming through the mic, but hopefully that is not

32
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:45,180
 too distracting for you all.

33
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,340
 Okay, if you are a basketball fan,

34
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,820
 this time of the year is usually some of the most

35
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,820
 exciting time because the NBA playoff

36
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,700
 is actually happening right now.

37
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,460
 And most of the teams that are able to make it

38
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:01,260
 this far into the seasons are usually led by

39
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,060
 one or maybe two superstars.

40
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,860
 And so these matchups are usually pretty fun

41
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:07,980
 to watch as well.

42
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:13,120
 But what makes a great players like LeBron James

43
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,960
 or Micah Jordan or Steph Curry

44
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,920
 such a great basketball players?

45
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,940
 While there are many different positions

46
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,300
 on the basketball court, these are some of the

47
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,700
 common characteristics that makes someone

48
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,460
 a great NBA players.

49
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:31,260
 First, of course, there is the basketball skills.

50
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,960
 How well can they score?

51
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,100
 Or how well can they defend?

52
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,400
 Or how well can they make a play?

53
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,420
 And then there's also basketball IQ.

54
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,440
 How well do they understand the game?

55
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,540
 And are they able to read the opponents

56
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,000
 and respond accordingly?

57
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,340
 And of course, there's the work ethic

58
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:55,060
 and also attitude, both on and off the courts.

59
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:58,100
 And lastly, there's also some intangibles as well,

60
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,900
 like leaderships, versatility,

61
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,860
 or if they're able to make a clutch plays

62
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,860
 when a team needs them.

63
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,340
 So all of these are some of the basic characteristics

64
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,500
 that makes someone a good basketball players.

65
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:18,900
 But now if I ask, what makes someone a good Christian?

66
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,020
 How would you answer it?

67
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:25,700
 And how different do you think the answer would be

68
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:29,380
 if I ask non-believers these same questions?

69
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:32,900
 I'm currently in the running groups

70
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:36,980
 and we do a group run every Friday morning at 6.40.

71
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,660
 And usually when we do a group run,

72
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,780
 so you would just end up talking to the person

73
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,940
 right next to you, right, for probably like

74
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,660
 about 30 minutes.

75
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,460
 And usually when people find out that I'm a pastor,

76
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,620
 the first thing that they will usually mention to me

77
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,780
 is either, oh, I actually used to go to church growing up,

78
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,140
 but I just stopped going now.

79
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,980
 Or, hey, I actually went to church with a friend of mine

80
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:00,020
 over Easter or over Christmas.

81
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,380
 And if I ask them these questions,

82
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,060
 what do you guys think makes someone a good Christian?

83
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:08,100
 I'm fairly confident that a majority of them will say,

84
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,580
 okay, a good Christian is probably someone

85
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,020
 who goes to church regularly,

86
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,820
 because to them, going to church

87
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,620
 is some of the most basic activities

88
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,420
 that all Christian participate in.

89
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,660
 And when it comes to Jesus days,

90
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,180
 there were also a few activities

91
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,220
 that became sort of like the identity marker

92
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,580
 of a good and pious Jews,

93
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,040
 because these are some of the most basic religious duties

94
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,780
 that a Jewish person have to sort of like

95
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,440
 be responsible for.

96
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,420
 But in our passage today,

97
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:43,220
 we'll see how Jesus subverts the norms of his days

98
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,340
 on what makes someone a faithful or devout Jews.

99
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,980
 But before that, let's enjoy our passage

100
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,940
 in the larger context of the Sermon on the Mount.

101
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,440
 So in Jesus' Sermon on the Mount,

102
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,220
 there is three major section that sort of like

103
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,860
 made up the main content for this sermon.

104
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,460
 And in the first major section,

105
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,540
 that is in Matthew chapter five,

106
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,980
 we learn that the truly blessed life

107
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,260
 comes from having an intimate relationship

108
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:14,500
 with our heavenly father, true Jesus Christ,

109
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,380
 and following after Jesus' example

110
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:20,020
 to live in a way that embodies his kingdom righteousness.

111
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,780
 In this first section,

112
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,960
 Jesus focused on the true righteousness

113
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,500
 that exceeds that of the Pharisees

114
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,320
 and the teachers of the law.

115
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,860
 But in our section in Matthew chapter six today,

116
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:36,020
 Jesus continues with his teaching on righteousness.

117
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,980
 But this time, instead of focusing

118
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:41,180
 on the positive aspect of righteousness,

119
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:44,780
 Jesus is going to focus on the wrong kind of righteousness,

120
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,160
 false righteousness.

121
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,680
 Moreover, while the better righteousness

122
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,060
 in Matthew chapter five has to do with our relationship

123
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,900
 with each other, that is sort of like

124
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,020
 the horizontal aspect of our relationship,

125
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,440
 right here in Matthew chapter six,

126
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,220
 the righteousness that Jesus talks about

127
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,000
 has to do with our relationship with him.

128
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,520
 So the vertical relationship between us and between God.

129
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,820
 And as we'll see later in our passage,

130
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,460
 showing off one's personal devotion to God

131
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:18,540
 or one's personal righteousness has become an avenue

132
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,980
 where someone in Jesus' days can do this

133
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,660
 to gain respect from the community.

134
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,820
 Or they can do this to kind of like

135
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,880
 increase their social status.

136
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,860
 And so Jesus, specifically,

137
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,620
 he warns again these kind of righteousness,

138
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,540
 the performative righteousness,

139
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,380
 the wrong kind of righteousness for his followers.

140
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,380
 So let's look at our passage today in Matthew chapter six.

141
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:47,340
 So Matthew six begins like this, be careful.

142
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,100
 So Jesus doesn't waste any time

143
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,300
 and he gets straight to his point with this imperative

144
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,620
 or with this authoritative command,

145
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:58,260
 be careful or be aware.

146
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:02,820
 And when Jesus say, be careful, we need to pay attention.

147
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,460
 And so what is Jesus trying to warn us here about?

148
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,800
 He says, be careful not to practice your righteousness

149
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,220
 in front of others to be seen by them.

150
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,660
 If you do, you will have no reward

151
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,640
 from your father in heaven.

152
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:20,460
 So this verse right here, verse one,

153
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,500
 will serve as sort of like an overarching structure

154
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,100
 for our passage today.

155
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,900
 So let's break it down a little bit.

156
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,300
 So right here, there's four elements

157
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,100
 that Jesus will repeat on each of the examples

158
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,540
 that we'll be looking at today.

159
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,660
 So the first one is the action.

160
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,860
 So the action that Jesus talks about right here,

161
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:42,100
 the overarching actions is practicing righteousness.

162
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,700
 And what righteousness means is pretty much

163
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,260
 is how to live rightly before the Lord.

164
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,500
 And right here specifically,

165
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,020
 the emphasis is on our actions and on our deeds.

166
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,780
 And then the second element is the manner

167
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,820
 of practicing this righteousness.

168
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,720
 It is in front of other people.

169
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,320
 And then the third element, the motive,

170
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:05,320
 is to be seen and approved by other people as well.

171
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,120
 And then the final element, the consequences,

172
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,680
 Jesus say you will have no reward

173
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,620
 from your father in heaven.

174
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:17,000
 So right here, what Jesus is having an issue is

175
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,520
 with more specifically on the second and the third element,

176
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,520
 the manner and the motives

177
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,400
 in which we practice our righteousness.

178
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,800
 So with that in mind, this is the main idea

179
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,660
 that we'll be diving into today from our passage.

180
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:36,160
 A worldly disciple pursues right living

181
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,040
 for the applause of people.

182
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:42,280
 But a kingdom disciple pursues right living

183
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,920
 for the affirmation of the Father.

184
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:49,100
 So we'll look at this idea from the three different examples

185
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,720
 that Jesus has given.

186
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,080
 That is the first one, giving to the poor,

187
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,440
 second, praying, and then the third one, on fasting.

188
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,560
 And why these three examples specifically?

189
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,040
 Well, again, these are some of the most basic

190
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,800
 Jewish practice and religious activities

191
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,760
 that Jews can express their devotion to God.

192
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,960
 In other words, these three activities

193
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,320
 are the identity marker of a good Jewish person.

194
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,560
 If you check all of these off,

195
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,200
 that basically means you are a pretty decent Jew.

196
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,720
 And again, through these examples,

197
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,280
 Jesus is trying to show us that as a disciples of Jesus,

198
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,320
 as his kingdom disciples,

199
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,120
 we strive to live a holy and righteous life,

200
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,960
 not for the praise of other people,

201
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,800
 but to be seen by our heavenly Father alone.

202
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,120
 So let's take a look at each of these three examples today.

203
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,180
 And the first one is giving to the poor.

204
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:48,380
 So Matthew chapter six, verse two.

205
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,320
 So when you give to the needy,

206
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,400
 do not announce it with trumpets

207
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,800
 as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets.

208
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,960
 To be honored by others.

209
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,560
 Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.

210
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,920
 But when you give to the needy,

211
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,040
 do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing

212
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,360
 so that your giving may be in secret.

213
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,680
 Then your father who sees what is done in secret

214
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,900
 will reward you.

215
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,960
 So if you remember the four element here,

216
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,920
 the first one is the action, right?

217
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,040
 So the action that Jesus focused on here

218
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,360
 is giving to the poor.

219
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,480
 And then the manner that Jesus warns against

220
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,280
 is announcing it with trumpets as these hypocrites do

221
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,280
 in synagogues or on the streets.

222
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,120
 So a little background context on giving to the poor

223
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,360
 or almsgiving from the Bible.

224
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,080
 In the Old Testament, social justice

225
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,180
 is actually a pretty prominent themes all throughout,

226
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,840
 but especially in the prophets.

227
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,880
 And when it comes to the intertestamental period,

228
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,840
 that is the time between the Old Testament

229
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,000
 and the New Testament,

230
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:00,120
 giving to the poor has become a sign of religious piety.

231
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,720
 And so fast forward to Jesus days,

232
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,840
 giving to the poor has pretty much become synonymous

233
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,360
 with righteousness.

234
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,920
 And when people give,

235
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,060
 they don't usually give directly to the needy,

236
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,880
 but they give it through the synagogues.

237
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,000
 And so the synagogues,

238
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,720
 they will function like a social agency,

239
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,760
 similar to the charities or nonprofits

240
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,400
 that we're familiar today,

241
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,820
 like Salvation Army or World Vision,

242
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,120
 where this agency,

243
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,800
 they will collect the donation from the community

244
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,040
 and then distribute it to the poor

245
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,460
 in the community as well.

246
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:38,040
 So while this public display of generosity

247
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,760
 is a way to celebrate God's goodness

248
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,400
 and generosity towards his own people,

249
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,120
 the hypocrites, on the other hand,

250
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,240
 they will take this as an opportunity

251
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,400
 to show off their generosity

252
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,560
 so that they can receive praise from other people.

253
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,980
 Simply put, their motivation here

254
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:00,360
 is to simply be seen and be praised by other people.

255
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,820
 So what Jesus warns against here is this.

256
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,780
 When you give to the poor,

257
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,260
 don't draw attention to your acts of kindness

258
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,960
 and generosity like these hypocrites do.

259
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:15,300
 And the word hypocrite here will actually be mentioned

260
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,620
 in all three of our examples today as well.

261
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,740
 So I think it is worthwhile to spend a little time

262
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,060
 just to understand what Jesus is referring to.

263
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:26,480
 So this word originally referred to a stage players

264
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,200
 or an actor in a Greek theater

265
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,560
 who put on mask to play all these different roles

266
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,960
 in the play.

267
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,600
 And usually, they will put on mask

268
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,280
 to pretend to be someone that they are not, right?

269
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,320
 So by the time of the New Testament,

270
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,320
 these words started to take on a more negative connotation,

271
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,760
 referring to someone who pretends to be morally good

272
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,480
 or morally virtuous,

273
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,560
 but they're just being false and empty inside.

274
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,960
 Essentially, someone who is a moral actor.

275
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:59,900
 I'm sure we all are familiar with someone like that, right?

276
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,620
 Growing up in Malaysia,

277
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,660
 usually when there's a flood or a house that got burned down

278
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,580
 or some sort of natural disaster that happened,

279
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,700
 the local politicians will usually show up

280
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,820
 to provide some sort of assistance

281
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,520
 and aid to these people, right?

282
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,880
 Because that is part of their job,

283
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,980
 that they're being elected by the people

284
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,240
 to serve the people.

285
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,540
 However, most of the time, when the politicians show up,

286
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,260
 they don't just come by themselves.

287
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:27,720
 They usually show up with the social media team

288
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,260
 or reporters from different news outlet

289
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,960
 or journalists from different newspaper

290
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:37,020
 in order that the good works can somewhat be documented

291
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,900
 and then being shown to the public.

292
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,900
 Look, look at what I've done for you all.

293
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,220
 And the funny thing is,

294
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:46,220
 the closer it gets to an election year,

295
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,900
 these kind of operations will become

296
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,500
 more and more frequent.

297
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,820
 They will start to visit the poorer part of the city

298
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,540
 and then take a photo there,

299
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:57,060
 or they will visit hospital or orphanage in the city,

300
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,980
 or do whatever they need, the publicity stunt,

301
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,820
 to increase the reputation.

302
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:07,580
 And the consequences of putting up a show for generosity

303
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,780
 like the hypocrites, this is what Jesus warns.

304
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:15,460
 "Truly, I tell you, they have received the reward in full."

305
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,720
 This can be a little bit confusing at first

306
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,900
 because you might wonder,

307
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,300
 "Jesus, I thought you warned against

308
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,340
 "this kind of public display of generosity.

309
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,860
 "How come they're still able to receive a reward

310
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:29,820
 "and even receive a reward in full?"

311
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,020
 So let's unpack that a little bit.

312
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,020
 So what Jesus is saying here

313
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,460
 is that they have received their full reward

314
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:39,380
 now in the earthly sense.

315
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,320
 Put it another way, Jesus is saying that

316
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,540
 if you give to the poor

317
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:46,500
 with the intention of receiving praise from people,

318
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,940
 then praise from people is all you're ever going to get.

319
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,860
 And God pretty much owes you nothing.

320
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:56,100
 So in this way, your reward is in the here and now.

321
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,460
 Your reward is pretty much temporary.

322
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:01,520
 And from another perspective,

323
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,620
 you're actually not giving to the poor,

324
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:07,120
 but you're sort of like buying your praises from people.

325
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,200
 So your reward is also transactional as well.

326
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,420
 Every time you want to receive honor or receive praise,

327
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,620
 you just give to the poor

328
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:18,460
 so that you pretty much buy your praises,

329
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,620
 buy the action of giving to the poor.

330
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:25,660
 So how should we give as his disciples?

331
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:28,620
 As kingdom disciples,

332
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:32,020
 how should we do this act of kindness towards the needy?

333
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,980
 And what kind of manner should we have?

334
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,940
 So in verse three and four, Jesus say,

335
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,020
 "When you give to the poor, to the needy,

336
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,540
 "do not let your left hand know

337
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,300
 "what your right hand is doing,

338
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,060
 "so that your giving may be in secret.

339
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,740
 "Then your father who sees what is done in secret

340
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,040
 "will reward you."

341
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,860
 So what Jesus say is this,

342
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:56,380
 when we give to the poor or when we help those in need,

343
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,900
 do it in secret or privacy,

344
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,900
 to the extent that even our left hand

345
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,000
 doesn't know what our right hand is doing.

346
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,500
 And to be able to show kindness and generosity

347
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,100
 to this extent requires us

348
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,860
 to completely disregard ourself, right?

349
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,160
 That is what Jesus mean,

350
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,620
 that your left hand doesn't know

351
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,540
 what your right hand is doing.

352
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:20,500
 It is a point where we need to completely disregard ourself.

353
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,180
 And the outcome of it,

354
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:25,320
 we will receive our heavenly reward from the Father.

355
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,300
 And one thing to note here,

356
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,940
 Jesus does not mean that we give

357
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,900
 because we want to receive a reward

358
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,900
 from our heavenly Father.

359
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,260
 We give from a cheerful and sincere heart

360
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,260
 for several reasons.

361
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,500
 If you recall at the end of Matthew five,

362
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,420
 the command to be perfect as our heavenly Father is,

363
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,460
 our goal on this side of heaven

364
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,580
 is to be like our heavenly Father.

365
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,420
 And from the Bible,

366
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,020
 we know that our heavenly Father

367
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,220
 is one who cares for the poor,

368
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,660
 the marginalized,

369
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:59,140
 and those in which the world has little regard for.

370
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:02,220
 So when we give to the poor or help those in need,

371
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:05,100
 we are living out our kingdom identity

372
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,440
 as the son and daughters of God.

373
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:11,740
 And secondly, we give to the poor because we love him

374
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,340
 and we want to give back a portion

375
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,140
 of what he has blessed us with.

376
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,020
 Later in Matthew,

377
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,420
 in the parable of the sheep and goat,

378
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,620
 Jesus himself emphasized that

379
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:24,580
 whatever we do to the least among us,

380
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,900
 we do it to Jesus himself.

381
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,740
 So as disciples of Jesus,

382
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:32,740
 we pursue generosity and kindness,

383
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:35,840
 not for the temporary glory from men,

384
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,700
 like the hypocrites or the worldly disciples do,

385
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,440
 but we do it for the affirmation from our heavenly Father.

386
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,620
 So this is the first examples on giving to the poor.

387
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:50,740
 Then Jesus moved on to the second examples, prayer.

388
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,460
 So let's start with some background context

389
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:55,120
 to prayer in the Jewish culture.

390
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,060
 If you are a Jews,

391
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:00,660
 there are set times of prayer for you every day.

392
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,080
 As traditionally,

393
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,120
 the Jews, they will pray at least twice a day,

394
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,000
 one in the morning and one in the evening.

395
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,040
 And usually during those set hours of prayers,

396
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,720
 they will pray the Shema prayer,

397
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,600
 which is from Deuteronomy.

398
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,500
 Hear, O Israel, the Lord, your God, the Lord is one.

399
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,640
 And so when it comes to prayer,

400
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,720
 more specifically on personal prayer,

401
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,400
 this is what Jesus has to say.

402
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,240
 And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites,

403
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,840
 for they love to pray standing in the synagogues

404
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,120
 and on the street corners to be seen by others.

405
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,480
 Truly, I tell you, they have received their reward in full.

406
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,240
 But when you pray, go into your room,

407
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,360
 close the door and pray to the Father who is unseen.

408
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,440
 Then your Father who sees what is done in secret

409
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,820
 will reward you.

410
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,800
 So again, we see the similar elements

411
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,160
 and themes right here, right?

412
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,840
 It start with the action, that is praying.

413
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,960
 And the manner in which the hypocrites pray

414
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,000
 is to stand in the synagogues,

415
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,380
 which is the epicenter of all things Jewish life,

416
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,760
 or on the street corner,

417
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,280
 which is also a public space with high visibility.

418
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,640
 If you think of a corner,

419
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,480
 you can see through a corner, not just from one side,

420
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,360
 but from both ways as well.

421
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,520
 And usually the foot traffic around the corner

422
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,720
 will also be a little bit slow

423
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,920
 because people will slow down

424
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,660
 when they're trying to turn a corner.

425
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,800
 So the street corners are places

426
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,960
 with usually the highest visibilities that you can get.

427
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:34,840
 And the motivation of doing these things,

428
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,120
 once again, it is to be seen by other people.

429
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,440
 And to these hypocrites, Jesus once again say that

430
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,460
 they have received their reward in full

431
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,640
 in the here and now,

432
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,520
 the temporary and fleeting kind of reward

433
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,200
 that pretty much just goes away

434
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,920
 once your prayer is finished.

435
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,940
 But on the contrary, Jesus taught that when we pray,

436
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,840
 go into the room, and not only that,

437
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,140
 close the door and lock it up

438
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:06,660
 so that no one else except God alone can see us.

439
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,500
 This is because the goal of our personal prayer

440
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,580
 is to commune with our Father and to abide in Him,

441
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,540
 not to impress other people.

442
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:20,180
 And then Jesus continues with the same practice of prayer,

443
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,560
 but this time with a different kind of manner

444
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,740
 and also a different kind of motivation.

445
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:27,460
 So verse seven,

446
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:31,620
 "And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like the pagans,

447
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,300
 for they think that they will be heard

448
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,500
 because of their many words.

449
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,980
 Do not be like them,

450
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:41,420
 for your Father knows what you need before you ask Him."

451
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,860
 So besides praying in public places,

452
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,820
 another manner that we can be tempted to pray

453
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:51,620
 is to use fancy words or try to pray as long as we can

454
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,660
 without any actual content to it.

455
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:56,860
 Jesus compares this kind of prayer

456
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:00,060
 to the prayers of the Gentiles during their pagan worship,

457
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,260
 where they were pretty much like playing relate

458
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,300
 with the pantheon of gods,

459
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,940
 where they would repeatedly mention

460
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,240
 the names of different pagan gods

461
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,940
 with the hope that just maybe the right god

462
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:13,220
 would listen or hear their prayers

463
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,660
 and help them in their circumstances.

464
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,940
 In other words, they pray

465
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,060
 because they try to manipulate gods

466
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,200
 for their personal benefits.

467
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:28,220
 But as God's children, we do not have to pray like that

468
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:32,580
 because our Heavenly Father is a different kind of God.

469
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:36,260
 We don't need a secret passcode or say a certain phrase

470
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:39,860
 or special words for Him to hear our prayers,

471
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:43,560
 because He is a God who loves and cares for His people,

472
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:48,320
 one who knows our needs even before we bring it before Him.

473
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:53,220
 He is a God who is eager to respond to our requests,

474
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:56,880
 and He is a God who delight in His children

475
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,880
 when we come before Him with our prayers.

476
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,020
 And as we step into this new theme

477
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,620
 of crossing over at our church here,

478
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,620
 one of the aspects that we'll be focusing on,

479
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,600
 like Pastor Mark said earlier,

480
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,300
 is on our relationship with Him, with God.

481
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:15,180
 And so with that, I want to ask,

482
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,760
 how is your relationship with the Lord

483
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,580
 when it comes to your prayer life?

484
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:24,580
 On my trip back to Malaysia last October,

485
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,580
 I got to spend a lot of time just catching up

486
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:29,460
 and also hanging out with a lot of friends and family

487
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,980
 because I haven't been back for seven years.

488
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,860
 However, one thing that I quickly realized

489
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:37,500
 is that in most of these gatherings or hangouts,

490
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,300
 people would always ask me to pray

491
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:43,060
 because they know that I'm a pastor here in the US.

492
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,460
 And it got to the point where during dinner one night,

493
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:48,140
 it is just between me, my brother, and my mom.

494
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:50,020
 I had to stop and tell my mom,

495
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,900
 "Mom, can you stop asking me to pray every time?"

496
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,520
 Like people has been asking me to pray

497
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,640
 since I got back to my hometown pretty much.

498
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,020
 And this experience makes me realize two things.

499
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:04,740
 For one, for me personally,

500
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:07,700
 I feel the pressure to pray in a certain way

501
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,300
 to meet the expectation of people,

502
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,140
 especially with people acknowledging that,

503
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,400
 "Oh, he's a pastor."

504
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,620
 So I feel like I have to pray in a certain way.

505
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,860
 And so when I pray during those times,

506
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,100
 I feel like I'm praying more

507
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,580
 to meet the expectation of these people

508
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,960
 instead of genuinely praying to the Father.

509
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,720
 But secondly, I sense that for some people,

510
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,560
 they have these false ideas that,

511
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,680
 "Okay, if a pastor prays for them,

512
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,600
 they will be extra blessed,

513
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,540
 or that God will be more willing to answer the prayer."

514
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,660
 For these people,

515
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:44,080
 they might feel like they don't really know how to pray,

516
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,720
 or their prayer is less effective

517
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,480
 just because of the fact that

518
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:50,320
 they're not "professional Christian."

519
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,740
 But again, what we see right here

520
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:56,220
 is that this is not the case at all.

521
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,920
 God does not concern with what words we use,

522
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,660
 or how long our prayer is.

523
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:04,360
 In the following verse in Matthew 6,

524
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:08,720
 Jesus would go on to show us how we ought to pray.

525
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,020
 And this has become known as the Lord's Prayer.

526
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,220
 But for today, we'll skip over this portion first

527
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,900
 and come back to it later in my next sermon.

528
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:20,340
 And so, so far we have looked at the first two examples

529
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:23,460
 on giving to the poor and also on prayer.

530
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:27,020
 And now Jesus continues with his third practice

531
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:31,520
 of righteousness on fasting, beginning in verse 16.

532
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:38,740
 So when you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do,

533
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,460
 for they disfigure their face

534
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:43,820
 to show others that they are fasting.

535
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:47,640
 Truly, I tell you, they have received their reward in full.

536
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:53,880
 So the purpose of fasting is for us

537
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,780
 to kind of like have a heart of complete dependence

538
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:58,320
 on the Lord, right?

539
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,980
 And it's also usually also a way for us

540
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,080
 to kind of like practice humility,

541
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,700
 just knowing that we cannot depend on ourself.

542
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,300
 However, the hypocrites,

543
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,260
 they would intentionally disfigure their face

544
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:15,020
 and make themselves look gloomy and miserable

545
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,660
 when they fast.

546
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,260
 This is because in the Old Testament,

547
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:21,980
 fasting is often associated with repentance.

548
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,260
 And along with fasting,

549
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:26,560
 people will usually also put on ashes on their face

550
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,300
 and put on sackcloth

551
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:32,000
 in order to heighten the feeling of sin and mourning.

552
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,140
 But when these hypocrites fast,

553
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,460
 they put on a show

554
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:39,420
 so that they can be recognized as more religious

555
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:42,260
 instead of coming out from a heart

556
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:46,000
 of mourning over their sins or mourning over the brokenness.

557
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:49,700
 So instead of coming from a place of humility,

558
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,860
 this kind of performative fasting

559
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:54,220
 comes from a place of pride,

560
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,620
 of wanting to be recognized.

561
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:59,780
 And instead of an attitude of dependence on God,

562
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,580
 this kind of performative fasting

563
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:05,300
 comes from an attitude of dependence on yourself.

564
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,860
 Pretty much, look at how righteous I am.

565
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,340
 Look at how religious I am.

566
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:12,520
 And this kind of performative fasting

567
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,260
 is what Jesus is warning us against.

568
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:17,180
 And again, these hypocrites,

569
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:20,460
 Jesus say that they have received the full reward

570
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,140
 in the here and now.

571
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:27,100
 So how should we fast then?

572
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:30,100
 So this is what Jesus say, verse 17.

573
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:35,100
 "But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face

574
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:38,140
 "so that it will not be obvious to others

575
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:40,080
 "that you are fasting,

576
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,120
 "but only to your father who is unseen.

577
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,280
 "And your father who sees what is done in secret

578
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,000
 "will reward you."

579
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,580
 So what Jesus meant is this.

580
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:54,620
 When you fast, clean yourself up

581
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:57,220
 and make yourself look presentable.

582
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:01,020
 Go out of your way to make yourself look normal

583
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:05,200
 in order that no one will recognize that you are fasting,

584
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,540
 but only the Father alone.

585
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:12,540
 So I want to end my sermon with these stories of someone

586
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:15,100
 whom I have the privilege of meeting,

587
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:18,960
 who perfectly embodies this kind of heart posture

588
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,380
 in their love of God

589
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,900
 and also in their service for other people.

590
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,180
 In summer 2019, when I was still serving

591
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,660
 with another ministry,

592
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:31,040
 I spent the summer staffing a summer mission

593
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,080
 of about 20 plus college students

594
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,700
 from all across the United States.

595
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,140
 And we're having our summer mission here

596
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,840
 in the inner city of Chicago.

597
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,780
 And on our first Saturday,

598
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:46,100
 we partner with a pastor from South Side of Chicago

599
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,020
 to do a homeless outreach.

600
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:51,140
 So this pastor, his name is Pastor Burton.

601
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,240
 And he had been doing this homeless outreach

602
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,320
 for years already at that point.

603
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,760
 And every Saturday morning

604
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,520
 during the warmer months of the year,

605
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,320
 he would set up a table to give out lunches

606
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,920
 and essential supplies to the homeless person.

607
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09,680
 So I have a few pictures from that summer.

608
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:13,720
 Can anyone recognize where the pictures on the top right is?

609
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,460
 Where is that at in Chicago?

610
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:19,440
 Yes, it is on Canal Street

611
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,260
 and it is right across Pacific Garden Mission,

612
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,520
 which is a homeless shelter.

613
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:28,160
 But why does he specifically set up a table

614
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,720
 to provide these essential supplies and food

615
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,160
 and lunches for the homeless people

616
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,720
 outside of a homeless shelter?

617
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,920
 Well, because there are people

618
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,400
 who are not being able to accept

619
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,920
 into the Pacific Gardens Mission programming

620
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,600
 for various reasons.

621
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,880
 And these are the people that Pastor Burton,

622
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,240
 he wanted to serve.

623
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,360
 And after a couple of hours,

624
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,160
 just kind of like setting up the table at Canal,

625
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,760
 he would then drive to Lower Wacker Drive

626
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,200
 to give out some supplies

627
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,100
 and also check in on the people who live in tents

628
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,120
 and some of the max-shift shelters there.

629
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,480
 So the picture on the lower left

630
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,920
 is actually at Lower Wacker.

631
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,200
 And if you have been to Lower Wacker before,

632
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,840
 you probably know that it is pretty much

633
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,920
 like a maze down there, right?

634
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,480
 It's not only is it dark

635
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,840
 and the street is a little complicated

636
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,400
 and your GPS like nine out of 10 times,

637
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,320
 it just doesn't work there.

638
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,680
 So I've personally driven through Lower Wacker

639
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,520
 countless times,

640
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,920
 but I actually never recognized anyone

641
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,440
 actually living down there.

642
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,200
 But the thing about Pastor Burton

643
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,980
 that really stood out to me,

644
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,600
 even until this day,

645
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,680
 is how he's able to remember

646
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,280
 where each of these individual lives.

647
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:41,020
 I remember that Saturday,

648
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:43,800
 we would just randomly stop at a spot

649
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,040
 like on Lower Wacker,

650
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,360
 and then he would just turn and tell us,

651
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,000
 "Okay, you guys can grab the supplies

652
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,560
 "and we're gonna head out now."

653
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,360
 And then he would lead us

654
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,800
 to all these different nooks and crannies

655
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,240
 on Lower Wacker,

656
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,740
 where all these people live.

657
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:00,760
 And so not only did he remember

658
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,720
 where each of these people live,

659
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,600
 he also know them by their name.

660
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,560
 He will call them,

661
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,640
 and these people will kind of like

662
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,520
 come out of the corners.

663
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,440
 And he also knew the specific needs

664
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,400
 of each of these individuals.

665
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,400
 If it is a guy,

666
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,880
 he have some specific supplies for a guy.

667
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,080
 If it is a mom with a few little kids,

668
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,640
 he also have some specific supplies

669
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,440
 for this mom and her kids.

670
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,700
 And the most important thing is,

671
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,200
 you would never see Pastor Burton

672
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,240
 being on the news,

673
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,960
 being recognized for the good work

674
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,900
 that he has done.

675
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:35,460
 And yet he show up week after week,

676
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,220
 because he knew that he was serving

677
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,320
 these people for the Lord.

678
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:42,880
 For him, he is just living out his faith

679
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,520
 and being obedient to Jesus.

680
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,360
 And even though I only get to spend a day

681
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,800
 with Pastor Burton,

682
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,200
 his example has left such a huge impact

683
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,860
 in my life that I think

684
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,620
 it will pretty much last forever.

685
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,200
 And that summary also changed

686
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,640
 a lot of my perspective of Chicago

687
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,960
 as a city as well.

688
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,100
 So before I end,

689
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,720
 I want to leave us with this question

690
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,780
 to reflect on.

691
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:09,520
 What motivations tend to drive

692
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,940
 your acts of worship and service?

693
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:15,060
 Is it the approval of God?

694
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:18,340
 Or the admiration of others?

695
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:25,260
 Again, a worldly disciple pursues

696
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:28,300
 right living for the applause of people.

697
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,900
 And a kingdom disciples,

698
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:31,740
 on the other hand,

699
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:34,820
 pursues right living for the affirmation

700
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:35,720
 of the Father.

701
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,300
 So let's spend some time

702
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,300
 just reflect on these questions

703
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,100
 and I would end this with a prayer.

704
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:50,280
 (soft music)

705
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,700
 (soft music)

706
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,120
 (soft music)

707
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,540
 (soft music)

708
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,960
 (soft music)

709
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,380
 (soft music)

710
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,800
 (soft music)

711
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:10,660
 (soft music)

712
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:16,680
 (soft music)

713
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:22,640
 (soft music)

714
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:28,800
 (soft music)

715
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,220
 (soft music)

716
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:37,080
 (soft music)

717
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:42,220
 (soft music)

718
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:48,000
 (soft music)

719
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:55,220
 (soft music)

720
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,640
 (soft music)

721
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:04,640
 (soft music)

722
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:14,640
 (soft music)

723
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:24,640
 (soft music)

724
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,060
 (soft music)

725
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:29,800
 - Heavenly Father,

726
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:34,560
 I ask that you would help us

727
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,800
 to be a church and be a people

728
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,320
 who loves you,

729
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,640
 who serve others,

730
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:45,380
 not for the praise of people

731
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:47,140
 or to be recognized by the world,

732
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:51,400
 but to do all these things of generosity,

733
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,260
 this act of kindness,

734
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:56,680
 out of a pure motives of just loving you

735
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,200
 and also loving your people.

736
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:02,240
 Help us to be a people

737
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,080
 who is able to love selflessly,

738
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,700
 who is able to serve selflessly,

739
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:11,000
 because we know that we belong to your kingdom.

740
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,080
 We know that we belong to you,

741
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,640
 our Heavenly Fathers,

742
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:18,200
 and that we're able to do all these things,

743
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,480
 not because of our own abilities,

744
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,200
 but because of the love that you have for us.

745
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:27,420
 So help us, Fathers,

746
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:31,640
 not to chase after the glory of man

747
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,600
 or the praise from the world,

748
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,620
 but to be your kingdom disciples

749
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,980
 who long for your affirmation

750
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:42,420
 and your approval alone.

751
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,700
 Help us to be people

752
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,900
 who loves you

753
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,020
 and love others in a way

754
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,080
 that shows our kingdom identity.

755
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,340
 (soft piano music)

756
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:56,900
 So Father, as we finish our service today

757
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:00,300
 and just go on for our week,

758
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,940
 I just ask that you will help us,

759
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:03,940
 even in this week,

760
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:07,520
 to have opportunity to serve and love others

761
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,220
 in the way that you have called us to.

762
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:12,360
 So I pray this in your Son's name, amen.

763
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:18,060
 Okay, thank you for joining us this morning.

764
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:23,060
 As Kelly said, we'll serve some lunch outside,

765
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:25,240
 so feel free to hang out

766
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,980
 and just fellowship with one another.

767
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:30,640
 Thank you.
