1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
 Just a word of reminder, I'm looking forward to next week,

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,740
 Dr. Ko-Hee Sun will be with us,

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:08,960
 and maybe a few more people will join us as well.

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,280
 So please come here early, all right, early,

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,320
 which is 11, and we're gonna share a portion

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,580
 of the whatever you call it, roasted pig, right?

7
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:24,420
 It's gonna be great, yeah, it's gonna be great.

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,800
 I talked to the cafe team,

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,160
 and we originally planned to have a birthday cake

10
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,760
 so we can cut it together,

11
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,360
 but Ada, one of the heads of the cafe team,

12
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,320
 called me and said, "Oh, I compared the prices,

13
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,960
 "and roasted pig is actually the same price as the cake,

14
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,640
 "right, so why don't we just go for roasted pig?"

15
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,720
 And okay, I said, "Yeah, why not?"

16
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:56,080
 Since it will be more delicious, I guess, right?

17
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,840
 So I come here at 11, so we're gonna join together

18
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,920
 in the cafe and have a good meal together, all right?

19
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,800
 So today, we are going to have a short message

20
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,800
 on the importance of this week, which is the holy week.

21
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,480
 Today is the Palm Sunday,

22
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,600
 that's why we have a brother getting baptized today,

23
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,080
 and seriously, you need to read his testimony.

24
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:28,080
 He came from China, from a pagan worshiping background,

25
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,040
 and he was led into a government church,

26
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,040
 and he found it uncomfortable,

27
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,920
 and eventually, he went to a family church, or house church,

28
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,920
 and he was introduced to Jesus,

29
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,600
 and then he came over to the United States not too long ago,

30
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,400
 started to come to our church actually months ago,

31
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,760
 and then I was talking to him

32
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,680
 about his decision to get baptized,

33
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,680
 and I actually asked him if he minds to wait a little bit,

34
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,560
 you know, wait till Christmas,

35
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,000
 we may have a few more people getting baptized, right?

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,640
 Because we're going to prepare one water tank anyway,

37
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,560
 whether you have 10 people getting baptized

38
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,400
 or one person getting baptized,

39
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,600
 it's gonna be one big water tank, right?

40
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:23,520
 So I asked him whether he's okay to wait until Christmas,

41
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,600
 we're gonna have baptism in Christmas,

42
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,780
 and he said, "No, I wanna get baptized."

43
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:35,780
 I said, "Whoa, okay, all right, then how will you answer?

44
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,160
 "How will you answer such a desire

45
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,200
 "to get baptized just himself, right?"

46
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,160
 So I talked to him, "You'll be just you,"

47
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,860
 and I didn't tell him, I said,

48
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,280
 "In my mind," I said,

49
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,480
 "We're gonna prepare one water tank anyway,

50
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,280
 "so may as well wait for other people to get baptized."

51
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,780
 And he said, "No, I wanna get baptized

52
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:02,620
 "because God has washed away my sin,

53
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,600
 "and I wanna tell the world that Jesus is my Lord,

54
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,320
 "and dude, amen to that, right?"

55
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:13,040
 So I had no answer, I said, "Yeah, let's do it, let's do it."

56
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,560
 So our team prepared the water tank for just one person,

57
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,620
 you know, one person getting baptized,

58
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,600
 and that is the most meaningful thing, right?

59
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,800
 We believe in Jesus Christ, we are in the name of Christ,

60
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,920
 and we receive the name of Triune God,

61
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,520
 Father and Son of the Holy Spirit,

62
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,480
 and the name being upon the person,

63
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,400
 and what a celebration, right?

64
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,040
 So read his testimony, it's very, very interesting.

65
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,160
 So this week is all about this,

66
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,520
 it's all about the salvation Jesus has done

67
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,080
 for all of us on the cross,

68
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,560
 and that is the last week, the final week of Jesus.

69
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,120
 Just very, very quickly, I wanna give you some survey.

70
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,120
 How important this week is,

71
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,720
 the last seven days of Jesus Christ

72
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,080
 on his earthly ministry, his earthly life.

73
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,600
 The last seven days is the most important thing

74
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,280
 recorded in the Bible.

75
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,880
 All four gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,

76
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:14,080
 spend over a quarter of its content,

77
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,220
 its pages, to record and to tell us the story,

78
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,920
 the crucified Messiah, Jesus Christ.

79
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,920
 If you turn to the fourth gospel, the gospel of John,

80
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,400
 actually half of the book is about Jesus Christ

81
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,640
 on the cross.

82
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,200
 He prepared himself to be nailed on the cross,

83
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,640
 and that is how important it is.

84
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,000
 If you add those up, if you add those up,

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,300
 if you're good at math, you add those up,

86
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,720
 you've got 30-some chapters

87
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,640
 talking about just this final week of Jesus,

88
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:51,640
 almost one-third to one-half of the four gospels combined.

89
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,420
 So this is the very, very important week

90
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,360
 that changed the world,

91
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,700
 changed the lives of the people who believe,

92
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,980
 all of us, each and every one of us.

93
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,440
 So it's a good thing to remind us

94
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,920
 to reveal what is going on in this final week.

95
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,120
 So we backtrack two days on Friday

96
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,120
 before the Palm Sunday,

97
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:18,040
 Jesus was annoyed by Mary at Bethany,

98
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:22,080
 and then it was Shabbat, resting day,

99
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,040
 and then Sunday is the Palm Sunday, which is today,

100
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,040
 and Jesus riding on a donkey,

101
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,840
 he enters Jerusalem as the king,

102
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,680
 and then he weeps for the city

103
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,000
 because the city of Jerusalem does not repent.

104
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,680
 And in one generation in AD 70,

105
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,340
 in that year, the Romans would come

106
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:46,340
 and destroy the entire city and the temple.

107
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:50,880
 And he weeps about the end, the judgment on the city,

108
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,000
 and then he returns to Bethany.

109
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,080
 And then on Monday and Tuesday,

110
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,480
 he returns to Jerusalem and have debates

111
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,440
 with all these religious leaders who would not repent,

112
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,120
 who would not recognize him as a Messiah.

113
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,480
 He also cursed a fig tree,

114
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:15,080
 which is a symbol of the Israel, the nation Israel,

115
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,080
 not willing to repent and bear fruit,

116
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,040
 which symbolizes the temple and the city of Jerusalem.

117
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,880
 And the Jewish leaders plot to kill him.

118
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,720
 So we come to Thursday and Friday,

119
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,800
 Jesus and his disciples share the last Passover meal,

120
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,900
 what we call the chameleon in later generations.

121
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:42,800
 And he talks so much about things for the disciples,

122
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,060
 which we call farewell discourse.

123
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,960
 So he's gonna say goodbye,

124
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,000
 but he's gonna have tons of things

125
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,160
 reminding the disciples, right?

126
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,440
 He's giving them the Holy Spirit to be with them,

127
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,020
 to walk with them so that they can grow in discipleship.

128
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:02,800
 And finally, he prays at Gethsemane,

129
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,740
 which is a garden at the foothill of Mount Olive.

130
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,980
 And he there was betrayed and arrested.

131
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:13,760
 And it was in the middle of the night,

132
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:18,040
 he was on trial and condemned by the Jewish court,

133
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,880
 by the Jewish leaders.

134
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:26,000
 And then Peter, as you remember, denies Jesus three times.

135
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,160
 And then it was sunrise.

136
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,880
 And Jesus was tried by the Roman governor Pilate,

137
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,800
 and was mocked by King Herod.

138
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,960
 And then he eventually was crucified on God Gotham.

139
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,160
 And at the time of his death,

140
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,640
 the veil of the temple,

141
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:49,620
 which separate the Holy of Holies and the Holy place,

142
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:52,240
 there was a long veil hanging down

143
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,160
 from the roof of the temple all the way down to the ground.

144
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,120
 When Jesus died on the cross,

145
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,860
 that veil, according to the gospel of Mark,

146
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,920
 split into two from top to bottom,

147
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,480
 not bottom to top,

148
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,020
 from top to bottom, which is a miracle.

149
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,240
 And the veil was open,

150
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,600
 because Jesus now is the center

151
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,080
 of people meeting God himself,

152
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,020
 not the stone building, not the temple,

153
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,240
 not in Jerusalem, but in Jesus Christ,

154
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,800
 no longer in the city of Jerusalem,

155
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,240
 no longer in the Holy temple,

156
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,120
 but in the person and work of Jesus Christ,

157
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,280
 so we can be saved and come to the Father

158
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,840
 and be restored to him in relationship.

159
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,400
 And then Shabbat came,

160
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,560
 because he was buried in such a hurry manner,

161
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,640
 and the disciples or people who asked for Jesus' body

162
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,160
 from the cross, they just didn't have time

163
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,440
 to prepare the whole body,

164
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,200
 because Shabbat, there's no work,

165
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,520
 so they have to call it off.

166
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,060
 And then they left the tomb,

167
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:58,320
 you know, happily prepare his body,

168
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,200
 and then it was Shabbat,

169
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,400
 for 24 hours, the Jews were not allowed to work.

170
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,280
 And then Sunday morning,

171
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,360
 when the sun rises,

172
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,360
 the women go back to the tomb, why?

173
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,320
 Because they want to finish up the preparation

174
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,080
 for the body of Jesus,

175
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,480
 but they discover an empty tomb.

176
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,880
 And the empty tomb can be explained in a lot of ways.

177
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,920
 There are a lot of strange theories,

178
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,360
 you can explain away the empty tomb.

179
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,840
 But the Bible give us the biblical reason

180
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,960
 why Jesus' tomb is empty,

181
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,160
 why only his tomb is empty,

182
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,480
 because by the power of the Holy Spirit,

183
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,320
 Jesus is risen from the dead.

184
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,120
 Now, I've talked through the entire week

185
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,880
 in two and a half minutes, right?

186
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,840
 Three minutes, right?

187
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,920
 And this is the most important week of all in human history.

188
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,160
 What Jesus has done in this seven days

189
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,400
 changed your life and changed my life,

190
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,560
 and changed the lives of many, many people

191
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,240
 from generation to generation

192
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,000
 in the past 2,000 plus years.

193
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,180
 Jesus has changed the course of our lives.

194
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,020
 Just as I told you,

195
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:21,160
 the person who received baptism today

196
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,520
 in the 10 o'clock service,

197
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,680
 he gave the testimony how God has touched his life,

198
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,240
 how Jesus has touched his life,

199
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,280
 and he wants to follow Jesus,

200
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,360
 and change the course of his life journey

201
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,000
 toward the kingdom.

202
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,360
 And that is why the gospels, all four gospels,

203
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,200
 and even the gospel of Mark,

204
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,280
 spend so much energy,

205
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,560
 and so much verses and chapters

206
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,360
 on this past,

207
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,240
 on this holy week,

208
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,480
 especially on Thursday and on Friday.

209
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,800
 So I want to take you a very, very quick survey

210
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,360
 of what is going on at the end,

211
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,840
 the ending two days,

212
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,320
 the last two days of Jesus' life.

213
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,060
 If you turn with me to the gospel of Mark chapter 14,

214
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:13,520
 here I give you some sort of a map, right?

215
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,540
 I want to encourage you in the holy week,

216
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,440
 go back home in your devotional,

217
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,800
 spend five minutes a day,

218
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,520
 pick the best time of your day.

219
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,600
 If you're an early riser,

220
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,000
 how many of you are early riser?

221
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,740
 You wake up, you feel refreshed all the time?

222
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,000
 None of you.

223
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,360
 No wonder you guys are late.

224
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,880
 (audience laughing)

225
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,680
 No wonder you guys are always late, right?

226
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,320
 All right, how many of you,

227
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,200
 your best hour is at night?

228
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,720
 Best hour is at night.

229
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,880
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

230
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,480
 Nothing wrong with that, okay?

231
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,320
 Nothing wrong with that.

232
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,520
 But use it.

233
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,220
 Use three minutes, five minutes,

234
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:49,960
 turn to the gospel of Mark chapter 14 and 15.

235
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,520
 That is all about the Thursday and Friday,

236
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,200
 the last two days of Jesus' earthly life.

237
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,520
 And here I give you a map.

238
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:02,780
 Imagine yourself to be a movie director.

239
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:09,040
 You're gonna shoot the scenes of Jesus' last 48 hours.

240
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,400
 Here in chapter 14 of gospel of Mark,

241
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,880
 you see it's switched from A to B, A to B, A to B, right?

242
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,860
 All the A's are characters other than Jesus.

243
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:25,000
 All the B's are pretty much the focus of the camera

244
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,160
 is on Jesus himself, of what he said and what he did.

245
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,720
 A, you would start with 14, verses one and two.

246
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,280
 The Jewish leaders trying to kill Jesus

247
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,600
 and they have a plot to do so.

248
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,560
 So the focus is on the Jewish leaders,

249
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,520
 those who betrayed Jesus out of self-interest.

250
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,120
 They're trying to protect their own authority.

251
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,520
 The religious leaders in Jerusalem

252
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,760
 trying to protect their own power

253
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,580
 because Jesus is getting the popular movement going on.

254
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,040
 So that's why they hate Jesus.

255
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,160
 They don't want Jesus to take their place.

256
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,200
 So they try to take away Jesus, trying to kill him.

257
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,160
 And then B, the second part is Jesus is anointed

258
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,260
 at Bethany by Mary.

259
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,960
 And Mary did that in order to prepare Jesus' death, right?

260
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,000
 You anoint the body, the dead body,

261
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,480
 in order to prepare the body for burial.

262
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,160
 And Mary probably understood the Messiah has to die.

263
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:28,160
 That's why she came with expensive perfume

264
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,240
 and trying to anoint the body of Jesus.

265
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,800
 And then it's switched to A again,

266
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:38,000
 which is the third paragraph, is Judah, one of the 12,

267
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,720
 joins the plot to kill Jesus.

268
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,860
 And then the camera shifts back to Jesus

269
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,500
 preparing for the Passover meal.

270
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,260
 And then one of the 12, again, Judah,

271
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:54,780
 will betray Jesus.

272
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,460
 And then switch to number six,

273
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:00,740
 which is the sixth section, verses 22 to 25.

274
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:05,740
 Jesus shares the Passover meal with his 11 disciples.

275
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,480
 And all the disciples will betray Jesus,

276
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,560
 and Jesus foretells that.

277
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,900
 And then switch back to Jesus praying

278
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,300
 in the garden of Gethsemane.

279
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:23,660
 And then the camera switch back to Judah, one of the 12,

280
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:28,740
 betrays Jesus, and all the disciples flee in the night.

281
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:34,180
 They all escape, trying to save their own lives.

282
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:38,860
 And then he was being brought in front of the Jewish court.

283
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:44,900
 Jesus revealed himself to be the Messiah, to be the Christ.

284
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:48,860
 And then lastly, we all remember this story.

285
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,400
 Peter's trying to get warm

286
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,940
 and get into the court of the high priest.

287
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:57,700
 And then he was being interrogated, being interrogated.

288
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,620
 And he was afraid.

289
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:03,080
 And he denied Jesus as his Lord,

290
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,800
 first time, second time, and third time.

291
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:10,500
 And then everybody fled.

292
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,480
 Jesus was alone.

293
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,400
 That is chapter 14 of the Gospel of Mark.

294
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:21,160
 And you see from top down, from top to bottom,

295
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,640
 all the people around Jesus trying to betray him,

296
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:30,480
 flee from him, to leave him alone, right?

297
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,520
 To abandon him.

298
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,720
 From the Jewish leaders trying to kill Jesus,

299
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:39,560
 one of the 12 Jews trying to plot against Jesus,

300
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,440
 and all the so-called faithful disciples,

301
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,480
 they thought they would be strong enough

302
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,760
 to follow Jesus all the way to the end, but they did not.

303
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,500
 They were fragile.

304
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,220
 Their faith is shaken.

305
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,960
 And they left.

306
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,780
 From top to bottom, all the people around Jesus left.

307
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:02,380
 But from top to bottom, we find that Jesus is determined

308
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,740
 to go to the cross.

309
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:09,680
 Step by step, he prepared himself to go to the cross,

310
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,340
 to be crucified, shamefully, on the cross.

311
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,900
 Because he understands this is the will of the Father

312
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:21,900
 to save humankind, to save each and every one of us.

313
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,440
 Right at the center of the story,

314
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:29,360
 Jesus shared the last meal with his disciples,

315
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,040
 encouraging them and saying to them,

316
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,540
 "This is the covenant.

317
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:37,240
 "This is the promise I give to you.

318
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:41,540
 "As I die, as I shed my blood, and we drink this cup,

319
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:46,300
 "you know you belong to me, no matter what."

320
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,360
 And he foretold the disciples would betray him,

321
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,040
 but he also promised, "I will go to Galilee

322
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,840
 "after I resurrected from death.

323
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,800
 "So I will restore you guys."

324
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,640
 Right?

325
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,080
 What a promise, right?

326
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,940
 In the entire story, in the entire chapter,

327
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,780
 no one can boast.

328
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:08,520
 No one can boast his faith or her faith is strong enough

329
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,080
 to follow Jesus to the end.

330
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,520
 Nobody.

331
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,960
 Everyone around Jesus is powerless.

332
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:21,360
 Everyone is going after his own self-interest.

333
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,200
 Chapter 14.

334
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:28,880
 In chapter 15, also the camera is switching back and forth

335
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,880
 from people around Jesus and Jesus on the cross.

336
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:39,820
 First of all, B, all of B is about Jesus.

337
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:43,820
 He revealed himself to Pilate, the Roman governor.

338
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:47,620
 Now at this time, no longer the Jewish court,

339
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,740
 but the Roman court.

340
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:54,740
 And then the crowd wanting to crucify Jesus,

341
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:59,900
 they asked for the release of Barabbas.

342
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:04,580
 Barabbas was a criminal convicted in Jesus' day.

343
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:09,580
 And the crowd want to release this guy, a rebel,

344
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:12,280
 but they want to crucify Jesus.

345
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:17,400
 What injustice, you know, the greatest injustice

346
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,120
 is being done to an innocent man, Jesus himself.

347
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,700
 But Jesus was silent because he accepted

348
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:29,460
 as the will of the father to die on behalf of all of us.

349
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,240
 And then Jesus is proven to be innocent

350
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,520
 by the Roman governor, Pilate.

351
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:38,380
 And mockingly, Pilate called Jesus king.

352
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:41,040
 "Are you the king of the Jews?"

353
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,620
 And Jesus said, "I am."

354
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:48,540
 Remember we did the Bible study of Gospel of Mark?

355
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:52,460
 Whenever someone says, "I am,"

356
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:56,660
 it's not just a simple statement, right?

357
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:59,300
 It's the declaration of his divinity.

358
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,500
 He is God, he's the son of God.

359
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,260
 So he said to Pilate, the Roman governor,

360
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,860
 "I am the king of the Jews."

361
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:11,060
 But mockingly, Pilate, we got him as king.

362
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:14,260
 And then the soldiers mock him as king.

363
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:19,260
 He put on a purple robe, purple robe on Jesus and mock him.

364
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:23,840
 And then at the center of the story, Jesus is crucified.

365
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,980
 And then as we go on in this chapter, chapter 15,

366
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:32,060
 all these people around Jesus mock him as king.

367
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:35,340
 And then finally Jesus dies.

368
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:39,820
 A Roman centurion, a commander,

369
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:42,460
 proclaims at the foot of the cross,

370
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:45,660
 "Truly, this is the son of God.

371
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,460
 "Truly, this is the king."

372
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,720
 And he was looking at Jesus on the cross,

373
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:53,140
 who shamefully died and sacrificed himself

374
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,660
 on behalf of sinful mankind.

375
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:59,180
 This is kingship, this is leadership.

376
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:02,180
 He died so that others can live.

377
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:05,300
 He sacrificed himself so that we can be released,

378
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,860
 we can have freedom.

379
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,420
 And truly, this is the son of God.

380
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:12,980
 This is the true king, the servant king.

381
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:18,380
 And then finally, the women watching from a distance.

382
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:23,240
 And then at the end of this chapter, Jesus is buried.

383
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,180
 Now, as you can see, very quick,

384
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:29,040
 from 14 to 15 chapter of the Gospel of Mark,

385
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,540
 Jesus becomes more passive and more passive.

386
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,660
 He's taking on the actions of others.

387
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:38,660
 People shame him, people mock him,

388
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:42,100
 and crucify him and kill him.

389
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,940
 Jesus is no longer the active agent.

390
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:49,860
 He's becoming more the object of the actions of other people.

391
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:53,900
 Some Bible scholar has counted how many verbs

392
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,660
 are there in these two chapters.

393
00:20:55,660 --> 00:21:01,020
 And there are 50 some verbs,

394
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:04,100
 50 some actions done to Jesus.

395
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,900
 He's being passive, the victim,

396
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:14,120
 until he's crucified and died and buried in the tomb.

397
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:20,740
 Now, at the center of it all is Jesus on the cross.

398
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:23,180
 Truly, he is the son of God.

399
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:28,480
 That is the climax of the entire Gospel of Mark.

400
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,340
 And it's very ironic, right?

401
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:35,860
 Now, we just had our primary election week, right?

402
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,260
 Did you vote?

403
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:41,500
 All those of you who could vote, you should have voted.

404
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:46,660
 But we're looking for leaders, or political leaders,

405
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:49,940
 to bring us hope, right?

406
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,460
 To make some positive changes in our neighborhood,

407
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:55,660
 in our city, in our government.

408
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:58,200
 We're looking for strong men and women.

409
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:03,360
 We're looking for someone who is qualified to lead us, right?

410
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,760
 Who has the power, military power, political power,

411
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:11,180
 or willpower to make changes, right?

412
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,520
 To make people follow him.

413
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:15,940
 Now, this is totally different.

414
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,560
 The leadership of Jesus is the other way around.

415
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,840
 It's the upside down leadership.

416
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,840
 He died, he sacrificed himself so that we can be born again.

417
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,960
 Here, I want to bring out two points.

418
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,060
 The first point is,

419
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,560
 Jesus sees through the logic of the cross.

420
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:42,000
 We kind of read through chapter 14 and 15

421
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,680
 of the Gospel of Mark.

422
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,040
 And you see, what Jesus was doing

423
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,600
 is that he lays down his life.

424
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,480
 He seems to be absolutely powerless.

425
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,960
 He has no power in his hand.

426
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,760
 He was nailed on the cross, he was totally passive.

427
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:02,560
 But he alone fulfills the will of God.

428
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,400
 He alone can save us from sin.

429
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:10,480
 A sinless one became sinful

430
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:16,440
 so that we, the sinners, can be forgiven.

431
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:20,680
 And that is why we call the Friday of the Holy Week,

432
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,400
 what do we call it?

433
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,060
 Good Friday.

434
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,280
 Why is it Good Friday?

435
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:30,280
 Jesus died on the cross on Friday, right?

436
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,360
 There's nothing good about him.

437
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,080
 But it was nonetheless called Good Friday

438
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:40,080
 because he has done the greatest great things for all of us.

439
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,160
 The salvation on the cross.

440
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,600
 That is the logic of the cross.

441
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,480
 And Jesus is condemned according to the will of the Father

442
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,020
 so that we are accepted.

443
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:55,920
 Jesus is punished so that our sins can be forgiven.

444
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,600
 We can be redeemed.

445
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,280
 He is cursed so that we can be blessed

446
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,040
 and we can be restored to God himself.

447
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,820
 He suffers so that we have peace with God.

448
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:10,020
 He dies so that we can have eternal life.

449
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:13,540
 And that's the most amazing logic.

450
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:17,040
 Nobody would have understood it

451
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,920
 until Jesus died on the cross.

452
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:23,360
 And I think the life of Jesus being summarized

453
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:28,360
 in four gospels is to challenge us and to remind us

454
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:32,120
 if we say Jesus is our Lord and our Savior,

455
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:36,640
 then our lives should reflect the value of the cross.

456
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,920
 What is the value of the cross?

457
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:41,720
 The logic of the cross is that we lay down our own will

458
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:47,880
 and we say to God, God our Father, your will be done.

459
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:53,880
 Every day you pray, you do devotion.

460
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:58,880
 The ultimate attitude we have is in front of God,

461
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:04,320
 we say, hey God, your will be done.

462
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,600
 Ultimately, it's not my will.

463
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,240
 Ultimately, it's not my interest.

464
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,480
 But your interest, your kingdom's interest

465
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,120
 is the utmost important to me, right?

466
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,760
 Your kingdom come and your will be done.

467
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,480
 That is the logic of the cross.

468
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,280
 That is the logic of Christian life.

469
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,600
 We come here to worship God,

470
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,520
 not because out of self-interest,

471
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:33,520
 because we know that Jesus should be praised.

472
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,260
 God should be worshiped today.

473
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,300
 We lay down our own interests

474
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:43,400
 so that we can exalt the name of God, right?

475
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,340
 That is the life pattern of all Christians.

476
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:49,960
 All normal Christian life should be like this.

477
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,520
 I asked you what's your best hour of the day, right?

478
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,680
 Probably it's the middle of the night, right?

479
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,640
 You do your own quiet time.

480
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,080
 Now, quiet time is very important

481
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:04,080
 because we kind of calibrate our own heart to the kingdom.

482
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:10,020
 We spend time with God so that God can speak to us

483
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,980
 when we read the word of God from the Bible.

484
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:18,500
 And we also pray to him and we speak to him our desire

485
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,660
 and ask him to change us, ask him to lead us.

486
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:24,340
 And that quiet time should be a calibration time

487
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:29,220
 so that we can calibrate our heart toward Jesus our Lord,

488
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:32,060
 so that our life can be constantly aligned

489
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:35,420
 with the discipleship pattern, right?

490
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:38,960
 The cross, which means thy kingdom come,

491
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,580
 thy will be done, not my will, but the will of the Father.

492
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:48,140
 Now, I wanna point you to the logic of the cross

493
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:53,140
 by quoting from chapter 10, verse 45 of the gospel of Mark.

494
00:26:53,140 --> 00:27:01,020
 Here's one verse, and some of you already memorize it, right?

495
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:04,700
 "For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve,

496
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:10,580
 "but to give his life as a ransom for many."

497
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:14,300
 Some of you may have heard about this verse

498
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,800
 or even memorize it.

499
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:22,020
 Here, Jesus summarized the entire gospel

500
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:27,020
 or his entire life and our life as Christian

501
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:30,380
 in just one verse.

502
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,980
 Here he states two things.

503
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:34,500
 He makes two claims.

504
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:40,340
 He came for the purpose of serving, to serve other people.

505
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,660
 And he came to die.

506
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:46,220
 He came to die.

507
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:48,580
 Now, when we do Bible study,

508
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:51,260
 sometimes we pay attention to some little words

509
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:57,860
 that usually we just don't focus on

510
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:00,200
 because the word is so little.

511
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,760
 And I have a highlight for you.

512
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,020
 And the word is actually,

513
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:09,500
 you can translate the word as "and," A-N-D.

514
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,380
 It's a conjunction in Greek.

515
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,660
 It's a very simple word, right?

516
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:17,380
 And he does that, and they do that,

517
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:19,340
 and something happened, and something happened.

518
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,860
 The conjunction, right?

519
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:23,220
 You can translate it as A-N-D, "and."

520
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:26,460
 Simply, simple translation, literal translation.

521
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,620
 But you can also translate

522
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,340
 because of the context requires you

523
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,300
 to translate it differently.

524
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:34,540
 So here, all the English versions,

525
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:38,460
 English translations, render it as "even."

526
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,300
 You see that?

527
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,140
 Even.

528
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:44,860
 Now, I was trying to dig through all the Chinese translations.

529
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:47,820
 They all missed this, except one,

530
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:51,220
 the contemporary Chinese version.

531
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:54,060
 It says, "Even the Son of Man

532
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:57,020
 "came not to be served, but to serve."

533
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,020
 Now, what's the effect?

534
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,460
 What's the difference?

535
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,740
 There's a huge difference

536
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:04,020
 if you translate this little word differently.

537
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:07,860
 If you translate "and," you still get the sense.

538
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:11,740
 But if you translate "even," it becomes more important

539
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:15,820
 because it tells you, when you translate as "even,"

540
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:20,660
 even for this, for "even the Son of Man came to be served,"

541
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:23,300
 or came not to be served, but to serve.

542
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:26,580
 If you translate "even," the effect would be,

543
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:29,340
 it tells you,

544
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:35,740
 if anyone could reasonably be expected not to serve,

545
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,420
 but to be served by others.

546
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,500
 It is the Son of Man.

547
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,660
 It's Jesus himself.

548
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:47,940
 Jesus reasonably expect all the other people around him

549
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:52,220
 to serve him, right?

550
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:54,700
 He's not here to serve other people, right?

551
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:59,860
 Think of yourself as king and queen,

552
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:04,100
 princess or prince, right?

553
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:07,500
 Think of yourself on a high status.

554
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:12,100
 You expect other people to serve you, right?

555
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:16,220
 I have some friends in Hong Kong,

556
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:21,220
 they hire servants to do the housework, right?

557
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:25,460
 Do you have a servant in your household

558
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,680
 to manage the do-the-dishes?

559
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,660
 Maybe your husband is, right?

560
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:32,660
 Somebody do the work for you.

561
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,740
 You expect someone to serve you.

562
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:39,700
 Here Jesus said, "Even the Son of Man came not to be served."

563
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:42,820
 And the effect is, even he himself

564
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:47,500
 can reasonably, legitimately,

565
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:51,580
 require everyone around him to serve him.

566
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:56,020
 But even the Son of Man came not to be served,

567
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:59,220
 but to serve other people, right?

568
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:04,620
 Think of the 24 hours each day.

569
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:07,380
 You know, what is your attitude, right?

570
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:11,400
 Our normal, typical attitude as a human being

571
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:16,400
 is being occupied by our own self-interest, right?

572
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:22,320
 Our own self-desire usually, or most of the time,

573
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,420
 is the top priority, right?

574
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:28,180
 Even for us who come to church,

575
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,740
 our desire mostly are out of self-interest.

576
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:37,780
 I come because I want to get something out of it, right?

577
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,280
 Oh, you got good food, okay?

578
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,720
 So I come, right?

579
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,640
 Oh, your food is crappy.

580
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,660
 I don't come, right?

581
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:49,680
 I'd rather spend my time somewhere else, right?

582
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:54,600
 I come to church because I expect to be served, right?

583
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,920
 I'm preoccupied by my own self-interest.

584
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,840
 People come and pray for me,

585
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,800
 or care about me, right?

586
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,060
 Or treat me well, right?

587
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:07,780
 That is our normal, typical expectation.

588
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:12,240
 But here, Jesus said, "Even the Son of Man,"

589
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,680
 even the King himself,

590
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:17,040
 "came not to be served,

591
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:21,600
 "but the other way around, to serve other people."

592
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,220
 So I want to remind you in this Holy Week,

593
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:29,220
 the life of Jesus, as all four Gospels emphasize

594
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:32,380
 how important these seven days,

595
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:35,280
 these seven last days for Jesus.

596
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:38,500
 He came to serve us,

597
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,720
 not to be served by us.

598
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,240
 And you would say Jesus is your Lord.

599
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:49,280
 And if you say, "I am a Christian, I follow Christ,"

600
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:52,500
 shouldn't our pattern,

601
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,960
 shouldn't our expectations be different?

602
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:59,400
 Our life pattern should be different.

603
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:03,900
 To reflect a little bit more what Jesus is,

604
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:07,600
 to serve other people, and not to be served.

605
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:12,960
 Think of one thing you can do for the church,

606
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,960
 for the church family,

607
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,920
 that you are not being served, but to serve other people.

608
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:25,100
 One thing they all suggest, to pray for the church, right?

609
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:28,400
 Spend some time and pray for the church.

610
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,740
 Pray for the church ministry.

611
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:33,140
 People devote their time and energy

612
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:35,640
 in order to make it work, right?

613
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,900
 In order to run the church, in order to grow the church.

614
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:39,740
 Pray for them.

615
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:43,020
 And secondly, I would suggest,

616
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,900
 maybe find something you can plug in, you know?

617
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,340
 You can try to help out, you know?

618
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:51,020
 Maybe just talk to new people, right?

619
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:54,480
 Come in with a smile, as simple as that.

620
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,500
 The pattern of discipleship.

621
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:02,980
 Not to be served, but to serve, right?

622
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:07,740
 Pray for those who are preparing the service next week.

623
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:12,300
 You know, Josh was leading worship today,

624
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:17,300
 and we spent a couple hours practicing, right?

625
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:20,180
 That's why he didn't sing our tune, right?

626
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,980
 He practiced.

627
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:25,420
 He came to serve, not to be served, right?

628
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:28,300
 So that we can enjoy worship together, right?

629
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,820
 There are many, many things I would suggest

630
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:35,340
 that you have to think just upside down, right?

631
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:38,220
 Not to be served, but to serve other people, right?

632
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:40,660
 To do good to other people, right?

633
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,300
 Or even after the service, you know,

634
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:46,300
 go to the people in the backstage,

635
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:49,940
 encourage them, appreciate them.

636
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:53,120
 'Cause they took their time, they took their energy,

637
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:56,180
 not out of self-interest, right?

638
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:59,020
 There's no benefit, right?

639
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,900
 But they serve, nonetheless.

640
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:05,260
 Do something so that we can build up the church together.

641
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,740
 Do something so that we can walk

642
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:09,460
 a little bit more like Christ himself, right?

643
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:11,500
 Let's do that, amen?

644
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,100
 Let's pray.

645
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:16,200
 Father, we come before you in this holy week,

646
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:20,780
 on this Palm Sunday, to remember what you have done for us.

647
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:23,300
 And thank you for being our sermon king.

648
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:26,980
 Thank you for dying on the cross so that we can have life.

649
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:31,980
 Thank you for experiencing the shame of the cross

650
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:34,060
 so that we can be honored.

651
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:36,260
 And thank you for your redemption.

652
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:39,620
 Thank you for granting us this new life

653
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:43,560
 so that we can reflect the value of the kingdom.

654
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:47,200
 And Jesus, we come before you.

655
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,420
 We ask that you change our heart

656
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:56,120
 so that we are not to be served, but to serve others,

657
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:59,700
 just like Jesus did for all of us.

658
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,680
 Thank you for your love,

659
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,840
 and thank you for the new life we can experience,

660
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,520
 and help us to know how to follow you,

661
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,880
 to build up your body, to build up your kingdom,

662
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,100
 to extend your kingdom, to preach the gospel,

663
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,160
 to invite people into your kingdom.

664
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,160
 There are so many different things we can do

665
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,400
 in the pattern of Jesus.

666
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,380
 And I pray that you will lead us,

667
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:27,500
 help our church to grow spiritually,

668
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:32,500
 to grow in the image of your son, more and more.

669
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:36,360
 In Christ's name we pray, amen.

670
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,180
 Well, God bless you,

671
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:40,440
 and make sure you come a little bit early

672
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:44,060
 so that we can enjoy the eighth anniversary,

673
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:47,520
 I don't know what you call it, what, refreshment?

674
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,520
 special refreshment.

675
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,280
 OK?

676
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,400
 All right.
