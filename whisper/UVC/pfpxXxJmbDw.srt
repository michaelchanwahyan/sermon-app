00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 [Music]

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 All right. Thank you very much.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 Well, good morning from Chicago, everyone.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 For those who are listening from wherever you are,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 I hear some of you are in Hong Kong.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 I hear from some of you guys are in Canada, different places.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 And those who are in the audience, good morning and good evening.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 My name is Tommy Lee, and I get a chance.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 I run multiple organizations, but one of the things I am very proud of is

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 I am the president and founder of Resource Global.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 And one of the things I get a chance to do at Resource Global is

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 we work with young Christian marketplace leaders in different global cities.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 And so as a result of that, I get a chance to go to Jakarta, Indonesia,

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 when pre-pandemic, in Kuala Lumpur, in Singapore, as well as Austin, Texas, Chicago.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 And I was recently just in Nairobi, Kenya.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 So I literally just came back from there last week,

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 and I had a chance to really be able to see what God was doing in Nairobi, Kenya.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 And it is phenomenal how different global cities are continuously grown.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 I'd love to share a little bit more in the future in terms of what Nairobi is,

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 but the one thing I will probably see, there is a lot of growth

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 in countries like Africa as well as Asia.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 But the one thing that it is, is what does it mean that as the countries continue to grow,

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 how do marketplace leaders, how does the local church continue

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 to really be able to proclaim what God is doing in those cities

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 and interact with those cities.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 So, man, it has been just a joy and journey.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 And with my role, I get a chance to travel a lot.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 And it's not always easy.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 A couple of weeks ago, it's my fourth straight week traveling, right?

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 It's my fourth straight week traveling. I'm tired.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 A couple of weeks ago, I was in Grand Rapids.

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 Tomorrow, I jump on a plane, I go to Los Angeles.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 Just got back from Nairobi, and it has not been always very easy

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 when you're jumping on planes all the time.

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 But in the midst of all these things, I get a chance to meet wonderful people.

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 Let me just show you one person, all right?

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 Here's this one person I want to talk about.

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 And they are going to put that right there.

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 His name is Ray Bakke.

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 I'm not sure if you guys have ever heard of the name Ray Bakke.

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Ray is someone--it ties in with our sermon today--

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 what I would call as God's anointed, God's professor, global professor.

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 A couple of weeks ago, maybe about four or five weeks ago,

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 I get an email from Ray's assistant saying that,

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 "Tommy, Ray has made a turn for the worse.

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 Ray has pancreatic cancer. Ray is dying."

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 As a result of that, he asked if you had time to go see him

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 in Bellingham, Washington for one final meeting.

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Well, here's the thing.

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 If someone tells you that they would like to see you for the final time,

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 you do everything you can to go out there.

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 I have gotten to know Ray for many, many years.

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 He is a global professor that has ministered and taught many students

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 all over the years, traveled to Hong Kong.

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 Some of you are sitting there watching from Hong Kong.

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 You may have been familiar with Ray and his travels and his teachings.

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 But the one thing Ray has always taught me as a professor is,

58
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 "Tommy, you have to learn to what?

59
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 Respect and honor the culture that you're in.

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 You have to learn to 'exegete to community.'"

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 What does he mean by that?

62
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 Too often--and I say this as an American standing here--

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 too often as an American, when I travel to your city in Hong Kong

64
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 or in Canada, all of that stuff, as Americans, I feel like I have all the answers.

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 As Americans, I feel like you have to learn from me.

66
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 As Americans, I'm your primary funder. I'm the leader.

67
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 You learn from me.

68
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 Whereas some of you who are sitting in Hong Kong or Vancouver

69
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 or wherever you are in the world are sitting there,

70
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 "Wait a minute. That's not right.

71
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 You fail to understand our culture.

72
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 You fail to understand--you bring your American ideas

73
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 and you expect all of us to learn."

74
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 That was the one thing Ray has always taught me.

75
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 He says, "Tommy, when you go to different global cities,

76
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 you are a learner of that city.

77
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 You are a student of that city.

78
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 God has been at work in that city way before you ever got there,

79
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 way before any Americans ever got there.

80
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 He has a plan for that city.

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 And so when you go to that city, listen and hear.

82
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 Ask questions. Honor the people there. Honor the culture there.

83
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 Always be respectful of the culture.

84
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 Hear what God is doing and always be asking yourself,

85
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 "How can God be working in your life?

86
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 How is God working in the city and how can you be part of it?"

87
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 That's what Ray taught me, and I will always remember that from Ray.

88
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 Ray is what I call God's anointed,

89
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 and it's a position that all of us are in today.

90
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 And this is a topic we're going to talk about actually

91
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 for the next three times I'm with you,

92
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 and I'm going to be with you every single month,

93
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 this September, October, November,

94
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 and we're going to talk about a three-part series on the life of David.

95
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 Today we're going to talk about a story that all of you are familiar with,

96
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 the story of the battle of David and Goliath,

97
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 which I would say if you're young or old,

98
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 you're probably familiar with this story.

99
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 It is a story, I would say, probably aside from the crucifixion

100
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 to the birth of Jesus, it's a story that we're all familiar with.

101
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 The story, the battle of David and Goliath,

102
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 good versus evil, underdog versus the giant.

103
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 But it's more than just a battle between little man versus giant.

104
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 But it talks about how God's anointed, God uses his anointed

105
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 to continue to call him out and use him,

106
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 begin to prepare him for the biggest stage of being the king of Israel.

107
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 And so we're going to talk about part one of that

108
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 and lessons that emerge, principles that we're going to talk about

109
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 that emerges of being God's anointed.

110
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 We're going to talk about part one.

111
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 We're going to talk about the next time I show up,

112
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 we're going to talk about part two as we finish up the rest of the story.

113
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 And then part three is one of my favorite ones is what happens

114
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 in the aftermath of a giant's killing.

115
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 Because you think that after the giant's killing, story ended, happy ending.

116
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 But it's far more than that.

117
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 And God is in the midst of preparing a king.

118
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 God's anointed with David.

119
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 It's a story of you as well, too, because God has a plan for you.

120
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 God chooses and wants you.

121
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 We all have the potential to be anointed by God to do something great.

122
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 We all have the potential to be anointed by God to make a difference

123
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 and impact this world because he is in the midst of writing your story.

124
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 He is in the midst of writing a chapter in your story,

125
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 a story that is so unique that my story is so different from your story,

126
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 that all of our stories are very, very unique.

127
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 And so as a result, within that journey, what is that story?

128
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 How is God calling you?

129
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 How is God making a difference in your life?

130
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 And that's what we're going to look at today.

131
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 As always, I will probably say is as you're getting to know me,

132
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 you will find that I will need a lot of water in the midst of it.

133
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 And so I always will tell people, please be patient with me during that period of time.

134
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 I think I told you in the last time I had a sermon, I spoke to you guys.

135
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 Cancer really affected my body.

136
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 Three years ago, I was diagnosed with cancer.

137
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 And in the midst of that cancer, right in my sinus,

138
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 it pretty much destroyed all my tears, most of my hearing.

139
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 That's why a lot of times if you're here, I speak very loudly

140
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 because a lot of times I can't really hear.

141
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 But more so, it really took away most of my saliva and most of my taste buds.

142
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 And so as a result, it is a part of that journey that God has written.

143
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 And so a lot of times I will ask you for a little grace as we continue on as well too.

144
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 Hey, let's take our story over to 1 Samuel 9 as we begin.

145
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 1 Samuel 9, and we're going to begin our story with that.

146
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 And we're going to go over to 17 eventually, but I'm going to start with 1 Samuel 9.

147
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 And the story begins in verses 1 to 2.

148
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 "That there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Abel, son of Zerah, son of Bekroth, son of Ephiah, a Benjamite."

149
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 Very, very important. Remember who that is.

150
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 He is from the tribe of Benjamin. He is a Benjamite.

151
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 Always remember that. We're going to get back to this.

152
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 "A man of wealth. And he had a son whose name was Saul, a handsome young man.

153
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 There was not a man among the people of Israel more handsome than he.

154
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 From his shoulders upward, he was taller than any of the people."

155
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 So the story begins with the selection of Saul as the leader.

156
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 He is a Benjamite. Very key. Comes from a very influential, very, very wealthy family.

157
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 He comes from a family of means.

158
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 He is the tallest. He is the most handsome. He is the most athletic and natural because of his outward appearance.

159
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 Coming from a very, very lucrative family, very well-to-do family, he is chosen king of Israel.

160
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 And the story goes, and we don't have time to go through all this, you know what happens with Saul.

161
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 Through a series of mistakes, that ego starts getting in the way.

162
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 The character flaws begin to show within Saul.

163
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 And God deems him as no longer the right fit as a leader.

164
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 As a result, he is looking for a replacement.

165
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 There is a prophet Samuel. He says, "Samuel, I have disqualified Saul.

166
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 Even though he is elected by the people, even though all of his outward appearance, it checks the boxes.

167
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 I have disqualified him as king of Israel.

168
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 And so I need you to go find the next king.

169
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 And I want you to go to Bethlehem to go do it."

170
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 And so Samuel goes over to Bethlehem, and he is now called to the son of Jesse, the Bethlemite.

171
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 And there Jesse comes in.

172
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 And he arrives and he says to Jesse, "Bring all your sons in. I want to talk with them. I want to see them."

173
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 And the story goes, he brings in three of his sons.

174
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 And the first one to show up is Eliab.

175
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 Well, Eliab is the oldest of all of the sons.

176
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 Eliab is the strongest, the tallest of all the sons.

177
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 And here's what 1 Samuel 16 tells us.

178
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 "But the Lord said to Samuel, 'Do not look on his outer appearance, on the height of his stature,

179
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 because I have rejected him.

180
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 For the Lord sees not what a man sees.

181
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 Man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks on the heart.'"

182
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 So he goes through all the sons, not him, not him, not him.

183
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 And he says to Jesse, "Jesse, do you have any more sons?"

184
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 Jesse remembers, "Oh, there's young David."

185
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 We all know the story. There's young David.

186
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 He's out in the sheep. He's tending the sheep.

187
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 "Hey, call David in."

188
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 David walks in.

189
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 "There Samuel anoints him with who watching is, his brother, including Eliab."

190
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 That's also very important. Note that as well, too.

191
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 We don't know exactly how he anoints him, but he anoints him.

192
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 Maybe he whispers to David, "You're going to be the next king."

193
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 And there the story ends.

194
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 First thing, first principle that emerges out of God's anointing.

195
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 God always looks at the condition of the heart.

196
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 God does not look at outer appearances.

197
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 God does not care how wealthy you are.

198
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 God does not care how good-looking you are.

199
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 God does not care how rich you are.

200
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 God does not care how successful you are.

201
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 God does not care how well you are, speaking-wise, your talents, whatever it is.

202
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 God does not look at the physical appearance.

203
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 But he always looks at the condition of your heart.

204
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 God is looking to use men and women wherever you are, whatever part of the world that you are.

205
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 God is looking for men and women with hearts of humility.

206
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 God is willing to look at individuals with hearts of generosity, others first, integrity.

207
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 Men and women who are willing to stand up, who are willing to give up their lives to serve the Lord.

208
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 God is looking always, always with the heart, and the condition of the heart versus the outer appearance.

209
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 Why? Why not outer appearance?

210
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 Because, simply, he's created you.

211
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 Number one, he's created you.

212
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 He's given you all your strengths.

213
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 He's given you and placed you and given you the riches of your life.

214
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 He's given you the talents that you have.

215
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 He's given you the position you are, how wealthy you are, whatever it is.

216
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 God has given you all that, so that's number one.

217
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 Number two, if you base your skills, and God looks at your skills, there's something you can brag about.

218
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 There's something you can say, "Look at what I can do."

219
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 And that's not it.

220
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 Ephesians tells us, "For it is by grace you have been saved, not by yourselves."

221
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 Why? So you can't boast.

222
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 God looks at the heart of the individual.

223
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 And never about your skills, never about your strengths, never about the things that you have, all of these different things.

224
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 Let me give you a couple of stories and illustrations of what I mean by this.

225
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 There's a pastor that I get a chance, so if you don't know me, I mean, instead of running five different organizations, I get a chance to run five different organizations, right?

226
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 So instead of one, I run five different organizations.

227
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 But one of the jobs I get a chance to do is I get to work with different ministry leaders on conferences that are held throughout the world.

228
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 And in the midst of all that, I get a chance to interact with pastors, speakers that have books, radio, that have great podcasts, that have a pretty well-known, and that's either good and sometimes bad.

229
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 I've met different people, I say this, who have written books that I said, "Wow, I can't believe I met this person.

230
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 I want to meet with them and realize, oh, wow, they're not exactly what I thought they was."

231
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 So one situation comes in.

232
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 I had this conference I was overseeing.

233
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 And this pastor comes in, and he's very well-known.

234
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 He has a large social media following.

235
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 He has book deals. He's always on the speaking circuit.

236
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 He had to do, for this particular conference, he had to do one workshop, and he had to do one 10-minute devotion.

237
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 That's all he had to do.

238
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 And so as a result of that, he then charges $5,000 in expenses for his time.

239
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 He traveled first class.

240
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 He won a large honorarium.

241
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 He didn't like the hotel that we put him in because he thought it was not nice.

242
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 He checked himself to a $500 hotel.

243
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 He started eating expensive meals, and suddenly his assistant sends me his receipt.

244
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 And for one day and a half, I'm looking at the expenses, $5,000.

245
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 And so naturally, I don't have the budget for this because I wasn't authorized.

246
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 So I go back to his assistant and says, "I can't do this.

247
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 We're going to have to reject it."

248
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 Again, very talented.

249
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 Huge book writer. Huge following. Everything like that.

250
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 Calls me up one day, and it's a Sunday now.

251
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 I'm in Houston. I'm at an event.

252
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 Calls me up and says, "Oh, why is this guy calling me? Coming from church?"

253
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 He says, "Tommy, let me just say this to you.

254
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 You have disrespected me.

255
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 Highly disrespected me because you're questioning my integrity and questioning my finances."

256
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 I said, "Yeah, you're right. I'm questioning your finances."

257
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 He says, "Here's why you're doing this.

258
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 Because your life stinks.

259
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 You probably live a miserable life.

260
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 Your kids probably hate you.

261
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 Your wife probably hates you.

262
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 You probably have no friends.

263
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 And that's why you're disrespecting me.

264
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 So I want you to do something like this.

265
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 I want you not only to pay my reimbursement,

266
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 but I need you to go on social media and apologize for disrespecting me,

267
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 or I will make your miserable life more miserable than it is right now."

268
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 God honors the heart.

269
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 It doesn't matter what skills you have.

270
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 It doesn't matter what you do or not able to do.

271
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 God honors the heart.

272
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 Second story that I have.

273
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 I know an elder of a church.

274
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 Very strong, very, very involved.

275
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 Involved in finance, all of that stuff.

276
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 Very dedicated to all of this stuff.

277
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 But inwardly, he and his wife have problems all the time.

278
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 Why?

279
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 He can't control his anger.

280
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 Because behind closed doors--hey, he knows what to do on a Sunday, right?

281
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 He knows what to do at churches on a Sunday.

282
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 He knows what to say.

283
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 He's there on Sundays.

284
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 He's there helping out with finances.

285
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 He's on the elder board.

286
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 But his wife says to me, "Behind closed doors."

287
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 He yells and screams to the point sometimes the neighbors are ready to call the police.

288
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 He cannot control his anger.

289
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 He belittles.

290
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 He's never happy.

291
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 God sees this.

292
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 We think no one has seen all these things.

293
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 But God sees it.

294
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 Because God is always after men and women whose heart belong to him,

295
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 whose heart are full of integrity,

296
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 whose heart is devoted to him.

297
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 God always looks at the heart.

298
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 Never, never on the outer appearances.

299
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 One last thing I just said to you.

300
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 I just came back from Nairobi.

301
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 When you go to Nairobi, you see roads galore.

302
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 You see overpasses.

303
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 You see new buildings being built, everything.

304
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 It's a brand-new city.

305
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 But then when you talk with the people there, the city is poor

306
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 because it's ruined by corruption.

307
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 Because you have people who are what they say are Sunday Christians

308
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 who all go to church.

309
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 Eighty-five percent of the population in Nairobi says they're Christians.

310
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 They all go to church on Sundays.

311
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 The president, the politicians all go to church on Sundays.

312
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 Monday through Friday, they do whatever they want.

313
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 And so as much as the money, which by the way, a lot of the money

314
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 and all the changes in Nairobi is funded by who?

315
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 The Chinese.

316
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 And as a result of the Chinese, they poured in all of this money.

317
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 And the politicians in Nairobi who are supposedly Christians

318
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 are benefiting from all this, but that money is not going to all the city.

319
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 And so you have people who are poor.

320
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 You have people in slums.

321
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 You have people who are struggling.

322
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 But only a few people are getting wealthy.

323
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 God's anointed for all of us.

324
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 God chooses to anoint you.

325
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 You have the potential, wherever you are, to sit in there,

326
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 to be anointed by God to do something great.

327
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 You really do.

328
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 What is the state of your heart?

329
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 Where is your heart?

330
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 Is God working your heart?

331
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 I don't care how talented you are.

332
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 I don't care how wealthy you are.

333
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 I don't care how educated you are.

334
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 I don't care how well you speak.

335
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 God cares about that heart.

336
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 Let's go on.

337
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 The story goes.

338
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 And the story goes to verse 7, chapter 17.

339
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 And it goes to verse 1.

340
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 And we're reading from the ESV.

341
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 And now the Philistines gathered their armies for battle.

342
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 Go into 17.

343
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 And they were gathered, or Soca.

344
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 Now the story goes that he's anointed David.

345
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 And now there's a battle which belongs to Judah.

346
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 And a camp between Soca and Ezekiah in Ephesus, the Mim.

347
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 And Saul and the men of Israel.

348
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 Now Saul was the king now of Israel.

349
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 We're gathered.

350
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 And they camped in the valley of Elah and drew up a line of battle

351
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 against the Philistines.

352
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 And the Philistines stood on the mountain on one side.

353
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 And Israel stood on the mountain on the other side with a valley between them.

354
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 And there came out from the camp of the Philistines a champion named Goliath the Gath,

355
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 whose height was six cubits, or over nine feet tall in his span.

356
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 Let me give you a little background on this in order to understand fully this story.

357
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 Take a look at this, right?

358
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 Let me give you a background on this.

359
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 Here's-- and if you guys get a chance, over there, there is a PowerPoint over there.

360
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 Well, the PowerPoints over here that I have is-- thank you very much.

361
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 Look at the two descriptions.

362
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 I gave-- the left-hand column is the Philistines.

363
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 The Philistines were coastal people.

364
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 They were sophisticated cultural people.

365
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 That was the Philistines.

366
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 The Philistines had learned how to use iron to make weapons and tools.

367
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 They were a master of iron.

368
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 They had a monopoly of iron.

369
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 But contrast that to the Israelites.

370
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 The Israelites were primitive people.

371
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 They were composed of shepherds and farmers.

372
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 They had no experience in working with iron at that time.

373
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 The Israelites were so, in some sense, appeared so inferior to the Philistines

374
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 that they lived in the mountains because the fertile valleys were dominated by the more powerful Philistines.

375
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 And, at the same time, here's something important to remember.

376
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 Remember what the Philistines are key at.

377
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 They were great blacksmiths.

378
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 They were great at iron.

379
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 Let me give you a point.

380
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 1 Samuel 13, 19, all right?

381
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 Here's the way it reads.

382
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 Not a blacksmith could be found in the entire whole land of Israel

383
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 because the Philistines had said, "Otherwise, the Hebrews will make swords or spears."

384
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 So all Israel went down to the Philistines to have their plow shares,

385
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 maddox, axes, and sickles sharpened.

386
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 The price were two-thirds of a shekel for sharpening plow horses and maddox

387
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 and a third of a shekel for sharpening forks and axes and repointing goats.

388
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 So on the day of battle, not a soldier with Saul and Jonathan had a spear or sword in their hands.

389
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 Only Saul and his son Jonathan had them.

390
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 What is the picture that's being painted?

391
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 Understand the context is very key.

392
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 Philistines came from Gath, had all of the supply of swords and iron.

393
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 They were masters at that.

394
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 Israelites were the primitive people who lived in the non-fertile valleys in the mountains.

395
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 They were farmers. They were shepherds.

396
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 The only one who had weapons was Saul, and Jonathan had the swords.

397
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 Because why? The Philistines had a monopoly on everything.

398
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 So now you're asking, as we read into it,

399
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 so why in the world are the Philistines invading the Israelites?

400
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 Are they just doing it for fun, or what's wrong with it?

401
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 Let me show you a series of three pictures, alright?

402
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 Here's a series of three pictures right here.

403
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 If you guys could see all these things, here's the first picture.

404
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 You see the Israelite camp, and you see the Valley of Elah.

405
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 If you go to Israel right now, the Valley of Elah is still there right now.

406
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 The Israelite camp is where the mountains are, and you see the Philistine camp.

407
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 Let me actually give you a closer picture as well, too.

408
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 You see right there, Gath is to the west of the Philistines, right?

409
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 You see the Israelite camp, again the Valley of Elah, and also the Philistine camp.

410
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 Let me actually then now go to a third map, and now you'll understand why this battle was taking place.

411
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 Take a look at this.

412
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 Right in the middle, you see where Ezekiel and Soca was?

413
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 That's where your Philistines and the Valley of Elah and all of that are.

414
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 You see Gath right there.

415
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 What do you see?

416
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 The Israelite is right there in the mountain, and where does it lead?

417
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 It becomes a gateway to what?

418
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 Look up north.

419
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 You see Bethlehem, you see Jerusalem, you see all of Bethel, all of these different places, Shiloh.

420
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 It is the gateway to the Jordanian Valley.

421
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 It is a key strategic point.

422
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 The Assyrian Empire at that point in time, many of the empires went through this gateway to make their trades.

423
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 What does the Philistines know?

424
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 That as much as they have the fertile valley, if they can control that gateway, it opens up the trade routes for them to control the gate routes.

425
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 It's like the tax collector Matthew, right?

426
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 So they need to control that gateway.

427
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 And who's standing in the way?

428
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 The Israelites.

429
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 So as a result, let's bring in everyone and get rid of the Israelites.

430
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 And you know what?

431
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 We're such a powerful army.

432
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 We're not even going to waste our time.

433
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 Let's not waste our soldiers.

434
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 Let's not have anyone get hurt.

435
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 Let's send in a big guy, Goliath.

436
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 Let's have him battle their biggest one because it probably doesn't stand a chance.

437
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 And whoever wins, if we win, we'll leave.

438
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 Which we probably are guaranteed that we won't win.

439
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 If we lose, we leave.

440
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 If we win, you're out.

441
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 And so Goliath shows up, and boy does he show up.

442
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 For 40 days, he comes in and out with the same challenge.

443
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 Bring your best soldier.

444
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 Bring your best hero and let him battle me and let's see who wins that out.

445
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 All for this particular valley.

446
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 And now we go to 14 to 18.

447
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 David, in verse 14, was the youngest.

448
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 The three eldest followed Saul, but David went back and forth from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem.

449
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 And for 40 days, the Philistines came forward and took his stand morning and evening for 40 days in verse 14 and now 16.

450
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 And Jesse said to David his son, "Take for your brothers an epath of his parched grain in these ten loaves

451
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 and carry them quickly to the camp to your brothers.

452
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 Also take these ten cheeses to the commander of their thousands.

453
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 See if your brothers are well and bring what?

454
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 Some token from them."

455
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 Which, you're going to actually, that plays an important role for them.

456
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 "Bring some token for them."

457
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 If point number one is that God chooses to look at the heart of the individual,

458
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 when God anoints an individual, he looks at the heart of the individual and never the outer appearance,

459
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 then number two, you never know when God comes calling.

460
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 You never know when God comes calling.

461
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 You never know when God is ready to call you.

462
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 You never know when that chapter in your book turns.

463
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 You never know what adventure he has.

464
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 You never know what plans he has for your life.

465
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 And so we approach our life with open hands.

466
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 We approach our life with great anticipation.

467
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 We approach our life sitting there each and every single day saying,

468
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 "Lord, what is it that you want me to do?

469
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 How can I continue to serve you each and every single day?"

470
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 Because you never know when God comes calling.

471
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 You never know when he has a plan for you.

472
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 So you live with an anticipation because why?

473
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 And we always talk about this because you are a steward of what God has given you

474
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 because your life is not yours, but you are a steward of what God has given you.

475
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 And when we are stewards, we are always anticipating to serve him in every aspect of our life.

476
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 It is a story of Nicodemus when he is called by God and he interacts with Jesus.

477
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 He never knew that through that interaction in John chapter 3,

478
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 when God says, "For God so loved the world," it will open his life.

479
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 Or it becomes the whole idea of Nehemiah.

480
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 We read about Nehemiah at 60-something years old as the cupbearer of the king.

481
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 Nehemiah is called to rebuild the walls.

482
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 He is 60-something years old.

483
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 God calls him to rebuild the walls.

484
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 He has had a lucrative job as cupbearer of the king.

485
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 Now he is called to rebuild the walls.

486
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 But what is the key is he hears one day that Jesus is coming to Jericho.

487
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 He wants to see Jesus in the midst of it.

488
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 Jesus invites himself to his house.

489
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 And Jesus says, "I want you to do something. I want you to stay as a tax collector.

490
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 But I want you to make a difference in your city."

491
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 In contrast to Matthew where he says, "Matthew, pick up your everything as a tax collector.

492
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 Follow after me.

493
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 Peter, James, and John, move away from being fishermen.

494
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 Follow after me."

495
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 You never know when God comes calling.

496
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 You never know when he is calling you to do something big.

497
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 So you live your life with anticipation.

498
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 You live your life with open hands.

499
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 You live your life constantly praying, "Lord, what do you call me to do?"

500
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 But more so, very important too,

501
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 you are faithful to where he has placed you at.

502
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 That wherever he placed you at, whether it's a stay-at-home mom,

503
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 whether it's in a job that you cannot stand,

504
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 whether it's a dead-end job,

505
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 whether it's in whatever situation that you're in,

506
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 you're faithful to where he has placed you at.

507
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 But you're always anticipating.

508
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 You're always looking.

509
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 You're always praying.

510
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 You're always looking, asking that God may make sense and close and open doors for your life.

511
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 Here's the one thing for those who are sitting there,

512
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 especially those who are in their mid-20s to mid-30s,

513
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 because I get a chance to talk with you guys quite a lot.

514
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 If you're sitting there in your mid-20s and 30s,

515
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 a lot of times you're always wondering what God is wanting you to do.

516
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 You're always anticipating.

517
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 You're always saying, "God, what do you want me to do?

518
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 I want to know what God wants me to do."

519
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 But you're not content.

520
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 Be content with where you are.

521
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 Learn why God is--and we'll talk a little bit about that later.

522
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 Be faithful to where God has placed you,

523
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 but always be looking.

524
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 If number one is God works in those who are anointed

525
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 by finding those individuals

526
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 and looking at identifying where the heart is,

527
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 then number two, you never know when God is going to work.

528
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 You never know when God's calling, so you're anticipating.

529
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 Number three--and we're going to work at the final thing,

530
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 and then we're going to move on.

531
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 Story goes, in '28, Iliab--we remember Iliab, right?

532
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 Iliab was the oldest son of Jesse.

533
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 He was the oldest brother of David.

534
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 Now, Iliab, his eldest brother, heard when he spoke to the men,

535
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 and Iliab's anger was kindled against David,

536
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 and he says, "Why have you come down?

537
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 And with whom have you left those sheep in the wilderness?

538
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 I know your presumption and the evils of your heart,

539
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 for you have come down to see the battle."

540
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 And David said, "What have I done now?

541
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 Was it not but a word?"

542
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 Point number three--the anointed leader will be criticized by others.

543
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 The anointed leader will not be free of criticism.

544
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 The anointed leader needs to learn to have thick skin

545
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 and learn that he or she can never make people happy, everyone happy,

546
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 and you are sometimes prone to criticism,

547
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 and you are not free of criticism.

548
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 You're going to have to learn that.

549
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 Too often, a lot of times, we like to be liked, right?

550
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 Especially for those who are Asian sitting here, we like to be liked.

551
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 We don't like conflict.

552
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 I don't like, for me personally, when people criticize me.

553
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 My defenses get up.

554
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 I sit there questioning all of these different things.

555
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 I like peace.

556
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 I don't like to deal with conflict.

557
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 We don't like when people don't like us.

558
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 But sometimes, as God's anointed,

559
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 you're going to have to make decisions that will never make people happy.

560
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 You may make decisions that people would disagree with,

561
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 that are critical with.

562
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 People may not like you because they're jealous of you.

563
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 People may not like you because they just don't like you.

564
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 God's anointed will not be free of criticism,

565
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 and you're going to have to learn to have thick skin.

566
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 You're going to have to learn not to take it personally.

567
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 But as God's anointed, you are making decisions

568
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 that glorify and honor the Lord in all that you do,

569
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 and that's a very fact.

570
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 You're going to have to deal with criticism.

571
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 Just like, for instance, Iliab over here doesn't like David.

572
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 Why? We don't know.

573
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 Does he have an intent against David?

574
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 Does he not like the fact that David was anointed by Samuel and he wasn't?

575
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 We don't know. I would guess probably so.

576
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 And so he's critical.

577
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 Look at what he says to him.

578
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 This little flock that you have,

579
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 these few sheep in the wilderness,

580
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 he's very critical of him.

581
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 You're not going to make people happy.

582
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 And so as a result, how do we learn to have thick skin?

583
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 How do we learn not to make things personal

584
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 but to continue to go forth with what God has called us to do?

585
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 If number one is the fact that God's anointed,

586
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 God looks at the heart of the individual

587
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 and never the outer appearance,

588
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 then number two is that you never know when God comes calling.

589
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 And you live with open arms, you live with open hands,

590
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 you live with anticipation, asking that God is working.

591
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 But number three, you've got to learn to be thick-skinned.

592
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 You've got to learn not to be taking things personally.

593
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 You've got to learn that sometimes people will be critical.

594
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 Out of jealousy, out of fact they disagree with your decisions,

595
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 whatever it is, but you're going to have to learn through all that stuff.

596
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 God's anointed means that you are a steward of what God has given you.

597
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 And for David, he had to learn these lessons before he became king.

598
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 And so as a result of that,

599
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 now next time I come back we're going to talk about part three.

600
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 There's a second half of the battle against Goliath.

601
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 And then we're going to talk about the aftermath of the days.

602
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 But for you, look, here's the one thing I would say to you for those who are listening.

603
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 Wherever you are in the world as you sit there,

604
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 always know that God has a plan for you.

605
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 Always know that he chooses to want to anoint you to do something bigger

606
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 than you can't even imagine for the gospel.

607
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 Now you're going to have to figure out as we wrap up what that calling is.

608
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 But that means you've got to be asking and living in anticipation

609
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 of what that practically means in your life.

610
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 But you're going to have to do business with your heart.

611
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 Because no matter what your skills are outwardly,

612
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 it's the heart that really matters.

613
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 So as we sit here, do we want to be used by God? Yeah, we do.

614
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 Do we want to be doing great for God in everything that we do? Yeah.

615
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 I think all of us will say yes.

616
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 But what does it say to your heart?

617
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 Are you anticipating for God to work in your life?

618
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 Are you learning to not take things personally?

619
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 Because God's anointing will not be free of criticism.

620
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
 How well are you doing in those three areas?

621
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 Let's come back next month and talk about the rest.

622
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 Let's pray.

623
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 Father, thank you for how you work with us each and every single day.

624
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 Thank you for the words that you give us as we look at the life of David

625
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 and how you anoint God, how you anointed David

626
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 and you bring him on the journey.

627
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 And we pray that as we face our own calling,

628
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 the journey that you have given to us,

629
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 that we learn from the lessons of David.

630
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 May you use us in ways that we can't even desire

631
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 to make a difference for you and for the gospel and the glory of God.

632
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 Thank you for the story of David.

633
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
 We lift these things up to you and give off our heart.

634
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 We pray for anticipation, and we pray for thick skin

635
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 to continue to honor you.
