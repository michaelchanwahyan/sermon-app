[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.840]   - Good morning everyone.
[00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:06.200]   Yeah, thank you Veronica for the clear announcement
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.380]   with different languages.
[00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.580]   Just like the song that we have just sang,
[00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.340]   from every tribe and every nation, right?
[00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.380]   You know, that is Christ's mind.
[00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.260]   You know, Christ is going to redeem every people
[00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.620]   and every tribe and every language to worship him, right?
[00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.260]   He is the Lord of all of us, okay?
[00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.740]   So very good to see you, okay?
[00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.580]   Very good to see you.
[00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.500]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.220]   Salaam, brother.
[00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.220]   Yeah, all right.
[00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.380]   So I'm speaking three different languages.
[00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:39.620]   Yeah, that's all I can do.
[00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.020]   (laughing)
[00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.180]   Yeah, but that is the way to worship God
[00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.840]   because we use different languages,
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.840]   we use different dialects to express our praises to God,
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.540]   right?
[00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.060]   And our God is worthy of our praise.
[00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.260]   And we continue our series on back to basics.
[00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.340]   And there are basics in our Christian life,
[00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.820]   basics in our Christian walk, and we have to master.
[00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.620]   We have to understand, right?
[00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.260]   So often we don't find it enjoyable in our Christian walk
[00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.660]   or in our Christian journey, we have troubles
[00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.620]   because we have forgotten the basics.
[00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.560]   And these are basics that we need to focus on.
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.100]   And that's why in this series,
[00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.900]   we're going to go back to some of the basic understanding,
[00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.700]   basic knowledge, basic teaching of the Bible.
[00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.500]   And I've introduced something new to the congregation.
[00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.860]   It is the verse of the week, right?
[00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.220]   Remember this verse last week?
[00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.420]   Remember this?
[00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.260]   Verse of the week.
[00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.260]   And let's recite together, all right?
[00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.900]   I, that's part of your homework is to memorize it, right?
[00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.020]   Have you?
[00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.820]   I'm sure you have.
[00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.540]   Verse of the week, let's recite it.
[00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.720]   You must love the Lord your God with all your heart,
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.300]   all your soul, and all your mind.
[00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.780]   And this is the first and greatest commandment, right?
[00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.460]   That's what Jesus said to us.
[00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.140]   This is the first and greatest commandment
[00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.180]   of all the commandments in the Old Testament, in the Bible.
[00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.740]   There are many details, there are many different
[00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.980]   commandments and statues you can find in the Bible.
[00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.800]   But this is the most important thing.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.980]   This is the ultimate summary, right?
[00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.680]   The ultimate summary of what God desire us to do
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.400]   is to love Him, to be loyal to Him, to follow Him
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.600]   with all our heart and soul and our mind.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.480]   And last week, we were talking about the importance
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.120]   of the Word of God in our Christian walk, right?
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.840]   Our Christian walk, we cannot do so
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.680]   without the Word of God, without a correct understanding,
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.480]   without a solid teaching of sound doctrine.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.400]   And that's why God has given us the scripture.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.440]   And this is the verse of the week for this week,
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.720]   for this current week.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.360]   And it's taken from the chapters that we are studying on.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.560]   It's 2 Timothy 3, the last two verses.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.000]   16 and 17, last two verses.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.600]   Let's recite it together.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.800]   All scripture is breathed out by God
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.520]   and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction,
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.520]   for training in righteousness,
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.320]   that the man of God may be complete,
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.960]   equipped for every good work.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.860]   2 Timothy 3, 16 to 17.
[00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.000]   All right, so we got to have this verse,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.440]   or these verses memorized for this week, okay?
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.680]   So whenever you are doing this or doing your work
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.680]   or there is some break time in your mind,
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.560]   try to recite this.
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.560]   I give you the Bible reference, 2 Timothy 3,
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.440]   and you can find it and recite it.
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.120]   All scripture is the breath of God, you know?
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.760]   And we're gonna study this chapter, chapter three.
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.760]   And remember last time I said this long chapter
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.840]   of 17 verses can be divided into two parts.
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.600]   And the first part is verses one to nine.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.160]   Second part is 10 to 17.
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.600]   And the first part from verses one to nine
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.520]   is the dangers of neglecting God's word.
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.360]   God's own word, if we neglect or we ignore,
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.080]   there are dangers, right?
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.320]   Remember Paul is trying to warn Timothy.
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.480]   And again, Paul is the mentor pastor of Timothy.
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.360]   Timothy is his disciple.
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.360]   Timothy is kind of his mentee.
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.360]   And Timothy is being in charge of the churches in Ephesus.
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.760]   And Paul is writing this letter in very personal tone.
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.720]   That's why we call it pastoral letters, right?
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.480]   First and second Timothy in the book of Titus.
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.440]   He's writing to his mentees.
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.720]   Timothy is one of them.
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.520]   And trying to teach them, trying to encourage him
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.720]   to persevere in shepherding the church of God.
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.840]   There were many opposition, there were false teachers,
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.040]   there were many dangers in the church,
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.600]   in the small churches in Ephesus.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.400]   And the first nine verses, it says there were dangers
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.280]   warning Timothy that this is the last days.
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.840]   Remember what I said about last day in New Testament term?
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.200]   The last day is the period between the first coming
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.220]   of Christ and the second coming of Christ,
[00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:24.680]   the final coming of Christ,
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.800]   which is still lying in the future, right?
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.040]   First coming of Christ, we know what it is.
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.760]   Incarnation of Christ, Jesus came in human form,
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.680]   fully God and fully man.
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.480]   And he died for us, died for our sins.
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.240]   And on the cross, he was crucified.
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.760]   And on the third day, he rose again
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.920]   and he was ascended to heaven.
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.840]   And he's king in heaven.
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.520]   And that is the first coming.
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.240]   And between first and second coming, it is the last days,
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.920]   the last period of human history
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.920]   according to biblical timeline.
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.320]   And Paul is saying to Timothy, this is a dangerous time
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.280]   because there are many difficulties
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.800]   and people are drawn to falsehood, right?
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:13.040]   I remember a few years ago when we had the pandemic,
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:18.320]   when the pandemic first hit us, right?
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:24.280]   Remember on social media, there's so much misinformation,
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.520]   right?
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.320]   There's so much conspiracy theories
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:32.320]   or just feeding our uncertainty, feeding our fear.
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.280]   And sometimes people are being hijacked
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.460]   by fear and uncertainty.
[00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.160]   And because the time was difficult, right?
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.760]   And we were in fear.
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:45.080]   And whatever information feed into our brain, our mind,
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.720]   especially sensational materials,
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:52.720]   they become like wildfire in the social media.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:58.440]   And I just wonder, shaking my head at times,
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:02.800]   why people would come to believe in falsehood, right?
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:07.080]   Something is clearly wrong, right?
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:10.080]   And they just never double check, right?
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:15.080]   And, you know, scammers, right?
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.640]   It's all over the place, right?
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:19.480]   Yeah.
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:24.040]   I don't know how many scam calls you get during the week.
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.120]   How many calls you get during the week?
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.960]   Or text messages?
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.280]   I can't count, you know?
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.120]   I can't count.
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.440]   You know, every day I get something like,
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:36.360]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.440]   (laughing)
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:39.280]   Something like that.
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.680]   In Chinese sometimes, sometimes in English, right?
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.160]   Hi, you know, I'm your old friend, you know.
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.640]   I know some of your friend.
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:50.320]   Or I even claim that they know my dad, you know?
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.120]   My dad passed away many years ago.
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.560]   (laughing)
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:57.160]   But, you know, there are people who believe in scams, right?
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:02.160]   Not too long ago, I received a phone call from a young girl.
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.920]   I received a phone call from a young girl.
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:09.480]   And she was in the mid-twenties.
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.760]   And she called me because she was in trouble.
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:16.800]   She received a call from IRS, you know,
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.240]   our tax department, right?
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.280]   US tax department.
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.920]   It's very scary.
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.280]   Called her and said,
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.920]   "Hey, you did not file your taxes, right?
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.040]   "For so many years, right?
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.440]   "You've been working, you did not file your taxes.
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:31.100]   "And now you have to pay back, all right?
[00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:33.700]   "And you have to pay back like $5,000.
[00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:37.680]   "But this is how you, you know, deal with IRS, right?"
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:39.800]   There's a scammer told her,
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:42.920]   "Okay, you go to the Apple store, all right?
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:47.920]   "You go to Apple store and buy Apple gift cards
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.740]   "of 5,000 worth, all right?
[00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:54.420]   "And you're gonna give me the gift card number
[00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:56.920]   "and the code or whatever identification.
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:00.500]   "And you give it to me, you know, through email online.
[00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:03.680]   "And then, you know, we're gonna cancel out your taxes.
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:04.520]   "All right?"
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:06.840]   And she believed it.
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:12.320]   She went to Apple store and got all the gift cards
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:17.660]   and 5,000 worth and gave all the numbers away.
[00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:19.680]   It was crazy.
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.940]   And that's why she called me.
[00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:24.900]   She said, "My goodness, I'm in trouble.
[00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:29.280]   "Now I realize, you know, it was a scam, right?"
[00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.060]   So miserable, right?
[00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:34.740]   There's nothing I can do, right?
[00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:36.820]   There's nothing you can do, right?
[00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:39.140]   But it just blow my mind, you know,
[00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:44.140]   how she could have believed something like that, right?
[00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:45.420]   You know why?
[00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:47.700]   It's not because she was stupid, right?
[00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:48.760]   She's very smart.
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:54.740]   It was because she was in fear, right?
[00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:57.000]   Indeed, she did not file taxes.
[00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:00.280]   Indeed, for a couple of years, she did not,
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:03.840]   she forgot or she just ignore it, right?
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:08.020]   And she knew that she owed some money to IRS, right?
[00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:13.080]   And that's how the scammers got to her, right?
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:16.300]   Because she was in a state of uncertainty and fear
[00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:18.520]   and all sorts of misleading content
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.800]   that she would believe, right?
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.560]   And this is the last stage, right?
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.720]   And we continue to read this passage.
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:30.720]   We find that Paul is trying to urge Timothy
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.780]   to learn the truth and learn the word of God.
[00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:35.980]   And that's why the second part, he says,
[00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:40.920]   there's so much benefit of learning the word of God,
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.220]   learning the truth, trying to discern, right?
[00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:46.380]   And we go through this part of this passage already
[00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:49.920]   last week from verses 10 to 15.
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:53.720]   And now we come to this two verses,
[00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:57.720]   the verse of the week, verse of this week.
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.520]   And I tell you, in the entire Bible,
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:04.440]   these two verses, 2 Timothy 3, 16 to 17,
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:09.300]   are some of the most important verses in the Bible.
[00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:15.440]   These two verses are some of the most important verses
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.820]   in scripture.
[00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:20.820]   And let's unpack it and we'll see why.
[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:23.680]   It says, "All scripture is the breath of God."
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:24.520]   God breathed.
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.960]   God breathed.
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:31.960]   And it's useful for teaching, rebuking,
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:35.200]   correcting, and training in righteousness,
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:39.360]   so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:42.920]   for every good work.
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:47.920]   Now, these verses are very, very valuable, very important.
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:49.000]   And why?
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:54.600]   Now, this is the last paragraph of chapter three.
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:57.040]   And Paul is trying to encourage Timothy,
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.760]   yeah, learn from your mentors, right?
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.640]   Remember, Paul is one of his mentors.
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.480]   And who else?
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:09.480]   His mother and Timothy's grandmother, right?
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.720]   Eunice and Lois.
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:14.880]   Learn from them, because since you were a child,
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:19.240]   you were learning scripture from these people, right?
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:21.800]   And here in verse 16, he says,
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:25.000]   "All scripture is the breath of God."
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.120]   Well, let's unpack it.
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:31.120]   Our first, the key word here is the breath of God.
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:33.280]   God breathed out.
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.920]   He spoke forth His word.
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.400]   And God is the speaking God.
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:44.040]   God spoke and God is speaking today.
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:47.200]   And God will be speaking tomorrow.
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:50.040]   And God is the God who speaks.
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.880]   The idols don't speak.
[00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:55.320]   They may have mouth, they may have lips,
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:57.560]   but they do not speak.
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:00.560]   Now, you don't have to be thoroughly learned in the Bible
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.840]   and you get the point, right?
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:04.440]   Because the first page of the Bible,
[00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:07.520]   when you turn to the Bible, the very first page,
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.080]   the very first chapter, very first passage,
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.080]   is Genesis one, right?
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:14.900]   In the beginning, God created the heaven and earth, right?
[00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:16.400]   And then there were some other details,
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.040]   the spirit of God upon the water.
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:19.800]   And what did God do?
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:22.400]   What was the first thing God did?
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:25.360]   He said, right?
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:28.320]   And God said, what did He say?
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.080]   Let there be light, right?
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.800]   Let there be light.
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:33.680]   And then there was light.
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:36.800]   So you got that from the first passage of the Bible,
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:41.800]   that God has the attribute of speaking.
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.200]   God is someone who reveals.
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:46.640]   God is someone who tells you what to do.
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.720]   God is someone who can speak.
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:51.920]   And here it says all scripture is the breath of God.
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:53.160]   It's the very breath of God.
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.200]   It tells you that God himself
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:00.560]   is the ultimate author of the Bible.
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:03.000]   You have your Bible on your phone app
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.640]   or you have a physical print Bible,
[00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:09.860]   but here it declares that all scripture,
[00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:13.360]   the Bible is actually written by God.
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:17.480]   Of course, it's written by God through people, right?
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:20.840]   Through human authors, like Paul himself, right?
[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:23.680]   Like Luke, who wrote the Gospel of Luke.
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:26.320]   And Mark, the Gospel of Mark.
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.240]   And some of the letters,
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:29.600]   or Moses wrote some of the books, right?
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:33.800]   But the ultimate author is God himself.
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:36.720]   And it tells you the authority of scripture,
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.720]   the standard of scripture.
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.560]   You know, we are an evangelical church,
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:46.360]   and we are in the great tradition of reformation.
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:51.360]   More than 500 years ago, 1517.
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.200]   1517.
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:58.200]   That was the year that launched the movement of reformation.
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:01.200]   And the guy who launched it,
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:06.200]   one of the guys who reformed the faith at that time
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:08.400]   was Martin Luther, right?
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:10.360]   Not Martin Luther King, Jr., okay?
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.900]   That's a different guy, right?
[00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:14.240]   Martin Luther, 1517.
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:15.880]   Martin Luther, okay?
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:17.320]   He's a church reformer,
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:22.320]   because he saw the Catholic church was broken,
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:26.560]   and they were not coming under scripture.
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:31.560]   So the entire movement of reformation is to call people,
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:35.440]   call the churches to return to the word of God.
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:39.360]   And the scripture is the final authority
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.400]   of everything that we believe
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.720]   and how we practice the Christian faith.
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:45.680]   We always have to return to the word,
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.040]   return to scripture.
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:50.440]   And Paul is saying all scripture is the standard,
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:52.120]   because God has written it,
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:54.360]   and he has divine authority.
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:59.360]   It says all scripture, all scripture, singular, singular.
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:07.440]   Now, in the time of Paul, they only had the Old Testament.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:09.960]   Do you get my point?
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:12.680]   The New Testament was still in the making, right?
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:15.240]   Some of the letters are being written.
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:18.160]   By this time when Paul wrote 2 Timothy,
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.820]   some of the letters from the Old New Testament
[00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:25.160]   or even the gospels were already being circulated,
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.800]   circulated in different churches.
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:31.280]   But the entire New Testament, New Testament canon,
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:34.200]   all 27 books are still in the making.
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:37.160]   And the Christians in Paul's days in the first century,
[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:38.960]   they only had the Old Testament,
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:43.000]   which was originally written in Hebrew.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.920]   And a couple of hundred years before Jesus,
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:49.080]   it was translated into Greek.
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:51.560]   And the apostle Paul or the early churches,
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.960]   they were using the Old Testament only,
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:58.400]   either in Hebrew or in the translated version Greek,
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:00.200]   we call it Septuagint.
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:02.320]   They only had the Old Testament.
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.080]   Now, listen up.
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:09.080]   All scripture, Paul is saying all of the Old Testament,
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:11.400]   right?
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:15.000]   All of the Old Testament, whether it's Hebrew or translated,
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   they are as one, the Word of God, right?
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.960]   The whole Old Testament is already the very Word of God.
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:25.800]   Right?
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:30.880]   Now, you think about it, this is pretty interesting,
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:32.720]   pretty inspiring.
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:34.480]   Just the Old Testament, right?
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:35.680]   Just the Old Testament.
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:39.680]   Yeah, maybe somehow your house got caught on fire, right?
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:42.000]   And your Bible is being burned, right?
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.080]   Let's say the New Testament, all 27 books
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:45.840]   are being burned away, right?
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:47.640]   They've been consumed by fire.
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:51.920]   You got out of the fire and you got the Old Testament, right?
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:54.960]   You still have the Word of God, right?
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:58.360]   The first 39 books.
[00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:00.320]   Paul is saying all the Old Testament
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:03.480]   is already the very Word of God.
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.400]   And think about it, this is very interesting.
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:08.960]   For us, we have more than the Old Testament, right?
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:13.080]   Because Jesus came and all the books of New Testament
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:16.280]   are being written about Him coming, right?
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:20.720]   And all 27 books are being added to the,
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:24.960]   what we call canon, what we call the full revelation
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.480]   of God in scripture.
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:29.680]   And now we have Old Testament and the New Testament.
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:31.760]   We have the Old Testament's 39 books
[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:34.000]   and we have the New Testament 27 books.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.360]   How perfect we are, right?
[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:42.920]   We have more than what Paul had, right?
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:44.360]   What Timothy had.
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:46.000]   And we know the Word of God,
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   we know the will of God so much more.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.320]   And we can comprehend the Word of God
[00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:55.360]   or the mind of God, even with more content, right?
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:58.400]   We are so blessed to have so much
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.880]   that God has revealed to all of us,
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.720]   the Old and the New Testament.
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:05.800]   And Paul is saying all scripture is the breath of God
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:09.280]   and it's useful, it's profitable, right?
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:13.000]   Useful for teaching, for rebuilding, correcting
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.320]   and training in righteousness
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:20.320]   so that we can be fully equipped for every good work.
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:23.200]   Let's unpack this.
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:27.400]   I still like the New Living Translation, NLT.
[00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.480]   And I give you here and at the bottom of the screen
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:33.560]   is the contemporary Chinese translation.
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:39.080]   I think these more contemporary language
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:43.520]   would have us better understand
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:46.360]   the usefulness of scripture.
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:48.120]   There are four phrases.
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:50.360]   Paul is saying, if you go to scripture,
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:53.520]   you read the Bible, first thing,
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:57.360]   the Bible will teach you what is true, right?
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:59.920]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:00.760]   Right?
[00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:02.320]   Teach you what is true.
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.960]   And secondly, is to make you realize
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:08.320]   what is wrong in your life, right?
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:11.040]   I tell you one of the secrets, I think,
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:13.560]   that we don't like to read Bible.
[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:15.120]   You know why?
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:17.400]   Because of this second purpose.
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.840]   We don't like to be confronted, right?
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:23.000]   We always want to be comforted, right?
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.760]   But you know, you go to scripture,
[00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:28.040]   so often the scripture confronts us, you know?
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:31.520]   There are behaviors, there are mindset we have to change.
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:32.400]   Right?
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:36.400]   And when it comes to changing and repenting,
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.120]   we just don't like it, right?
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:40.600]   That's why sometimes we ditch the Bible, right?
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:42.080]   We just don't like to read it.
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:45.400]   Or we like to read it because we just want to read it
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:47.240]   selectively, right?
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:49.520]   We're just cherry picking all the time, right?
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:53.920]   Just like to read whatever we like or sound good to us.
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:58.080]   However, there are many, many passages in the Bible
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:01.440]   that confronts us, show us that we have sins
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:03.520]   to repent from.
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:06.160]   We have shortcomings.
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:08.840]   We need to ask God to give us grace.
[00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:11.360]   And that is the value of scripture, right?
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:14.080]   To tell us, yeah, there's something wrong with us, right?
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:15.720]   And that's why we need grace.
[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:17.760]   And that's why we need Jesus Christ,
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:19.360]   to make us realize this,
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:22.160]   so that our life cannot be the same.
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:24.680]   We can be changed and we can be changed
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:26.360]   by the grace of God, right?
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:30.080]   Only if we allow God and the Spirit to work in our lives.
[00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:31.320]   And that's the second purpose.
[00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:33.560]   The third purpose is to correct us.
[00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:36.280]   It's not just showing you what is wrong in your life,
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:41.280]   but it's to tell you when, to correct you,
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:43.480]   to show you the way, the right way,
[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:45.360]   when you are wrong, right?
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:46.200]   Yeah.
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:52.000]   I've been driving for almost a year,
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:54.080]   over 30 years, yeah.
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:55.640]   Over 30 years, yeah.
[00:21:55.640 --> 00:22:01.480]   I consider myself a pretty experienced driver, right?
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:04.480]   Don't you think?
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:10.880]   And I also have some experience in teaching new drivers,
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:12.240]   right?
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:14.560]   You know, my sons and daughters, right?
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:17.480]   I'm trying to teach them how to drive, right?
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:22.000]   And it's such a pain to teach them.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.480]   It's so painful to teach a new driver,
[00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:27.560]   especially a young driver, right?
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:30.960]   I have to show them what is right, right?
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:34.560]   I also have to, and that is pretty easy, okay?
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:36.240]   You have to turn right.
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.640]   You have to turn left.
[00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:39.760]   You have to make a full stop here, okay?
[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:43.480]   They said, "Dad, you don't always do a full stop."
[00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:46.600]   I said, "Don't worry about me, okay?
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.360]   You have to do it, okay?
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:50.120]   Because you're a new student, right?"
[00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:51.200]   But that's pretty easy.
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:52.680]   The first thing is pretty easy.
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.640]   The second thing is pretty hard, right?
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:57.120]   To help her or him to realize
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:01.160]   there's something wrong in his or her driving, right?
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:04.160]   There's some habit you have not developed, right?
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:06.440]   Like checking your blind spot, right?
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:09.520]   Even today, I'm sitting in my son's car.
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:11.960]   I still have to remind him, right?
[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:13.960]   Every turn you're gonna make,
[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:16.880]   you have to always check the blind spot, right?
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:20.560]   Yeah, if you go to my cars, a few cars, a few old cars,
[00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:25.720]   I always have the, I always buy the blind spot mirrors.
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:28.000]   You know what that is?
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.760]   I stick it on the side of the side mirror, right?
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:33.400]   Because I've been using it for decades, right?
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:37.600]   And every single car that I own, or before, or now,
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:40.000]   I always have the blind spot mirror, right?
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.480]   So I have to remind the new driver,
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:43.480]   "Come on, you have to check your blind spot.
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:45.520]   That is the most important thing," right?
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:48.880]   Yeah, and sometimes they get angry.
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:50.680]   They get angry at me, you know?
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:52.520]   I'm so kind, right?
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:57.520]   I just want them to drive well, you know?
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:02.680]   But that is the human nature, right?
[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:04.160]   We don't like to be pointed out
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:06.960]   there's something wrong in our lives, right?
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:09.040]   But that's what scripture does.
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:12.080]   Not only showing us what is wrong in your life,
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:15.360]   but to correct you, to tell you what is the right way,
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:18.080]   the better way, right, to live.
[00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:22.000]   And then lastly, is to teach us what is right.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.400]   The original term for the fourth purpose,
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:30.820]   teaching us to do what is right,
[00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:35.820]   is actually, a better translation may be discipline.
[00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:37.760]   You know?
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:39.160]   You know what discipline is?
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:41.640]   Habit, right?
[00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:42.880]   Remember, beginning of the year,
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:45.680]   I have a series on the book of Proverbs,
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:50.640]   and the series is called Atomic Wisdom, right?
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:54.120]   Atomic habit, it means small, tiny habits
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:56.840]   that we have to build in our life
[00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:01.840]   so that we can be godly, we can be trained and equipped
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:04.480]   to walk in the way of God, right?
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:07.560]   And there are tiny atomic habit we have to develop.
[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:10.080]   Ask questions, you know?
[00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:12.360]   Now, meeting together is one of them.
[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:13.840]   Reading the Bible is one of them.
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:16.100]   And praying, we're gonna talk about it later,
[00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:20.440]   some of the habits or disciplines
[00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:22.840]   that we have to develop, right?
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:26.840]   And every one of us know what discipline looks like, right?
[00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:29.520]   In the beginning, it was painful, right?
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:34.160]   But as you go on, as you persevere, as you continue,
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:37.800]   you find it is helpful for you, right?
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:38.640]   Right?
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:42.960]   But those of the people who do workouts
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:45.600]   from time to time or regularly,
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.400]   you know what I meant, right?
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:49.040]   You know what I meant, right?
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:52.400]   When I first do, try to do workout,
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:53.880]   did I tell you?
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:55.180]   I do plank, right?
[00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:59.400]   I do plank, I started with, it was a couple years ago.
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:01.120]   You know, I find that, you know, I'm getting old
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:03.740]   and I need to do some more exercises, right?
[00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:05.220]   And, you know, being a pastor,
[00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:08.000]   sometimes we just sit there and in front of the screen,
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.360]   we have to prepare messages
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:11.600]   and we have to answer phone calls and email and all that.
[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:14.920]   And sometimes we just get lower back pain, right?
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:19.920]   And I started with plank for only 45 seconds.
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:22.920]   Dude, it was painful, right?
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:26.100]   And now I can do seven minutes, right?
[00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:27.600]   Can you do seven minute plank?
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:31.680]   It's pretty good, right?
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:32.880]   For someone like me, right?
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:34.160]   Over 50.
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:37.880]   But, you know, you build up your body, right?
[00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:41.280]   And you become stronger and stronger and stronger, right?
[00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:43.960]   Until today, if I don't do plank,
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:45.240]   I feel like there's something wrong
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:47.160]   and something missing, right?
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.980]   So to get up, I have to do plank again, right?
[00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:51.520]   And push up and all that stuff.
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:55.480]   That's what I'm saying, discipline.
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:27:00.480]   NLT has it, teaching us to do what is right.
[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:03.440]   Peiyang, xingyi.
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:06.160]   Peiyang, cultivate, right?
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.600]   It's a habitual pattern, right?
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:15.000]   And we all know the Olympic games
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.880]   are gonna start soon, right?
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:18.520]   July 26th, right?
[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:19.520]   Olympic games.
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:22.960]   I don't know if you watch some of the preparation
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:27.720]   and some of the qualifying games on TVs.
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:29.640]   It's pretty interesting to watch.
[00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:33.300]   And pretty exciting and inspiring to watch.
[00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:36.900]   But the athletes, why are they doing what they do, right?
[00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:41.420]   How could they do something like that, right?
[00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:45.140]   Because they have gone through tough training, right?
[00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:49.260]   It's not something that you can do overnight.
[00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:53.220]   They do it day after day, hour after hour,
[00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:54.500]   minute after minute.
[00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:59.500]   Then that's why they have the ability to do it, right?
[00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:04.800]   Christians, we need to read scripture
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:08.380]   and we have to understand scripture, right?
[00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:13.980]   I'm thankful we have at least the men's breakfast, right?
[00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:18.100]   And we're going through scripture verse by verse
[00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:20.100]   or chapter by chapter.
[00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:23.360]   I hope this will continue to develop.
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:25.540]   They'll develop into a more solid,
[00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:27.460]   like a Sunday school class, right?
[00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:29.660]   And a Bible study, so that we can have
[00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:32.540]   a better understanding of the word of God, right?
[00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:35.900]   And we're gonna close by this verse of the week.
[00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:38.740]   Oh, by the way, yeah, I said the old scripture,
[00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:40.960]   2 Timothy was the worst of the week, right?
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:42.460]   This should be the one.
[00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:43.300]   Sorry about that.
[00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:45.140]   Yeah, I'm dating myself.
[00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:48.220]   This is the verse you have to memorize
[00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:49.980]   for this coming week, all right?
[00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:51.840]   Verse of the week, all right?
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:54.780]   Matthew chapter five, verse 14.
[00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:57.220]   "You are the light of the world,
[00:28:57.220 --> 00:29:01.640]   "like a city on a hilltop that cannot be hidden."
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:05.000]   The light of the world.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.120]   This is the verse you have to memorize this week, all right?
[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:10.640]   Why did I pick this verse?
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:15.640]   You know, in Jewish tradition, Jewish rabbinic literature,
[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:19.780]   they discuss what is light, what is light.
[00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:24.560]   And to them, what is light?
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:26.480]   The Torah is the light.
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:30.100]   It's the light for life.
[00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:33.520]   The Torah, it meant the scripture, right?
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:39.000]   For the Jews, it was the Old Testament, right?
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.240]   The Hebrew Bible.
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:42.740]   For us, it's the entire Bible.
[00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:47.460]   And in their discussion among the rabbis,
[00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:51.200]   the Torah is the light of the world.
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:52.560]   The Torah is the light of the world
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:55.480]   because the Torah will give life to people.
[00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:57.800]   The Torah will give grace to people,
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:01.800]   will point people to the right way of wisdom.
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:04.740]   And here, Jesus said something really interesting.
[00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:07.080]   He was saying to his disciples, right?
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:08.900]   It's part of the Sermon on the Mount, right?
[00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:10.380]   Yeah.
[00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:13.380]   Pastor Chi has been preaching on it.
[00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:17.240]   He was talking to his disciples.
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:20.900]   "You guys are the light of the world."
[00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:23.300]   Wait a minute, what does it mean?
[00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:26.100]   That means you are the Bibles.
[00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:28.100]   You are the Torahs.
[00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:31.200]   You are the lives who will show people
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:34.060]   the beauty of the Word of God, right?
[00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:37.460]   If you listen to me and obey me, Jesus said,
[00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:40.760]   you are the light of the world, right?
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:43.400]   You know most people don't read the Bible, right?
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:45.240]   You know most people don't understand the Bible
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:47.120]   and where to start, right?
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:49.460]   But you guys are different, right?
[00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:52.520]   When they see you, when they see your life,
[00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:55.860]   they just see the beauty of God's Torah,
[00:30:55.860 --> 00:31:01.180]   God's law, God's very Word, right?
[00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:04.260]   Because you're living out the Word of God.
[00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:05.460]   You are the light of the world,
[00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:08.840]   like a city on a hilltop that cannot be hidden.
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:10.860]   You cannot hide.
[00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:13.980]   If you profess the name of Jesus Christ,
[00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:16.480]   you believe in the name of Jesus,
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:19.460]   you cannot hide, you cannot hide in the dark.
[00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:21.880]   And you are the light, right?
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:27.380]   And as we conclude, I want us to take this challenge.
[00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:33.620]   To take this challenge is to read and meditate scripture,
[00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:36.860]   right, to read and meditate the scripture.
[00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:39.460]   You are the Bible in some sense.
[00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:41.260]   You are the Word of God.
[00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:43.500]   And you know, in our time, in our age,
[00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:48.180]   I think this is the most challenging thing that we all face.
[00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:51.300]   It's not so much of preaching the gospel
[00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:54.840]   or telling other people what they should believe.
[00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:58.080]   That is not the most challenging thing.
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:01.860]   It's that the most, the biggest challenge for us
[00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:05.980]   is that, is how to give people a good, convincing,
[00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:10.980]   positive impression of what the Christian is like.
[00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:15.580]   You can tell people about the gospel,
[00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:18.140]   but at the end, you need to leave a good,
[00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:19.880]   positive impression.
[00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:22.460]   Whether the person believes or not, right?
[00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:23.900]   Whether the person is convinced
[00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:26.460]   about the gospel of Jesus Christ or not.
[00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:27.380]   That is not the question.
[00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:28.780]   That is not something we can do, right?
[00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:31.320]   Only the spirit can do, right?
[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:36.180]   But what we are urged to do is to give people
[00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:41.180]   the positive, convincing impression
[00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:44.720]   of what believing in Christ is like, right?
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:46.700]   Can we do that?
[00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:50.920]   To our family members, to our children,
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:55.840]   to our spouse, to our neighbors, right?
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:57.160]   Can we do that, right?
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:01.680]   By what we say and how we behave, right?
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:03.800]   How we interact with other people.
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:06.920]   Let them see a good impression.
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:10.960]   Let them see the convincing impression, right?
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:13.140]   You are the light of the world.
[00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:13.980]   Let's close.
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:16.900]   (smacks lips)
[00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:20.480]   Father, we all come before you.
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:25.780]   We confess that we're broken, we are weak.
[00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:28.800]   Sometimes we do ignore the word of God.
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:32.820]   But the word of God is right in front of us.
[00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:34.520]   But we neglect it.
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:39.460]   We'd rather watch videos, we'd rather scroll our phones,
[00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:42.980]   and being distracted by all these worldly desires.
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:46.960]   We come before you to confess our sin.
[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:48.840]   So cleanse us and forgive us.
[00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:54.960]   Let us focus, once again, the light that you have given us
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:58.960]   that will shine into our lives,
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:01.640]   all the darkened corners of our heart.
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:03.780]   And we need your word.
[00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:08.320]   And may we continue this habit
[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:12.280]   to read and to meditate your word.
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:14.660]   For your word is good.
[00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:18.920]   Your word is precious and perfect.
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:23.140]   Give us the understanding, give us the wisdom,
[00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:25.440]   so that we can understand scripture,
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:26.820]   understand the very word.
[00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:30.140]   In scripture, we find you.
[00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:32.760]   In scripture, we find you being with you.
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:36.880]   And thank you for being our good and faithful God.
[00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:39.400]   May we take your word more seriously.
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:42.020]   May we read your word more diligently.
[00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:46.560]   So that we are full of your message,
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:51.080]   full of your word, so that we can be the light
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:53.080]   to this darkened world.
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:55.520]   Send us out this week.
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:59.920]   So we go to our neighborhood, go to our families,
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:03.380]   to interact with other people, Christians or not,
[00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:07.480]   that our lives will be the light.
[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:10.620]   Our lives will be your word.
[00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:13.200]   And we will be your representatives.
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:17.200]   Send us out and use us, and help us to dig into your word
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:20.280]   and to help us to understand your very word.
[00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:23.080]   Thank you for being our God who speaks,
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:24.920]   and you still speak.
[00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:27.620]   Speak to us through your spirit, through scripture.
[00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:34.200]   Grant us an obedient heart to listen and to obey
[00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:35.120]   in Christ and pray.
[00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:38.720]   All right, guys, hope to see you next week,
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:40.820]   and we'll continue to serve our God
[00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:42.900]   and to understand the word, all right?
[00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:43.740]   God bless.
