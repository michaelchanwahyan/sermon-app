1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,360
 - Well, good morning, everyone.

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:06,040
 It's nice to see everybody up here, from up here again.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,840
 And I know that Rebecca, my wife, was here just with you

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,560
 all last month for a couple of times, and twice,

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,960
 and in an art workshop.

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,960
 And the first message she gave was--

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,560
 (audience applauding)

8
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,880
 Was on the topic of the power of storytelling

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,560
 and Jesus being the goat.

10
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,480
 And her second message was diving into

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,640
 one of the parables of the wheat and tare.

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,060
 And also, she facilitated an art workshop,

13
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,560
 and I really appreciated some of the artwork

14
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,480
 that she had photos of.

15
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,740
 And my favorite was one where someone made an ice cream,

16
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,180
 given that's my favorite thing right now.

17
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:50,880
 Time really flies, because the last time I was up here,

18
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,940
 I realized when I was preparing for this message

19
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,960
 was actually last October.

20
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,960
 So it's already been a little over a year.

21
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,800
 And for that message,

22
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,980
 I actually prepared one called "Lightning Our Yolks."

23
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:10,080
 If some of you are here, you remember that in Acts 15,

24
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,440
 I talked about how we sometimes put on additional

25
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,600
 individual and corporate yolks on ourselves.

26
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,160
 And these are the additional spiritual restrictions

27
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,400
 that we prescribe ourselves,

28
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,720
 that kind of hinder our spiritual faith journeys.

29
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,480
 But instead, Jesus prescribes to us

30
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,320
 that he is lightening our yolks,

31
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,620
 and that he will give us greater joy and freedom,

32
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,440
 because we can know that we have these lighter loads

33
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,360
 that we carry, and he's helping us carry them.

34
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,420
 At the end of the message, I mentioned that

35
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:47,720
 even though we're afforded greater freedom and greater joy,

36
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,220
 there's still a yolk that we have to carry.

37
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:54,640
 A lighter one, but we're still expected to maintain

38
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,260
 proper conduct, behavior, and live our lives

39
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:01,180
 that are, in a way, glorifying to him.

40
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:05,800
 Carrying this yolk, doing this work,

41
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:10,460
 still requires a degree of focus, intention, and discipline.

42
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,940
 I really appreciate coming here,

43
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,920
 because Pastor Mark always gives me freedom to choose

44
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,240
 whatever topic I wanna preach up here.

45
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,380
 And it wasn't my intention to actually tie in

46
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:24,980
 what I talk about today with the message

47
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,420
 that I prepared before, but it kinda ties in together.

48
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:32,500
 So I really kinda like that it worked out this way.

49
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,780
 I've been praying about what message to give,

50
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,320
 and the message today is what I got,

51
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,700
 and it happens to still connect with what I did last time.

52
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,040
 So anything we do, especially focused work,

53
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,580
 requires a level of preparation, training,

54
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,020
 and right mindset.

55
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:55,020
 Our message today comes from 1 Corinthians 9, 24 to 27.

56
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,140
 And the sermon title, as you guys saw,

57
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:01,400
 is Do You Even Lift, Brah?

58
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,660
 The passage today is from 1 Corinthians 9, 24 to 27,

59
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,940
 and I'll read it.

60
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,520
 I know it's a little bit small for you all,

61
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,220
 but I'll read it.

62
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,320
 Do you not know that in a race, all the runners run,

63
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,460
 but only one gets the prize?

64
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:18,060
 Run in such a way as to get the prize.

65
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,700
 Everyone who competes in the games

66
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,500
 goes into strict training.

67
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,660
 They do it to get a crown that will not last,

68
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,900
 but we do it to get a crown that will last forever.

69
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,140
 Therefore, I do not run like someone running aimlessly.

70
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,700
 I do not fight like a boxer beating the air.

71
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,180
 No, I strike a blow to my body and make it my slave

72
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,220
 so that after I preach to others,

73
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,780
 I myself will not be disqualified for the prize.

74
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,740
 In Rebecca's presentation and messages,

75
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:48,580
 she prepares very beautiful slides.

76
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,260
 I'm sorry, mine will disappoint

77
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,820
 because they're not nearly as elegant.

78
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,060
 Actually, they're the opposite.

79
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,840
 They're very, very crude.

80
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,060
 But I lean more kind of your common pop culture

81
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,860
 cliche visual tools.

82
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,180
 So hopefully some of you will appreciate.

83
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:07,440
 And I know there's a broad age and generational range here.

84
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,860
 Some probably as young as high school or college

85
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,340
 and those that might even be retired.

86
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,220
 And so I know that my title requires

87
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,380
 a little bit of explanation for those especially

88
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:21,380
 that don't know what it actually means.

89
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,420
 The phrase, do you even lift brah?

90
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:27,220
 Is actually a mocking question used for people

91
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,060
 who attempt to look or act capable in something

92
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,860
 but actually aren't.

93
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,720
 Case in point is someone like this guy, right?

94
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,720
 I think that he's presenting this persona of a lifter,

95
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,360
 very athletic, but I think some of us question

96
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,520
 whether or not he has the ability.

97
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,820
 It's often used against people who want to give,

98
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,460
 this phrase is often used against people

99
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,300
 who give the impression that they're really strong

100
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,820
 and athletic, but in fact, they look very foolish

101
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:01,420
 and we kind of quickly see through their kind of facade.

102
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:05,440
 Because those who actually engage in something like lifting

103
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,440
 or athletic training know that it requires a lot of focus

104
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,600
 and a lot of preparation and training.

105
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,560
 I don't know the closest Mandarin translation

106
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,120
 to this particular phrase, but I know that in Cantonese,

107
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,840
 there used to be something that a lot of people use

108
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,020
 in the movies, in Hong Kong movies.

109
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,680
 It's like (speaking in foreign language)

110
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,380
 and so that question is, do you have the qualifications?

111
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:35,260
 And actually it kind of points out to someone like,

112
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:38,000
 you kind of try to look the part of something,

113
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,640
 but do you actually have the backing, the credentials

114
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,980
 to support the persona that you're presenting?

115
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:50,480
 When I mention these ideas, I'm sure some of you have

116
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,280
 some memories that come to mind of your own experiences.

117
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,000
 In my case, I remember years ago

118
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,760
 when I was still going to the gym.

119
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,360
 I don't go to the gym anymore, I have two kids

120
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,720
 and I have a puppy now, so all I do is just take care

121
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,240
 of them and that's sufficient enough exercise for me.

122
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,480
 But I remember that there was a time

123
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,960
 when I was going to the gym and this was at Export

124
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,000
 on State Street and I was there for an hour with my friend

125
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,040
 and I was lifting weights and there was a guy that came in

126
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,920
 and he had full track suit, he had a headband,

127
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,440
 he brought his gym bag and he was ready to look like,

128
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,880
 well he looked like he was ready to lift,

129
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,640
 but in fact he sat down at the bench press

130
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,800
 and he pulled out a whole chicken dinner out of his bag

131
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,340
 with a cup of soda and he just proceeded

132
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,720
 to eat dinner at the gym.

133
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,400
 For the whole hour I was there,

134
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,360
 he didn't even do one exercise,

135
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,920
 he was just sitting and enjoying his meal.

136
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,360
 So that for me is like the perfect example

137
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,680
 of when you would use the question, do you even lift, bruh?

138
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,680
 Because this guy is coming in and showing his athleticism,

139
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,880
 but really there isn't very much of it.

140
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:01,520
 In our passage, Paul uses the visual image of running

141
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,880
 and this is a metaphor, an image that connects the idea

142
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,680
 with our own spiritual journeys, our spiritual walks.

143
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,720
 He says, do you not know that in a race all runners run,

144
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,560
 but only one gets the prize?

145
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,880
 Run in such a way as to get the prize.

146
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,320
 He's calling us to keep our faith muscles

147
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,040
 well conditioned and activated for the Lord's work

148
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,260
 and for our faith journeys.

149
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,760
 Paul highlights that our faith journey

150
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,760
 is demonstrated through action

151
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,140
 and not just a cognitive process that happens in our minds.

152
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:39,480
 Living out our faith is more than the mental belief

153
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:43,760
 that God exists in identifying Jesus as our savior.

154
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,080
 It requires a manifestation of our faith

155
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,500
 through our actions.

156
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:52,640
 We're not just thinking about what we know as truth,

157
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,640
 we're living it out.

158
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,520
 It's not a basic matter of belief

159
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,280
 through intellectual insight,

160
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,600
 but it's an actively engaging process

161
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,440
 and Paul, in our passage, uses this metaphor

162
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,620
 to connect this for his original audience.

163
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,260
 But it also really kind of ties into what we understand

164
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,600
 in our modern times as well.

165
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,080
 Paul's audience is the Corinthian church

166
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,040
 and the believers are in Corinth,

167
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:24,720
 which was a major Greek commercial city in his time.

168
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,240
 The idea of running a race was actually very familiar

169
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,280
 to them because they had a long history

170
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,240
 of holding what were known as the Isthmian Games.

171
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,520
 And these were the games that I think

172
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,260
 that our Olympics are actually modeled after.

173
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,200
 These games happened every two years

174
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,780
 and athletic as well as musical competitors

175
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:44,360
 from all of Greece would descend upon Corinth

176
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,820
 and compete in honor of Poseidon.

177
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:51,500
 This happened since like 582 BC,

178
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,600
 so by the time Paul was using this example

179
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,040
 of running a race, people were already familiar

180
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,360
 with this for centuries.

181
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,440
 Paul takes an idea that the Corinthians understand

182
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,520
 and uses it to help them visualize

183
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,560
 a right perspective of Christian living.

184
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,780
 Paul turns around the idea as well

185
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,560
 of this big competition being in honor of Poseidon

186
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,920
 and instead attributes what we do

187
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,680
 for God's honor and glory and for his service.

188
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:23,540
 Throughout his letter to the Corinthians,

189
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:27,400
 Paul addresses a laundry list of specific matters

190
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,960
 that range from addressing disorderly church conduct

191
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,180
 and leadership to divisions,

192
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,640
 to sexual immorality in the church.

193
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:40,360
 He addresses things like lawsuits among believers,

194
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,320
 divorce, sexual immorality.

195
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,880
 And I mentioned before that Corinth

196
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,480
 was this important city of commerce in Corinth.

197
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,820
 And to make a comparison, it's not unlike Hong Kong

198
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,820
 or New York or London.

199
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:59,020
 It was a major port city where there was a lot of trade.

200
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,500
 And with trade in these places,

201
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,220
 it wasn't just the trade of physical goods,

202
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:06,020
 but trade of physical ideas and culture

203
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,180
 and beliefs as well.

204
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,220
 And with any big city, we know there's big city problems.

205
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:15,020
 And Corinth was definitely experiencing this as well.

206
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:18,440
 The church was, by comparison to the Jewish churches

207
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,220
 in kind of the Israeli regions,

208
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,060
 not as grounded in moralistic traditions

209
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:27,120
 and that culture that they had for a very long time.

210
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,720
 And so with a younger church like the Corinthian church,

211
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,440
 you have leaders and followers that are

212
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,680
 just kind of understanding the outside world

213
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,520
 and are not as mature.

214
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,460
 And they're bringing in the ideas that they understand

215
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:43,060
 from their usual conditioning into the church.

216
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:46,020
 And so Paul is writing the church to address

217
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,780
 the deficiencies in their theology

218
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,100
 and their practices.

219
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:56,260
 Paul addressed topics that are very much practical.

220
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:59,900
 And he stares away from the idea, again,

221
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,660
 of a passive idea of our faith

222
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:05,260
 and just understanding it as a concept.

223
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:07,360
 His belief was demonstrated by him.

224
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,460
 Well, like looking at Abraham,

225
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:13,780
 our original kind of forefather of the faith,

226
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:18,500
 we know that God credited his faith as righteousness to him.

227
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,020
 But this wasn't just him believing.

228
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,780
 It was backed by action.

229
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:26,500
 And we know that Abraham left everything that he knew.

230
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,420
 He left his family, his home,

231
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:31,060
 and he went to an unknown place

232
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:34,920
 where God even called him to sacrifice his son.

233
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,260
 And he was obedient.

234
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:41,260
 So he didn't just believe.

235
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:44,180
 He demonstrated his belief through action.

236
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,140
 And what I'm saying is that genuine faith

237
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,660
 is exhibited through consistent action.

238
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,940
 And this is a way that we serve and glorify God.

239
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:55,260
 The race that Paul refers to

240
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,140
 is his race to fulfill the mission of God,

241
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:00,100
 to proclaim the gospel to as many people as he can

242
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,260
 and to save as many as he can.

243
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:05,300
 And I'm not trying to present the idea

244
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,780
 that, oh, we're trying to earn our way to salvation.

245
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,940
 We are justified as soon as we believe.

246
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:15,540
 This is a demonstration of what real faith is

247
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,620
 because it's consistent with how we act.

248
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:18,920
 It's not just what we say.

249
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,020
 I think the example of loving someone

250
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,620
 is a very helpful one in showing this.

251
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,860
 Authentic love is reinforced by how you express it.

252
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:31,020
 So if I tell my children that I love them,

253
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,860
 but I don't spend time with them to do the things they like,

254
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,580
 I don't support them, I don't encourage them,

255
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,820
 I can't say that my love is really genuine.

256
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,980
 In the same way, thinking that just belief in God is enough

257
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:45,140
 is not enough.

258
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,380
 We have to demonstrate it through action

259
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:50,100
 because even Satan and the demons believe in God

260
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:50,980
 and they fear him.

261
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,400
 If we're looking at the act of running

262
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,700
 as a metaphor for our faith journey,

263
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:00,780
 there are specific spiritual practices in our lives

264
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,900
 that then represent our spiritual muscles, so to speak.

265
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:09,540
 These are our actions like our prayer life,

266
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:13,020
 our devotions, our grounding ourselves in God's word.

267
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:17,300
 And like muscles, these areas need to be developed over time

268
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:20,780
 and conditioned as well so that we can run like an athlete,

269
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:23,980
 so that we can do the work God calls us to do.

270
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:27,460
 In our physical bodies, when our bodies are not engaged

271
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:31,380
 in activity and using our muscles, do you know what happens?

272
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,580
 There's something called atrophy that happens.

273
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,660
 The muscle starts to weaken and it starts to diminish.

274
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,620
 And because the body deems these muscles as non-essential

275
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,940
 'cause we're not using them,

276
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,920
 it just degenerates and fades away.

277
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,100
 This is especially visible, I think, in older folks

278
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,640
 where they're just less active and so their muscles

279
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,460
 begin to shrink and they just become smaller.

280
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,460
 But this can happen with younger folks too.

281
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:56,460
 If any of you have broken a limb, like an arm or a leg,

282
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,740
 and you put a cast on, and then at the end of your healing

283
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,140
 and you take away the cast, that arm or that leg

284
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,380
 on one side is gonna be smaller than the one

285
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,740
 on the other side because it's atrophied.

286
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:11,500
 And likewise, with our spiritual condition,

287
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,060
 our spiritual practices, if we don't keep engaged

288
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,500
 in things like reading God's word

289
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,460
 and grounding ourselves in prayer and fellowship

290
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:22,180
 and these type of actions, we also will begin to

291
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,980
 kind of degenerate in our spiritual strength

292
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,220
 and our spiritual muscle.

293
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:33,340
 When we engage in training and keeping ourselves

294
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,880
 sharp and ready, we'll be able to handle times of stress

295
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,420
 and even take advantage of times of opportunity.

296
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,460
 There's something called muscle memory.

297
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,500
 Some of you might know it if you guys are athletes.

298
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:48,140
 And it happens where when through repeated training

299
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:51,220
 of something, an action, your body just begins

300
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,700
 to know what to do in specific situations

301
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,180
 where you trained it to do something.

302
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:59,780
 Because your body reverts back to its conditioning

303
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:02,700
 when you might not be thinking about how to react

304
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,460
 in a certain situation.

305
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:07,180
 This is why athletes and soldiers train

306
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,820
 and train and train.

307
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,860
 Because in times of pressure and urgency,

308
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:15,360
 when we don't have the time to think about a certain action

309
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,460
 we wanna take in a situation, our body naturally,

310
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:21,260
 intuitively responds in the way that we've trained it.

311
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:26,740
 Likewise, as we engage in prayer and worship

312
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:29,240
 and grounding ourselves in God's word,

313
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,180
 when there are times of crises,

314
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,140
 we will naturally go to do what we've been training

315
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,820
 ourselves to do.

316
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:39,140
 We don't think maybe, we don't have the ability to think

317
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,620
 'cause we might be so stressed out,

318
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,740
 but we will naturally gravitate toward that type

319
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:46,420
 of behavior and why training is so important.

320
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,040
 And it's not just in times of crises.

321
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,860
 It could be training for times of opportunity.

322
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,260
 So let's say like you're on the street,

323
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,540
 you're at a restaurant, you meet a friend of a friend

324
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,260
 and they find out you're a Christian.

325
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:59,380
 They want to know more about your faith and what it means.

326
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:03,580
 If you have not been doing the practices that I mentioned,

327
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:06,060
 you may not have the ability to truly,

328
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:10,420
 in a well-fashioned way, articulate what the faith

329
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,900
 that you believe in actually means and is.

330
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:16,620
 And so the training is also to take advantage of opportunity.

331
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:21,340
 We need to remember that these spiritual muscles we develop

332
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:26,340
 serve the purpose of loving our God and loving our neighbors

333
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:29,900
 for advancing God's mission, his church,

334
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,620
 and to build up our fellow brothers and sisters.

335
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:36,500
 So these muscles that I'm talking about

336
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:40,020
 aren't for the vanity of our own self-righteousness.

337
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,540
 It's not for us to look in the mirror

338
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,760
 and to feel good about ourselves

339
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,780
 or to present ourselves to others.

340
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,620
 It's all for a purpose.

341
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,140
 And that purpose is to advance God's kingdom

342
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,940
 and to serve him and to build up his church.

343
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:54,540
 We don't engage in action for ourselves

344
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:57,060
 or for action for action's sake.

345
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:05,980
 So the second part of 1 Corinthians 9, 24,

346
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:10,100
 Paul says, "Run in such a way as to get the prize."

347
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,880
 There's a particular direction, a trajectory,

348
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,500
 and goal we're supposed to train and aim for

349
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,600
 when we're doing our training and our conditioning

350
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,540
 and our running of the race.

351
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:24,140
 Paul runs with a strong strategic purpose in his mind.

352
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:27,780
 As he says, "I do not run like someone running aimlessly."

353
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,380
 There's an objective to his actions.

354
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,060
 The problem is that we can get trapped

355
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,660
 in the cycle of keeping ourselves busy

356
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,040
 and doing very churchy things

357
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:41,040
 because we feel that that equals making progress.

358
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,820
 And like this example of the hamster,

359
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,220
 like he's just running and running and running

360
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,860
 and probably feels like he's going somewhere,

361
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,660
 but he's really going nowhere.

362
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,340
 And a lot of organizations today

363
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,020
 and in a lot of work meetings,

364
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:56,020
 they kind of go on and on

365
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,980
 and you might have meeting after meeting after meeting.

366
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,320
 And there are times when I've been in work

367
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,740
 where I feel like it's death by meeting.

368
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,820
 Like there's just meeting, meeting, meeting.

369
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:10,220
 And sometimes people feel like just because you're meeting

370
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,180
 and meeting for long periods of time,

371
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,540
 that there's progress.

372
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:16,300
 But that's not true.

373
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:19,300
 I mean, there are probably some of you that have been in,

374
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,140
 I know Pastor Mark has agendaless meetings.

375
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,420
 And this could be for work and it could be for church

376
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,240
 and it goes for hours and hours and hours.

377
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,060
 At the end of it, you're exhausted and you wonder,

378
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,880
 what did we actually accomplish?

379
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,100
 It doesn't seem like we accomplished anything,

380
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:34,900
 but some folks feel like by the pure fact

381
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,500
 that we're together, that some progress is made.

382
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:42,500
 And we need to not confuse the flurry of movement

383
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:46,240
 or busyness as actual progress.

384
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,580
 Paul lays out a very specific goal in his running.

385
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,660
 His main purpose is to advance the gospel

386
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,620
 to as many as he can.

387
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,940
 He discusses this in the section

388
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,420
 right before our focus passage here.

389
00:18:56,420 --> 00:19:00,900
 So we're focusing on 1 Corinthians 9, 24 to 27,

390
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:04,340
 but in verses 19 to 23, I'm not gonna put it up,

391
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,280
 but I'll just read it out loud.

392
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,060
 He says, "Though I am free and belong to no one,

393
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,300
 "I have made myself a slave to everyone,

394
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,200
 "to win as many as possible.

395
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,980
 "To the Jews, I became like a Jew to win the Jews.

396
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:18,380
 "To those under the law, I became like one under the law,

397
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,000
 "though I myself am not under the law,

398
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,340
 "so as to win those under the law.

399
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,100
 "To those not having the law,

400
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,000
 "I became like one not having the law,

401
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,960
 "though I am not free from God's law,

402
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,920
 "but am under Christ's law,

403
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,300
 "so as to win those not having the law.

404
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,860
 "To the weak, I became weak to win the weak.

405
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,340
 "I have become all things to all people,

406
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:40,420
 "so that by all possible means, I might save some.

407
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,640
 "I do all this for the sake of the gospel

408
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,600
 "that I may share in its blessings."

409
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,340
 Paul is saying that he will do whatever it takes

410
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:51,100
 to achieve his goal, to proclaim God's word,

411
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,600
 and save as many people as he can.

412
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,240
 He's willing to become a slave and serve.

413
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,080
 He's willing to become a Jew and take on Jewish traditions.

414
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,040
 He's willing to become weak and forgo the privilege

415
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:07,020
 that he has as a Roman citizen in his particular context.

416
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:10,500
 He's willing to become one apart from the law,

417
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:15,500
 not having the law, and eat and engage in activities

418
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,460
 with Gentiles, something that the Jews found repulsive.

419
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,820
 So he acts in various ways so that he can relate

420
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:26,000
 to his target audience, and not just with words.

421
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,160
 Paul's purpose adheres to what Jesus makes clear

422
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,980
 for all of us as our purpose in our spiritual lives

423
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,180
 in Matthew 28.

424
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:35,280
 And this is, I'm sure, overused,

425
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,740
 but this is the great commission that Jesus leaves us.

426
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:41,820
 He says, "Therefore go and make disciples of all nations,

427
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,780
 "baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son

428
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,580
 "and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them

429
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,980
 "to obey everything I have commanded you.

430
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,280
 "And surely I am with you always

431
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,840
 "to the very end of the age."

432
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:54,580
 So this is a command not just for Paul,

433
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:57,140
 but actually for all of us.

434
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:59,300
 Paul advocates engaging in action

435
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,780
 and engaging in action with purpose.

436
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:11,540
 Paul advocates this because also, not just with purpose,

437
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:14,980
 we also need a sense of urgency in our action.

438
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:20,260
 It's not okay to just participate in the race,

439
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:23,220
 uncaring of whether one actually aims to finish

440
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:26,180
 or cross the finish line.

441
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:29,980
 He says to run in such a way as to get the prize.

442
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:34,980
 In the ancient races, there was no second or third place.

443
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,220
 There can only be one.

444
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:40,060
 And maybe someone can appreciate that movie quote.

445
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:43,300
 But imagine that there's competition

446
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,540
 when you're running the race.

447
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,860
 No one waits on you.

448
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:49,340
 You have to push yourself,

449
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,700
 and there's a sense of urgency in all of that.

450
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,240
 You have to push your hardest.

451
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:56,820
 And these days we have, and I guess my children aren't here,

452
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:59,080
 these days we have diminished the need

453
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,320
 for competitive urgency in our society,

454
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,560
 especially for the sake of not hurting children's feelings.

455
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,080
 There are awards for everything.

456
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,440
 There's participation awards for just someone

457
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,800
 who participates and shows up.

458
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,520
 And everybody is crowned a winner.

459
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,800
 You might get a medal and a trophy.

460
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,260
 And I think that that bleeds into

461
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:22,000
 how our spiritual activities and lives are.

462
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,760
 It seems enough to just show up,

463
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,120
 even when we're not fully involved.

464
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,440
 And sadly, I think that breeds spiritual mediocrity.

465
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,100
 Regularly attending church and volunteering are empty

466
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,520
 if our daily life does not reflect Christian behavior,

467
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,480
 and there are no efforts to be made

468
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,920
 to advance God's mission.

469
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:46,060
 Without the drive to strive,

470
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,200
 I think people fall into the danger

471
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,600
 of stopping short of completing what their holy duties are.

472
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,400
 I think the aspiration of people working hard

473
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,000
 and retiring early is also a very damaging narrative

474
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,400
 for people to follow,

475
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,660
 especially when it bleeds into how we behave.

476
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:05,360
 Even amongst believers,

477
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,920
 there's this aspiration to retire in our 50s

478
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:11,080
 and maybe in our 60s at the earliest.

479
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,600
 And folks dream about time they're gonna spend

480
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,080
 on the golf course or on cruises they're gonna go on,

481
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,100
 vacations they're gonna take.

482
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:22,120
 But this is, in my opinion, a very modern notion.

483
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,760
 We have the luxury now to actually consider

484
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,940
 this more leisurely lifestyle in our later stages of life,

485
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,520
 when we couldn't do that before.

486
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,900
 But I don't think that's actually a very biblical notion.

487
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:38,320
 And despite modern advances in productivity

488
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,980
 and healthcare and safety in the world,

489
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:44,040
 there's still many problems where Christians

490
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,560
 are called to answer those issues,

491
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:52,560
 and where the gospel and Christian work is needed.

492
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,840
 Now, I'm not saying that we should maintain

493
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,080
 the same level of intensity throughout our lives

494
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,440
 and how we do God's work,

495
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,600
 but we're still meant to just keep our eyes on the prize,

496
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,480
 to kind of cross that finish line,

497
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,880
 really until the day we die.

498
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:09,780
 I had a friend that used to always say,

499
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:13,680
 I'll rest when I die, and he was a ministry worker.

500
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:18,300
 And I think that is probably the more biblical thing

501
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,680
 to have in mind when we're actually thinking about

502
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,940
 how we proceed with the later stages of our lives.

503
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,380
 So God deserves our first fruit efforts

504
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,560
 in every part of our lives.

505
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:31,200
 And we don't need to officially win to be the winner,

506
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,120
 but we have to be in it to win it.

507
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,360
 We have to have a winner's mindset

508
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,420
 where we're aiming for a goal,

509
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:41,420
 we're pushing our highest, and we actually go for it.

510
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:44,000
 And that only happens with a sense of urgency

511
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,500
 to advance God's kingdom.

512
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,460
 Our faith requires action.

513
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:53,460
 That action or these actions require purpose,

514
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,800
 a sense of purpose, frame with purpose,

515
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:59,280
 and there has to be a level of urgency and immediacy

516
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:03,400
 to how we approach that work.

517
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,920
 Now, this is a picture of the tortoise and the hare,

518
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:09,600
 and it's a very famous fable that I assume all of you know.

519
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,400
 We need to be like the tortoise in the fable here,

520
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,320
 where we're constantly pursuing our goal.

521
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,860
 Slow, well, not slow because he's slow,

522
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:21,520
 but steady wins the race.

523
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,720
 Whereas the hare here is actually just relaxing

524
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,960
 because he's relying on his talent and his abilities,

525
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,360
 but he's procrastinating, he's lazy.

526
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:34,160
 We operate in a world now where we have control

527
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,100
 over so many aspects of our lives.

528
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:40,240
 We can control so many things, even from our smartwatches.

529
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,000
 And we think that we are the ones in control,

530
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,280
 even of how we handle our kingdom responsibilities

531
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,360
 that the Lord has given us.

532
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:54,200
 Sometimes the problem is that it's not that,

533
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,560
 you know, we're slow in getting to the race

534
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,760
 or slow in the pace of our race.

535
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,240
 We haven't even started the race.

536
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,240
 And the most blatant experience that I've had

537
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,680
 is when I used to serve as a volunteer

538
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,160
 at a MBA campus ministry.

539
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:15,080
 And I overheard a student speaking to another student,

540
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,040
 and he was telling this other student

541
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,500
 that he's gonna get this very lucrative job,

542
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,840
 and that he's gonna make up to $10 million,

543
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,600
 and when he does, that's when he's gonna retire early

544
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,300
 and then start serving the Lord.

545
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:31,120
 He thought that it was appropriate to wait

546
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,540
 and allocate time later on in his life to serve the Lord,

547
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:36,280
 and there was no immediacy,

548
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:40,000
 and there was no need to start his race anytime soon.

549
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,160
 You know, this reminds me of the passage

550
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:45,560
 in James chapter four, 13 to 15, where James says,

551
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,240
 "Now listen, you who say today or tomorrow

552
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,940
 "we will go to this or that city,

553
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:53,300
 "spend a year there, carry on business, and make money.

554
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,180
 "Why?

555
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,720
 "You don't even know what will happen tomorrow.

556
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,940
 "What is your life?

557
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:00,220
 "You are a mist that appears for a little while

558
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,800
 "and then vanishes.

559
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,560
 "Instead, you ought to say, if it is the Lord's will,

560
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,980
 "we will live and do this or that."

561
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:09,920
 In contrast to the MBA student,

562
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,840
 one of my inspirations is Dr. Stuart Wu.

563
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,380
 I don't know if some of you might know him,

564
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,460
 but he's probably one of the most dedicated

565
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,780
 and faithful servants I've ever met in my life.

566
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,220
 And I first encountered Dr. Wu

567
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:26,160
 when I was doing a short-term medical mission

568
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,160
 in Zhongshan, China.

569
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,980
 He's a retired surgeon, and he would regularly,

570
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:35,140
 more than once a year, go out to remote parts of China

571
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,660
 where we would have to track mountainous areas

572
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:40,620
 to get to people and provide them medical care

573
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,140
 and also to share the gospel.

574
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:45,220
 He did this into his late 80s,

575
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:47,940
 until he was 87 and then passed away.

576
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,940
 And he never made a complaint that I knew of

577
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,180
 when he did this.

578
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:54,060
 And so, I was less than half his age.

579
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:56,780
 I was probably a third of his age when I first met him.

580
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:59,980
 And I didn't have nearly as much stamina

581
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:02,680
 and as much zeal as he did.

582
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,640
 And I wish to be like him,

583
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,640
 because he kind of constantly had this mindset

584
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,980
 of finishing the race and finishing well,

585
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,140
 even until his late 80s.

586
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:16,380
 Nope, that's not it.

587
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:22,380
 I know this last slide says active rest,

588
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:27,780
 but actually, my focus pivoted toward

589
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:30,500
 making sure that we have guardrails.

590
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,980
 As we run the race and start doing God's work

591
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:36,860
 to spread his good news and make disciples,

592
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,740
 we need to make sure that we don't take

593
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:41,460
 an end justifies the means approach.

594
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:45,140
 And that how we behave in the process

595
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,940
 of reaching that goal matters as much

596
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:49,540
 as actually reaching that goal.

597
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:52,660
 So, even if there are great results

598
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:55,500
 of people coming to the church, of the church growing,

599
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,480
 it doesn't give you a pass on how you act

600
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,900
 in the way getting there.

601
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:04,140
 The Lord cares as much about that journey

602
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:08,740
 as he does about the end goal that you're striving for.

603
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,460
 You know, the last part of this passage,

604
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,720
 Paul emphasizes that he makes sure

605
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,580
 that he's not disqualified in his attempt

606
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:17,320
 to obtain the prize by making sure

607
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,480
 that he keeps his body in check.

608
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:23,700
 In verse 27, he says, "No, I strike a blow to my body

609
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:27,440
 "and make it my slave, so that after I preach to others,

610
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,800
 "I myself will not be disqualified for the prize."

611
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,060
 I believe that he's actually alluding

612
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:36,400
 to keeping material and physical temptations at bay.

613
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,820
 Because earlier in Corinthians,

614
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,540
 he had addressed the audience to flee

615
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:42,220
 from sexual immorality in chapter six.

616
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,660
 And I think that he's alluding to this

617
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,660
 when he's talking about making sure

618
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,020
 that he's not disqualified.

619
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:54,340
 He makes sure that as he's fulfilling the work of God,

620
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,940
 that he's not discredited and doesn't discredit

621
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:59,940
 the Lord's work by his behavior.

622
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:03,300
 Sadly, in recent years, we've seen a lot of church leaders,

623
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:06,660
 even in our region, fall to sexual sin.

624
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:11,660
 And this has had severe impact on the churches themselves,

625
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,700
 as well as people coming to the church.

626
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:17,500
 And this is what we want to stay away from.

627
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:21,380
 And it may not be such a blatant sin as sexual immorality.

628
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,380
 It could be an arrogant attitude.

629
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,820
 It could be poor financial stewardship.

630
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,780
 It could be a lack of empathy for the people

631
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:30,300
 that we're actually trying to target.

632
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,660
 In my devotions recently,

633
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:35,980
 I'm now finishing the book of Deuteronomy.

634
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,700
 At the end of Deuteronomy,

635
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:41,780
 Moses is getting ready to go up to Mount Nebo and to die.

636
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:45,060
 And he will never be able to cross into the promised land.

637
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:47,100
 He gets a view of the promised land,

638
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,860
 but he's not allowed to cross it.

639
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:51,620
 And this happened because he actually

640
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:55,540
 did not follow God's exact orders.

641
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:59,060
 Even though he is a champion and a hero of the Bible,

642
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:01,700
 and he saved the Israelites from slavery,

643
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:04,060
 and took him into, or got him ready

644
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,720
 to go into the promised land,

645
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,520
 the Lord prevents him from going in,

646
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,560
 because instead of whispering to a rock

647
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:14,420
 to call forth water, he knocks it twice in anger.

648
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,560
 And this was enough for the Lord

649
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,020
 to actually prevent him and penalize him

650
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,780
 from going into the promised land.

651
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:24,380
 How we uphold ourselves during our work

652
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:28,580
 is as important as accomplishing the end result.

653
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:32,240
 It's not only about the end point, but how we get there.

654
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,580
 Not just about the finish line,

655
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,600
 but how we run the race itself.

656
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:41,960
 So, I ask all of you, do you even lift, bruh?

657
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:46,360
 If you have been diligently doing God's work,

658
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:50,360
 keep at it, and remember that we're in a continuous marathon

659
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:53,760
 that requires training, diligence, dedication.

660
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,680
 But also, the point that I want to highlight,

661
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,880
 and said that I changed,

662
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,560
 was also to make sure that we rest.

663
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:05,480
 We, I think, especially as immigrants,

664
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,440
 or children of immigrants,

665
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,160
 there's this very strong work ethic that we develop.

666
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,000
 And sometimes we bring that also into our faith,

667
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,320
 and we don't rest.

668
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,520
 And the Lord prescribed the Sabbath for us,

669
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,640
 so that we can make sure that we rest as well,

670
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,520
 and are recharged so we can run even stronger,

671
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,440
 and for God.

672
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,600
 Continuously train yourselves,

673
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,700
 keep yourselves sharp and ready,

674
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:32,040
 and your muscles going, you know,

675
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:35,200
 reading the word, praying, being in fellowship,

676
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,440
 serving actively in your communities,

677
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,100
 and then keeping yourselves accountable

678
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,080
 while in fellowship with others.

679
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,000
 And for those of you who are honest and say,

680
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,800
 no, I don't lift, now's the time to start,

681
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:53,300
 because there is, it's never too late to get started.

682
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,760
 And it's important to begin when you know

683
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,320
 that God's calling you to his great commission.

684
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:04,200
 So, go run the race, and do your part in God's great work,

685
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:07,560
 and get those muscles going, and well conditioned.

686
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,860
 Let me end this in prayer.

687
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:13,300
 Heavenly Father, thank you for this opportunity

688
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:17,640
 to preach your word, and to understand that our faith

689
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,480
 is one that is demonstrated through action.

690
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,760
 And Paul uses the visual of running a race.

691
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,400
 I pray that for each one of us,

692
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,340
 you help us to understand the areas in our lives

693
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,440
 where we need to be better conditioned,

694
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:34,040
 or to start conditioning, and to operate these muscles,

695
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:37,040
 these spiritual muscles, so that we can be ready

696
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,760
 for your work that you've called us to,

697
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:43,760
 to advance your kingdom, and to make disciples

698
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,400
 for your kingdom.

699
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,800
 In your name we pray, amen.

700
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,800
 - Amen.
