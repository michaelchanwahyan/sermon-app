1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,540
 And we turn to the Bible today, all right?

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:05,220
 We started this series on seven letters

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,520
 to the seven churches in the book of Revelation,

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,780
 and I want to tell you this, God writes letters, okay?

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,460
 God writes letters.

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,340
 Just imagine if God writes you an email, all right,

7
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:21,260
 and tells you what he thinks of you,

8
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,860
 as a Christian, as a Jesus follower,

9
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,940
 as a church, as a group,

10
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:29,020
 what would that email tell you, all right?

11
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:30,660
 If God writes you an email,

12
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,260
 if God's going to write you a letter,

13
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:36,740
 what would the letter be,

14
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,500
 and what is the content of the letter?

15
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,380
 Think about it, because this series,

16
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:44,220
 we are thinking about this important topic,

17
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:48,240
 is what Christ himself, the head of the church,

18
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,860
 you know, the head of the church is not the pastor,

19
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,420
 is not the deacons,

20
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:56,220
 is not the court team members or ministry team,

21
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,520
 is not you, definitely,

22
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,400
 the head of the church, or head of our church,

23
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,260
 is Christ himself, right?

24
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,840
 Jesus Christ himself.

25
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,700
 What does he think of our church?

26
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,800
 That is what matters, right?

27
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,160
 And what does he think of you, your role in the church, right?

28
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:20,480
 In the book of Revelation, Christ himself, Jesus himself,

29
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,080
 writes letters to the seven churches

30
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,140
 in what today is called Turkey,

31
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,600
 in the western Turkey.

32
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,440
 And we went through this in the first letter to Ephesus,

33
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,000
 and there are seven churches there, right,

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,460
 in seven different cities.

35
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,700
 The first one being Ephesus, right?

36
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,880
 And then the second one is,

37
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,440
 can you make it out from the map?

38
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,800
 Smyrna, right?

39
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,640
 Smyrna.

40
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,360
 And then kind of go clockwise, actually,

41
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,800
 clockwise, right, all the way to the seventh one,

42
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,960
 which is the old Assyria.

43
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,160
 And we read the first letter to the church of Ephesus,

44
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,360
 and now we come to the second letter.

45
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,360
 So we're moving from Ephesus, we follow that line,

46
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,200
 kind of the postal delivery service route,

47
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,240
 moving north to another harbor,

48
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,800
 another port city called Smyrna, all right?

49
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,240
 If you go to Smyrna today,

50
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,240
 you find that this is a modern city,

51
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,680
 and it's a very thriving city, actually, right,

52
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,240
 in western Turkey.

53
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,080
 By the way, I'm trying to put together

54
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:36,400
 a church group going to Turkey and Greece next year.

55
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,520
 I don't know if you're interested.

56
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,080
 You're interested, right?

57
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,120
 Yeah, you have to pay, right?

58
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,240
 You have to pay for it.

59
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,800
 Anyways, we're trying to put together,

60
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,160
 you know what happened in the Mediterranean East,

61
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:53,040
 the Israel-Palestine conflict, just tragic, right?

62
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,040
 And everything just, you know, stopped right now, right,

63
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,040
 in terms of tourism.

64
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,080
 But I'm trying to, you know,

65
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,800
 put together a New Testament tour,

66
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,760
 not going to Israel,

67
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,640
 because I don't know when I can go to Israel,

68
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,480
 or we can go to Israel,

69
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,680
 but hopefully the conflict will die down a little bit,

70
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,080
 and the land will have peace.

71
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,880
 But I'm trying to put together a New Testament tour,

72
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,800
 and that is going to Turkey and Greece, all right?

73
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,440
 Follow the footstep of Paul kind of tour.

74
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,760
 It'll be fun, two weeks.

75
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,400
 And by the way, if you're interested, let me know.

76
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,560
 I'm not sure, there's no guarantee I can put it together,

77
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,120
 but it also depends on what's going on over there

78
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,240
 and in the other part of the world.

79
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,720
 But anyways, if you go to Smyrna today,

80
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,600
 it's Izmir in Turkey.

81
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,480
 It's a thriving city.

82
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,680
 You see the cruise line cruising off

83
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,600
 from the harbor of modern day Smyrna.

84
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,800
 And if you visit the site,

85
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,800
 you find everything you can find in Chicago, right?

86
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,880
 You know, Supermall and all that stuff,

87
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,440
 everything is modernized.

88
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,920
 But, you know, that's the fun thing

89
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,040
 about going to biblical sites.

90
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,920
 You know, you always have the mix

91
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,840
 of ancient and modern, right?

92
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,080
 You can go to the mall and there's Starbucks there,

93
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,880
 you know, get a cup of cappuccino or something like that.

94
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,160
 And you don't feel like you're going somewhere else, right?

95
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,520
 You're still in the, kind of in the West, right?

96
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,520
 Kind of in America.

97
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,440
 But, you know, walking down the street,

98
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,720
 you find the ancient site

99
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,240
 where the archeologists has uncovered.

100
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,600
 And they uncovered the first century Smyrna, right?

101
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,600
 It was an ancient city with a good harbor, just like today.

102
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,760
 Back then it was a good harbor,

103
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,400
 just like Ephesus had a good harbor back then.

104
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,040
 A big marketplace, right?

105
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,440
 A big marketplace, you see down there, all the columns.

106
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,840
 Big marketplace, a forum and a theater,

107
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:07,480
 Roman stadium, temples and library,

108
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,280
 and all the public buildings.

109
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:15,080
 You see the mountain there is called Mount Pagus,

110
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,520
 Mount Pagus.

111
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,280
 And it's a city of great building.

112
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,920
 And from the ancient texts,

113
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,600
 we know that people are praising the city, Smyrna,

114
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,600
 as a beautiful city.

115
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,440
 And it's like a city surrounding that mountain,

116
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,120
 surrounding that hill, just like a crown, you know?

117
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,280
 All the city and all the ancient, you know,

118
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,280
 residents and cities and development at the foothill

119
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,640
 and surrounding that hill.

120
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,880
 And on top of that hill, Aquapolis, there's a temple.

121
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,560
 And that is the background of the letter

122
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,600
 to the Christians in Smyrna.

123
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,440
 Now, again, this is one of the seven letters.

124
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,360
 And there were seven letters there.

125
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,400
 If you read them through,

126
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,480
 you find that only two letters have no criticism

127
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,800
 of the churches.

128
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,400
 There are only two out of the seven, right?

129
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:14,880
 If you take it as a whole, you know, we fail, right?

130
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,880
 Only two out of these seven churches have no criticism

131
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,960
 from Christ the letter writer himself.

132
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,440
 So Christ will get the seven churches.

133
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,440
 There are only two churches that have praises only,

134
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,000
 commendations only, no criticism.

135
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,440
 And one of them is Smyrna.

136
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,360
 The other one is Philadelphia.

137
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,360
 So this letter goes,

138
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,280
 "To the angel of the church in Smyrna write,

139
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,120
 "these are the words of him," Jesus himself,

140
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,000
 "who is the first and the last

141
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,640
 "and who died and came to life again."

142
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,320
 First and last, right?

143
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,840
 That kind of echoes the familiar phrase in the Bible,

144
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,640
 Alpha and Omega.

145
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,040
 Remember that one?

146
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:03,120
 Alpha and Omega, there are 24 letters in Greek.

147
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,800
 And the first letter being Alpha,

148
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,320
 the last letter, the 24th letter is Omega.

149
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,960
 So first and last, Alpha and Omega,

150
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:16,360
 that means that kind of title for Jesus,

151
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,000
 meaning he has everything under control.

152
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,680
 He knows everything, right?

153
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,400
 He's the first and last in your life.

154
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,160
 He's the Alpha Omega of your life, right?

155
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,360
 Where did you come from?

156
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,920
 Where did you born?

157
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,760
 Where were you born?

158
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,440
 And what have gone through in your life journey?

159
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,040
 From day one of your existence up to now

160
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,720
 and until future someday, you know,

161
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,800
 you will end your life journey, Alpha and Omega.

162
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,360
 That is our Lord Jesus Christ.

163
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,200
 And he says, "I know everything about you."

164
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,800
 Every single letter and every single detail,

165
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,320
 every single day and hour you have been through

166
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,640
 and you will go through,

167
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,960
 God's saying he is the Alpha and Omega.

168
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,560
 He's the first and the last.

169
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,480
 And he knows everything about you

170
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,240
 and he has everything under his control.

171
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,880
 And so as to the questions in Smyrna

172
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:19,160
 and that kind of a comprehensive title.

173
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:23,920
 And also he said, "He died and came to life," right?

174
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,080
 "He has conquered death

175
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,880
 "and death should have no authority over you."

176
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,960
 Yes, death and evil have some effect on you.

177
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,160
 It can influence you.

178
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,560
 It can overpower you,

179
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,000
 but it has no ultimate authority in your life

180
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 because God in Christ Jesus has conquered the final enemy,

181
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,640
 which is death.

182
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,480
 So this dual introduction of Christ himself

183
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:56,480
 offers some hope and encouragement to all of us, right?

184
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,280
 Especially the small churches,

185
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,800
 small house churches in Smyrna.

186
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,840
 Jesus knows everything

187
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,600
 and he has conquered the final enemy.

188
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,320
 And it has to do with what they're experiencing at that time.

189
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,920
 And I'm sure if we read this short letter,

190
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,600
 you'll find some echoes,

191
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,400
 you'll find some resonance.

192
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,320
 You know, it's kind of like me, you know?

193
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,360
 It's kind of like me.

194
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,080
 Verse nine, the letter goes on.

195
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:27,480
 "I know your afflictions and your poverty,

196
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,280
 "and yet you are rich.

197
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:34,800
 "I know the slander of those who say they are Jews,

198
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,480
 "but they are not, but they are a synagogue of Satan."

199
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,520
 Now, from this verse,

200
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:47,400
 do you think the church in Smyrna is rich or poor?

201
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,920
 Was it a mega church?

202
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,000
 Was it a medium-sized church?

203
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,280
 It's a very small church, right?

204
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,120
 They don't have a lot of resources.

205
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,360
 They are poor, right?

206
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,880
 In profiting, right?

207
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,160
 Actually, in first century,

208
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:09,160
 the early Christians, most of them were poor people, right?

209
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:13,040
 They lack of any resources

210
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,080
 and means to thrive, right?

211
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,880
 They have to depend on God.

212
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,400
 So this church is not rich.

213
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,040
 They are, in fact, very poor.

214
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,400
 And the church is going through some very tough time, right?

215
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,960
 It's a very tough time.

216
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,920
 And John, the letter writer, says

217
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,760
 they are going through some tough times

218
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,360
 because of the Jews,

219
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,200
 Jewish slander, right?

220
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,000
 So what happened there, right?

221
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,600
 Now, when we read the Bible,

222
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,480
 we have to read the Bible in its own context, right?

223
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,380
 In the ancient context,

224
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,160
 the term, the Jews, or Jewish people,

225
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,960
 so often not an anti-Semitic statement, right?

226
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,640
 So John is saying Jews or Jewish are slandering

227
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,640
 against the churches, against the church in Smyrna.

228
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,920
 It's not an anti-Semitic statement

229
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,520
 because the early Christians, ethnicity-wise,

230
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,000
 they were Jewish Christians, right?

231
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,880
 They were themselves Jews, right?

232
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,000
 How could they be anti-Semitic, right?

233
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,560
 But in the entire New Testament,

234
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,560
 when it mentions the Jews,

235
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,760
 and they are doing something to persecute the early church,

236
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,400
 the Jews represent the unconverted Jewish people,

237
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:34,100
 especially the authorities, the leaders of the synagogue.

238
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,760
 They would turn Christians

239
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,960
 to the Roman authorities for persecution.

240
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,280
 Remember, Jesus was turned in

241
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,960
 by the Jewish leaders in Jerusalem, right?

242
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:51,200
 The early Christians, as told in the book of Acts,

243
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,540
 were persecuted by the Jewish people, right?

244
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,760
 The Jewish authorities in Jerusalem.

245
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,140
 And they collaborate with the Romans

246
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:04,140
 and try to stumble down the church,

247
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,540
 try to stop the church from spreading out, right?

248
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,640
 So the early church had that experience,

249
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,520
 and until the day of John,

250
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,400
 until the day of the book of Revelation,

251
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,880
 they were still under the pressure

252
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,960
 from the Jewish authorities of the city.

253
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,320
 So we can imagine in the city of Smyrna,

254
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,880
 there were some Jewish leaders,

255
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,840
 and they don't believe Jesus as Christ, as the Messiah,

256
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,280
 and they bad-mouthed them, and they slandered the Christians,

257
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,760
 and sometimes they turned the leaders,

258
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,440
 the church leaders, to the Roman authorities

259
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:39,400
 and trying to persecute the church.

260
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,640
 So this small church is going through

261
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,360
 some very, very tough experience.

262
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,440
 But Jesus says in this letter,

263
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,880
 he says, "Do not be afraid of what you're about to suffer."

264
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,640
 Jesus is not saying, "I'm gonna scoop you out,

265
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:59,000
 "and I'm gonna save you from suffering."

266
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,120
 Jesus said, "Do not be afraid what you're about to suffer.

267
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,460
 "I tell you, the devil will put some of you in prison

268
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:09,080
 "to test you, and you will suffer persecution

269
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,520
 "for 10 days.

270
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,160
 "But be faithful, even to the point of death,

271
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,760
 "and I'll give you the crown of life."

272
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,640
 You know, the main job description of Satan

273
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,120
 is one thing, right?

274
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,640
 One thing.

275
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,040
 If you check Satan's resume,

276
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,720
 there's only one thing, only one bullet point.

277
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,020
 It's to make God's people suffer, right?

278
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,840
 That's his job, right?

279
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,040
 24/7.

280
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,680
 That's what Satan has been thinking about, right?

281
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,880
 That's what Satan is thinking about you.

282
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,040
 That's what Satan is thinking about our church.

283
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,440
 It's to persecute them, to stop them,

284
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,140
 and to close them down.

285
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:53,600
 That is the resume of Satan, right?

286
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,760
 It's a pretty easy job, right?

287
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,160
 24/7, the devil is trying to just destroy your faith,

288
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,040
 just to lead you astray,

289
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,440
 from believing to unbelieving,

290
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:11,200
 from unbelieving to unbelieving remains unbelief.

291
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,640
 And that is Satan's job description, only job description.

292
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,200
 And this letter is trying to encourage

293
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,520
 the small church in Smyrna to withstand the pressure,

294
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,200
 to withstand suffering.

295
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,440
 And it says there's a short period of time of testing.

296
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,080
 10 days, right?

297
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,240
 10 days.

298
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,680
 You know, if you search all the pages of the Bible,

299
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,760
 from Old Testament to New Testament,

300
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,800
 there's one place talking about persecution,

301
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,520
 talking about testing of faith,

302
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,200
 and it mentioned 10 days.

303
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,600
 There's only one passage, and that's Daniel chapter one.

304
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,560
 Remember that story?

305
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,080
 Daniel was being captured,

306
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,340
 and he was exiled in the Babylonian court,

307
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:58,120
 and he was forced to be assimilated

308
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,180
 to the Babylonian culture.

309
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,400
 And Daniel and his three friends were saying,

310
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,840
 "Hey, you know, give us 10 days.

311
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:09,840
 "I'm not gonna partake in the royal feast.

312
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,840
 "You know, you have to test us for 10 days, right?

313
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,000
 "And you will know after 10 days,

314
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 "we will do well and even better than all the other pagans."

315
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,600
 And as a result, you know, the consequence was that

316
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,400
 Daniel, trusting God, and after 10 days,

317
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,760
 you know, the court sees Daniel and his three friends,

318
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,320
 they're actually more healthy, right?

319
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,200
 They are better than other people.

320
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,480
 Now, of course, that passage is not

321
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:46,320
 a modern copycat dietary law, right?

322
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:52,280
 It's not for us to copy the same thing that they did.

323
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,840
 But it shows us, you know, God is trustworthy, right?

324
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,160
 It shows us God is trustworthy,

325
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,160
 and Daniel and his friends were vindicated.

326
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,720
 They're proven to be innocent, proven to be holy,

327
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,840
 and set apart by God himself.

328
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:09,240
 So they finally experienced vindication.

329
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,400
 And that's what Jesus is saying to the church in Smyrna.

330
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,520
 Yes, there's persecution.

331
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:17,120
 There will be 10 days of testing,

332
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,400
 but God will vindicate you.

333
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,160
 God will protect you.

334
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,160
 And at the end, you will win

335
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,440
 because you are standing on the side of God.

336
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,760
 You're standing on God's side.

337
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,600
 Persecution.

338
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:33,520
 You know, by the way, persecution is still a reality today.

339
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,200
 Still a reality today.

340
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,280
 Of course, we're sitting here.

341
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,480
 We can come in, lazy.

342
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,160
 You know, we can be lazy.

343
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:45,160
 In America, there's not so much about persecution, right?

344
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,800
 I mean, nobody go out of the church or come in the church

345
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,560
 and fearful of the neighbors killing him, right?

346
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:55,080
 Or slandering you, right?

347
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,520
 There may be some pressure.

348
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,640
 There may be some temptation.

349
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,840
 And that is by and large our experience

350
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,000
 in America as Christians.

351
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,720
 However, persecution is still very much going on today

352
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,680
 in other parts of the world,

353
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:15,680
 especially those countries or areas

354
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,560
 that has no access to the gospel

355
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,520
 or the authority or the government

356
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,000
 is against the Christian faith.

357
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,480
 Like many places in China, right?

358
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,880
 It's very much going on, persecution.

359
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,520
 Many places in Muslim countries,

360
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,800
 persecution is a real thing.

361
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,240
 And let me read you some numbers, some statistics,

362
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,640
 so that we know what Jesus is talking about here

363
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,280
 is not just 2,000 years ago.

364
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,600
 It's very much a reality today.

365
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,200
 So some numbers here.

366
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,880
 There were, according to open doors

367
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,680
 and Gordon Cornwell resource,

368
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:58,520
 almost 400 Christians are killed, persecuted,

369
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,480
 for their faith every month.

370
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,080
 If you figure out numbers, try to calculate the number,

371
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:09,160
 there were 13 Christians who died for their faith every day.

372
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:14,000
 Even now on average, 13 Christians every day.

373
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,640
 And then 214 churches and Christian properties

374
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,840
 are destroyed every month around the world,

375
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,080
 according to open doors,

376
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,000
 especially in places hostile to the gospel.

377
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,120
 200 some churches are being destroyed, you know,

378
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,960
 intentionally because they hate Christ, right?

379
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:40,120
 And these churches suffer damages.

380
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,760
 Now, the last number, listen up.

381
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:47,760
 40 to 80 million Christians have been martyred

382
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,120
 in the course of 2,000 years church history.

383
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:56,200
 40 to 80 million Christians have been martyred.

384
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,880
 They die for their faith, being persecuted

385
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,960
 in the course of church history.

386
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,840
 Church history has 2,000 years old, right?

387
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:10,800
 And over half of them were martyred in the 20th century.

388
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:15,720
 The last century, the last century.

389
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,080
 Half of them, that means at least 20 million Christians

390
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:25,080
 were persecuted and martyred in 20th century,

391
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,440
 in the last century.

392
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,160
 So it's very much a reality, right, today.

393
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,000
 Even though we don't see it, you know,

394
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,840
 kind of we don't see it in our sight, our mind,

395
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,920
 but it's a reality.

396
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:42,120
 So what the church in Samaria is going through

397
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,280
 is actually what many Christians in other parts of the world

398
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,560
 are going through today.

399
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,960
 And Satan will continue to persecute Christians.

400
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,040
 Satan will not get tired, okay?

401
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,120
 You go to sleep at 10 o'clock.

402
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,200
 You go to sleep at 11 p.m., right?

403
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,320
 And then you wake up 8 o'clock, 9 o'clock, 10 o'clock, right?

404
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,560
 You have to rest, right?

405
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:04,080
 But Satan, Satan does not need rest, right?

406
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,960
 Right?

407
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:10,840
 And you know, in Jesus' encounters with Satan,

408
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:15,240
 with the devil, actually the devil studied the Bible.

409
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,280
 Remember the temptations Jesus had

410
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,120
 in the 40 day of wilderness?

411
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,760
 Satan actually quote from one of the Psalms, right?

412
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,520
 Psalm 91, right?

413
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,000
 Do you know what Psalm 91 is?

414
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,480
 We don't know because we don't study.

415
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:35,760
 Satan's more diligent, knowing the word of God,

416
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,040
 but for the purpose of tempting,

417
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:43,480
 for the purpose of persecuting Christians.

418
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,720
 So if they misinterpret, they can be led astray, right?

419
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,720
 So Satan will continue to persecute Christians

420
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,300
 with suffering, and by and large for us, it's temptation.

421
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:55,780
 Right?

422
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:59,460
 There are tons of temptations in our lives, in your life.

423
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,300
 Right?

424
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,540
 How long you been a Christian?

425
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:05,540
 Probably from some months and probably some many years,

426
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,820
 right?

427
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:09,300
 And if you check your experience,

428
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,780
 there are many, many temptations.

429
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,420
 There are many, many temptations

430
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:17,340
 that could have destroyed your faith, right?

431
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,180
 Criticism.

432
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:21,580
 Some people will criticize you, right?

433
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,860
 Probably unbelieving parents

434
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,460
 or unbelieving family members will criticize you

435
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:28,260
 for believing Jesus, right?

436
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:32,140
 And then you experience discouragements, right?

437
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:36,120
 From time to time, you feel discouraged, right?

438
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:40,920
 Now, I've been serving in church for 25 years, right?

439
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:45,820
 And I tell you, many, many experiences of discouragement.

440
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:51,700
 Either people give me the discouragement

441
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:56,620
 or I myself perpetuate that kind of discouragement, right?

442
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:59,540
 Don't you feel that way sometimes, right?

443
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,860
 You feel discouraged, right?

444
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:05,260
 Your friends left the faith, right?

445
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:08,160
 Your friends criticize you or friends, you know,

446
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,740
 go cold shoulder on you, you know, in terms of faith.

447
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,860
 And there are discouragement, there was criticism,

448
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:18,860
 there was negative experience that we all share.

449
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,980
 And that is part of the real temptations.

450
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,600
 And Satan's using those occasions,

451
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,800
 using those temptations to lead you astray, you know,

452
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,160
 to beat you down so that you will not be able

453
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,320
 to follow Christ, right?

454
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,860
 You will not be able to serve Christ, you know,

455
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:41,760
 to magnify your shortcomings, right?

456
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,960
 Magnify your guilt, magnify your weaknesses

457
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,960
 so that you feel like you don't deserve

458
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,300
 to be called a disciple of Christ, right?

459
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:55,980
 And that is trying to lead you astray from grace, right?

460
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:00,980
 Because we can always fall back on grace, right?

461
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:05,700
 Our faith started with grace and ended with sheer grace.

462
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,300
 It's not about our work, but Satan can use those occasions

463
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:13,040
 to destroy your faith, to slow down your Christian growth.

464
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:17,800
 I think this letter is a very relevant letter.

465
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,320
 Because it reminds us as Christians, you know,

466
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,360
 we will go through some suffering, right?

467
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,840
 You know what is the most often used image

468
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,920
 to describe Christian walk?

469
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:36,920
 What's the most often used, frequently used image

470
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,400
 in the New Testament to describe Christian life?

471
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,760
 What is it?

472
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,360
 Let me tell you.

473
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,180
 Battle.

474
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:46,360
 It's a warfare, right?

475
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,620
 It's a spiritual battle.

476
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:50,800
 That's one image, right?

477
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:54,560
 Farming is another image, right?

478
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,520
 Have you ever been a farmer?

479
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,460
 It's tough work, right?

480
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:06,480
 Running, you know, running.

481
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,820
 Track and field, you know, it's a competition.

482
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:14,840
 No, these images call for discipline,

483
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,120
 call for willingness to suffer, right?

484
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,920
 Willingness to withstand pressure.

485
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,600
 And that is the call of Christians.

486
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,960
 When Jesus called you to follow him,

487
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:32,180
 what he really meant was what he meant

488
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,440
 when he called the first disciples.

489
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:39,440
 He said to Peter, Andrew, John, and those guys,

490
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,020
 Jesus said, "Follow me."

491
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:48,020
 Jesus actually meant just follow me,

492
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:51,220
 just walking after me, right?

493
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:54,960
 You know, walking from town to town, from city to city,

494
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,760
 and you have no place to stay.

495
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,080
 There was no Airbnb for you.

496
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,160
 There's no hotel for you, right?

497
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:05,320
 You gotta, you know, withstand the pressure, right?

498
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,080
 To have the discipline to follow him literally.

499
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,120
 And Jesus is calling you today to do the same thing, right?

500
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,060
 It's a battle.

501
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:17,640
 It's a spiritual warfare, and we need to get ready for that.

502
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,120
 And I'll tell you how to get ready for that, all right?

503
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:21,960
 From this level.

504
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,980
 And, but I wanna give you an illustration.

505
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:29,160
 You know, not too long ago, someone introduced me

506
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:33,540
 the term strawberry generation.

507
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:36,200
 Strawberry generation.

508
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,800
 Have you ever heard of that?

509
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:42,800
 It's actually a term coined by an Indonesian sociologist.

510
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:48,320
 You know, it's a professor in Indonesia.

511
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,400
 And that professor actually wrote a book on this topic,

512
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,720
 and the title of the book is "Strawberry Generation."

513
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,860
 And it's a very popular term now,

514
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:02,200
 or used to be a very popular term in Taiwan.

515
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:08,720
 Now, this term, this label, strawberry generation,

516
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,840
 describes people born after 1990.

517
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,360
 Anyone here?

518
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,200
 1990.

519
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,640
 I'm sure you're not, okay?

520
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,500
 I'm sure you're not.

521
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:21,480
 But let me tell you what strawberry generation is.

522
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,120
 Now, strawberry generation means,

523
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,960
 you know, this image means, you know,

524
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,480
 those people who are born after '90s,

525
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,360
 strawberries look nice and colorful, right?

526
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,040
 And you know, you see creativity,

527
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,960
 you see freshness, right?

528
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:41,240
 And these are the people, so-called Gen Z, right?

529
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,400
 Strawberry generation.

530
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,560
 Look very nice and colorful,

531
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:49,480
 but strawberries bruise easily, right?

532
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,680
 You press it, and then you bruise it.

533
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:56,660
 And the term actually describes a new generation

534
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,680
 that cannot withstand social pressure,

535
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,280
 not willing to work hard,

536
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:05,320
 or less resistant to challenges in life.

537
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:10,320
 Perhaps, you know, sociologists will say,

538
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,120
 perhaps, you know, this generation

539
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:19,400
 grew up in an overly protective environment, right?

540
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,160
 Probably fostered by parents, right?

541
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:25,960
 You heard of helicopter parents, right?

542
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:30,160
 I was kind of one of them, right?

543
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:33,960
 When my girl was trying to learn to walk, right?

544
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,800
 And she stumbled, right?

545
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,800
 I was like, "Oh my God."

546
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,640
 Right?

547
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,720
 "Oh my God, I don't want to get hurt," right?

548
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:46,000
 And, you know, having too much too soon,

549
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,460
 growing up in a very comfortable environment,

550
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,640
 just like greenhouse, right?

551
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,760
 Strawberries are grown in protected environment, right?

552
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,960
 Protected greenhouse.

553
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,040
 Spoiled, right?

554
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,680
 And the sociologists are suggesting

555
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:03,920
 we have a whole new generation who are like strawberries,

556
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,760
 right?

557
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:11,600
 So I wonder, are there strawberry Christians?

558
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:16,200
 Are there a generation of strawberry Christians?

559
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,480
 You know, we look nice, you know?

560
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,840
 We look kind of creative, right?

561
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,760
 We have many ideas, and we are fresh.

562
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,240
 But, you know, are we like strawberry

563
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,440
 when we are being pushed or pressured,

564
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:35,040
 and we get bruised too easily, right?

565
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:41,560
 This letter reminds us what it means to be Christian.

566
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:48,640
 The church in Smyrna, they set up a great example.

567
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,080
 They were always under the pressure.

568
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,120
 They were always under the attack of Satan, right?

569
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,840
 But Christ encourages them.

570
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:01,160
 To withstand suffering, right?

571
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:04,880
 So your question is, how to handle suffering?

572
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,000
 How should we do it, right?

573
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,640
 How should we handle pressure?

574
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:12,040
 Especially pressure related to our faith, right?

575
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:15,440
 Let me give you some pointers.

576
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:20,400
 First, you need to understand, as this letter tells us,

577
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,600
 understand suffering is a test.

578
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,760
 It's a test of your character.

579
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,240
 It's a test of your faith, right?

580
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,600
 Now, remember, when you go through a test,

581
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,520
 of course, it's painful.

582
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,560
 It's not comfortable.

583
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:38,840
 But remember, only people who are of worth

584
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,400
 deserve testing, right?

585
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,040
 Only you are equipped.

586
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,200
 You have been growing up.

587
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:51,840
 That's why God allows testing in your life.

588
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:56,080
 Because God sees you as someone of worth.

589
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:00,960
 Wanna test you, wanna grow you, even better, right?

590
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,440
 That's one pointer.

591
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:09,160
 The second one is to understand what faith really is.

592
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,680
 Question of faith, following Jesus.

593
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,160
 What does it mean, right?

594
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,440
 So often we misunderstood.

595
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,440
 We think believing Jesus is simply

596
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,400
 just get a ticket to heaven, right?

597
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,080
 Get a passport to heaven.

598
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,360
 Get a ticket to heaven so I can wait in the gate, right?

599
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,200
 I can be passive, I don't have to do anything.

600
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,760
 And I just wait, someday I'll fly to heaven

601
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,520
 or something like that.

602
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,560
 No, that is not biblical faith.

603
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:39,760
 God does not save us from suffering.

604
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:44,520
 But God will save us through suffering.

605
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,440
 You see the difference?

606
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,800
 You see the difference?

607
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,520
 God does not necessarily save us from suffering.

608
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,640
 Of course we wanna pray that God will save us from suffering.

609
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,280
 We don't have to suffer.

610
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,560
 But so often God does not do that.

611
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,600
 But God, in his grace, in his faithfulness,

612
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:06,360
 God is telling you he will save you through suffering, right?

613
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:09,800
 So that you can withstand suffering.

614
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,560
 In his grace, you can depend on him.

615
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:16,280
 Depend on his grace and his strength.

616
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:19,240
 The second part, understand what faith is all about.

617
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,120
 The third point I wanna suggest to you

618
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:25,680
 is to learn spiritual disciplines.

619
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:30,040
 Learn spiritual disciplines, right?

620
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,360
 Reading the Bible, right?

621
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:36,240
 Reading the Bible, praying every day, you know?

622
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,080
 To have the discipline to go to worship, right?

623
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,560
 To do something, what does it mean, spiritual discipline?

624
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,400
 To do something that is against our

625
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,720
 most comfortable desire, right?

626
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:54,120
 If we seek for comfort, of course we will not read the Bible.

627
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,520
 We will not seek God, right?

628
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,480
 We will seek sin.

629
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,280
 We will seek our own self.

630
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,000
 We will listen to our own self.

631
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 But spiritual discipline, we're against our own nature

632
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,880
 and build on the new nature, right?

633
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,960
 The more you practice spiritual disciplines,

634
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,720
 you know, regular prayer, regular Bible study,

635
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,040
 regular getting together with other people,

636
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,600
 other people of God, other Christians,

637
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,360
 to get encouragement and pray for other people,

638
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,920
 these kind of spiritual disciplines will build up your life

639
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:30,080
 and will help you withstand pressures.

640
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,800
 Point number three.

641
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:36,520
 Number four, learn from great examples.

642
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:41,680
 People who have finished their course of faith,

643
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:45,520
 you know, beautifully and finish it well.

644
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,480
 Learn from them, right?

645
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,600
 Last week we had a memorial service

646
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,640
 and we said goodbye or see you later

647
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,320
 to one of the brothers,

648
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,400
 one of the actual retired pastor in our midst.

649
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:05,400
 And he passed away when he was 96 years old, 96 years old.

650
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:10,240
 And he has been serving God for decades

651
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,400
 and he has been faithful.

652
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:18,760
 You know, by telling stories of his past experience,

653
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,920
 he has suffered quite a bit.

654
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:24,800
 He had different challenges in his life,

655
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,200
 serving God, following Jesus, right?

656
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,800
 But he finished it well, you know.

657
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,800
 We praise God for his life, right?

658
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,400
 And we can learn from him.

659
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,000
 We can learn from great examples of faith, right?

660
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,040
 And there are many great examples around us.

661
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,800
 And there are many great examples in the Bible.

662
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,920
 We can learn from them.

663
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,400
 That's point number four.

664
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:48,360
 Number five, focus on eternal reward.

665
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,280
 Someday we will be rewarded.

666
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:53,880
 And God is saying to the church in Myrna

667
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,080
 and to our church, to you,

668
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,320
 he who has an ear,

669
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,920
 let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.

670
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:03,400
 He who overcomes, he who endures,

671
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,560
 will not be hurt at all.

672
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,080
 By the second death.

673
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,480
 By the second death.

674
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,880
 And he will have the crown of life, right?

675
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,960
 The crown of life.

676
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:21,200
 That is the desire for Christ when he sees you.

677
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:26,440
 Ask questions, ask follow of Jesus Christ.

678
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,760
 Look forward to the eternal reward.

679
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,960
 The crown of life and then will not be hurt by second death.

680
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,800
 What is that?

681
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,600
 First death is the physical death, right?

682
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:39,160
 The separation of the physical body and our soul or spirit.

683
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,120
 The second death is the final judgment.

684
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:44,800
 That is unfold in the book of Revelation,

685
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,320
 the later chapters.

686
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,240
 That is the second death.

687
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,960
 But Jesus has conquered death.

688
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,240
 And second death, final judgment,

689
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:56,080
 has no power over you, has no authority over you.

690
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:01,320
 So you can withstand because you have this hope

691
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,360
 in the future.

692
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:05,480
 And that hope is secured by Jesus Christ.

693
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,080
 Let me tell you this, there's a saying that says,

694
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:13,520
 tough times don't last, but tough people do.

695
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,240
 Right, heard of that?

696
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:18,360
 Tough times don't last, but tough people do.

697
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,720
 But I would say of this passage,

698
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:25,680
 tough times don't last, but God's people do.

699
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:32,000
 God's people last forever, eternally.

700
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,160
 Because we are secure in Christ.

701
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,320
 Yes, we can go through some tough times,

702
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,080
 but they don't last because we have this eternal hope.

703
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,200
 Right?

704
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,920
 Let me remind you and let me encourage you today.

705
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,600
 Let me pray and we come before God and say,

706
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,400
 God, we need your strength, we need your grace,

707
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:53,120
 and we know that you are a rock and we can depend upon you.

708
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,400
 We can draw strength from you.

709
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,440
 We can gain strength from you.

710
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:59,320
 We can go on and follow Jesus, right?

711
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,360
 Let's pray.

712
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,840
 Father, we just come before you.

713
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:07,280
 We know that we are weak and we are easily defeated.

714
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:13,640
 Whenever we focus on our old self, our own brokenness,

715
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:16,800
 our own shortcomings, our own weaknesses,

716
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:22,760
 yes, we will be broken and we'll fall into temptation

717
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:29,040
 because Satan will not get tired of tempting us

718
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,120
 and damaging our faith.

719
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:35,680
 But we know that you are our rock.

720
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:40,680
 You are the God who we can trust, the God who is our rock.

721
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:44,480
 And I just pray that with all the pressures that we have

722
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,680
 when we follow you, with all the challenges

723
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:50,640
 that we have to go through, that our faith will be tested.

724
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:55,040
 Our faith will be polished and our character,

725
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:59,640
 our life, our Christian life will be just like a lampstand

726
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:04,440
 to witness to your faithfulness.

727
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:09,280
 And I pray that for your church, you will protect us

728
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,960
 and you will bring us through suffering.

729
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:16,560
 And we will know that you are always trustworthy.

730
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,160
 Thank you for being our faithful and loving God.

731
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:22,200
 Thank you for loving us so much unconditionally.

732
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:28,000
 And may your love and your grace continue to carry us through

733
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,760
 so that we give you glory in Christ and pray.

734
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:36,360
 Well, please stay for a time of fellowship

735
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,920
 and then we'll start our Bible study, right?

736
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,440
 Okay, all right?

737
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,280
 No Satan is going to do Bible study,

738
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:46,320
 but we will do Bible study, all right?

739
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,160
 All right, God bless you.

740
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:50,200
 And stay in the cafe and we'll call you

741
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,840
 when it's time for our fellowship, all right?

742
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,680
 God bless.

743
00:37:53,680 --> 00:38:03,680
