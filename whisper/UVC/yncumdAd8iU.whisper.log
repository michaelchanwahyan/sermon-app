[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   Thank you.
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.080]   Well, it's great to be here today.
[00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.480]   I'm very excited to be here.
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.640]   And love being at UV.
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.920]   It's been a little bit since I've been here in person, but it's great to see you all and
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:16.920]   to see family.
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:17.920]   It's good.
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.760]   Spent a lot of time with a lot of you that are here, and it's great just to be around
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:30.400]   family again and appreciate you being here today and enjoy the worship with you all and
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.400]   just excited to be here.
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:38.960]   We're going to be looking in Luke chapter 10 today at this story of Mary and Martha.
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.840]   We're going to talk about choosing what is better.
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.800]   I'm going to pray real quickly as we begin, and then we'll start to look at this passage.
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.740]   God, thank you so much for the opportunity to be here today.
[00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:50.880]   Thank you for your word.
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.140]   God, thank you for how it changes us, how it forms us and shapes us.
[00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.380]   And I pray that would take place today, that as we consider your word together, as we read
[00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:07.300]   it, as we talk about it, that it would change who we are, that when we leave, we would be
[00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:13.340]   different than when we came in and that ultimately we'd be closer to you, God, in Jesus name.
[00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.340]   Amen.
[00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.960]   So this passage, just a few verses we're going to look at in verses 38 to 42 of Luke chapter
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.720]   10, a familiar story, but I think a lot of powerful truth for us in our lives about what
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.000]   we choose to do with our time and our resources that God has given us.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.240]   So let's read this together.
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:41.080]   Luke 10, 38 to 42, it says this, "As Jesus and his disciples were on their way, he came
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.880]   to a village where a woman named Martha opened her home to him.
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:53.560]   She had a sister called Mary who sat at the Lord's feet listening to what he said, but
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.140]   Martha was distracted by all the preparations that had to be made.
[00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.380]   She came to him and asked, 'Lord, don't you care that my sister has left me to do the
[00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.200]   work by myself?
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.200]   Tell her to help me.'
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.880]   Martha, Martha, the Lord answered, 'You're worried and upset about many things, but few
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.480]   things are needed or indeed only one.
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:23.560]   Mary has chosen what is better and it will not be taken away from her.'"
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.300]   And that's what we're going to consider today, choosing what is better.
[00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.520]   This is a really powerful command that Jesus lays on us in this passage, but it's a little
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.240]   bit perplexing to us too, and we're drawn to the power of what Jesus is saying here.
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.240]   We want this.
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.280]   We want to choose what is better, yet sometimes we're confused about how to do so.
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.920]   What does it mean to choose better?
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.160]   What does better even mean?
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.120]   And I think that question is even more significant for us in the modern world because we live
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:03:00.620]   in a world that there are so many choices and we live in a society where there's a lot
[00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.640]   of affluence and there's so many options in every place that we look in life.
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.280]   And whatever we're trying to choose in that moment, there are just kind of a myriad of
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.680]   choices for us to choose from.
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.320]   If you think about something like when you get a new car.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.520]   Now I've never bought a new car.
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.120]   I've only bought used cars, so there's less choices when you buy used.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.540]   But sometimes when I'm dreaming or I don't have anything else to do, I have gotten online
[00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:39.060]   and looked at, you look at Tesla or whatever and you go through, build your own and customize
[00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.520]   and all that.
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.660]   And if you've ever done that or whatever your favorite car is, if you ever looked at a Ford
[00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:51.860]   Bronco online or a Corvette or whatever, there's so many choices that it takes forever just
[00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:58.660]   to get through all the choices because obviously you have to pick the car that you want, the
[00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.100]   body style, do you want an SUV, a van, a sedan or whatever?
[00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.980]   And then after that, you've got to pick the engine, the drive train, then you're going
[00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:13.940]   to pick the seats and the fabric and the color and what kind of radio you want and all the
[00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.740]   different technology options.
[00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:23.380]   It's just kind of endless amount of choices to choose something like that.
[00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:29.580]   And that is just kind of a silly illustration, but in every era of our life, we're faced
[00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.340]   with just kind of an overwhelming amount of choice.
[00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.180]   When it comes time to eat, there's so many things to choose from when we're going to
[00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.180]   eat, right?
[00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.620]   Are we going to go to a restaurant?
[00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.580]   Are we going to get takeout somewhere?
[00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.740]   And if we are going to go to a restaurant, which one are we going to choose?
[00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.780]   Because the whole city is full of great restaurants.
[00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.340]   If we're going to cook at home, what are we going to cook?
[00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.580]   There's so many different ingredients and recipes and options.
[00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.940]   There's all these different choices.
[00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.780]   There's ready-made meals, there's things at the grocery store, what are we going to do?
[00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.620]   When we think about how we're going to spend our time and entertainment and things like
[00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:08.460]   that, there's sporting events, you could go to the movies, you could go to the park, you
[00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.460]   could go to a concert.
[00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.060]   There's so many choices when you have a free night that you're going to go do something.
[00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:21.380]   Or even if you're just going to sit down and veg out on the couch and watch something on
[00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.100]   TV, there's limitless choices, right?
[00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:29.620]   If you have cable, you could channel surf for hours.
[00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.180]   I don't have cable, but we have some streaming and streaming is the same way, right?
[00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.460]   That's the hardest part of watching a movie or a show on streaming is actually getting
[00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.740]   started because there's so many things you're like, "Ah, maybe we should watch this.
[00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.460]   I want to check this out.
[00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.540]   I heard this was good."
[00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.560]   When I was a teenager, we had this thing.
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.380]   Some of you know what this is, but some of you, this is totally foreign to you.
[00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.720]   When I was a teenager, we had this thing called Video Store.
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:06.020]   It was a store with shelves like other stores, and on these shelves were a whole lot of DVDs.
[00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.020]   Some of you might know what a DVD is.
[00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:13.560]   It was just literally shelves and shelves of DVDs.
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.800]   My friends and I, when we were in high school, we would do the same thing that everybody
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:17.900]   does with streaming now.
[00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:23.620]   We'd go in there, spend like 45 minutes walking around the Video Store, picking up movies,
[00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.220]   being like, "Hey, do you want to watch this?"
[00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:26.620]   "No, I've already seen that."
[00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:30.340]   Or, "No, I heard my friend said it wasn't any good."
[00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:33.280]   It took so long just to choose.
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.420]   We still have that problem now.
[00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:40.140]   Like I said, we get on Netflix or Disney+ or whatever, streaming, and there's just so
[00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:41.140]   many choices.
[00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:47.980]   And so, what Jesus is saying here is actually really significant to us.
[00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:52.660]   And the reality is, there's so many choices in our lives that at some points, it almost
[00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.140]   becomes like an existential threat to us.
[00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:59.180]   We feel overwhelmed because we have so many choices to make.
[00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.940]   We feel like if we make the wrong choice, we're going to miss out or we're going to
[00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:04.500]   wreck our whole life.
[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.180]   I remember when I was trying to choose a college feeling that way.
[00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.380]   I was like, "There's so many colleges in the United States.
[00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:13.780]   How could I possibly know which one is going to be best for me?"
[00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:17.400]   And it almost seemed like, you know, if I don't make the right choice, the world might
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:18.740]   come to an end.
[00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.980]   And we feel that way with a lot of our choices.
[00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:27.460]   So what Jesus is saying here, that we need to choose what is better, is really a significant
[00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:29.900]   and powerful truth to us.
[00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:33.860]   But it's difficult for us to know what He means.
[00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:39.820]   So let's look at what's going on in this passage and begin to discover what Jesus is communicating
[00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:40.820]   to us.
[00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:45.540]   First of all, we see in this passage, there's this contrast between the two sisters.
[00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:49.540]   They each have a different response to Jesus in His presence.
[00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:53.380]   He shows up at their house and they respond differently.
[00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:58.380]   But the response, the contrast here is actually more than just their behavior.
[00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:06.660]   It's really a contrast in their attitudes and in the way that they're treating Jesus.
[00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:11.660]   Sometimes I think we could look at this and see it simply as a contrast between, well,
[00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:16.260]   it's a contrast between a contemplative life and a life of work.
[00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.620]   And it's not really that.
[00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:22.980]   It's not just a story about, "Don't be too busy and forget to spend time with people
[00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:23.980]   you love."
[00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:24.980]   It's not that.
[00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:27.880]   I mean, those things are important, but the story is more than that.
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:32.380]   It's really about the hard attitudes of Mary and Martha in this story.
[00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:38.140]   It's about the posture that they take as they respond to Jesus.
[00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:42.780]   And what's happening here, Jesus and His disciples are traveling and they come to this village
[00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:45.300]   where Mary and Martha live.
[00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:50.620]   And the passage tells us that Martha invites Jesus and the disciples into her home.
[00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:53.140]   Now that's good.
[00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:54.580]   That's a really beautiful thing.
[00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:59.240]   See, Jesus and His disciples, remember, they were itinerant ministers.
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.240]   They didn't have a bunch of money.
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:04.360]   They didn't have, Jesus didn't have a home of His own.
[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:09.240]   So Martha was being generous and extending hospitality, inviting them into her home.
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:14.400]   And we can assume from the context here, Martha's probably a pretty well-off woman.
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:18.800]   Since she has the space and the resources to welcome visitors into her home, she probably
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.880]   is fairly affluent.
[00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:25.400]   And her name in Aramaic actually means ruling lady.
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:31.280]   So she was probably a significant person, a person of influence.
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:34.600]   And she's probably most likely, we see this in the story as well, that she's probably
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:40.360]   the one who kind of makes the decisions in the home and makes sure things get done.
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:44.180]   She's doing something praiseworthy and good here by welcoming Jesus and His disciples.
[00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:46.640]   She's showing hospitality, generosity.
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:47.840]   Those are biblical values.
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:50.000]   That's really good stuff.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:56.640]   But the word, the Greek word in verse 40 that is used to describe what she's doing is the
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:00.560]   word diakonia, which is a word that we get the word deacon from.
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:03.960]   It's a word that gives this connotation of service or ministry.
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:07.320]   So the point that I'm making here is that Martha's actually doing something good.
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:11.280]   She's ministering, she's serving, she's doing something good.
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.240]   The problem is not with what she's doing.
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:17.280]   Because she's doing something that she should be doing.
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:20.760]   She's a respectable woman, she's ministering.
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:24.020]   But the problem is that she's missing the best thing.
[00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:27.720]   She's doing something good, but even in doing something good, she's missing the best thing.
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:31.160]   And that's the point that Jesus is making.
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:35.540]   She's missing the one thing that is truly important, or as Jesus says in this passage,
[00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:38.440]   that is truly needed.
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:41.880]   Now Mary, on the other hand, here's the contrast.
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:50.200]   Mary is sitting at the feet of Jesus, and she's taking the posture of a disciple, a
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.280]   learner, or a follower.
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:55.600]   She's responding to God's presence with faith.
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:58.680]   She has joyful anticipation.
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:01.880]   If you think about what it was like for her to sit there and listen to Jesus, I'm sure
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:07.880]   she's leaning in and desiring to hear every word that he's saying.
[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:11.760]   And she responds with a personal affection.
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.800]   It's very close.
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:16.680]   And there's trust involved, there's love.
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:22.800]   She's able to forget about the other tasks and pressures that she has in life, and just
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:26.480]   focus on being present with Jesus.
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:33.000]   She's valuing, this is big for us in 21st century America, she's valuing presence over
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   productivity.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.360]   That's what she's doing in this moment.
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:41.120]   And she's valuing a relationship over simply good works.
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:44.600]   Ultimately, she's valuing Jesus.
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.400]   And her response is very different.
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:52.760]   And this is the response that we need in our lives, that Jesus is pointing out in this
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:55.560]   passage and calling us to.
[00:11:55.560 --> 00:12:00.560]   Like Martha, we have a lot of good stuff in our lives, but sometimes we miss out on what
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:05.520]   is best because there's so much good.
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:12.680]   And Jesus is calling us to discover the ways that we, like Mary, can choose what is better.
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:18.080]   So there's three things I want us to consider in this that will help us to choose what is
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.080]   better in life.
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:24.240]   And the first is that we have to learn to choose identity in Christ that's grounded
[00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:25.240]   in God's grace.
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:30.280]   We have to choose identity in Christ that's grounded in God's grace.
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:35.320]   This is probably, I think, the most critical piece of choosing better.
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:39.560]   It's considering where we place our identity as human beings.
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:45.340]   If our identity is not in Christ but in anything else, our choices about our priorities and
[00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:52.040]   our time, our resources, even our happiness, will ultimately be driven by the source of
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:54.240]   our identity.
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:57.840]   And this passage, why is Martha so focused on all the stuff she has to do?
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:00.840]   As Jesus says, she's worried about so many things.
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:04.220]   Why is she worried about all that?
[00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:05.720]   We don't know exactly.
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:06.720]   The passage doesn't tell us.
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:13.440]   But I think we can imagine that it could be, one of the reasons could be, that she, like
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:20.080]   so many of us, is finding identity in the work that she has to do.
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:24.800]   You know, perhaps she really likes being the one who makes the decisions and keeps control
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:25.800]   of the household.
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:28.920]   Maybe that's an important part of her identity and who she is.
[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:36.220]   Perhaps she feels a sense of pride in how competent and comprehensive she is in serving
[00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:37.220]   guests.
[00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:38.820]   You know, her house is well kept.
[00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:40.340]   Everything's clean in its place.
[00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:43.500]   The meal is perfectly delicious that she's putting on the table.
[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:45.700]   And there's treats for people who come in the door.
[00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:47.660]   And there's cut flowers.
[00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:48.660]   And everything's decorated.
[00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:51.260]   And all the servants in the house are working.
[00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.180]   And everything's running like clockwork.
[00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:58.900]   Maybe that's really important to her in terms of her identity.
[00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:02.620]   Maybe she's kind of a Martha Stewart of her time, right?
[00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:06.740]   And that's important to her, that she knows everybody's looking at her being like, "Wow.
[00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:08.120]   Her house is amazing.
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:09.400]   And everything smells great.
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:10.400]   And it's all clean.
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.100]   And it runs perfectly."
[00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:17.420]   And maybe that's really a big part to her of who she is.
[00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:22.380]   And she feels the pressure of maintaining that facade of perfection in front of other
[00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:23.380]   people.
[00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:27.900]   Because she's like, "Everybody's expecting me to do everything and for it to be great
[00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:28.900]   and perfect.
[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:30.580]   And I have to keep up with that appearance.
[00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:31.580]   I have to keep up that facade.
[00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:34.740]   I have to keep up that image."
[00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:36.220]   And she's feeling that pressure.
[00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:44.700]   Because ultimately, her identity is in the work that she's doing, not in Christ.
[00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:49.980]   Maybe she's feeling a sense of significance because she's doing all this important stuff.
[00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:58.820]   And if she wasn't doing those things, maybe she would feel kind of empty and wonder who
[00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:01.540]   she was, where her worth was found.
[00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:05.040]   That's so true for us as well.
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:11.100]   And I think that's so significant for us to consider.
[00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:14.900]   Maybe she felt like all the good stuff that she was doing somehow was earning her favor
[00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:16.700]   with God.
[00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:22.060]   Maybe she thought that what she was doing helped demonstrate to other people and to
[00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:27.180]   God that she was a good person because she was doing all this good stuff.
[00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:31.420]   And maybe Martha isn't choosing what is better.
[00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:35.180]   She's not choosing to sit at the feet of Jesus to be present with Him.
[00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:39.060]   Because she feels like she wouldn't know who she was or other people wouldn't know who
[00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:43.500]   she was without all this activity that she's doing.
[00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:49.340]   I think we have to examine our hearts because it's so easy for us to do this as well.
[00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:56.680]   How often do we place our identity as human beings in stuff other than Christ?
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:00.540]   In our work, we certainly, it's easy to do, right?
[00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:05.140]   A lot of us as Americans, when people ask us, when we meet someone for the first time
[00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:10.740]   and they ask us about ourselves, we start describing our work like that's who we are.
[00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:12.860]   That's not who we are as human beings.
[00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:14.300]   The job that we do.
[00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:15.860]   That's not our identity.
[00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:18.620]   But we place our identity in that.
[00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:20.860]   Sometimes it's in our education.
[00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:25.100]   We feel like our education defines who we are.
[00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:30.940]   The success or sometimes we, if we don't experience the success we want in education, we feel
[00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:33.300]   defined by failure.
[00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:34.860]   That's not who we are.
[00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:36.940]   That's not our identity.
[00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:43.220]   Our accomplishments, our skill in different things and different parts of life, our competency,
[00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:45.980]   our success, our relationships.
[00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:51.540]   Sometimes we feel like, oh, I have this identity because of who I know or who my friends are,
[00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:54.140]   who my family is.
[00:16:54.140 --> 00:17:03.780]   Our life experiences, our travel, our money, our prestige, our social media feeds, our
[00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:09.580]   Instagram, those things, if we're not careful, we start to define ourselves and think that
[00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:10.940]   that is who we are.
[00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:12.700]   That's our identity.
[00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:15.180]   And that's not true.
[00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:20.660]   Even good things in our life, like our family heritage or our religious faithfulness and
[00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:26.380]   church attendance, things like that, that are good things that God wants us to do, we
[00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:30.140]   can start to put our identity there and say, yeah, I know I'm a good person because I always
[00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:33.940]   show up at church and I try to help some other people and every once in a while I give some
[00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:35.580]   money or whatever.
[00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:37.460]   But that's not who we are.
[00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:42.020]   Our identity has to be found in Christ.
[00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:47.700]   You know, if we try to pull meaning and significance and worth from these things, then we start
[00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:54.260]   to feel good when they're going well, when our work is going well or when our something
[00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:57.780]   good is happening in our life, when we get to take the trip that we want to take or our
[00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:58.780]   school is going well.
[00:17:58.780 --> 00:17:59.780]   We feel good.
[00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:01.900]   We feel like, yeah, everything's great.
[00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:05.260]   But then when they're not going well, we feel worthless.
[00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:12.900]   We feel like who we are as a human being has been destroyed or crushed in some way.
[00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:15.980]   We feel miserable.
[00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:20.020]   And it's because we're placing our identity in something that it shouldn't be in.
[00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:24.340]   And all the while, those things that we're placing our identity in begin to take more
[00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:29.100]   and more of our time and focus and more and more of our priority in our life.
[00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:32.040]   They start to consume us and they become our priorities.
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:37.540]   Even if we don't plan for them to, they start to take up all of our time.
[00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:42.380]   And I want to just point out again that a lot of those things I'm talking about are
[00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:45.020]   not bad things.
[00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:46.020]   Not saying that.
[00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:50.980]   Obviously, we know if we're putting our identity in destructive, unhealthy, sinful things,
[00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:51.980]   then that's wrong.
[00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:52.980]   We shouldn't do that.
[00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:53.980]   But that's not what I'm talking about.
[00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:58.760]   I'm talking about good stuff that God actually wants us to have in our life.
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:04.620]   It's just we get it out of proportion, out of focus, and it becomes bigger than it should
[00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:05.620]   be.
[00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:06.620]   And that's what was happening with Martha.
[00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:09.960]   As I said earlier, she was doing good stuff.
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:11.600]   She just wasn't doing the best thing.
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:15.020]   She wasn't spending time in the presence of Jesus.
[00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:18.200]   And that happens to us too.
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:19.200]   It's good to work hard.
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:20.700]   It's good to be successful and competent.
[00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:22.780]   It's good to be faithful in church.
[00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:24.420]   Those are all biblical values.
[00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:27.060]   There's nothing wrong with seeking those things.
[00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:30.220]   The problem is when we begin to put those things in the wrong place.
[00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:34.180]   And to help us keep those things in perspective, we really have to understand the grace of
[00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:36.400]   God.
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:44.480]   We live righteously in life because Jesus has forgiven us and saved us and is at work
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:45.920]   in our lives.
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:51.480]   We do not live righteously so that Jesus will forgive us and save us and be at work in our
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:52.480]   lives.
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:54.660]   We have to keep that front and center.
[00:19:54.660 --> 00:20:00.660]   Like when good works come out of us, it's because God is at work.
[00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:04.720]   It's not because good works are coming out of us so that we can earn anything or so that
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:10.320]   we can achieve something with God or so that we can impress other people.
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:15.880]   And when we put our identity in something other than Christ, whether we realize it or
[00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:21.560]   not, we're seeking to derive something from those things that God never intended for us
[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:24.500]   to get out of those things.
[00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:32.680]   And trust me, nothing in the world can support the weight of human identity.
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:39.920]   It's a crushing weight for us to try to find our worth in something.
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:43.880]   And Christ is the only thing that can support that weight.
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:51.840]   If we try to pull worth and identity out of our job, we'll ultimately be disappointed,
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:52.840]   right?
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:55.880]   Because our jobs can be lost.
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:21:02.160]   If we try to pull that out of a relationship, that relationship could change.
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:05.480]   That friend or that person in our life may not be there anymore.
[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:06.760]   Maybe they move away.
[00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:08.520]   That can evaporate.
[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:15.920]   Our success, our education, our prestige, those things can go away.
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:19.720]   People can forget about our accomplishments.
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:27.920]   Maybe our degree or our GPA won't mean that much to anybody.
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:32.320]   Those things were never meant to hold the weight of our identity.
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:34.680]   But Christ can.
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:38.560]   And here's the truth of God's Word, and this is the important part, I think, for us to
[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:44.180]   remember in terms of identity, that we are made in the image of God, that each one of
[00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:49.560]   you has unspeakable value and worth because you're made in God's image.
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:54.200]   And by God's grace, if you have relationship with Jesus Christ, you've been redeemed by
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:56.360]   the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross.
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:22:00.960]   All of your sin and brokenness and all the mistakes and all the mess ups and all of the
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:08.560]   stuff in your life that has hurt you can be forgiven and healed and restored.
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:11.300]   That's the reality of your identity.
[00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:14.860]   But even in that, you don't bring anything to offer God.
[00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:17.200]   It's a gift of grace that Jesus does.
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:18.440]   We don't have to earn anything.
[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.080]   We don't have to work for it.
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:26.240]   We're forgiven and reconciled to God because of His love for us.
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:30.080]   We're restored to relationship with our Creator, the God who made us and loves us because of
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:31.080]   His grace.
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:34.400]   He does all the work, and we receive all the reward.
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:39.320]   And that's the good news of the Gospel, that we don't have to do anything, but we're healed
[00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:42.440]   by His love and grace and mercy.
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:45.080]   And that's your identity.
[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:48.400]   If you're in Christ today, that is your identity.
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:54.960]   You are forgiven and healed and restored and made new and covered and protected and
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:55.960]   loved.
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:58.240]   That's who you are.
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:01.040]   Not because of anything you do.
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:05.840]   Not because of anything that you have accomplished or will accomplish.
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:09.640]   Because of God's grace and work in your life.
[00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:12.520]   And so you can stop striving.
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:15.160]   You can stop trying to deserve it.
[00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:20.440]   You can stop trying to impress God or other people, and you are free to go sit in the
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:26.160]   presence of Jesus and enjoy His presence.
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:27.160]   That's where Martha was at.
[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:30.720]   There was something that was, she felt like she couldn't go in there and sit at His feet
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:34.580]   because she had to do all this stuff.
[00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:38.920]   She wasn't free to say, "Yeah, I can just sit in the presence of Jesus."
[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:41.960]   And we can feel that tension as well.
[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:44.400]   You are free in God's grace.
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.680]   If you find your identity in Christ, to say, "You know what?
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:51.400]   I can go sit in the presence of Jesus, and I don't have to keep up any appearance or
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:52.400]   any image.
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:53.400]   I don't have to earn anything.
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:55.600]   I don't have to try to be good enough.
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:56.800]   Because He's loved me.
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:59.440]   He's forgiven me."
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:04.720]   That freedom allows us to choose what is better.
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:10.640]   The next thing I want us to see here is that we have to choose provision and peace in Christ
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:12.080]   that is grounded in God's goodness.
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.320]   We have to choose provision and peace in Christ.
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:16.560]   That's grounded in God's goodness.
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:20.880]   Maybe another reason that Martha is working so hard is because she's preoccupied with
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:24.880]   getting things done because she feels the pressure of living in our broken world where
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:29.240]   there's a lot of problems and there's stuff that has to be taken care of.
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:35.280]   Maybe that's why she can't go and sit at the feet of Jesus because she's like, "Hey, there's
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:39.560]   bills to pay, and there's stuff that's got to get done in this house.
[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:43.080]   And if I'm not doing it, who's going to do it?"
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:44.080]   Maybe there were debts.
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:46.560]   We don't know.
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:51.000]   Or maybe she's just saying, "Hey, all the comforts of this home that Jesus is enjoying
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.080]   and the fact that Mary can sit in there and relax at His feet, that only happens because
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:57.200]   somebody's working, and it's me.
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.240]   So I got to keep working."
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:02.620]   Maybe she's feeling that pressure of the fact that we live in a broken world and nothing
[00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:08.880]   comes easy, and so she just has to keep laboring.
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:09.880]   And that's true.
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:11.120]   Those are very real concerns.
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:12.160]   I get that.
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.880]   All of us have those types of concerns.
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:16.320]   We face those issues.
[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:17.680]   There are financial pressures.
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:22.800]   There are responsibilities to care for people in our families, in our churches, in our communities.
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:28.600]   The list of things we have to do and the bills we have to pay kind of seems to go on forever.
[00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:33.920]   And at times we can feel like we simply don't have the time to sit down and spend in God's
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:37.440]   presence because there's so much that has to be done.
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:40.800]   But what do we see about Mary in this passage?
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:44.840]   She does make time.
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:51.680]   Now is Mary sitting at the feet of Jesus because she's lazy and unconcerned?
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:52.680]   I don't think so.
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:56.480]   I don't think there's anything in this passage or anywhere else in the Gospels where it talks
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:02.220]   about Mary that would cause us to believe that Mary's just lazy or she doesn't care.
[00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:04.400]   That's not true at all.
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:06.880]   It's not that she has no responsibilities.
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:11.320]   I'm sure she had a lot of stuff she needed to do too.
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:15.320]   It's not because her life was just full of leisure and she could just sit around.
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:17.000]   It's not that.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.680]   What's going on with Mary is that she has all the tasks and the responsibilities.
[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:24.200]   She has stuff that she needs to do.
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:29.080]   She has pressures, but she's just saying, "No, I'm going to set that stuff aside and
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:31.440]   go sit at the feet of Jesus.
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:37.640]   And I'm not going to worry about them because I'm going to trust that if I'll make time
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:44.280]   for Jesus and make that important in my life, then he'll help take care of all the other
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:45.280]   stuff."
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:51.120]   She's finding the peace to sit in his presence by trusting that he's going to provide for
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:55.560]   the rest of the pressures of her life.
[00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:59.640]   And that's really important for us as well.
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:01.120]   Martha doesn't really understand this.
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:05.280]   We see when she comes in, she says, "Lord, don't you care that my sister has left me
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:06.560]   to do the work by myself?
[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:07.560]   Tell her to help me."
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:12.680]   It's kind of like Martha saying, "How can she just sit here and listen to you when there's
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:15.920]   so much that has to be done?"
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:18.000]   But Mary's not sitting there because she doesn't care.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.480]   She's not sitting there because she's being spiteful towards Martha.
[00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:24.960]   She's sitting there because she's trusting Jesus and she's saying, "This is really important
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:25.960]   in my life.
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:27.680]   This is the most important thing.
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:33.560]   And I'm believing that if I make time for this and if I make sure my relationship to
[00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:39.360]   Jesus is healthy and I'm spiritually healthy, then God's going to take care of the rest
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:40.360]   of it.
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:42.520]   I'm going to be able to get through the rest of it a whole lot better."
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:44.920]   Doesn't mean her life was easier, that she didn't have problems.
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:46.560]   That's true for us.
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:50.000]   Just because we have a relationship with God doesn't mean God's going to make all our problems
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.920]   go away or we don't have to pay bills.
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:55.480]   We have the same challenges everybody else has.
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:28:02.560]   But if we will choose to find provision and peace as we trust God's goodness in our life,
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:04.480]   then we'll find ourselves saying, "You know what?
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:05.480]   I am busy right now.
[00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:06.720]   I have a lot to do.
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:13.360]   But I can take a minute to sit in God's presence and be encouraged and be blessed by that."
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:17.360]   And that's what Mary is doing.
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:22.540]   And one of the cool things about that is as we do that, as we spend time in Jesus' presence,
[00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:27.400]   we actually start to get perspective on the problems in our life that they're not as big
[00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:28.400]   as we thought anyway.
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:32.160]   Remember there's this old hymn that says, "Turn your eyes on Jesus.
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:36.080]   Look full in His wonderful face, and the things of earth will grow strangely dim in the light
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:38.200]   of His glory and grace."
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:39.600]   That's really true.
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:43.920]   When we're focused on the problems and the challenges in our life, they seem huge and
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:45.680]   insurmountable.
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:48.960]   But when we start doing what Mary was doing and sitting at the feet of Jesus and focusing
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:54.160]   on Him, spending time in His presence, suddenly the problems are not that big of a deal.
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:57.080]   They start to fade into the background.
[00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:07.480]   And the third thing we see here is that Mary is choosing satisfaction in God's presence.
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:13.840]   You know, sometimes we work and we do all this stuff because it just feels good, right?
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:21.080]   Maybe some of us have painful things in our life, trauma from our past that it's tough
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:24.820]   for us to deal with, and so it's just easier to work and to stay busy and to put our head
[00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:28.360]   down and to try to distract ourselves.
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:30.780]   Maybe that was going on with Martha a little bit too.
[00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:37.620]   Maybe she was discouraged from things in her life, but it was just easier to push ahead
[00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:41.380]   into her work than to actually deal with any of that.
[00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:44.140]   And that happens to us.
[00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:49.320]   The reality is that we all ache for better things in our world, because we live in a
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:56.280]   broken world where there's all types of pain around us, and it comes into our lives as
[00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:57.280]   well.
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:59.820]   And God created us for a perfect world.
[00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:03.620]   God created us for perfect relationship with Him, for perfect relationship with one another,
[00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:04.980]   for Heaven.
[00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:10.780]   And so there's a part of us that looks at our broken world and is just, we're hurt by
[00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:16.180]   it, we're frustrated, we're angry at times, we don't understand it.
[00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:19.660]   Our hearts break over it.
[00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:24.820]   And because of that heartbreak, we start to seek satisfaction in different things.
[00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:31.260]   There's a lot of unhealthy ways that we seek that, but sometimes we seek it just in work
[00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:37.460]   and business and trying to order our lives and our families and our future.
[00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:42.260]   And we feel like, if I can just kind of get everything in order the way I want, then it'll
[00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:43.260]   feel good.
[00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:47.220]   I'll feel satisfied if I can just order my own life.
[00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:53.340]   And the sad reality is we're always let down in that, because none of us, no matter how
[00:30:53.340 --> 00:31:00.500]   OCD we are, none of us can control everything and order our own life and make it all work
[00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:03.180]   out the way we want it to.
[00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:12.420]   God's always going to disappoint us or get sideways or let us down or break.
[00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:17.460]   And we have to understand that we should be finding satisfaction in God's presence.
[00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:23.980]   There's a reason that God, He did create us for good works, but as I said earlier, those
[00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:27.580]   good works are a result of what He's doing in us.
[00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:31.660]   God created us not as human doings, but human beings.
[00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:37.220]   God wants us to be with Him more than He wants us to work for Him.
[00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:39.220]   And sometimes we feel like, okay, I want to follow Jesus.
[00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:41.700]   It's all about the stuff I do.
[00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:45.980]   And God says, "Hey, yeah, I've got some stuff for you to do, but first I want you to be
[00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:46.980]   with me.
[00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:50.940]   I want you to spend time in my presence."
[00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:56.500]   And that's what Mary was choosing to do.
[00:31:56.500 --> 00:32:03.420]   Mary is finding satisfaction in the presence of Jesus, sitting at His feet.
[00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:08.740]   She is ultimately choosing, as I said earlier, His presence over productivity, over trying
[00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:09.740]   to do everything.
[00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:17.620]   She's saying, "I'm going to be most satisfied just spending time with Christ."
[00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:23.540]   Mary is choosing relationship with Jesus as a disciple, a follower, and a friend.
[00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:25.260]   She's choosing not to be distracted.
[00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:27.860]   She's not putting her identity in her activity.
[00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:32.420]   She's trusting Jesus rather than worrying about the pressures around her.
[00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:35.300]   And look at how she's relating to Him.
[00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:42.380]   She's taking the posture of a worshiper, sitting at His feet, welcoming His presence, listening,
[00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:47.180]   learning from what He's saying, being humble and attentive to His words, opening her heart
[00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:48.960]   to His truth.
[00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:51.540]   She's giving the response of a follower.
[00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:56.700]   I'm sure she had questions and fears and misgivings, but even in the midst of that, she's choosing
[00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:58.200]   to obey.
[00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:00.220]   She's being a disciple.
[00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:05.100]   She's leaving other priorities to be devoted to the time in God's presence.
[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:07.020]   She's choosing the response of a friend.
[00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:12.460]   She's sitting, talking, laughing, just like a friend would, sharing time together.
[00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:16.300]   She's experiencing the love of Christ and responding with love.
[00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:19.900]   And she's choosing what is better.
[00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:23.020]   So I think the question for us then is how do we make that choice?
[00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:25.180]   We want to choose what is better.
[00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:26.180]   How do we make that choice?
[00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:31.220]   It seems kind of simple for Mary because Jesus was there, like, in the room.
[00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:35.020]   So you know, if Jesus was right in the other room, we could all say, "All right, let's
[00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:37.820]   go in there and have a seat."
[00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:39.820]   That's a simple choice, right?
[00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:43.860]   But in our lives, Jesus is present, but He's not physically present in the other room.
[00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:48.100]   So how do we do what Mary did and choose what is better?
[00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:51.900]   Well, it's really not as complex as it might seem to us.
[00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:58.540]   Ultimately, we choose what is better by responding to the presence of Christ, just like Mary
[00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:00.980]   did, by responding to His presence in our life.
[00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:03.300]   Jesus showed up at Mary and Martha's house.
[00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:07.380]   Mary responded by going into His presence.
[00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:12.780]   And first of all, if you don't have relationship with Christ, you respond to His presence by
[00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:15.340]   beginning relationship with Him, as we talked about earlier.
[00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:19.700]   That comes by grace, through faith, through believing what He's done on our behalf.
[00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:22.680]   It's not something we have to earn or do anything for.
[00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:24.380]   It comes by grace.
[00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:29.700]   But for those of us who already have relationship with Christ, who say, "Okay, I've already
[00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:33.100]   made a decision to know Jesus.
[00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:36.900]   I already have relationship with Christ."
[00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:41.740]   Then Jesus is already present in our lives through the presence of the Holy Spirit.
[00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:42.860]   He's with us every moment.
[00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:46.700]   So how do we respond to His presence?
[00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:55.940]   I think the answer for us to consider today is that we choose to take time with Him.
[00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:59.740]   We choose to take time sitting at His feet.
[00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:03.740]   Now like I said, His physical presence is not here, but how do we listen to His words?
[00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:05.740]   Mary sat at His feet and listened to His words.
[00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:06.940]   Well, God's given us the Bible.
[00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:09.460]   It's His words spoken to us.
[00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:15.580]   So if we want to sit at His feet, hear what He has to say to us, we spend time reading
[00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:18.380]   His word.
[00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:21.620]   And we do it in the way that we see modeled in this story.
[00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:23.000]   We take time.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   We do it slowly.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   We do it attentively.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:30.660]   We do it with a heart to hear and listen and understand, not just a heart that says, "Yeah,
[00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:32.180]   I know this is kind of important.
[00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:33.700]   Like I go to church.
[00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:34.700]   I'm supposed to read my Bible.
[00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:36.900]   I'll check it off the list."
[00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:38.820]   But we say, "No, that's not the point of what I'm doing.
[00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:42.860]   The point is I want to actually hear what God has to say.
[00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:45.060]   I want to be in His presence."
[00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:46.060]   We ask questions.
[00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:48.620]   We don't rush through it.
[00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:51.260]   We pray.
[00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:54.900]   And when I say pray, I don't just mean like, "God, thank you for this food.
[00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:56.620]   Help me not to break my leg today.
[00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:57.620]   Amen."
[00:35:57.620 --> 00:36:01.540]   But taking time to really pour out our heart before God.
[00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:04.940]   If you think about a relationship, if there's any closeness in that relationship, there
[00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:07.180]   has to be communication, right?
[00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:10.980]   And the closer the relationship is, the more honest and open that communication should
[00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:11.980]   be.
[00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:15.180]   So if you're going to have a relationship with Jesus, you should be able to talk honestly
[00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:17.380]   and openly about what's in your life.
[00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:18.860]   And that's what I mean when I say pray.
[00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:23.140]   I mean sitting down with God and saying, "God, here's what's going on.
[00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:28.780]   I'm confused or I'm angry or I'm hurt or I'm frustrated.
[00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:29.940]   I don't understand.
[00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:34.140]   I'm afraid because of what's happening in my life."
[00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:38.680]   That's what I'm talking about, honestly and fully pouring out your heart before God and
[00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:42.460]   sharing your struggles and your doubts and your fears.
[00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:45.020]   Opening up your heart and saying, "God, I don't understand this.
[00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:47.700]   I don't know what's going on right now, but I'm asking you to work and I'm going to let
[00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:48.700]   you work.
[00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:54.340]   I'm going to take my hands off of it a little bit and let you do something in my life."
[00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:59.180]   Letting God speak to us, listening to what he's going to have to say as we get in his
[00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:00.180]   word.
[00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:03.420]   We choose to stay and continue in relationship and in prayer, right?
[00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:05.140]   That's one of the challenges we have as believers.
[00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:09.540]   It's easy to be like, "Okay, God, I prayed once, read a little of the Bible.
[00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:11.620]   Now I want to see the result."
[00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:14.260]   And it doesn't happen tomorrow and it doesn't happen next week.
[00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:16.020]   And then we're like, "All right, I'm done.
[00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:19.420]   I'm going to go try to do this myself or find another solution."
[00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:24.140]   But continuing to stay with God and saying, "God, I'm going to continue to let you work
[00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:25.140]   in my life."
[00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:29.580]   That's how he speaks to us.
[00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:32.780]   That's how we experience his presence.
[00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:35.660]   Choosing to find our identity in him like we talked about at the beginning, not in all
[00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:39.740]   the other stuff, but to find our identity in Christ.
[00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:44.180]   Guarding our hearts against putting our identity in something else that's not going to be able
[00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:47.180]   to support the weight of our identity.
[00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:51.700]   Believing his truth that we're loved by him, we're forgiven, that we can be healed.
[00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:58.020]   Finding our worth in who we are, created in God's image and redeemed by Christ.
[00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:00.800]   And we choose to prioritize our time in that way, right?
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:05.340]   If you have a relationship with someone that you love, that's important to you, you prioritize
[00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:06.620]   time with that person.
[00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:09.260]   You make sure that it happens.
[00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:11.940]   You put it on the calendar and you don't miss it.
[00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:15.620]   And you ignore other stuff to make it happen, right?
[00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:18.060]   And that's how we spend time at the feet of Jesus.
[00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:21.420]   That's how we choose what is better, like Mary was saying.
[00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:24.180]   We say, "I'm going to make sure I get time with God in his presence.
[00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:28.460]   I'm going to make sure I get time in the Word, praying, worshiping, spending time with God.
[00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:33.580]   And I'm going to prioritize it and make sure it happens consistently."
[00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:38.620]   And we do that even when, and I would say especially when, the responsibilities and
[00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:41.980]   the stress and the pressures of life are piling up.
[00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:45.820]   Because that's when it's easiest to be like, "I just don't have time right now to sit in
[00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:47.860]   God's presence."
[00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:51.920]   But that's when we need it the most.
[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:53.860]   Maybe Mary knew that in this story.
[00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:57.980]   Maybe she was saying, "Hey, I actually have so much to do and that's why even more than
[00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:02.940]   ever I need to go sit at the feet of Jesus so that I can experience some peace that will
[00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:07.020]   get me through what's about to happen in my life."
[00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:10.020]   We've got to value that.
[00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:11.900]   We've got to choose it.
[00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:16.900]   And I think if we do, our relationship to Him will start to flourish in really life-giving
[00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:17.900]   ways.
[00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:21.740]   And we'll really discover the reward of knowing Him.
[00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:23.180]   And we'll experience His blessing.
[00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:30.300]   And we'll experience a lot of things that seem so threatening to us not being as threatening.
[00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:35.540]   That God will remove those things or they just won't be as big of a deal for us.
[00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:38.740]   What we'll ultimately experience is what Jesus says in this passage, that it will not be
[00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:40.900]   taken away.
[00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:44.920]   Everything else is going to come and go.
[00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:49.100]   But the time that we spend with God, loving Him, the time that we spend allowing Him to
[00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:56.380]   work in our lives to love other people, that ripples through eternity, right?
[00:39:56.380 --> 00:40:03.180]   The bills we pay, even our jobs, our degrees, our cars, our houses, everything else, it'll
[00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:05.260]   be gone in a few years.
[00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:07.700]   No one will remember it.
[00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:10.860]   But our relationship to God is eternal.
[00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:13.640]   The way that God uses us to love other people, that's eternal.
[00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:18.180]   The souls of other people will be in heaven for eternity or they'll be separated from
[00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:19.180]   God.
[00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:23.140]   But it's going to be an eternal impact.
[00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:26.100]   And that's what I want us to see as we close.
[00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:30.540]   If you think about Mary and Martha, I want to just kind of humanize this story for a
[00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:31.540]   second.
[00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:35.380]   It's easy for us to read Bible stories in a kind of two-dimensional way, like, oh yeah,
[00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:36.380]   they're Bible characters.
[00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:39.320]   They're like people on a felt board that move around.
[00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:41.820]   But these were real people.
[00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:45.820]   They really lived just like we do.
[00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:50.780]   And I'm sure one day when they were older, they probably told people about Jesus, right?
[00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:54.900]   Because everybody in their culture would have known about Him and wanted to hear stories.
[00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:57.940]   I'm sure they sat around with kids someday and told them, "Hey, this one time Jesus came
[00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:04.700]   to our house and He was passing through with the disciples and we invited Him in."
[00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:06.380]   And think about that.
[00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:09.820]   When they would tell those stories some days, what do you think they told about?
[00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:12.700]   Did Martha say, "Yeah, Jesus and the disciples came over.
[00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:13.700]   It was awesome.
[00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:20.220]   The pitas that I made that day were just, they were perfectly crisp."
[00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:22.460]   Is that what she was talking about?
[00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:25.220]   I really doubt it, right?
[00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:29.820]   Or every candle, I mean the wicks were trimmed at the same height.
[00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:32.660]   That's not the story that she would have told.
[00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:35.940]   She would have talked about Jesus was present in her house, in the room.
[00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:37.300]   Like, this is what He said.
[00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:40.780]   This is what it felt like to be there with Him.
[00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:43.180]   This is how loved I felt in His presence.
[00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:44.780]   This is what He said to me.
[00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:46.620]   This is how He healed something in my life.
[00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:51.100]   This is how I was forgiven by His grace.
[00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:52.620]   That's the stuff that doesn't go away.
[00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:53.780]   That's what Jesus said here.
[00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:55.940]   It will not be taken away.
[00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:58.000]   And that's true for us.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.660]   We get so caught up in all this other stuff in life and a lot of it won't be important
[00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:04.680]   in a few years.
[00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:09.220]   But if we'll choose, like Mary, to sit in the feet of Jesus, to take time in His presence,
[00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:11.980]   to value presence over productivity and everything else.
[00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:14.140]   That's something that will not be taken away.
[00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:15.780]   We won't lose it.
[00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:19.220]   And we will remember that and we'll share it with others, what it feels like to be in
[00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:27.180]   His presence, to be forgiven, to be loved, to be accepted, and to be comforted, to be
[00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:31.420]   healed, to know Him and to grow in Him.
[00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:37.620]   That's what Jesus is calling us to, to choose that in our lives and to sit in His presence,
[00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:40.620]   to choose relationships, to spend time with Him.
[00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:42.420]   Let's pray.
[00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:49.140]   God, we thank You, again, for Your truth, for how powerful and real it is.
[00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:55.320]   And God, I just pray over all of us in this room, I know it is so easy to do everything
[00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:58.180]   else except spend time with You.
[00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:02.660]   We have so many pressures, so many things we feel like we have to do, so many things
[00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:04.500]   we feel like we want to do.
[00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:07.780]   It's hard to choose what is better.
[00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:12.780]   And God, I just ask for Your help in my life and I ask for Your help in each one of our
