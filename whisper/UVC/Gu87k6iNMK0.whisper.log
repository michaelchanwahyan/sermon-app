[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600]   - Thank you, Phoebe.
[00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:05.820]   Yeah, one more reminder is that we have a few workers,
[00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.820]   interns among us, and I wanna personally introduce them
[00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.080]   and wanna appreciate their work and ministry in the summer.
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.200]   The first one, of course, is Phoebe.
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.320]   So Phoebe is one of our summer intern.
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.960]   She is finishing off her master's study
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.940]   at Lagos Evangelical Seminary,
[00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.280]   so she's doing some intern here.
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.520]   And also Wendy, is Wendy around here?
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.360]   Back there, right?
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.760]   Yeah, Wendy.
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.280]   Wendy is another intern, so we wanna thank her
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.280]   for doing all the background and backstage ministry for us.
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.040]   And also Lucy, Lucy right there.
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.360]   And thank you for joining us for this summer intern,
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.320]   and she is studying as Wendy as well
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.200]   at Moody Bible Institute,
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.480]   and she is music composition major.
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.800]   So if you want some new songs, go to Lucy.
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.140]   She will be helping us with the instrument
[00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.080]   and all the music as well.
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.860]   So do pray for our interns, all right?
[00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.560]   We're going to put them to work,
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.520]   and they will work very, very hard, okay?
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.520]   So they will have a very, very busy month in the summer.
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.040]   So let's pray together.
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.280]   Father, give thanks as a community of faith,
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.400]   as your believers, we come before you.
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.040]   We know that we are born in the spirit.
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.200]   Thank you for the privilege and the blessing.
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.040]   We can praise you, we can worship you,
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.660]   we can draw close to you.
[00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.320]   Thank you for inviting us into your presence,
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.040]   and may your spirit speak to us
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.280]   and lead us into true worship.
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.040]   And may all that we do, all that we think,
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.640]   and all that we say be pleasing to you.
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.880]   We again come before you.
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.300]   We ask that you will cleanse our sins,
[00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.000]   and you will forgive us.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.480]   You will help us to come before you,
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.840]   knowing that in Christ we are righteous,
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.080]   because all that your son has done for all of us.
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.440]   Pray for our church as well.
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.040]   During the summer, there are people in now,
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.760]   especially there are some brothers and sisters
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.600]   who are out of town, and I just pray
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.640]   that you will grant them safety.
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.040]   I also wanna pray for those who are sick,
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.640]   who are going through some challenges and struggles.
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.520]   Pray that you will grant them peace and healing.
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.200]   As we open the scripture,
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.440]   we ask that your spirit will lead us into your truth,
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.000]   and let your truth set us free,
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.080]   and build up your church, and build up our life.
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.000]   In Christ, we pray.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.960]   Well, we will continue our series on worship,
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.200]   and this is a seven-part series.
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.360]   We are in part number six.
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.720]   So we began this series asking the question,
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.160]   how can we be better worshipers?
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.240]   How can we be better worshipers?
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.600]   How can we become better worshipers as a group,
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.560]   as a church, as a community?
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.240]   And there are many questions we need to ask ourselves,
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.160]   or confront ourselves,
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.640]   because God is pleased when his people worship him.
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.640]   And we have reminded all of us that from the Bible,
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.560]   from cover to cover, from the first chapter
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.840]   to the last chapter, in some sense,
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.840]   worship is all that the Bible is all about.
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.320]   And what God is doing in humanity is that to rescue us,
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.120]   and to live in us, and to dwell in us.
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.000]   And today, we're going to talk about
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.880]   some of the aspects of worship.
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.680]   And we try to do something like a summary.
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.240]   Try to find from the pages of Scripture
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.680]   what worship is all about,
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.040]   and what are those elements happen in corporate worship.
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.120]   When we worship together, what are the elements,
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.880]   what are the things that we do,
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.880]   or things that the people in the Bible do when they worship,
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.840]   and to reflect upon how we can prepare ourselves,
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.040]   how we can become better worshipers.
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.640]   So I have summarized some of the aspects
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.720]   or elements of worship from the Bible,
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.360]   especially from the New Testament,
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.560]   or also from the Old Testament as well.
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.440]   From the whole Bible, try to summarize
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.240]   what are the main aspects of worship.
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.760]   When we come before God to worship together,
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.020]   or when we call upon the name of Jesus to gather together,
[00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.160]   the New Testament reminds us
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.480]   whenever there were two or three people,
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.240]   calling in the name of Jesus,
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.060]   gathering in the name of Jesus,
[00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.800]   God is in the midst,
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.840]   God is dwelling among them in his presence.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.120]   So what did they do, right?
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.960]   What did they do?
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.000]   What do we do?
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   And there are eight elements I have tried to summarize.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.260]   So in this part and the last part next week,
[00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.280]   we're going to go through this list
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.880]   and see what the Bible says
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.680]   about all these aspects of worship.
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.920]   And first of all, it's about songs, right?
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.000]   We sing songs, right?
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.080]   We sing songs and we sing praises to our God
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.480]   when we gather to worship together.
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.120]   No matter we gather in a church like this,
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.380]   like this kind of setting,
[00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.560]   or we gather into small group,
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.400]   or we even go to retreat, right?
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.340]   We get together as a small group.
[00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.200]   We get together to worship.
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.760]   And of course, the first thing that we do
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.960]   is that we sing songs, right?
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.840]   There are general principles from the Bible
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.440]   about using songs in worship.
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.260]   However, the Bible never dictate the details, right?
[00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:52.440]   You agree?
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.200]   Does the Bible dictate what kind of songs that we sing?
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.960]   You think so?
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.180]   You know, I used to go to a reform seminary,
[00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:07.680]   and in the seminary, there were chapels every week.
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.280]   There were about two chapels every week, morning chapels.
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.560]   So we joined the morning chapels,
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.640]   and because it's a reform seminary
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.240]   and it's on the traditional side,
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.560]   and we always use the same hymn book.
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.960]   And the hymn book, if you pick up the hymn book
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.200]   and you flip the pages, there are only 150 songs.
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.520]   There are only 150 songs, right?
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.800]   That makes it easier, right?
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:34.760]   If you're leading worship,
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.160]   you don't have to go Google some of the songs, right?
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.240]   You don't have to go to YouTube
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.680]   and listen to some of the songs,
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.600]   because there are no new songs.
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.860]   There are only 180 songs,
[00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.240]   because they are directly taken out
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.280]   from the bowl of salt, right?
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.420]   There are 150 songs only.
[00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:56.000]   So that's the philosophy.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.320]   They only sing 150 songs, right?
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.160]   You agree with that kind of practice?
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.840]   Yes, no?
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:08.240]   Well, I don't think the Bible really dictates us
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:13.400]   exactly what kind of songs that we sing, right?
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:16.840]   The songs that we use are contemporary songs, right?
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:21.320]   They are not applicable,
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.880]   or they are not being used in other culture,
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.240]   in other setting.
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.780]   Did I tell you last year I tried to learn some Hebrew songs?
[00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:30.760]   I did, right?
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:31.600]   Yeah.
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.720]   Did I tell you last week?
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.720]   I'm losing my memory, yeah.
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:39.800]   Right, and my children don't like Hebrew songs, right?
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.280]   The Hebrew songs are pretty much minor songs, right?
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.640]   But they're beautiful, right?
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:48.960]   But to some of the contemporary audience,
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.960]   don't speak to them, right?
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.040]   So we use some of the songs that are contemporary to us.
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.600]   So we use those songs,
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:00.120]   and they are new songs compared to the bowl of psalms.
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.980]   However, they are totally applicable.
[00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:06.360]   It's biblical to use new songs,
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.720]   because the psalms, the Bible tells us
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.080]   whenever God does something new,
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.220]   we have to sing new song, right?
[00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:17.860]   So people will compose new songs to be used in worship,
[00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:18.700]   right?
[00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:21.680]   We have a major in music composition.
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.660]   They're using her gifts, using our gifts,
[00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:28.660]   to compose entirely brand new songs for worshiping God.
[00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:32.940]   So I don't think God will dictate
[00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:35.540]   what kind of songs we have to use.
[00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:36.420]   No.
[00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:39.060]   However, most of the songs that we use in corporate worships
[00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:42.320]   are what I call upward songs.
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.860]   We sing those songs directly to God,
[00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.700]   directly to the Lord,
[00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:51.380]   and those are legitimate songs or poems that we can use,
[00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:54.140]   or lyrics singing directly to God.
[00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:57.260]   Most of the songs that we use in worship are like that.
[00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:02.260]   However, I don't think the Bible has ever dictated us
[00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:06.620]   what kind of songs or which songs that we use.
[00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:09.380]   As you step into this church,
[00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:12.900]   you find that our setting is a little bit different.
[00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:16.660]   I used to go to traditional churches.
[00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:21.200]   This is not quite traditional setting for church buildings.
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.500]   I wanna give you a quiz.
[00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:25.600]   You know what is this?
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.080]   You know what this is?
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.880]   What kind of furniture item is this?
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.760]   Anyone?
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:38.360]   They are actually hymnal or hymn book holder.
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:42.720]   You know, if you walk into a traditional church setting,
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.720]   you find those hymnal holder
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.820]   at the back of the church pillars, right?
[00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:51.600]   They are used for not your books.
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.360]   You know, you don't bring your books and put it there.
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.720]   It is for public worship.
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:01.720]   So they use a particular hymnal, particular book of hymns.
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:06.760]   And I used to go to a traditional Baptist church
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:09.740]   in California, and when I was younger,
[00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:12.200]   I always joined the worship service
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:16.260]   and the Wednesday evening prayer meeting.
[00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.040]   And what we do is we gather together,
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.920]   and the host or the worship leader
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.260]   will tell us the number of the hymn.
[00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:27.780]   So let's turn to our hymnal, 126.
[00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:32.000]   And then we will turn to the hymn, hymn book, 126,
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   and we sing together.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.500]   And all the songs that we use are all compiled
[00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:40.000]   in that book, right?
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.440]   But culture has changed, right?
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.280]   And we need to consider the local culture
[00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:45.920]   and language and tradition.
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.600]   And there were flexibility,
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.960]   how we use or what songs that we use
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.380]   in corporate worship.
[00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:58.220]   However, the main thing is there,
[00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.460]   the focus is to sing songs to God,
[00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:03.540]   it's to praise him with songs and poems.
[00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:06.980]   And that's one of the aspects of public worship.
[00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:08.960]   The second aspect is prayer.
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:12.120]   Now, this is a no-brainer, right?
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.900]   Because in scripture, the people of God
[00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:16.580]   get together to worship.
[00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:18.540]   There are many different prayers,
[00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:20.460]   or many types of prayers.
[00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:22.800]   There are praises, there are petition,
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.920]   there are supplications, there are laments,
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:28.920]   there are also confessions of sin,
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:33.320]   expressions of repentance, expressions of thanksgiving.
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:38.240]   All this wide variety of prayers are found in the Bible,
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:42.960]   and they are legitimately being used in corporate worship.
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.160]   So sometimes when we pray together,
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:48.960]   or pray silently, or pray together,
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:53.220]   we confess our sin, and we ask God for his forgiveness.
[00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:56.660]   Sometimes we give thanks to God.
[00:11:56.660 --> 00:12:00.500]   We give thanks to God because God answered our prayer,
[00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.220]   and God has been good to us.
[00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:05.660]   And sometimes we do petitions, right?
[00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:09.300]   We pray for our church, we pray for our community.
[00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:12.460]   And this is one of the reminders that we have,
[00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:15.700]   is we summarize what worship is all about in the Bible,
[00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:18.380]   that we need to prepare ourselves, right?
[00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:20.600]   We come before God in the presence of God,
[00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:23.260]   we want to worship, we need to prepare ourselves,
[00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:28.260]   we learn the songs, and we prepare our heart for prayers.
[00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.300]   Did you do that today?
[00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:34.320]   You walk into this hall, this auditorium,
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:37.000]   you prepare yourself to be prayerful.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.220]   You pray to God, you speak to God, right?
[00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:41.480]   Either you have thanksgiving,
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:44.440]   or you have some confessions to make,
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.440]   or some praises you want to sing, right?
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:50.080]   We need to prepare ourselves, right?
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.540]   Not only you prepare your body,
[00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:54.360]   but you prepare your spirit
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:58.280]   so that you can focus on worshiping God.
[00:12:58.280 --> 00:12:59.860]   Speaking of prepare on body,
[00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:04.980]   I have not been sleeping so well in the last two weeks.
[00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:08.760]   Especially about three weeks ago,
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:13.760]   I tried one of those over-the-counter sleeping pills,
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:17.380]   because I have trouble sleeping.
[00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:21.940]   So I tried some new sleeping aids three weeks ago.
[00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:25.280]   I took one on Tuesday, and of course I slept,
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:28.180]   but I collapsed, I actually collapsed.
[00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:31.160]   And then I woke up Wednesday morning,
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.540]   I feel so bad, feel so bad.
[00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:38.540]   I felt like I never slept last night, the night before.
[00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:42.960]   And then it lingered for a few days, actually.
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:46.880]   I've been just sleeping all day, sleepy all day, right?
[00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:51.800]   If you tell me, you ask me,
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:56.460]   if I took the new sleeping pill,
[00:13:56.460 --> 00:14:01.260]   like Saturday night, it would not be wise, right?
[00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.300]   Because I want to prepare my body
[00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:05.180]   so that I can worship God.
[00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:08.160]   So I ditched those new sleeping pill,
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:13.360]   and I go back to my, the old ones, the prescribed one.
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:15.320]   And it helps me to rest,
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:20.320]   help me to prepare our physical body to worship God.
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:22.780]   And this sort of thing reminds us
[00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:24.880]   we need to prepare ourselves to worship.
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:26.960]   We cannot just bump into a worship service,
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:29.560]   and then, okay, all right, we're worshiping.
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:32.860]   Right, God wants us to prepare ourselves,
[00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:35.840]   our spirit, our mind, and our body to worship Him.
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:38.660]   That's how we become better worshipers, right?
[00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:43.840]   Number three is confession of faith.
[00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:46.700]   Now, this sort of things sometimes we do
[00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:48.780]   in corporate worship.
[00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:51.920]   And what does it mean, confession of faith, or creed?
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:55.720]   It's from Latin, credo.
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:57.000]   It means I believe.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.540]   You know, throughout the entire church history
[00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:02.420]   of the last 2,000 years,
[00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:08.580]   there are generations of theologians and believers,
[00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:14.260]   they summarize the basic doctrines
[00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:15.720]   of the Bible.
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:20.740]   As they summarize it, they will write some of the creeds.
[00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:25.000]   Now, one of those creeds that we use in the past
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.600]   is called the Apostles' Creed, right?
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:30.140]   I actually preach about it
[00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:34.100]   in a sermon series on Apostles' Creed.
[00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.300]   And Apostles' Creed has been around
[00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:38.820]   for more than 1,000 years.
[00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:43.060]   And it's a very, very valuable and ancient summary
[00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:44.620]   of Christian faith.
[00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:50.580]   And it summarizes our basic doctrines in 12 articles.
[00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:55.040]   And we recite the Apostles' Creed
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:59.100]   to remind us what we believe, what we stand on.
[00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:03.460]   And that is called the creed or confession of faith.
[00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:07.500]   Actually, those creeds we can find from the Bible.
[00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:10.500]   If you pay attention to some of the scripture
[00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:13.020]   or some of the passages in the Bible,
[00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:15.180]   they are actually being incorporated
[00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:17.020]   into the New Testament writing,
[00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:19.220]   into the New Testament Bible.
[00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:23.780]   For example, the book of Matthew, Matthew 6.
[00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:28.620]   The Lord's Prayer, right?
[00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:31.580]   Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
[00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:32.500]   Be thy name.
[00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:34.260]   Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
[00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.320]   on earth as it is in heaven.
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:38.580]   Give us today our daily bread.
[00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:39.860]   Forgive us our debts.
[00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:42.620]   And we also have given our debtors.
[00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:44.660]   And lead us not into temptation,
[00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:47.220]   but deliver us from the evil one.
[00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:49.420]   For thine is the kingdom, the power,
[00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:51.660]   and the glory forever, amen.
[00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:55.540]   As I read this, I used King James words
[00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:57.820]   because that's how I grew up.
[00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:00.460]   I recite this Lord's Prayer from time to time
[00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:01.980]   in worship service, right?
[00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:05.620]   This is the confession of faith.
[00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:07.220]   Now, how do we know?
[00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:09.620]   You know the last line I highlight here?
[00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:14.620]   If you read the details of the English Bible, for example,
[00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:18.180]   you find a footnote there,
[00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:21.340]   and the footnote tells you the early,
[00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:25.020]   early Christian manuscript of Matthew 6
[00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:28.940]   does not have the sentence highlighted.
[00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:34.980]   Only the later manuscript contains the highlight,
[00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:37.940]   a second part of verse 13.
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:43.260]   Now, you know, there are many manuscripts of New Testament,
[00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:46.460]   and what the scholar's doing is trying to summarize
[00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:50.020]   what the original text actually is.
[00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:54.740]   So if you go to the earlier or the best manuscript,
[00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:58.540]   it doesn't have the yellow highlight verse.
[00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:01.020]   It stops at the evil one.
[00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:04.980]   Deliver us from the evil one, and then it stops.
[00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:06.220]   And that's the Lord's Prayer.
[00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:08.380]   That's the original Lord's Prayer.
[00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:11.260]   That's how Jesus taught His disciples to pray, right?
[00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:12.820]   It's a series of petition.
[00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:15.200]   Leads us not into temptation, forgive us,
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:17.860]   and deliver us from the evil one.
[00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:22.860]   The last line is being added in the early Christian church,
[00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:28.180]   and that's why those who copy the Bible
[00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:31.960]   from generation to generation, the Christian scribes,
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:34.440]   they incorporate this last verse,
[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:38.160]   this last second part of verse 13 into the Lord's Prayer.
[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:39.260]   And why?
[00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:44.260]   Because the early churches, when they met in house churches,
[00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:49.460]   they add this phrase at the end of the Lord's Prayer.
[00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:51.700]   And this is how they use it,
[00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:54.540]   use the Lord's Prayer in their worship service.
[00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:59.220]   So end with some sort of doxology, some sort of praise.
[00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:00.740]   Yours is the kingdom and the power
[00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:03.580]   and the glory forever, right?
[00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:06.340]   So as one of the example, you find that, you know,
[00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:10.140]   this kind of confession of faith using the Lord's Prayer,
[00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:13.140]   it's a legitimate use of scripture,
[00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:18.140]   and it happens to be used in worship service.
[00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:20.580]   That's why sometimes we do that too, right?
[00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:21.980]   A brother just remind me,
[00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:26.140]   why don't we do something like that in our worship service?
[00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:28.180]   You know, recite some of the scriptures,
[00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:31.160]   like the Lord's Prayer, and memorize it, right?
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:33.500]   Because when we memorize the Word of God,
[00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:37.780]   the Word of God will take effect in our own life, right?
[00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:42.380]   That's a great idea, and we will continue to do that, right?
[00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:43.820]   So there's confession of faith.
[00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:47.820]   There's also another aspect called vows,
[00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:50.380]   or some sort of response or a commitment
[00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:52.500]   that we make before God in worship.
[00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:56.120]   In the Old Testament and New Testament,
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:20:00.300]   we find many, many different vows or promises,
[00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:02.500]   commitments that people make to God
[00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:05.580]   to fulfill those promises.
[00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:09.160]   Don't you experience that?
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:13.220]   Sometimes you're in your spiritual walk with God.
[00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:14.900]   You pray for a certain thing,
[00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:18.260]   and then God answer your prayer,
[00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:21.860]   or God open a way for you, right?
[00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:24.060]   And you made some sort of promise to God.
[00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:27.460]   You pray a certain thing in front of God,
[00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:30.220]   and you say, "God, if you answer me,
[00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:34.700]   "if you do this for me, for your glory,
[00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:37.780]   "then I will fulfill my vow, right?
[00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:39.660]   "I will give you thanks.
[00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:42.940]   "I will give you offering," or something like that, right?
[00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:47.580]   I have done so many times in my Christian walk, right?
[00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:50.540]   God provide me, you know?
[00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:54.540]   If you answer my prayer, I will recommit myself to you,
[00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:56.620]   and that is what vow means.
[00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:59.140]   That is what commitment means.
[00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:04.460]   I remember years, years ago, I was in seminary,
[00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:07.100]   and I finished the first two terms,
[00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:09.160]   and then I ran out of money.
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:13.960]   I just didn't have money to pay for tuition,
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:15.860]   so I prayed.
[00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:22.540]   Right at that moment, I was in a really, really big struggle
[00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:25.100]   because I probably have to quit,
[00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:27.980]   have to find a job, right?
[00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:31.340]   And to save up more money so that I can pay for tuition.
[00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:33.120]   So I prayed, I prayed.
[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:37.580]   So as I prayed, and I went to prayer meeting,
[00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:39.860]   and we prayed together.
[00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:44.020]   Now I remember the following week,
[00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:45.340]   I went to a prayer meeting.
[00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:49.860]   I went to a worship service, and I came home,
[00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:54.860]   and I find a white envelope in my mailbox.
[00:21:55.860 --> 00:22:00.860]   I was kind of curious, okay, who put it there, right?
[00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:06.220]   So I grabbed the envelope, and I went to my bedroom,
[00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:10.820]   and I opened the envelope, and there was a check,
[00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:15.180]   and that check has the amount just enough
[00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:18.560]   for me to pay for the next term, right?
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:24.100]   At that moment, I fell on my knees.
[00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:26.300]   I said, "God, thank you.
[00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:30.160]   "Thank you for answering my prayer.
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:35.160]   "Thank you for accepting me because I was of little faith,
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:37.820]   "right, and God, you are the great provider,
[00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:41.580]   "and you are so faithful to me," right?
[00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:45.780]   So I fell on my knees, and I prayed, I vowed.
[00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:48.540]   You know, "If God, you are so faithful,
[00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:52.260]   "help me in my faithlessness, right?
[00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:54.560]   "Help me with my lack of trust.
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.460]   "Help me to trust in you."
[00:22:56.460 --> 00:23:01.220]   So there we go, I fulfilled my vow, right?
[00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:03.420]   In my years of ministry, there were up times,
[00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:05.980]   there were many down times.
[00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:08.580]   There are mountain tops, a few mountain tops.
[00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:12.980]   There are many valleys, but I remember this experience.
[00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:16.860]   I made a vow to God that God is faithful,
[00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:20.140]   and I need to continue to trust in him, right?
[00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:23.860]   Whether the times is good or the time is difficult.
[00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:28.340]   That should be part of our journey as well, right?
[00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:33.620]   God grant me this prayer.
[00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:36.860]   I will make a vow to you, right?
[00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:39.700]   I will recommit myself, and that's part of our worship too.
[00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:44.700]   And in the Old Testament, there was a story about Hannah,
[00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:47.340]   right, the woman who was barren.
[00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:52.340]   She didn't have any child, and she was suffering nobility.
[00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:56.340]   She was being locked down upon.
[00:23:56.340 --> 00:24:01.340]   And Hannah prayed to God in the tabernacle,
[00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:04.780]   and prayed that God grant me a child, right?
[00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:08.380]   And lo and behold, God grant her a child, Samuel.
[00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:14.260]   And the next year, she went back to the temple,
[00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:19.940]   the tabernacle, with her husband, Elkina,
[00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:23.300]   and his family, went on their annual trip
[00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:28.300]   to offer worship sacrifice to the Lord, and keep his vow.
[00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:31.140]   And there you go, vow right there.
[00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:34.180]   The vow actually is Hannah's own vow.
[00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:37.100]   So Hannah prayed to God, grant me a child.
[00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:40.940]   If you really grant me a child, I will offer this child
[00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:45.020]   for your service, for the Lord's ministry.
[00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:46.620]   And she did that.
[00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:50.940]   She brought Samuel, the boy, to the temple, or tabernacle,
[00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:55.060]   and offered Samuel as a minister to God.
[00:24:55.060 --> 00:25:00.940]   So vows and promises is part of our worship service.
[00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:07.180]   Now, we will continue this list next week.
[00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:09.300]   Preaching and teaching and sacraments,
[00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:11.540]   and we will explain what sacraments are,
[00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:13.940]   and then offerings and fellowship.
[00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:17.380]   Now, I want to close this sermon by saying,
[00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:20.180]   all of these aspects and all of these elements
[00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:22.420]   are part of legitimate worship.
[00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:27.180]   And God is pleased when His people gather
[00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:30.380]   in His presence to worship Him, right?
[00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:36.500]   Remember this, worship is about God, it's all about God.
[00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:41.100]   And worship in the Bible has two dimensions.
[00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:43.460]   The first dimension is a vertical dimension.
[00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:47.860]   We worship and we respond to what Jesus has done
[00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:49.220]   in our own lives.
[00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:52.220]   He save us for the purpose of worshiping Him.
[00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:53.980]   And that's a vertical dimension.
[00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:58.100]   And the other dimension is horizontal dimension.
[00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:03.100]   Worship is to edify, is to build up others in the community.
[00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:06.580]   Worship is not for me to have fun.
[00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:09.420]   I come here, I am present here,
[00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:12.100]   so that I can practice community.
[00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:13.980]   I can build up the body of Christ.
[00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:17.580]   I can have fellowship and share life with other people.
[00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:21.980]   And our worship can be a witness to the world outside.
[00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:23.820]   Let's remember that, right?
[00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:26.380]   We're gonna close in prayer.
[00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:28.940]   And let's pray before God.
[00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:31.140]   How can we become a better worshiper?
[00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:34.620]   All right, to glorify Him.
[00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:35.460]   Let's all pray.
[00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:39.620]   I'll give you some seconds and you can pray to God
[00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:40.540]   in silence.
[00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:46.660]   If God has led you to repent,
[00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:50.060]   ask for forgiveness.
[00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:52.180]   No, God's grace is always sufficient.
[00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:55.340]   If God is calling you to recommit,
[00:26:55.340 --> 00:27:00.180]   do so, because God is good, worthy of our worship.
[00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:04.380]   (gentle piano music)
[00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:07.460]   (gentle piano music)
[00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:22.220]   Father, thank you for being our loving God.
[00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:26.420]   Thank you for loving us so much.
[00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:30.220]   And call us into your presence,
[00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:32.620]   so that we can be your people.
[00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:35.740]   So we pray that you will help us
[00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:39.340]   to become better worshipers,
[00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:41.020]   to honor you and to glorify you.
[00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:44.540]   Forgive our shortcomings.
[00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:47.620]   Sometimes we don't prepare.
[00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:51.380]   If we don't prepare our hearts and our body
[00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:53.260]   to serve you, to worship you,
[00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:55.700]   may you forgive us
[00:27:55.700 --> 00:28:00.660]   and help us to put you as our life's pyrode.
[00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:04.140]   To worship you is to bring you glory.
[00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:08.020]   Ask your people, ask your church,
[00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:10.580]   help us as a community to worship you,
[00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:14.580]   to honor you in Christ's name we pray.
[00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:18.820]   Well, God bless, and next week we're going to learn
[00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:21.820]   how to be better worshipers, right?
[00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:23.100]   So join us next week.
[00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:23.940]   God bless.
