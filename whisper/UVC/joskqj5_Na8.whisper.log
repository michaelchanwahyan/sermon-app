[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   First, I want to record a quick and easy video for you guys
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:11.720]   This video will give you a basic idea of how to do Premiere Pro
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.220]   I will start from the beginning
[00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.420]   First, you need to import your video
[00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.980]   It's best to sort it out
[00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.020]   As you can see, I have written down all the camera
[00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.860]   Camera 1, Camera 2, Take 1, Take 2
[00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:24.900]   It will be much easier
[00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.860]   First, I will do the opening
[00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.200]   You only need one angle for the opening
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.200]   So you won't need a lot of things
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.200]   You can see the import is done
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.740]   Basically, you click and drag it to the timeline
[00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.740]   You will see it
[00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:42.740]   Like this
[00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.740]   But we have a lot of takes
[00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:45.740]   You can edit it here
[00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.740]   For example, you can play it here
[00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.220]   (There is a Christmas, there is a Christmas, it's warm)
[00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.720]   That's right
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.720]   But if you don't want to edit it here, there is another way
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.720]   Let's talk about how to edit it here
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.720]   For example, I want to do this last take
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.720]   You can put the cursor at the beginning or at the end
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.720]   You will see a red bracket
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.720]   First, press the cursor at the beginning
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.720]   You will see the video is cut when you drag it
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.720]   Like this
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.720]   Let me restore it first
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.720]   If I don't want to cut it like this
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:18.720]   What will I do?
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.720]   First, go back to this
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.720]   Press the video
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.720]   When I double click it
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.720]   You will see a small window here
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.720]   It will open a preview window
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.720]   I can play it here
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.720]   (It's so big)
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.720]   I can play it until I get to this third place
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.720]   I want that take
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.720]   (There is a Christmas, there is a Christmas, it's warm)
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.720]   This is what I want
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.720]   Let's go back
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.720]   I open a bracket here
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.720]   Mark it in
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.720]   Start from here
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.720]   (There is a Christmas)
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.720]   It's not right, move it forward a little
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.720]   Go back here
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.720]   About here
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.720]   (There is a Christmas, there is a Christmas, it's warm)
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.720]   Stop
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.720]   Then I mark in
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.720]   Can you see this? Mark in and out
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.720]   This is what I want
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.720]   First, I put the cursor at the video
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.720]   Left click, hold
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.720]   When I drag it down
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.720]   You will see
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.720]   The part I dragged is the part I bracketed just now
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.720]   Not the whole video
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.720]   This is another way you can do
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.720]   You can see the bar below
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:29.720]   Zoom in and zoom out
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.720]   This word
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.720]   You see I just cracked that video down
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.720]   Very good
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:35.720]   Usually
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.720]   If I just need one camera
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.720]   I will immediately get the audio down
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.720]   Import the audio first
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.720]   You have to organize it yourself
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.720]   Label all files
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.720]   Otherwise, it will be troublesome when you do it
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.720]   You must label it
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.720]   Because all files are photos
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.720]   The number will be very messy
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.720]   I have labeled my audio
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.720]   Audio
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.720]   Put it in
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.720]   You see my audio is also very long
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.720]   Because the audio should be so many takes
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.720]   I know it should be the third take
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.720]   So I can pull it
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.720]   Pull it to the last episode
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.720]   Okay, I need to synchronize it
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.720]   Not synchronize by myself
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.720]   Must use all programs
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.720]   So highlight both
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.720]   Right click
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.720]   Synchronize
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.720]   Must synchronize by audio
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:24.720]   When you press
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.720]   You see it lined up by itself
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:27.720]   Why is it lined up here
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.720]   Oh, that means tell me
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.720]   What happened
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.720]   I thought I got the second take
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.720]   Actually, I should have got the third take
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.720]   That means it can't line up
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:39.720]   Although I cut it
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.720]   But in fact, it can see
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.720]   In fact, the program did not delete
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.720]   It knows
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.720]   I am the whole video
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.720]   That means I did something wrong
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.720]   I actually want to get the third take
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.720]   I thought I was the third take
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.720]   So now let me do my wrong demonstration
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.720]   Okay, I actually need the third take
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.720]   Actually, if I want this part
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.720]   I will highlight both at once
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.720]   Trim
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.720]   Two videos at the same time
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.720]   This should be the third take
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:10.720]   Audio
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.720]   I play it once
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.720]   When you play
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.720]   Both tracks are on
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:16.720]   I don't want to
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.720]   I want to mute the first track
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:18.720]   I want to mute the original one
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.720]   Because I want to use the beautiful sound we recorded
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.720]   Now look at it
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.720]   Christmas is coming
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.720]   This is perfectly matched
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.720]   Because it's not manual
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.720]   Must use the program to synchronize
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.720]   When you play
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.720]   Why do you feel a little lacking
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:36.720]   Because you see
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:37.720]   The speed when I play
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.720]   It's just a quarter of the speed
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.720]   So when you play it for him
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:42.720]   There should be no problem
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.720]   But usually preview
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.720]   Don't turn it on full
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.720]   Because when you have too many running
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.720]   Your machine usually can't handle it
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.720]   And it's very slow
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:50.720]   You think things are not synchronized
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.720]   Usually I am one quarter or one eighth
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.720]   Depends on how big my video is
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.720]   Okay, the hard thing is coming
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.720]   Next step
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.720]   When you want to use multi-camera
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.720]   What to do when three cameras are doing it at the same time
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:04.720]   Do you remember every video
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.720]   We are all from three different angles
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.720]   First of all
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.720]   What to do is import this video
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.720]   I suggest you don't import all at once
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.720]   One take at a time
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.720]   So I put camera 1, camera 2
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.720]   And camera 3 take 1
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.720]   Import it first
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.720]   Then these highlights
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.720]   These cards are named
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.720]   So it doesn't have to be stuck together
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.720]   First, select them all
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.720]   Three different angles take 1
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.720]   Then right click
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:36.720]   Go to this one
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.720]   Called create multi-camera source sequence
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.720]   So what do you synchronize it by
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.720]   It must be by audio
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.720]   Then it will think about it
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.720]   Put the three videos together
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.720]   If you are lucky, it will be fine
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.720]   I have tried error message
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.720]   Maybe I can show you later
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.720]   Will also error message
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.720]   If it is an error message
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:57.720]   First, the first thing is to look at
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.720]   Will it suddenly show up here
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.720]   A called camera 2 or camera whatever
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.720]   Your take 1 but more
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.720]   Is multi-camera
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.720]   Let me see what the full name is
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.720]   See if I can show you
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.720]   Multi-camera
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.720]   If you have done this process
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.720]   A video like this is played
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:19.720]   Actually it works
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.720]   Even if it says you have a mistake
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.720]   You don't care
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.720]   First, highlight this video
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.720]   Drag down
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.720]   If you see there is a video above
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.720]   V1 is actually video
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.720]   There are videos below A1
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.720]   There are two voices
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.720]   You are already in good shape
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.720]   You have done the first part
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:41.720]   I deleted it
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.720]   Sometimes there is an error message
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:44.720]   There is this video
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.720]   There is a multi-camera video
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.720]   I drag down and only have a voice
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.720]   Only have a voice or only have a picture
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:51.720]   What do you do
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.720]   You delete it
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:53.720]   Highlight it, delete it
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:54.720]   Do it again
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.720]   I don't know why
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.720]   But it happens to me so many times
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.720]   As long as you keep doing it
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:00.720]   Make sure
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.720]   Of course, it can't synchronize that video
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:04.720]   There is a reason
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:05.720]   You highlighted the wrong video
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:06.720]   There are two videos that are not the same
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:07.720]   It can't synchronize
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:08.720]   But if you are pretty sure
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:09.720]   Double check
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:10.720]   Those three videos are the same
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:11.720]   Same video, different angle
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:12.720]   But it can synchronize
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.720]   I just keep doing it
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.720]   The second one will be take two
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.720]   Push it like this
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.720]   Take two
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:22.720]   Do it again
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.720]   Let's see if there is a failure this time
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:25.720]   I am also lucky
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:26.720]   Sometimes failure
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.720]   Say error message
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:28.720]   Sometimes
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:29.720]   Can do it
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:30.720]   Can do it
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.720]   It has a take two multi-camera
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.720]   Ah, I will do it for you right away
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.720]   Why is this one?
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.720]   If you are in this situation
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.720]   I basically delete it
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.720]   Say delete, yes
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:45.720]   I do it again
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:46.720]   Import the video
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:47.720]   Do it again
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:48.720]   Do it until it works
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:49.720]   Usually only two or three takes
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:50.720]   The worst case
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.720]   Basically, you keep importing all your videos
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.720]   Then put the audio below
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:57.720]   Synchronize
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:00.720]   This is the first step
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.720]   First look at the video
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:07.720]   I have put all the videos of the multi-camera
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.720]   So the opening is the start
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.720]   Then take one
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.720]   Take two, take three, take four
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:15.720]   See different lengths
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:16.720]   Below here
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:20.720]   I have started to put the audio
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.720]   Synchronize the audio
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.720]   It's definitely not handmade
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.720]   It's done by a machine
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:30.720]   So I continue to highlight three
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:31.720]   Actually not three videos
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.720]   It's the video and the audio
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.720]   You see it looks like three boxes of highlights
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:39.720]   But actually because the original video is with the audio
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:40.720]   Then continue to do it
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.720]   Synchronize
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:42.720]   Always like this
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:43.720]   Audio
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.720]   Then I think about it
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.720]   You see it doesn't seem to move much
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.720]   Because these two videos match very well
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.720]   The audio and the video
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.720]   But sometimes there will be a problem
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:59.720]   For example, I will put the audio of take two down now
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:02.720]   You see that sometimes our hands
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.720]   Everyone's camera and video
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:07.720]   There is a slight difference between opening and closing
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.720]   Sometimes it may not be perfectly matched
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.720]   Sometimes the audio is very long
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:14.720]   I will do a demonstration now
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:19.720]   First, if I put the videos in a seamless way
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:20.720]   Which is nice
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:21.720]   And you have to do this
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.720]   But sometimes in the early morning
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:25.720]   If the audio is not synced with it
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.720]   You will find that this happens
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:31.720]   First, I will put the audio and video of take two
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:32.720]   Line up
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:33.720]   Synchronize
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.720]   Because when it is synchronized
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.720]   It usually puts
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:38.720]   See
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:41.720]   The video will move around to adjust the audio
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:45.720]   I don't know if it has anything to do with the order of highlights
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:49.720]   But you will see when they want to align something
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.720]   It will move the video
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:55.720]   When you see it move to the right
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.720]   It will actually eat into the next video
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:01.720]   So these are things you don't want to see
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.720]   It won't push the video below
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.720]   It overlaps and eats it
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.720]   So first, press Ctrl + C to undo
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:14.720]   So don't usually line up the videos so quickly
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.720]   Leave a line in the middle
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.720]   In case they will move around
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.720]   Shift to the next video
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.720]   Yes
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:26.720]   After that, you can line up
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:27.720]   How to line up?
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.720]   I will zoom in for you to see
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:32.720]   Usually, there is no problem if the audio is not lined up below
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.720]   I basically want the video to line up
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:36.720]   So you drag it over
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:40.720]   Make sure the video is seamlessly lined up
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:41.720]   If they are usually seamless
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:44.720]   You will see a triangle here
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:48.720]   That means it is perfect when it is pinned together
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.720]   But if you eat it like this
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.720]   You will see a triangle on one side
[00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:54.720]   Not two sides
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.720]   That means you ate into another video
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.720]   So when you drag it down, you have to touch it
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.720]   Oops, wait a minute
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:02.720]   I forgot to highlight
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:03.720]   You see
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:06.720]   Make sure to highlight the three videos together
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:09.720]   Otherwise, you just move the top
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:10.720]   There is also a way
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:11.720]   If you want to group them together
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.720]   You group
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:14.720]   Here
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.720]   You move it, everyone moves together
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:17.720]   No problem
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:18.720]   But sometimes you remember
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.720]   When you want to highlight the video
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:21.720]   Ungroup it
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.720]   Otherwise, you move it all
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:24.720]   Move the audio
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.720]   Okay, let's continue
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.720]   The other two videos are the same
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:31.720]   After synchronizing it
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.720]   Line up
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:34.720]   You see me
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.720]   I'll do it for you quickly
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.720]   OK
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.720]   Drag it over
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.720]   Make sure the video is lined up
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.720]   Do the last one
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:47.720]   Take 4
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:48.720]   You see
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.720]   Actually before you officially add the video
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:52.720]   Actually there are a lot of these
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:53.720]   Line up
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:54.720]   Synchronize
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.720]   A lot of trimming work
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:59.720]   Have to do it first
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:00.720]   OK
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.720]   Synchronized
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:03.720]   Also all lined up
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.720]   So you can
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:08.720]   Start your first step
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.720]   If you are clear-headed
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:14.720]   You will see that our videos have different colors
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:15.720]   If you remember
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.720]   When we opened
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:18.720]   We said
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:19.720]   This
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:20.720]   Opening camera 2
[00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.720]   Used one camera
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.720]   So you see the video is blue
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:26.720]   And the other ones are green
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.720]   That is multi-camera
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:29.720]   Then
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:32.720]   You will see why it seems so random
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:33.720]   The first video is written Cam3
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.720]   The second video is written Cam2
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:36.720]   This one
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:39.720]   Highlight them with you
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:42.720]   What do I want to say
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:43.720]   Highlight them with you
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:46.720]   There is a difference when doing multi-camera
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:47.720]   I didn't remember
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:48.720]   When you highlight the first one
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:49.720]   When you click the first video
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.720]   It will take that angle
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.720]   Actually this is not important
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.720]   How to change the angle is the most important
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:57.720]   So everyone
[00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:58.720]   Need to know a button
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:12:59.720]   Is this
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:02.720]   There is a row of buttons under this big light
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.720]   You guys slowly familiarize yourself with how to use it
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:05.720]   Basically
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.720]   This is the marker
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:08.720]   This is Mark In
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:09.720]   Mark Out
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:10.720]   This color
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:11.720]   This Shift to In
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:12.720]   I rarely use
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:13.720]   This is
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:15.720]   Backtrack 1 frame
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:16.720]   This is Play
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:18.720]   This is Forward 1 frame
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:19.720]   This is Go To Out
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.720]   Go to Mark In, Mark Out
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.720]   I rarely use
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.720]   I don't know how to use these
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:27.720]   Export Frame
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:29.720]   Sometimes you can take a screenshot
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:30.720]   You can use this button
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.720]   Comparison View
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:33.720]   I don't seem to have used
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.720]   This button is what I want you to know
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.720]   This is called Taggle Multi-Camera View
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:38.720]   You can say
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.720]   I don't have it
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:41.720]   Why can't I find it
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:42.720]   It doesn't matter
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.720]   You go to the plus sign next to this
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.720]   There are actually many hidden buttons inside
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.720]   You haven't used it
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.720]   Maybe your button hasn't appeared yet
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.720]   So you can find the button you want to use
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.720]   For example, I drag one out
[00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:56.720]   This one
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.720]   You press it and then drag it down
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.720]   You can put it in this Toolbox
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:02.720]   Then click OK
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.720]   Then you can do it
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.720]   But I don't want this
[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:06.720]   I'll cancel it
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:07.720]   This is very important
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:09.720]   I'll press it down for you to see
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:11.720]   After pressing
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:12.720]   My machine is a bit slow
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:14.720]   So I just saw it flashed
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:15.720]   It's called Media Blending
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.720]   Your machine is fast, it's okay
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:20.720]   There will be more cameras
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:21.720]   How do you see it
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:23.720]   First of all, it's the same as this icon
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:24.720]   The big camera is on this side
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:28.720]   The one on the right is the angle your audience sees
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:31.720]   So now the audience sees this video
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.720]   It will be in this camera 3
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.720]   Anyway, camera 1, 2, 3
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:36.720]   You label it yourself
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.720]   I have my own system
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:42.720]   Usually the camera closest to Mark Chan
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:46.720]   The so-called left-hand side of our audience
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:47.720]   Mark Chan's side
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.720]   Camera 1
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:51.720]   The front one is called Camera 2
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:54.720]   On the right side of our audience
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:55.720]   Camera 3
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:56.720]   I usually label it like this
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:57.720]   If you have your own system
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.720]   That's okay too
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:03.720]   Now the audience is watching in Camera 3
[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.720]   You see here
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:07.720]   I divided it into smaller sections
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:08.720]   There are 1, 2, 3, 3 sections
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.720]   Because I only have 3 cameras
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:12.720]   I haven't tried it yet
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:13.720]   But I absolutely believe
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:14.720]   If you have 4 cameras
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.720]   Then there will be 1, 2, 3, 4 fill-ups
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:18.720]   If you have 5, then it will continue to split
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:19.720]   The computer also tells you
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:22.720]   You are watching in Camera 3
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.720]   You are using the camera 3 angle
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:26.720]   So it highlights the yellow box
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:31.720]   So the left side of this screen
[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:32.720]   Just to let you know
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.720]   How many camera angles are there in this video
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:35.720]   We have 3
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:37.720]   But the big box on the right
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:40.720]   Is the angle that the audience is watching
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.720]   Why do you have to watch this
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:45.720]   Why do you have to know the split
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:46.720]   It's very important
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:47.720]   Because it will be very confusing later
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:48.720]   So everyone listen
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:49.720]   OK
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.720]   When I was watching this video
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.720]   I was watching and playing
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:58.720]   Play very slowly
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:02.720]   Because if your machine
[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:04.720]   Is not that fast
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.720]   Actually doing this editing
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:07.720]   Is quite difficult
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:09.720]   Because it will keep splitting
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:11.720]   So I usually do it
[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:14.720]   I will flip it
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:15.720]   I will turn it off
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:17.720]   Because it wastes a lot of memory
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.720]   When I usually watch the preview
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:21.720]   I will keep playing
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:28.720]   For example, I think I want to change the angle
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:29.720]   What should I do
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:33.720]   I will press this button
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:34.720]   Waiting again
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:35.720]   Yes
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:36.720]   There are two ways
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.720]   If your machine is playing fast
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:41.720]   I will set it to 1/8 or 1/16
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:42.720]   This is very important
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.720]   Especially because the more you open
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:45.720]   The slower it plays
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:47.720]   I have the 1/16 option
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:48.720]   Use it
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.720]   The screen seems to be very blurry
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:51.720]   But that's ok
[00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:53.720]   Because you are using 1/16 to watch
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:55.720]   Two ways to edit
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:58.720]   The first is to watch and edit
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:16:59.720]   When you keep watching
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:01.720]   The bar will move
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.720]   You can see a gap here
[00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:06.720]   You won't see any editing
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.720]   Until you call the machine to stop
[00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:14.720]   You keep watching and editing
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:17.720]   The clips will be made for you to see
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:18.720]   What is right for me
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:20.720]   You watch me do it now
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:23.720]   First, if you keep watching and editing
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.720]   First, you must press the play button
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.720]   While you are watching
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:30.720]   The machine is talking
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:31.720]   It is very slow
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:33.720]   It should be moving
[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:37.720]   For example, I want to change the angle
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:38.720]   I will change to full screen
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:39.720]   You press this button
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:40.720]   Full screen
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:41.720]   Press
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:44.720]   It seems nothing happened
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.720]   You can see the screen has changed
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.720]   Keep watching
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:52.720]   For example, I want to change the angle
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:54.720]   I will change to Mark Chang's angle 1
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.720]   Press this button
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:58.720]   Camera 1
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.720]   Then
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:01.720]   It is working
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:02.720]   You can see it is not working
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:03.720]   It is working
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.720]   It will remember what you want to cut
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:07.720]   I have some delay
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:08.720]   You can see it has changed
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:09.720]   Ok
[00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:11.720]   For example, I want to stop here
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:12.720]   Stop
[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:13.720]   You can see
[00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:16.720]   It is not cut yet
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.720]   Now
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.720]   After I stop
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.720]   The program will remember
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:25.720]   When I changed the angle
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:27.720]   It will cut the scene
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:28.720]   So
[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:29.720]   Let me see
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.720]   I need to go back
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:32.720]   My machine is too slow
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:34.720]   It is hard to play
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.720]   While I am watching
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:38.720]   While I am editing
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:40.720]   It will help me change the angle
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:46.720]   (Laughter)
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:47.720]   It has changed the angle
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.720]   It will help me change the angle
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:52.720]   My machine is too slow
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:54.720]   It has delayed
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:57.720]   (Background noise)
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:58.720]   It will change the angle
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:18:59.720]   Next
[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:01.720]   I will change to Mark Chang's angle
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:02.720]   It will change
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:03.720]   So
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:06.720]   This is a fast way to do
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:07.720]   Not fast
[00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:08.720]   It is called
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:10.720]   When you are watching the video
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:11.720]   You can cut
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:12.720]   For example, I am watching here
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:13.720]   Mark Chang suddenly said something
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:15.720]   I zoom to Mark Chang's side
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:16.720]   Look at Mark Chang
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:17.720]   It will be very smooth
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:19.720]   Very beautiful
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:21.720]   This is one of the ways
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.720]   The second way
[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.720]   Is manual
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:26.720]   Not playing
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:27.720]   It is
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.720]   When you decide to stop
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:32.720]   You can use the razor blade to cut
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:36.720]   I delete what I did
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:37.720]   Now the video is beautiful
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:38.720]   I didn't cut
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.720]   The way to save memory
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:44.720]   Don't use the multi-angle
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:45.720]   Just play
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:46.720]   (Laughter)
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:47.720]   Just play
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:49.720]   Okay, everyone is happy
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:52.720]   I decide to cut here
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:54.720]   You divide the video into two parts
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:56.720]   The first part is still angle 3
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:58.720]   But I want to start from here
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:19:59.720]   Go to the front
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:01.720]   Because I want to see everyone laughing
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:02.720]   So
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.720]   I will open this button
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:05.720]   Here
[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:06.720]   Manual
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.720]   Press camera 2
[00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:11.720]   You see this video
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:12.720]   Immediately change to camera 2
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.720]   The whole video will change
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:17.720]   Then you continue to go down
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:18.720]   Go down to this point
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.720]   I want to go back to the second camera
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.720]   So you manually cut it
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:24.720]   So from this video
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:28.720]   You want to change the angle of the new video
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.720]   Then the video will turn back to camera 3
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:31.720]   See it changed immediately
[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:33.720]   This is manual
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:36.720]   Both ways are fine
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:38.720]   Your machine is fast
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:40.720]   You just watch and cut
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:41.720]   If your machine is slow
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:42.720]   Just like me
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:43.720]   Turn around and cut
[00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:45.720]   Not much difference
[00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:47.720]   It will be easier if you are familiar with it
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:49.720]   But what I want to say is
[00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:51.720]   First of all, I regret it
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:52.720]   After I did it
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:54.720]   I found that this video should not be camera 2
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:55.720]   What should I do?
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:57.720]   It's very simple, right?
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.720]   Go back to this multi-camera setting
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:00.720]   Just change
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:02.720]   Basically, the angle has been changed
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.720]   Anyway, you have to make sure
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:05.720]   When you change
[00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:06.720]   You highlight the video
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:07.720]   Don't highlight the other video
[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:09.720]   You highlight the other video
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:10.720]   You press it
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:11.720]   When you find it doesn't work
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:12.720]   Because you highlighted it wrong
[00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:13.720]   You have to highlight the other video
[00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:16.720]   This is one of the ways to change the angle
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:17.720]   Very easy
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:18.720]   But another thing is
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.720]   Oh, I think this video
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:23.720]   Stay at camera 3
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:25.720]   This angle is too long
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:27.720]   Actually, I should have changed earlier
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:28.720]   Change earlier
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:29.720]   Let's say
[00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:31.720]   For example, my next video is camera 2
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:33.720]   Change it first
[00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:37.720]   Usually my machine is slow
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:38.720]   Just like this
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:39.720]   Okay, now you see
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:40.720]   This video is camera 2
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.720]   This video is camera 3
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:43.720]   Camera 2
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:46.720]   I found that I have to change to camera 2 earlier
[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:47.720]   This video is too long
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:48.720]   What should I do?
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.720]   This is the third trick
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.720]   You see
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:54.720]   The so-called clip trick
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:57.720]   The first is red, right?
[00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.720]   Just shorten the video
[00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:00.720]   But leave a gap
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:02.720]   This red bracket
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:04.720]   Can only be used at the beginning or end of the video
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.720]   If you are in the middle of the video
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:07.720]   Remember which button to press
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:10.720]   Just put the mouse here
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:13.720]   Press ctrl to make it yellow, right?
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:15.720]   Then drag it
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:18.720]   The video will be seamless
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.720]   There will be no gap
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.720]   But what's the problem here?
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:25.720]   It will make the video shorter
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:27.720]   Your neck is not beautiful
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:29.720]   Ctrl + Z to come out
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:32.720]   How to shorten this video
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:35.720]   That is, the time of camera 3 is shortened
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:38.720]   To change to camera 2
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:39.720]   The time of camera 3 is shortened
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:40.720]   To change to camera 2
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:43.720]   First put the red bracket in the middle
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:44.720]   Not in the middle
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:46.720]   Put it in the middle of the two videos
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:47.720]   When you press ctrl
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:49.720]   You see this is a new button
[00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:50.720]   You have never seen
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.720]   This has two arrow buttons
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:55.720]   Then you press the left button to hold it
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.720]   Then you shift it
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:01.720]   The advantage of this button is that the length of the video will not change
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:07.720]   What you change is to shorten the time of the camera
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:10.720]   I usually use this
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:14.720]   If I find that the length of the video is too long
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:15.720]   I want to adjust
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:16.720]   I don't want to affect other things
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:19.720]   I will use this button
[00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:23.720]   You see the video won't change
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:25.720]   It just changes the angle
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:40.720]   This is how I change the angle
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:42.720]   And adjust the length
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:45.720]   That's about it
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:50.720]   In the next video, I will continue to talk about how to trim
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:54.720]   Because I usually don't do camera
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:56.720]   This is just a demonstration
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:59.720]   I won't change the camera angle
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:03.720]   After synchronizing the video and audio
[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:07.720]   I first trim the unwanted things
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:10.720]   So the correct order is
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:16.720]   Remember the first time I imported the video
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.720]   The video has to be multi-camera
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:21.720]   Then put the beautiful audio in
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:23.720]   Synchronize the audio
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:26.720]   After everything is in sync
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:28.720]   What you have to do is start watching the video
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:31.720]   Then you see something that doesn't fit
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:34.720]   Or some jokes, just cut it
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:35.720]   How to cut
[00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:38.720]   I usually put a bookmark here
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:42.720]   Because the bookmark may not want to cut off
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:43.720]   I still think about some things
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:44.720]   Maybe cut off
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:45.720]   Maybe not cut off
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:48.720]   Some of course, the NG points must be cut off at the first time
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:52.720]   But some may be the topic or the sentences are not good
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:53.720]   I don't know if it will cut off
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:55.720]   I will use the above marker
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:57.720]   Mark where it is
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:01.720]   Then cut them
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:06.720]   The first video should have talked about the basics
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.720]   I won't talk about it anymore
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:11.720]   But there are some tricks that I want to tell you
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.720]   Re-tune
[00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:14.720]   Talk later
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:18.720]   Give you a little more example
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:19.720]   See how I cut
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:21.720]   For example, I am here now
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:24.720]   I found a place to stop
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:25.720]   How to do it
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:27.720]   I will play it for you to see
[00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:38.720]   I found that I can stop here
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.720]   I added a bookmark
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:41.720]   Actually, it's the above
[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:42.720]   Add bookmark
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:46.720]   I found that the middle paragraph can be cut
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.720]   I added a bookmark
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:50.720]   Usually, after adding a bookmark
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:51.720]   You press it
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:52.720]   It will line up
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.720]   Then I will use the razor blade to cut
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:55.720]   I just happened to
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:58.720]   Because we remember that our machine failed
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:02.720]   So I will have a video
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:04.720]   I have a beautiful soundtrack
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:06.720]   Then add MP3
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:08.720]   So I have two soundtracks now
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:09.720]   One video
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:12.720]   And I zoom in for you to see
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:15.720]   Actually, the soundtrack that follows this video is here
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:16.720]   But I don't want to see it
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:17.720]   I just pulled it up
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:22.720]   Then cut it
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.720]   Then you can do it
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:26.720]   Put it back in your marker
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.720]   Do the same thing again
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.720]   Usually if you are in the words
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:31.720]   In the words
[00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:32.720]   These questions
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:34.720]   I usually zoom in a little
[00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:35.720]   Make sure I cut it beautifully
[00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:37.720]   Use the razor blade to cut
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:38.720]   Cut
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:39.720]   Cut
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:40.720]   Cut it all
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.720]   Cut all I want
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:44.720]   Video and those two sound clips
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:46.720]   Remember to go back to Arrow
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:47.720]   Choose your tools
[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:48.720]   There are two ways
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:51.720]   First, I decided not to do this kind of thing in the middle
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:52.720]   Highlight it all
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:54.720]   Remember not to press delete immediately
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:55.720]   You press delete
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:56.720]   There will be a big gap
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:57.720]   Like just now
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:59.720]   You have to drag all the
[00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:00.720]   Pull it all back
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:01.720]   Very troublesome
[00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:02.720]   So how to do it
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:03.720]   If you delete
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:05.720]   I press Ctrl + C
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:07.720]   Remember to highlight
[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:09.720]   What trick to do this time
[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:10.720]   Just press Shift
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:12.720]   Then delete
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:13.720]   See it
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:14.720]   The middle piece
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:15.720]   Delete all
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:17.720]   But all below
[00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:18.720]   Will automatically line up
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:20.720]   That's one of the ways
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:21.720]   it is good
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:22.720]   There is another way
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:23.720]   Just
[00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:25.720]   I
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:26.720]   I will press Ctrl first
[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:28.720]   I just cut one side
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:30.720]   Although these two sections in the middle
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:31.720]   Now we are cracking this section
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:32.720]   Is what I don't want
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.720]   I just need to cut one side
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:35.720]   How to do it
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:36.720]   After cutting
[00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:40.720]   I cut that side
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:41.720]   Then now put this
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:42.720]   Line up
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:45.720]   I want to go to
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:46.720]   We just said we want to go to this place
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:48.720]   Don't want the middle piece
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:49.720]   Highlight
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:51.720]   Remember I have a trick
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:53.720]   Put an arrow here
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:54.720]   Then press Ctrl
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:57.720]   Then I pull it
[00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:59.720]   Pull it to the place I want to stop
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:00.720]   Let go
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:01.720]   Same reason
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:03.720]   You can do the same effect
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:05.720]   Just don't want the middle piece
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:06.720]   Instead of
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:08.720]   Cut two pieces like cutting a cake
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:09.720]   Delete the middle one
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:10.720]   I just cut one side
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:13.720]   Then pull the whole video
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:15.720]   Pull it to the place I want to let go
[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:16.720]   But remember
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:18.720]   After you make these adjustments
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:19.720]   The markers above
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:21.720]   Will all move
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:22.720]   So
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:24.720]   How do I delete these markers
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:26.720]   Go to the marker
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:27.720]   Right click
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:28.720]   You will see
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:30.720]   Clear all markers
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:31.720]   You can clear it all
[00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:33.720]   So usually these markers
[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:34.720]   I do a paragraph
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:35.720]   Then do it all
[00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:37.720]   I have to delete it all
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:38.720]   Clear it all
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:39.720]   Otherwise I will be very lucky
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:41.720]   Sometimes in the middle of these cuts
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:42.720]   You will feel
[00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:44.720]   Coincidentally, their positions are different
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:45.720]   Will it be very awkward
[00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:46.720]   Actually, you see my usual videos
[00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:48.720]   Sometimes it will jump
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.720]   But how to make the jump smoother
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:52.720]   Is in the middle of these jumps
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:54.720]   Remember we can change the camera angle
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:56.720]   When you do this
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:59.720]   The jump will be less obvious
[00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:01.720]   And you will feel like
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:03.720]   You seem to be suddenly focusing on talking
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:04.720]   Talking about angles
[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:05.720]   For example, Mark Sir said
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:07.720]   He will talk a lot in the middle
[00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:09.720]   I decided to jump the angle
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:11.720]   When you play this video
[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:13.720]   It will be very smooth
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:14.720]   Because you seem to be
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:16.720]   I changed the angle to focus on
[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:17.720]   The person talking
[00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:19.720]   People will not notice
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:21.720]   You are jumping
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:23.720]   Not so obvious
[00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:31.720]   Is it like a lot better
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:32.720]   So usually
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:34.720]   First make a video
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:35.720]   How to do it
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:37.720]   Remember I just told you
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:39.720]   Line up all the audio to video
[00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:42.720]   After that, don't care about the angle
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:43.720]   Don't do anything
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:45.720]   Angle is basically done at the end
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:47.720]   Just watch the video all the time
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:48.720]   Put some bookmarks
[00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:50.720]   Where do you think you should cut
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:51.720]   Where not to cut
[00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:52.720]   How
[00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:53.720]   Usually watched
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:54.720]   About two minutes
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:55.720]   Or if you feel very smooth
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:56.720]   Continue to watch
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:57.720]   After a few minutes
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:58.720]   You put all the bookmarks
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:29:59.720]   Just go back
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:01.720]   Do your cutting things
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:02.720]   After cutting
[00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:04.720]   When you cut the whole video
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:05.720]   What will you find
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:08.720]   I found that the sound will be loud and quiet
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:09.720]   For example
[00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:11.720]   If you can watch Peaks
[00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:13.720]   You will know how to watch Peaks
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:14.720]   You will see
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:15.720]   Here
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:17.720]   Is a little quieter
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:19.720]   But when everyone suddenly gets up
[00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:20.720]   It will be very noisy
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:22.720]   Wow, what should I do?
[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:24.720]   There is a way
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:25.720]   First is
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:26.720]   For example
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:28.720]   I found this video
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:29.720]   When someone is talking
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:30.720]   Very quiet
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:31.720]   This paragraph
[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:32.720]   Crack it up
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:34.720]   Now you cut the sound
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:35.720]   After
[00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:37.720]   You just control this paragraph
[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:39.720]   For example, maybe Cindy is talking
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:40.720]   Maybe Leo is talking
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:41.720]   Very quiet
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:42.720]   Click on this video
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:44.720]   Then right click
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:46.720]   Go to Audio Gain
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:48.720]   It will ask you
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:49.720]   How much gain
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:50.720]   Here is actually gain and reduction
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:51.720]   Add and subtract can also be
[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:52.720]   Now it is too quiet
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:54.720]   So I want it louder
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:55.720]   So you are positive number
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.720]   I usually start with 5
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:58.720]   You will see
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:00.720]   These peaks suddenly got higher
[00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:02.720]   Or I do it again for you to see
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:03.720]   Exaggerated
[00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:05.720]   You can see the difference
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:09.720]   First do 10
[00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:10.720]   Or 15
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:11.720]   Press
[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:12.720]   You see the peak is much bigger
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:14.720]   Just adjust like this
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:17.720]   First do this adjustment
[00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:18.720]   Because this adjustment
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:20.720]   There won't be so much echo
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:21.720]   But if you say
[00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:25.720]   I still want to be higher
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:26.720]   There is another way
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:28.720]   When you click the video
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:29.720]   You will see
[00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:31.720]   The effect control here
[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:32.720]   Will come out
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:34.720]   Change levels
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:37.720]   This can also change the volume
[00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:39.720]   But somehow this volume
[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:40.720]   Change
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:42.720]   It will be a little different from the control gain
[00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:44.720]   You have to play around
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:46.720]   Usually if I want to change the overall
[00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:47.720]   Change the sound
[00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:48.720]   Add a little
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:50.720]   I will use control gain
[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:54.720]   I found that the echo is not so strong
[00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:56.720]   If you just do level
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:58.720]   For example, from 0 to 15
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:00.720]   Usually the sound will be worse
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:04.720]   This is how you can control the volume
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:06.720]   But specifically sometimes
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:08.720]   For example, someone said a sentence
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:10.720]   Suddenly it's very explosive
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:12.720]   I can also change
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:13.720]   Change levels
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:15.720]   I will talk about this later
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:17.720]   Basically it's like this
[00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:19.720]   Do the whole video
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:21.720]   Cut all the boring details
[00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:23.720]   After that, listen again
[00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:26.720]   Make sure all the sounds are consistent
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:28.720]   If it's too loud, adjust it
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:30.720]   After adjusting all the sounds
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:33.720]   Then go back to the last angle
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:35.720]   Because by the time you cut the video
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:37.720]   You will find that this video
[00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:39.720]   Has been cut countless times
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:41.720]   Then you slowly adjust the angle
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:44.720]   Sometimes it will jump to Mark Chan's angle
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:46.720]   Sometimes jump to Hale's side angle
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:48.720]   Sometimes go back to the middle angle
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:49.720]   That's about it
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:51.720]   The order is always doing camera angle
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:53.720]   Do the last last
[00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:55.720]   Will do this step
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:57.720]   That's all for now.
