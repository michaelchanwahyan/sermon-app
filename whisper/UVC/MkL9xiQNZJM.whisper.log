[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.080]   Let's welcome him.
[00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:04.240]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.700]   - Hello, hi everybody.
[00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.720]   Thank you, Pastor Mark, for praying,
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.220]   and thank you, James, for leading worship.
[00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.220]   Fun fact, I texted James this morning
[00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:15.420]   to see what he was wearing
[00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.560]   so that we could make sure we were matching.
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.120]   (laughing)
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.660]   That's not true, we just have a similar fashion sense.
[00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.340]   (laughing)
[00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.240]   Thank you both.
[00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.080]   So today, I wanna talk about the Book of Jonah,
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.240]   but before we do that, I wanna tell you guys a story.
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.920]   This is a story that I haven't really told before.
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.140]   It's been something that happened
[00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.000]   and was decently significant in my life for a while,
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.600]   but I didn't really see it as something
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.860]   that was timely or necessary at the time.
[00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.440]   But I think the themes of this story fit really well
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.120]   with the themes of the Book of Jonah,
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.580]   so I'm bringing it out today.
[00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:06.280]   I want you to think back to about a year and a half ago.
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.440]   This would be right as Chicago is getting out
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.680]   of our state-mandated lockdown, right?
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.880]   We're all kind of trying to figure out
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.980]   how to do this post-pandemic world,
[00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.840]   even though it was still mostly in the pandemic,
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.140]   and we're trying to figure out how to continue to function
[00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.560]   even though this virus is spreading.
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.040]   And we've been locked up for two and a half months.
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.320]   Things are kind of tense, right?
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.220]   And then, right as quarantines are lifting,
[00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.120]   the killing of George Floyd is basically televised
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.880]   and thrown everywhere online, and protests erupt.
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.240]   Peaceful marches are everywhere over our city.
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.520]   It was kind of a hectic time.
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.080]   Not only were we living through a massive worldwide pandemic
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.020]   like once in every hundred years,
[00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.720]   but we're also experiencing crazy amounts of social unrest
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.800]   and calls for new things to happen
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.240]   to bring justice about in our country.
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.580]   It was a bit of a crazy time.
[00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.300]   Now, for those of you who don't know,
[00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.900]   I am a photographer, kind of.
[00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.060]   I get to do part of that for my job,
[00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.560]   and I also get to do it on the side.
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.440]   So I love taking photos of cool places in Chicago.
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.240]   I love taking photos of cool places when I travel,
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.240]   and I also really enjoy taking photos of worldwide events.
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.780]   So I loved it when the Cubs won the World Series
[00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.440]   because I got to go, and I got to take photos
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.980]   of entire crowds at Wrigleyville
[00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.260]   just celebrating and getting excited.
[00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.180]   I loved it when the pandemic happened
[00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.980]   because I got to take really stark photos of empty shelves,
[00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.920]   no toilet paper in sight.
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:44.760]   It was great.
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.020]   It's like a photographer's dream
[00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.020]   to live through these kinds of world-changing events, right?
[00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.460]   So when all these protests started happening,
[00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.580]   when these marches began happening,
[00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.460]   I'm like, "I gotta be there.
[00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:58.560]   "I'm a photographer.
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.800]   "I can't one day teach my kid how to use a camera
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.500]   "and then not have photos
[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.660]   "of some of the most significant historical events
[00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.540]   "that I've lived through."
[00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.700]   So I went.
[00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.540]   I went to different protests
[00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.900]   that were happening around the city.
[00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.660]   I documented it, and I took photos,
[00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.940]   and I partook in those.
[00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.780]   I even accidentally came across
[00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.200]   some of the looting that was happening,
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.140]   and I documented that a little bit,
[00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.380]   although a little more scared.
[00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.420]   And then what ended up happening next
[00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.260]   was quite possibly, quite possibly
[00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.900]   the worst experience I've ever had
[00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.400]   trying to photograph anything
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.020]   because in addition to protests that were peaceful
[00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.780]   and marches put on by churches
[00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.840]   and different organizations and groups,
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.840]   there was also a lot of panic and fear in our neighborhoods.
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.460]   And that's what I stumbled on one night.
[00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.060]   Sammy and I, my wife, were coming home from Carbone,
[00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.740]   which is the best hidden gem in Chicago.
[00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:57.980]   It's right by Riccobini's,
[00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.100]   and it is so much better than Riccobini's,
[00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.540]   so if you're ever in town, go there.
[00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:03.720]   It is the best.
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.420]   So we were coming back from that,
[00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.580]   and we were driving on 31st and Princeton,
[00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.220]   and we noticed at this intersection
[00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.340]   was a massive crowd of people, like massive.
[00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.320]   I'm talking 40 to 50 people,
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.660]   and remember, we've just come out of lockdown,
[00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.500]   so this is not normal, right?
[00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.420]   What is this massive crowd doing?
[00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.380]   And we finally drive through, and we get through,
[00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.620]   and we notice along our street
[00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.780]   there's a bunch of people sitting outside
[00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.920]   of their doorsteps, people sitting on lawn chairs
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.880]   right in front of their buildings.
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.420]   People are kind of alert and waiting.
[00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:46.780]   So we find out that apparently
[00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.080]   one of the very peacefully planned protests
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.260]   was going to walk through just a corner of our neighborhood,
[00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.700]   just a tiny spot of our neighborhood.
[00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.980]   And the place where we live just erupted.
[00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.340]   People were not okay.
[00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.640]   That crowd, they were walking around with baseball bats,
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.920]   crowbars, table legs that they had unscrewed
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:12.920]   from their table.
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.120]   I even saw a machete.
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.720]   There were people sitting outside their buildings
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.880]   with pistols.
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.000]   I even saw somebody with an AK.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.480]   I am not kidding, a semi-automatic weapon.
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.860]   So being the genius that I am,
[00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.960]   and against the wishes of my much smarter wife,
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.960]   I decide I'm gonna go take photos of this.
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.380]   How often do you see somebody walking along a street
[00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.300]   right next to a police officer with a pistol
[00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.260]   or a freaking machete?
[00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.820]   Not very often.
[00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.200]   So I take my camera and I go out, I go down our street,
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.640]   and it's tense.
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.020]   It's, well, not yet.
[00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:54.660]   It's not actually yet tense.
[00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.380]   Right now it's pretty light.
[00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.700]   I get up there and it's by Franco's Restaurant
[00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.980]   and everybody is having a good time.
[00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.100]   They're joking with each other.
[00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.040]   They're showing off the table legs or the crowbars
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.220]   or whatever random assortment of weapons
[00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.580]   they decided to bring to this little gathering.
[00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.040]   Oh, it's a little insane.
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.400]   And they're all drinking too.
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.700]   They're in this group and they have,
[00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.060]   like some of them have crowbars in one hand
[00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.600]   and beer in the other.
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.540]   And it's getting to them.
[00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.000]   So I'm a little anxious about this.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.120]   So I make sure to do all the best practices.
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.500]   I say, "Hey, I'm just a photographer.
[00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.140]   "I've been photographing everything that's happening
[00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.140]   "from the pandemic to the protests.
[00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:38.560]   "Just so you know, I'll be taking photos.
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.760]   "If you don't want me to take your photo,
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:40.820]   "just let me know."
[00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.940]   And I get a lot of people saying, "Yeah, you're fine."
[00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:43.780]   And then some people saying,
[00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:44.900]   "I'd prefer not to be in photos."
[00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:45.740]   I'm like, "Okay."
[00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.660]   And then we hear a noise.
[00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:56.120]   And two young kids, I'm talking 10 and 13, tops,
[00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:59.440]   ride their bikes past our crowd.
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:04.320]   And two of the guys in the crowd
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.240]   throw their beer bottles at these kids
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.740]   and yell, "We don't want you in our neighborhood."
[00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:15.800]   Everything just shifted in a moment.
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.940]   The tone just took a 180.
[00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:24.720]   And suddenly, things were not jovial anymore.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.340]   People weren't messing around.
[00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:29.860]   There was this weird macho and this weird,
[00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:33.720]   almost like desire for violence
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:38.720]   or desire for letting out their aggression in this crowd.
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.120]   It shifted massively.
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.300]   And in that moment, some of the people
[00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:49.440]   who were a little more under the influence turned around
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.520]   and they pointed their weapons at me and they said,
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.380]   "You can't have that here.
[00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:54.580]   "You need to get out of here.
[00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:57.020]   "Some of these people have city jobs, man.
[00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:59.920]   "They don't want me taking photos of them
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:03.060]   "doing illegal and terrible things."
[00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:06.680]   So I sense it and I try to push back,
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.460]   like, "Hey, it's public space," but they're not having it.
[00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:11.080]   So I start to turn around
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.680]   and I don't wanna walk directly home
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.840]   because I'm only one and a half blocks away
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.060]   from where I live.
[00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:17.820]   So I walk the other direction
[00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:20.880]   and two of the guys start following me.
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.960]   My genius mind was like,
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.480]   "I should get the memory card out of my camera."
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.720]   So I do that and that's what I'm thinking of.
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.360]   And I'm thinking, "I need to find a safe spot."
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:31.520]   I see a streetlight off to the corner
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.800]   and I head there thinking,
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.980]   "Surely no one's gonna mess with me
[00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:38.060]   "in broad streetlight 'cause it's dark at this point."
[00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:42.120]   So I get there and the two guys show up
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.340]   and there's a group of people
[00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:45.320]   kind of hanging around that streetlight
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.540]   and they all form a circle.
[00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:52.540]   And out of the home by that corner comes this older guy.
[00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.500]   And if you've ever seen a mafia movie
[00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:57.720]   and you think of like that old mob boss,
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.740]   that's the image of this guy.
[00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:03.580]   About yay high, balding head, combed over.
[00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:05.220]   Like I don't think he had a cigar,
[00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:08.240]   but if he did, it would have made perfect sense.
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:11.580]   So he comes out, he's in his white shirt with his overalls
[00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:13.900]   and he decides to be the one
[00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:16.380]   to take the charge questioning me.
[00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:19.980]   And on his shoulder is a sawed off shotgun.
[00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:21.820]   So this whole crowd surrounds me
[00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:24.820]   and starts asking me questions about where am I from?
[00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:26.300]   Am I actually in this neighborhood?
[00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:27.340]   Do I live here?
[00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:28.820]   What, let me see your driver's license.
[00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:31.540]   Prove that you're not from somewhere else in the city
[00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:34.060]   and you're not trying to like screw us over.
[00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:35.540]   These guys start getting intense.
[00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:37.180]   They start yelling at me.
[00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:40.740]   I'm anxious, I'm worried.
[00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:43.660]   I'm trying everything I can to calm them down.
[00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:44.500]   And eventually I just say,
[00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:47.620]   "Look, I am just gonna leave, all right?
[00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.560]   "Clearly you don't want your photo taken.
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.420]   "I will not take your photo.
[00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:54.600]   "I haven't taken any photo since it got intense.
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.100]   "I'm just gonna leave."
[00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:58.860]   And they're like, "Yeah, you do that."
[00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:01.740]   I leave and people trail me for just a little bit
[00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:03.900]   but then I zigzag around
[00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:05.220]   so that nobody can see where I'm going
[00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:08.680]   and I come home and I am shook up.
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.680]   I am like anxious about this.
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.260]   Even now thinking about the encounter
[00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.840]   it gets me really, really tense.
[00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:21.780]   I haven't told this story
[00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:24.020]   because I think there are a lot of other stories
[00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:26.020]   at that time that were more worthy of telling
[00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:29.580]   and more timely and I don't think the world needed me
[00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:32.080]   to tell this story or anything like that.
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.820]   It wasn't that groundbreaking or anything.
[00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:38.100]   There were other narratives that needed
[00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.900]   to be lifted up during that time.
[00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:43.580]   So I kept it to myself but the reason I'm bringing it out now
[00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:46.020]   is because the themes of that story
[00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:50.420]   of hatred and division and aggression
[00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:55.560]   tie in really well to the themes of the book of Jonah.
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.200]   I won't talk about what that is now
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.520]   but I'll bring it back in just a minute.
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:02.900]   So let's pray.
[00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:07.620]   Oh God, thank you so much that you are our God,
[00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:09.880]   that you love us, that you protect us,
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:11.780]   that you have grace for us,
[00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:13.060]   that you have given us your word
[00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:14.900]   so that we may know who you are
[00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:18.580]   and that you give us wonderful gems of Bible books
[00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:20.560]   like the book of Jonah.
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:22.460]   I pray that you'd be with us as we talk about it.
[00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:23.700]   Be with me as I speak about it.
[00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:25.540]   Don't let me say anything that is against
[00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:28.860]   or contrary to what you stand for, God.
[00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:32.160]   Let each of us in this room examine our own hearts
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:36.480]   in the light of you and what you stand for, God.
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:40.740]   May you have your way with each of us.
[00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:43.460]   We love you, God, and we pray this in your name, amen.
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:46.140]   Now, if I were to ask any of you
[00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:47.780]   what the book of Jonah is about,
[00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:51.220]   most of us think about VeggieTales, right?
[00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:55.580]   Most of us think about the pirates who don't do anything
[00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:56.980]   and we think about the VeggieTales movie,
[00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:59.100]   the bankrupt their studio, right?
[00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:02.740]   And in that movie, you have a bunch of vegetables
[00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:05.660]   singing fun songs about how awesome God is
[00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:07.800]   and how he gives second chances.
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.100]   And it's so much fun,
[00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:12.460]   but it's also a very watered down version
[00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:14.540]   of the actual book, right?
[00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:18.220]   Trying to describe the book of Jonah as,
[00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:20.880]   oh, Jonah's scared of Nineveh, he runs away,
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.280]   God gives him a second chance
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:23.760]   and everything turns out great.
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.080]   Describing it that way is like trying to describe
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:29.740]   Avengers Endgame as somebody steals jewelry
[00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:32.000]   from an old guy.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.260]   It's not really gonna cover all the bases.
[00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.360]   It might technically be true,
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:41.440]   but it doesn't give you the full scope of what's there.
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:43.560]   And that's a shame because the book of Jonah
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.400]   is crazy cool.
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:48.320]   It is funny, it is extreme,
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:51.560]   it is almost satirical in nature.
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:54.480]   And it is kind of one of a kind in the Bible.
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:57.240]   And when we look at it and we kind of view it
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.480]   through the lens of a children's book,
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:02.040]   we do it a massive disservice.
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:05.640]   I gotta give credit to Tim Mackey from The Bible Project
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:09.100]   because his work on unraveling and decoding this book
[00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.640]   and helping me see it in the way
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:15.080]   that maybe the person reading it at the time would have
[00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:18.440]   has changed the way that I look at the book forever.
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:19.600]   So props to him.
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:23.080]   Now, the part we wanna talk about today
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.620]   is at the very end of the book.
[00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:26.660]   And we can't talk about the very end of the book
[00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:29.760]   without discussing what goes on for the rest of it.
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:33.880]   So in order to talk about the rest of the book
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.040]   and to sum it up,
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.760]   I'm gonna use the most sophisticated
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:40.280]   storytelling tool I have, puppets.
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:41.760]   (audience laughing)
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:44.560]   Now, my wife was very much against this,
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.640]   but for me, that was very personal
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:49.280]   because for those of you who don't know, I was homeschooled.
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:51.840]   And we don't have sports when you're homeschooled.
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:52.760]   When you're homeschooled,
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:54.800]   you don't join the volleyball team,
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:57.120]   you join the puppet team.
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.320]   I'm not kidding.
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.480]   I was in a traveling puppet troop.
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:04.520]   We had neon puppets and we were basically the varsity team.
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:05.760]   I was pretty good.
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.040]   In fact, the puppets I had,
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:10.240]   you actually had arm rods to deal with as well.
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:13.980]   And they were way more advanced than these level one puppets.
[00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:17.400]   But we're gonna work with what the Moody Library has
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.360]   and we're just gonna go with that.
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.600]   Sound good?
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:25.400]   So bear with me as I give a bit of a comical recap
[00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:27.360]   of the book of Jonah up to this point.
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.280]   Sound good?
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:30.120]   Cool.
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.380]   Let's recap Jonah.
[00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:35.880]   This is a bit of an overview that Tim Mackey did.
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:37.200]   It is wonderful.
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.680]   We're gonna go through the spark notes of this
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.620]   as we tell this story.
[00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:43.280]   This is Jonah.
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:46.840]   You can tell because he has a necklace of a whale
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:48.520]   and it says Jonah.
[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:50.240]   I don't think that's canonical,
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:52.920]   but the puppet says it, so we're gonna go with it.
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:54.360]   This is Jonah.
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.920]   And Jonah's a prophet.
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:57.720]   For those of us who don't know,
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.240]   prophets of the time were basically
[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:01.560]   God's mouthpiece to Israel.
[00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:04.200]   So God would need to say something to people,
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:07.240]   but because God prefers to work through people,
[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.480]   through his representatives on the earth,
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:11.240]   that's what it means that we're the image of God
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:12.400]   or images of God,
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:16.080]   he uses humans to work with other humans.
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.840]   So he had prophets.
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:20.320]   It was this class of people that would
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:23.320]   speak on behalf of God.
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.860]   And Jonah was one of those prophets.
[00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:27.680]   Now if you're in ancient Hebrew
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:29.400]   and you're reading the book of Jonah,
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:32.120]   when you say, oh, this is a prophetical book,
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:34.160]   you're expecting to open it up
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.200]   and hear all the proclamations of judgments
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.180]   that God has for Israel,
[00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:42.600]   or all the warnings or all the encouragements that he has.
[00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:45.600]   If you look at the books ahead or behind of Jonah,
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:48.920]   they're just chapter upon chapter of the prophets
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:51.700]   saying to Israel what they need to know.
[00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:53.660]   But then the book of Jonah is different.
[00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:55.240]   It's a narrative.
[00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:56.080]   And not only that,
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:16:00.080]   it's kind of intense and insane and extreme
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.400]   in the best way possible.
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:04.120]   So at the beginning of the book,
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:08.840]   God sends Jonah a message.
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:12.200]   It says, "And the word of the Lord came to Jonah.
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:15.240]   "Go to Nineveh and that great city
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:18.840]   "and tell them the judgment I have for them.
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:21.160]   "In 40 days, they're going to be destroyed."
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:25.680]   Now, Jonah doesn't like this.
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:27.920]   Jonah dislikes this so much
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:31.400]   that rather than going to Nineveh over here,
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:35.920]   he turns the other direction and heads towards Tarshish.
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:38.200]   He gets to a port of Joppa,
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.840]   he gets in the boat,
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:44.840]   and he sails away from where God has asked him to go.
[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:47.800]   We were going over this with our students
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:50.760]   at Urban Voice recently,
[00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:54.000]   and we were like, what do you think is Jonah's motivation?
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:54.900]   Why is he running?
[00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:57.840]   Why does he not want to do what God has asked him to?
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.920]   And the general consensus from the students
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:02.000]   and from just about anybody who reads it
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.200]   is that Nineveh's a bad place and Jonah's terrified.
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:10.160]   What Nineveh used to do is when they conquered a city
[00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.720]   and they took the walls down,
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:14.820]   or they conquered a city
[00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:17.240]   and they would take the leader of that city
[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:18.840]   and they would string,
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:20.960]   I don't know how graphic I should be,
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:23.460]   they would cut them up in creative ways
[00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:27.940]   and string them along the wall of that city.
[00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:31.160]   So the leaders would not only be killed and bleeding out,
[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:34.240]   but they'd also be publicly humiliated in the process,
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:37.000]   and everybody in that city would have a very clear reminder
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.840]   of what has happened to them.
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:41.860]   So our students are like, well, Jonah's terrified.
[00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:43.680]   They don't want that to happen to him.
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:45.200]   I wouldn't want to go tell Nineveh,
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:48.820]   hey, you're gonna be destroyed in like 40 days.
[00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:52.120]   So Jonah's running away.
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:55.100]   He gets in the boat, he falls asleep,
[00:17:55.100 --> 00:18:00.100]   and then the Bible says God sent a massive wind,
[00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:06.260]   a great wind, a storm to hit this boat,
[00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:09.060]   and things are terrifying, things are freaky.
[00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:11.120]   It's so bad, in fact,
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:16.700]   that the sailors, who are apparently
[00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:20.320]   on a different diet than Jonah, are terrified,
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:21.840]   and they begin praying to their God,
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:23.840]   and they're like, ah, what is happening?
[00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:27.140]   And they're like, is everybody praying to their God?
[00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:28.560]   Do we have all of our bases covered?
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:30.420]   What's that one guy down deck that's sleeping?
[00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:31.380]   Go wake him up.
[00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:34.200]   And the captain comes and says, Jonah, pray to your God.
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:35.040]   What are you doing?
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:37.040]   He's like, what, what, oh, okay.
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:39.140]   So they're all praying to their gods.
[00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:41.700]   Notice, Jonah ain't saying a word.
[00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:45.140]   They're terrified, and Jonah knows what's going on,
[00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:48.100]   but he's just keeping his mouth shut.
[00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:52.060]   He's willing to let them all figure it out themselves.
[00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:55.460]   So they cast lots, they play a game of chance,
[00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.720]   and Jonah draws the short straw.
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:01.300]   So in that day and age, oh, crap, our God's mad at you.
[00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:04.500]   And Jonah says, yeah, I am a Hebrew,
[00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:07.480]   and I worship the God Jehovah, Yahweh,
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:10.460]   and basically, he's really angry at me
[00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:11.780]   for running away from him.
[00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:14.000]   That's why all this is happening.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.620]   So they're like, oh my gosh, this is terrifying.
[00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:18.260]   And they're such great people
[00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:21.800]   that they actually try to row the other way.
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:23.580]   They're like, maybe we can row out of it.
[00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:26.280]   And Jonah's like, no, what you have to do is,
[00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:30.620]   now at this point, you'd think Jonah maybe understands
[00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:32.100]   that God's mad at him.
[00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:34.100]   Jonah maybe knows what he has to do.
[00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:35.380]   Maybe Jonah's gonna tell them,
[00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:37.600]   hey, we should turn this boat around,
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:40.040]   go the other way, and I'll go to Nineveh.
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:42.060]   But what's Jonah say?
[00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:44.260]   You should throw me overboard.
[00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:49.100]   You should throw me into the sea and leave me to drown.
[00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:54.100]   Jonah would rather die than go to Nineveh for some reason.
[00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:55.720]   They don't wanna do it.
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:56.600]   They try to row the other way.
[00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:57.800]   It won't work.
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:00.000]   And with a prayer to God, like God,
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.640]   forgive us if this results in this man dying,
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.780]   they throw him overboard.
[00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:07.880]   The storm clears.
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:10.560]   And the first subversive thing that happens,
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:11.760]   the thing we're not expecting,
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:14.240]   is that all the sailors are like, crap,
[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:15.640]   that must be the real God.
[00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:17.600]   And they make covenants towards him,
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:18.800]   and they make promises.
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:21.860]   Those sailors become believers in Jehovah.
[00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:24.020]   Even though they would have been of other nations,
[00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:25.700]   even though they would have been of other tongues
[00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:26.740]   and different religions,
[00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:28.380]   they come to know God through it.
[00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:32.820]   So Jonah's drowning.
[00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:36.060]   And this is the part of the story everyone loves.
[00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:40.180]   God sends a fish,
[00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:42.820]   who is apparently a very happy whale,
[00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:46.540]   to swallow Jonah up, right?
[00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:49.380]   God is not going to let Jonah die,
[00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:52.940]   'cause honestly, Jonah dying would kinda be like him
[00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:54.320]   getting one over on God, like,
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.960]   ha ha, you can't make me go to Nineveh.
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:01.960]   So God swallows, God has the fish swallow Jonah up,
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:04.360]   and while in the belly of the whale,
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:07.340]   Jonah recites different psalms.
[00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:08.820]   He prays to God.
[00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:10.940]   Now, on first read, it looks like he's praying,
[00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:12.140]   looks like he's repenting,
[00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:16.140]   but the more you read it, he never actually apologizes.
[00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:19.300]   He never actually commits to be better, really.
[00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:21.700]   All he's really doing is quoting psalms
[00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:24.900]   about how amazing God is, how forgiving God is,
[00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:28.100]   how salvific and loving God is.
[00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:34.660]   And after three days, God tells the fish
[00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:38.740]   to vomit Jonah out onto dry land.
[00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:40.660]   That's what the text says.
[00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:41.880]   There's vomit in the Bible.
[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:44.260]   Vomit is a key element of this story.
[00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:48.300]   So the fish vomits Jonah onto dry land,
[00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:50.660]   and Jonah decides to go to Nineveh.
[00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:53.860]   So he's going into Nineveh,
[00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:55.820]   and we're told Nineveh is a great city.
[00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:59.820]   It would take three days to walk all the way through Nineveh.
[00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:02.760]   But Jonah, he walks one day into it.
[00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:05.220]   Just one day.
[00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:09.480]   It's a three-day trip city, but he goes in one day,
[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:13.160]   and he says, oh, sorry,
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:17.060]   and he says, "40 more days,
[00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:19.500]   "and Nineveh shall be overturned."
[00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:23.360]   Hey, in 40 days, you're all going to be destroyed.
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:25.600]   Not a very convincing sermon.
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:28.260]   Jonah didn't put his best work towards this.
[00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:31.740]   He's not exactly attempting to convince anybody.
[00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:34.220]   He's fulfilling an obligation.
[00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:37.740]   He's doing the barest minimal possible.
[00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:40.060]   So he goes part of the way into the city,
[00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:41.820]   and he says, hey, you guys are all going to be destroyed
[00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:44.420]   in 40 days, and then that's it.
[00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:48.340]   But the next part is also surprising.
[00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:50.720]   We wouldn't have expected the sailors to turn to God,
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.700]   and we also wouldn't have expected Nineveh to,
[00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:57.700]   but what happens is that word gets all the way,
[00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:02.880]   oh boy, word gets all the way to the Ninevite king,
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.400]   and he's like, oh, crap, guys,
[00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:07.260]   we're going to be destroyed in 40 days,
[00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:10.540]   and he puts out a decree to all of the people
[00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:11.740]   in that nation.
[00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:15.000]   He says, guys, we need to dress ourselves
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.820]   in sackcloth and ash, which is the thing you would do
[00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:21.500]   at that time if you were grieving and in despair,
[00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:24.060]   and he says, and we need to pray to this God
[00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:26.860]   and ask him, because maybe he'll relent.
[00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:32.900]   And so the king has every man, even every cattle,
[00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:38.700]   every freaking cow, be in sackcloth and ashes and repent.
[00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:41.860]   And at the end of chapter three, it says,
[00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:45.960]   and God saw what they had done and relented.
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:49.900]   So now we're at the point of the story where we want to be.
[00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:53.420]   Now we're at the very last chapter,
[00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:55.780]   and this chapter is kind of like a key.
[00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:58.880]   It unlocks some of Jonah's motivations.
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:00.540]   It tells you what he was thinking
[00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:03.160]   throughout this entire ordeal.
[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:05.060]   So that's where we're going to pick up.
[00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:11.680]   But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was angry,
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:15.120]   and he prayed to the Lord and said, oh, Lord,
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:17.100]   is this, is not this what I said
[00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:18.780]   when I was yet in my country?
[00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:23.080]   That is why I made haste to flee to Tarshish.
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:24.940]   Pause for a second.
[00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:28.060]   Jonah's telling us why he didn't go to Nineveh.
[00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:30.620]   He's explaining it himself.
[00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:33.600]   He wasn't afraid of Nineveh.
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:37.060]   He knew that God was going to forgive Nineveh if he went.
[00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:42.320]   Jonah continues, for I knew that you are a gracious God
[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:45.120]   and merciful, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love
[00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:46.720]   and relenting from disaster.
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:49.840]   Therefore now, oh Lord, please take my life from me,
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:54.020]   for it is better for me to die than to live.
[00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:56.080]   Jonah's throwing a temper tantrum.
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:58.660]   Jonah is like a child who doesn't like a decision
[00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:01.740]   his parents has made, and the Lord said,
[00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:03.820]   you do well to be angry.
[00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:07.260]   Jonah went out of the city and sat to the east of the city
[00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:08.820]   and made a booth for himself there.
[00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:09.940]   He sets up tent.
[00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:12.700]   He sat under it in the shade till he should see
[00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:14.720]   what would become of the city.
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:16.180]   So remember he said in 40 days,
[00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:17.860]   you guys are gonna be destroyed.
[00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:22.540]   He's camping out there for 40 days just out of spite,
[00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:25.060]   just because he wants to watch them be destroyed.
[00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:27.060]   Now the Lord God appointed a plant
[00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:29.900]   and made it come up over Jonah,
[00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:31.700]   that it might be a shade over his head
[00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:34.020]   to save him from his discomfort.
[00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:37.380]   So Jonah was exceedingly glad because of this plant.
[00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:40.780]   Notice when God is giving Jonah some favor,
[00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:42.880]   Jonah's happy, he's a happy boy.
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:44.080]   He's great with this.
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:48.500]   But when dawn came up the next day
[00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:50.860]   and Nineveh was not destroyed,
[00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:52.940]   God appointed a worm that attacked the plant
[00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:54.460]   so that it withered.
[00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:58.180]   When the sun arose, God pointed a scorching east wind
[00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:00.380]   and the sun beat down on the head of Jonah
[00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:02.460]   so that he was faint.
[00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:04.140]   And he asked that he might die and said,
[00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:07.460]   it is better for me to die than to live.
[00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:09.440]   Apparently Jonah keeps going back to this
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:11.560]   whenever he's in an argument.
[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:14.620]   But God said to Jonah,
[00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:16.180]   do you do well to be angry for the plant?
[00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:19.080]   He said, yes, I do well to be angry, angry enough to die.
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:21.320]   And the Lord said, you pity the plant
[00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:23.160]   for which you did not labor,
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:25.860]   nor did you make it grow which came into being in a night
[00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:27.820]   and perished in a night.
[00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:30.540]   And should I not pity Nineveh,
[00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:34.540]   that great city in which there are more than 120,000 persons
[00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:37.800]   who do not even know their right hand from their left
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:39.740]   and also much cattle?
[00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:42.900]   And that's the end of the book.
[00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:44.740]   That's how it ends.
[00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:46.680]   In some translations, which I love,
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:48.720]   it's and even the cows?
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:51.500]   Then it just ends.
[00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:53.100]   You end with God being like,
[00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:55.380]   and what about the cows, Jonah?
[00:26:55.380 --> 00:27:00.140]   So this is just the weirdest, strangest dud
[00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:04.620]   of an ending to a book, but it is so fascinating.
[00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:06.120]   It is so fascinating.
[00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:09.720]   Because what this final chapter reveals about Jonah
[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:13.120]   is that Jonah was not afraid that Nineveh would kill him.
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:16.840]   Jonah was afraid Nineveh would be forgiven.
[00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:23.940]   Jonah was so sure that if he went to Nineveh,
[00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:28.640]   like God asked him to, that God would forgive Nineveh.
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:31.060]   And Jonah didn't like that.
[00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:34.100]   And he was willing to run away for it,
[00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:36.060]   leave his entire life for it.
[00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:37.760]   He was even willing to die for it.
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:46.740]   What is interesting here is that Jonah refuses
[00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:51.740]   to accept a God who loves people that Jonah hates.
[00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:54.180]   Say that again.
[00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:59.180]   Jonah refuses to accept a God who loves people Jonah hates.
[00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:06.900]   I wanna go back to that story, kind of.
[00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:09.200]   I wanna go to a few days after that happened.
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:12.160]   Samy and I were going out to eat
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:15.120]   once restaurants were allowed to open up.
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:17.520]   And we were at a pizza place next to our restaurant,
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:18.620]   next to where we live.
[00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:23.580]   And it's in the same neighborhood that this event happened.
[00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:25.160]   And we're eating our pizza,
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:29.400]   and in walks one of the guys from that night.
[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:31.800]   In fact, this was one of the guys
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:34.520]   who even threw his bottle at one of the teenagers.
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:36.720]   And one of the guys who followed me
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:39.580]   midway through when I tried to leave.
[00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:43.600]   I noticed myself tense up.
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:46.880]   I noticed my breathing get shallow.
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:49.000]   I was getting anxious.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.060]   I asked Samy, "We finished our food?"
[00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:55.000]   And then I asked her if we could leave.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.400]   And I remember, because he was the one
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:01.240]   who had been saying, "We don't want you here.
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:02.880]   "These people have city jobs."
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:08.720]   And from that point, for the next few months,
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:11.600]   something in me had shifted.
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:14.080]   Something in me had changed.
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:17.720]   And something about the way that I viewed my neighbors
[00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:21.180]   and the people on my street had altered.
[00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:27.520]   I didn't want to pass them while I was walking my dog.
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:31.320]   I didn't want to talk to them when I was parking my car.
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:33.680]   I didn't want to run into them at any of the businesses.
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:36.100]   In fact, when I'm doing all of those things,
[00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:41.640]   there is a very real part of me that despises them.
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:45.040]   There's a very real part of me that sees
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:47.940]   some of those faces that I remember from that night
[00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:52.940]   and feels very real anger and very real vitriol
[00:29:52.940 --> 00:30:01.440]   and almost hatred, almost like I despise their very being.
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:04.940]   I hate the fact that they're in my neighborhood.
[00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:06.820]   I hate the fact that I live among them.
[00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:09.220]   And all these thoughts are going through my head
[00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:11.560]   as I walk my dog past them,
[00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:14.380]   as I shop next to them at the gas station
[00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:15.780]   or fill up my vehicle.
[00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:22.160]   In that moment, guys, I had also become Jonah.
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:26.100]   We read this book and we think it's a little insane
[00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:28.020]   or a little extreme,
[00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:32.560]   but we ourselves are prone to the exact same thing.
[00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:37.580]   I could not look at my neighbors
[00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:40.100]   with the eyes that God looks at them
[00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:41.880]   because of my anger towards them.
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:48.140]   I could not accept that God also loves them
[00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:52.200]   because of what I perceived as the kind of people they were.
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:55.540]   And I lived like that for a while.
[00:30:55.540 --> 00:31:03.020]   In this moment, Jonah believes he knows better than God.
[00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:04.180]   That's the root of it.
[00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:08.060]   God, I know better than you.
[00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:11.900]   And if you were to make something bad happen to these people
[00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:14.540]   that would be better, that would be justice.
[00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:16.340]   If you were to make it so that they couldn't do that
[00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:18.420]   to people anymore, that would be justice.
[00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:23.060]   It's this belief that we know better than God.
[00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:29.900]   And it's also the same exact motivation
[00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:31.400]   as Adam and Eve in the garden.
[00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:34.260]   What do Adam and Eve in the garden do?
[00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:36.180]   God tells them something bad is going to happen
[00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:39.740]   if they do something, but they decide,
[00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:42.280]   I think something good is gonna happen if I do that.
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:44.760]   So often in Genesis we're told, and God said it was good,
[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:47.020]   and God said it was good, and God said it was good.
[00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:49.680]   And then with the apple or the fruit
[00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:51.780]   that he's told them not to eat,
[00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:54.900]   it says they looked and saw that it was good.
[00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:58.760]   That's a verbal code for us,
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:02.200]   that they looked and they're making the moral judgment call.
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:05.380]   The disobedience didn't happen at the bite of the fruit.
[00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:07.240]   The disobedience happened when they decided
[00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:08.600]   to pick it from the tree.
[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:14.020]   To pull this even closer to our story,
[00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:15.260]   at the very beginning it says,
[00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:17.420]   but it displeased Jonah exceedingly.
[00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:18.260]   See that little A?
[00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:19.980]   That means there's a different way
[00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:21.860]   that it's said in certain passages.
[00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:25.420]   Some passages don't say that it displeased Jonah exceedingly.
[00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:30.580]   Some passages say Jonah found it exceedingly evil.
[00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:33.320]   And what happens right before this?
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:36.160]   God relents, God does not destroy Nineveh.
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:38.580]   So God doesn't destroy Nineveh,
[00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:41.500]   and in some of the passages we have,
[00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:46.440]   it was seen as exceedingly evil to Jonah.
[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:50.360]   Jonah is now the one making these moral judgment calls.
[00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:55.060]   But who are we to look down on Jonah for that?
[00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:56.660]   'Cause we do that all the time.
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:02.080]   I know that this has happened to me,
[00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:04.120]   and I know it's probably happened to you.
[00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:08.780]   People who have hurt us, people who have maybe betrayed us,
[00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:11.440]   or people who have inconvenienced us.
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:16.400]   We have this desire in ourselves to not see them be treated
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:19.360]   with the same love and care that we ourselves have known.
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:27.580]   Here's the other weird part about this passage.
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:31.240]   Belief in God was not Jonah's problem.
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:35.920]   Jonah was very aware of God's existence.
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:38.800]   Jonah knows God, Jonah hears from God,
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:44.220]   yet he doesn't understand God's values
[00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:46.020]   and isn't on board with his mission.
[00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:50.560]   A person can fully believe in God,
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:52.460]   yet not understand his values
[00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:54.100]   or be on board with his mission.
[00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:55.840]   That should terrify us.
[00:33:57.240 --> 00:34:00.480]   There are people walking around, sometimes even us,
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:05.020]   with the Christian word on their shirt
[00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:10.020]   who are hurting people, who are causing pain or division,
[00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:15.080]   and all the while they have the name Jesus on their shirt.
[00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:18.320]   That should scare us.
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:21.280]   And it should remind us that belief in God,
[00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:23.520]   belief that he's real and belief that the things
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:25.520]   in the Bible are how they happened,
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:26.720]   isn't the thing that saves us.
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:31.160]   It's us saying we submit ourselves to your mission,
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:33.100]   to your values, and to your way.
[00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:37.400]   You are our God, not me.
[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:40.560]   When we believe we know better than God,
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:43.460]   we are choosing Adam, not Jesus.
[00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:48.800]   Interesting side note, our students, some of them,
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:51.380]   I've had interesting conversations with them
[00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:54.460]   where we'll talk about what it means to be a Christian,
[00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:56.780]   and almost none of our students are hung up
[00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:59.580]   on the idea of believing in Jesus.
[00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:01.600]   Some of them wanna talk apologetics.
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:06.500]   Some of them wanna talk about the archeology and all that,
[00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:09.220]   but the majority of them, the majority of,
[00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:12.200]   I would say people, the thing you can't get behind
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:14.580]   isn't the belief about whether or not it's real,
[00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:19.000]   but it's the submission to another being's way
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.820]   of doing things that's hard.
[00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:24.660]   And we struggle with that,
[00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:27.460]   even though we may believe in him.
[00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:33.160]   Here's another thing we learn from this passage
[00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:37.380]   is that we cannot fully love others like God loves them
[00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:41.760]   until we learn to see ourselves the way God sees us.
[00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:45.660]   We cannot fully love others like God loves them
[00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:49.280]   until we learn to see ourselves the way God sees us.
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:54.880]   When we view ourselves as higher than or better than others
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:56.480]   because of whatever metric
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:58.740]   is in front of our noses at that time,
[00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:01.780]   we are doing the same thing the Pharisees did.
[00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:04.600]   We're doing the same thing Jesus rebuked the Pharisees for.
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:05.800]   We are saying we are better
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:08.080]   because of something we've earned,
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:09.320]   because of something we've done,
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:11.120]   because of something I am,
[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:13.080]   and you are worse because of something you are
[00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:14.500]   or something you've done.
[00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:18.280]   Paul in the New Testament,
[00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:19.440]   an apostle who would write
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:20.960]   to many of the different churches,
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:23.000]   he understood this well.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.740]   He understood that he can't love other people
[00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:28.980]   until he sees himself the way God sees him.
[00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:31.400]   Paul has this really interesting message at one point
[00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:35.140]   where he says, "I am the chief among sinners."
[00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:39.460]   And that's crazy and weird to the people of the time
[00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:42.120]   because this is the guy who's leading the charge
[00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:44.260]   in bringing the gospel to Gentiles.
[00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:49.000]   This is like earliest Christian celebrity, right?
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.880]   That guy, the one who's writing most of the New Testament?
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:55.080]   And he says, "I am the chief among sinners.
[00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:56.560]   I'm the greatest sinner I know
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:59.360]   because I know my thoughts.
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:01.280]   I can't read your thoughts.
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:06.280]   And I know who I am and I know how dark I can be.
[00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:11.200]   I know how evil I could become."
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:15.480]   And that sort of knowledge and understanding of oneself
[00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:17.080]   leads to a humility that says,
[00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:20.240]   "I can love other people and love them better
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:23.980]   and find them more important than I find myself."
[00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:26.240]   Paul had that, Jesus had that.
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:28.000]   Sometimes we struggle to have that.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:34.680]   Finally, we don't get to decide who is worthy of God's love.
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:36.080]   We're not the gatekeepers.
[00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:38.440]   We are not the one who makes the rules.
[00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:41.400]   When we accept that God has loved us
[00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:42.960]   and done something for us
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:45.320]   to bring us into a better state of being,
[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:48.960]   to bring us from a state of death to a state of life,
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:53.960]   we agree with God that that is a possibility for everybody.
[00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:57.680]   Even the people who we despise,
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:00.280]   the people who have hurt us, who have betrayed us,
[00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:02.200]   the people who are on the opposite end
[00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:03.880]   of our political spectrum,
[00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:07.440]   the people who do evil things in the world,
[00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:10.080]   we have to believe with God
[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:13.280]   that they are as eligible for his grace as we are.
[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:15.920]   We can't be the ones who decide
[00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:17.840]   who is and who isn't worthy of that.
[00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:21.480]   And the way we go about our lives needs to reflect that.
[00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:23.160]   I know that's sobering for me.
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:27.480]   I say all this,
[00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:33.200]   I say all this having told you about this struggle I've had,
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:35.360]   especially in the past year with my neighbors.
[00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:37.440]   And I wanna tell you how this sort of ended
[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:38.600]   and wrapped up for me.
[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:42.440]   One of the things I love about our neighborhood
[00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:44.160]   and about the churches in our neighborhood
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:46.880]   is that we do this thing called Pray Bridgeport.
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:48.240]   And it's amazing.
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:51.240]   It's all the churches in the area
[00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:54.720]   who are willing to come together
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:56.560]   and we pray for our neighborhood.
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:58.240]   And it's freaking beautiful.
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:01.560]   We got Anglicans over here, we got Baptists over here,
[00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:05.920]   we have people of all different like cultures,
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:09.240]   nationalities, all different denominations,
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:11.440]   and we're all coming together to pray
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:14.680]   that God would love the people in our neighborhood.
[00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:15.960]   And it's amazing.
[00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:22.840]   And a few months after that incident in my neighborhood,
[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:26.800]   I was at a Pray Bridgeport at our park at Armor Square,
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:28.360]   which is right where I live,
[00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:31.320]   which is right where this incident had happened, basically.
[00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:36.840]   And they had set up prayer at different stations.
[00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:38.000]   So you would go to one station
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.120]   and pray for a specific thing,
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:41.960]   go to another station and pray for a specific thing.
[00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:44.400]   And I was going about these stations
[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:45.880]   and I get to a station
[00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:51.960]   that is praying for the political
[00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:58.040]   and social divide in our neighborhood.
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:00.360]   And it's run by some of the pastors
[00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:02.560]   at Progressive Baptist Church,
[00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:05.680]   who are some of the people who are organizing
[00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:09.520]   the peaceful marches and the protests of that time.
[00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:12.280]   They're organizing these things
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:17.160]   and they lead us in prayer for the very people
[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:22.480]   who I had just been hating in my own heart for so long.
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:26.200]   The very people I didn't wanna think about,
[00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:28.520]   the very people I was honestly terrified
[00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:31.160]   that God would ask me to talk to at some point
[00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:32.520]   because I didn't want to
[00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:35.360]   and I didn't want them to know about God.
[00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:38.080]   I didn't want to have to be forced to talk about him
[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:40.880]   to someone who I find so despicable.
[00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:44.120]   And these people who were even organizing
[00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:45.560]   these protests and marches,
[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:49.740]   lead us in prayer for that, for them asking God,
[00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:52.160]   would you work in their hearts?
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:54.800]   Would you help them to see the error of their ways?
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:57.920]   And would you grip them for a greater purpose?
[00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:02.200]   Make them people who bring about good in your world.
[00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:05.880]   And that was the prayer that I couldn't pray at that time.
[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:09.440]   And it was me coming face to face with the idea that
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:14.680]   Jesus loves them as terrible
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:16.940]   as they might be at their worst.
[00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:20.720]   I'm also terrible at my worst.
[00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:24.240]   And let me clarify, this is not to say in any way
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:26.560]   that Jesus permits some of the kinds of things
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:29.240]   they were doing or the violence or the animosity,
[00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:31.900]   but that if we have a biblical example
[00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:33.840]   of God using one of his prophets
[00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:38.740]   to reach such an evil city as Nineveh,
[00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:41.040]   we need to know that God can reach
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:43.240]   even those who we see are evil.
[00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:45.820]   And if we're not getting on board with that,
[00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:49.480]   we are being against God and trying to gatekeep
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:52.480]   and hold things that we want for ourselves
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:54.320]   and not letting other people have it.
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:57.480]   Here's the final point.
[00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:02.420]   Jesus is kind of like the new Jonah.
[00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:05.220]   Do you guys remember when Jonah
[00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:07.100]   was in the belly of the fish?
[00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:08.340]   He was in the belly of the fish
[00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:10.660]   for three days and three nights.
[00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:12.480]   Our alarm bells should be ringing.
[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:14.780]   That is like a biblical hyperlink
[00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:16.820]   to another theme in the Bible.
[00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:20.420]   Who else was in the dark for three days and three nights?
[00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:21.360]   That's Jesus.
[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:26.980]   We're supposed to see parallels between Jonah and Jesus.
[00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:31.980]   Both are, in a sense, messengers to a people
[00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:35.000]   delivering a message from God
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.960]   of repentance for their own good.
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:42.780]   And Jonah goes into the belly of the fish
[00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:44.020]   for three days and three nights,
[00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:45.980]   and Jesus goes into the grave
[00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:48.060]   for three days and three nights.
[00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:50.460]   But the difference between the two
[00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:53.420]   is that where Jesus decides
[00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:55.460]   that he is going to take up this cross
[00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:58.680]   to bear this mantle and to love the people he's sent to,
[00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:00.340]   Jonah despises them.
[00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:04.180]   Jonah fights tooth and nail against God,
[00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:05.740]   even as he's given the job
[00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:08.420]   of letting these people know that they need to repent.
[00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:11.960]   But Jesus walks to the cross.
[00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:13.380]   Jesus is consistent.
[00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:14.700]   Jesus is steady.
[00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:17.740]   Jesus continues to love the people
[00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:20.700]   who are doing him active harm.
[00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:23.620]   And when Jesus is strung up on the cross,
[00:43:23.620 --> 00:43:25.980]   in much the same way the Ninevites
[00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:28.740]   would have strung up their enemies on their walls,
[00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:31.760]   Jesus utters, "God, forgive them,
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:33.460]   "for they know not what they do."
[00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:36.820]   May we have that kind of a heart.
[00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:39.160]   May we have that kind of a desire for people,
[00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:40.700]   that when we see evil
[00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:43.340]   and when we see bad behavior in the world,
[00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:44.940]   we don't despise them,
[00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:47.740]   we don't stoop to their level of making our own enemies,
[00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:51.560]   but we understand that God's transformational love
[00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:54.320]   and his work in our hearts
[00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:57.480]   is something that also could be done in theirs.
[00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:59.760]   And may we hope for that.
[00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:01.920]   It might not always happen,
[00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:05.280]   but might we pray for that and desire that,
[00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:07.600]   not just for the people who we see as worthy,
[00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:11.920]   but for the people who God loves, which is everybody.
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:14.500]   If you're a Christian in this room,
[00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:17.480]   at all times, as an ambassador of God's kingdom,
[00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:20.760]   you have a choice to be a Jonah or to be a Jesus.
[00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:23.840]   Not that you can be Jesus, but you know what I mean.
[00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:27.800]   Are you going to love the people you have been sent to,
[00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:30.120]   sacrificially trusting that God is good,
[00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:32.760]   or are you going to fight him tooth and nail
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:33.820]   for your own way?
[00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:39.140]   May we choose to be more like Jesus and not Jonah.
[00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:39.980]   Let's pray.
[00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:44.520]   God, thank you for this convicting passage.
[00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:48.240]   Thank you for this strange novelty of a book.
[00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:51.000]   Thank you that it's so different
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.840]   from many of the other parts of the Bible.
[00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:57.160]   And thank you that it is such a mirror to us.
[00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:59.520]   Thank you that when we look to it,
[00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:02.480]   it is so subversive and it points out
[00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:05.640]   the flaws in our own heart so well.
[00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:08.280]   Thank you that it allows us to see
[00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:10.620]   the areas where we need to grow.
[00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:12.240]   And God, I pray for each of us,
[00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:14.840]   would you give us a heart that is similar
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:16.280]   to the heart of Jesus,
[00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:18.720]   that when we look at people who are lost,
[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:21.840]   when we look at people who are in the dark,
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:25.320]   we don't despise them for what they might do
[00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:27.880]   to ourselves or to other people,
[00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:32.680]   but would we have pity and compassion and empathy
[00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:35.760]   and seek to show them the love that you have first shown us?
[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:39.160]   God, we pray that you would use us mightily.
[00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:42.000]   We pray for each of those people
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.140]   who we all maybe have a difficult time loving.
[00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:49.220]   Would you be with them?
[00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:51.300]   Would you work in their hearts?
[00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:53.300]   And also would you work in ours
[00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:58.140]   to know how to love them well and to represent you better?
[00:45:58.140 --> 00:46:00.540]   We love you, God, and we pray this in your name.
