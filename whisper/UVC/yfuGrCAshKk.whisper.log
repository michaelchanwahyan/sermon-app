[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   All right, if you have a Bible, we'll continue our series
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.400]   on the seven letters to the seven churches.
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.640]   So please turn with me to the book of Revelation.
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.800]   And by the way, this is the first of the month, okay?
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.480]   This month, we're gonna recite this verse
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.440]   and remember the promises there.
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.880]   Let's do it together, and I picked this last week
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.420]   because it is a reminder that we all need this,
[00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.340]   forgiveness of sin from time to time, right?
[00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.420]   And God's grace is always sufficient,
[00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.700]   and sufficient to the point that, you know,
[00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.900]   even though we fall and we stumble,
[00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.660]   but God's grace is always there, all right?
[00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.100]   Let's recite it together, 1 John 1, 9.
[00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.220]   If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just
[00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.860]   and will forgive us our sins
[00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.380]   and purify us from all unrighteousness, all right?
[00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.860]   Why don't we do that?
[00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.120]   Take a moment to confess our sin,
[00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.220]   to confess that we have our shortcomings,
[00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.460]   yet God's grace is always there, all right?
[00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:05.460]   Let's take a moment.
[00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:15.460]   Father, once again, we experience
[00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.840]   the unconditional forgiveness of sin,
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.500]   all because of what Jesus has done for us.
[00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.200]   And thank you for the renewing grace and love
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.900]   that we can experience.
[00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.140]   And thank you for your promise
[00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.260]   as we confess our sins and our shortcomings.
[00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.860]   You are there to embrace us with your grace
[00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.700]   in Christ, we pray, amen.
[00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.760]   So let's turn to the book of Revelation.
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.380]   Turn to book of Revelation chapter three, all right?
[00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.500]   We have studied some of the letters
[00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.940]   written by Jesus to the seven churches.
[00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.420]   And today we're gonna talk about this letter
[00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.340]   to the church in Philadelphia.
[00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.740]   So it's not the Philadelphia in United States.
[00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.940]   It's Philadelphia in today's Western Turkey.
[00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.780]   That is one of the cities the seven churches address to.
[00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.400]   So we study this from part one.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.940]   Jesus wrote a letter to the church in Ephesus.
[00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.720]   And then Smyrna, Pergamon.
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.320]   Thyatira and Sardis.
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.880]   And now we come to Philadelphia, Philadelphia.
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.800]   And by the way, the name Philadelphia
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.560]   means brotherly love, right?
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.000]   Philo, love, right?
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Adelpha, Adelphia, the second part is brother.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.880]   So brotherly love, city.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.120]   So this church or house churches
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.720]   located in this ancient city, Philadelphia.
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.160]   And the letter is pretty short.
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.520]   And there are two points here.
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.660]   I wanna make two points from this letter,
[00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.260]   from the sixth letter to the church in Philadelphia.
[00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.280]   The first point is your work, your ministry,
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.040]   your serving of God, it matters to God.
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.400]   And second point is that your work,
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.620]   your ministry will be awarded, all right?
[00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.240]   It will be awarded.
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.220]   The two points here.
[00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.280]   So let's read through this letter.
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.560]   Verse seven of chapter three.
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.560]   To the angel of the church in Philadelphia write,
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.880]   these are the words of him who is holy and true,
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.060]   who holds the key of David.
[00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.140]   When he opens, no one can shut.
[00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.140]   What he shuts, no one can open.
[00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.120]   This is how Jesus introduced himself
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.560]   to the church in Philadelphia.
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.700]   And it talks about key, right?
[00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:51.780]   Key.
[00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.100]   You should have some keys in your pocket, right?
[00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.020]   What did they symbolize?
[00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.300]   Keys.
[00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.220]   I remember a couple months ago,
[00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.820]   because I got a very, very cheap used car.
[00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:07.180]   And so I bought this from a friend.
[00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.140]   And I got the car and there was only one copy of the key.
[00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.460]   One copy of the car key.
[00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.980]   And knowing that I'm very forgetful,
[00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.340]   I'll lose things, you know?
[00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.380]   When you ask my wife, I lose things all the time.
[00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.420]   And because we only have one key
[00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.480]   and I've become nervous using that car.
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:30.480]   So I drove this car to a hardware store nearby
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.420]   and to have my car key copied.
[00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.540]   And I didn't know how much it would cost.
[00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.760]   And I asked the manager, how much would that cost?
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.160]   And to my surprise, it's very expensive.
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.760]   Any guess?
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:43.760]   To copy a car key?
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.500]   300, $400.
[00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.780]   Woo, 300, $400.
[00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.420]   I thought I can just go to Home Depot and make a copy.
[00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.780]   But it's not that simple.
[00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.900]   And the manager had to ask me questions
[00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.140]   whether I own the car, right?
[00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.660]   Whether I have the registration to show him
[00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.860]   that I really is the owner of the car
[00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.500]   and he has to check my registration, my title,
[00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.020]   and make sure I really own the car
[00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.880]   and I really have the car in the parking lot
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.160]   and he can go out and check it out.
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.660]   And he's gonna order a blank, a blank key.
[00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.540]   And then I have to come back.
[00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.020]   I pay for the blank key and I have to come back
[00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.180]   like a couple weeks ago after I got a call from him.
[00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.060]   And it's a very, very complicated process.
[00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.780]   And I really appreciate that.
[00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:32.620]   You know why?
[00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.620]   Because it's not gonna be, I just steal a car
[00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.780]   and drive it to a hardware store and have a key copied.
[00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.740]   And I really appreciate that because this will prove
[00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.820]   that I'm not doing anything criminal.
[00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.380]   And it finally took me a couple of weeks
[00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.820]   to have my car key copied and I have a peace of mind.
[00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.520]   300, $400, I mean, this is crazy, right?
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.640]   Keys are access and authority.
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.920]   But you have the key to my car, you have access to it.
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:13.040]   You have the key to my house, you have access
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.900]   and you kind of have authority.
[00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:19.900]   And in Bible times, keys are very, very big, very large.
[00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.620]   Sometimes people would carry the key over the shoulder
[00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.140]   with a lanyard or sword.
[00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:30.020]   And then you have your key under your armpit.
[00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.660]   And you can show people you have a big house.
[00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.500]   And here's some of the pictures of the Roman time.
[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.020]   You can see some of the keys,
[00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:42.140]   one of the keys here on the left.
[00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:45.120]   You find a bronze key from Roman's time
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.560]   and it is a horse head handle key.
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.720]   It's huge, you just stick it in.
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.880]   I don't know how heavy it is.
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.140]   But it's made with bronze and metal.
[00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.360]   On the right is also a Roman key.
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:02.600]   It's an iron key with a iron handle.
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.360]   That's kind of cool, right?
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.200]   That's kind of cool.
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.640]   I don't have those keys, right?
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:11.560]   And Jesus said, he has the key.
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.040]   And he has the key to the kingdom of David.
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:18.000]   And that is the kingdom, the kingdom of God promised
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.320]   long, long time ago in the Old Testament
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.640]   and finally fulfilled and inaugurated
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:27.760]   by the true son of David, Jesus Christ himself.
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.640]   And he has the key, he has the authority
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.040]   and access to the kingdom.
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:36.280]   And this is how Jesus introduced himself to the church.
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:40.000]   And he wants the church to remember who he is.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.480]   Jesus is not simply a guy out there on the street.
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:48.640]   He is the God, the true son of David
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.720]   who inaugurate, usher in the true kingdom,
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:55.440]   the heavenly kingdom of David and the eternal kingdom.
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.840]   And in Christ, we share that access.
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.280]   In Christ, we share that authority.
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.440]   We have the access to go into the kingdom
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.640]   and we are part of the kingdom.
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:10.200]   And to this little church, Jesus wants his church
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:14.680]   to be reminded, no matter how many demands
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.240]   or how many challenges you are facing,
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:21.320]   you are depending on a God that is dependable.
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:22.760]   And you can trust in him.
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.760]   We all need this kind of truth.
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.440]   Sometimes we're dealing with life,
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.000]   with a lot of different issues and challenge
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.280]   and we are fighting the battles.
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.600]   And sometimes we forget that the Jesus that we believe in
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.200]   is the one who has the final authority.
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.160]   He has the final access to the kingdom
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:44.160]   and he guarantee the access to the kingdom.
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:45.760]   He has the key.
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.200]   And we have to remember that.
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:51.400]   In Jesus, we have the eternal hope and eternal life.
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:55.680]   And we have the eternal source of strength to go on.
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.240]   And why did he say that?
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:00.600]   We continue to read this letter from verses eight
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:01.440]   and following.
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:05.040]   Jesus said to the church, "I know your deeds.
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:09.080]   "See, I have placed before you an open door, the access,
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.200]   "and no one can shut it.
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.760]   "I know you have little strength,
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:18.640]   "yet you have kept my word and have not denied my name."
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:21.120]   You see what the church is going on here?
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.840]   They're facing a lot of different problems,
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:25.240]   different challenges, just like our church.
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:30.200]   And Jesus reminds them, "Yes, you have little strength,
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.480]   "but you have kept my word.
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.320]   "I am here to protect you.
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:38.520]   "I am here to walk with you."
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:44.640]   In trials of difficulties, Jesus is still there.
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:48.000]   And what kind of trial they're going through in verse nine?
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.440]   He said, "I will make those who are of the synagogue of Satan
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:56.920]   "who claim to be Jews, though they are not, but are liars.
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:59.200]   "I will make them come and fall down at your feet
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.080]   "and acknowledge that I have loved you."
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.760]   Now, in the context of the seven letters,
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:08.040]   we have already talked about or described
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.520]   what kind of situation the churches were in.
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.080]   In the first century, they were facing
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:16.160]   a lot of different difficulties and persecution.
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:17.640]   And the source of persecution
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.960]   is sometimes from so-called the Jews.
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:22.880]   As you understand, the early Christians,
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:27.720]   they kind of spin off from the Jewish synagogue
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.240]   in the first century.
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.640]   And many of the Jews in those days,
[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:34.400]   they do not believe Jesus is the Messiah.
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.600]   They do not believe Jesus is the Christ.
[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.040]   And in fact, they not only rejected,
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:42.400]   they would persecute and go after and oppose to anyone
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.640]   who proclaim that Jesus is the Messiah.
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:48.280]   And that's why the early churches were facing
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:52.640]   a lot of different problems from these Jewish leaders
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:55.040]   who's trying to stumble down the church,
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:57.440]   try to destroy the church.
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:00.040]   But Jesus has the promise for the church.
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:03.000]   Jesus said, "I will make your enemies,
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.120]   "the difficulties, the challenges,
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:10.120]   "to fall down at your feet because I have loved you,
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:13.760]   "because I have taken care of you."
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.160]   And so you take heart.
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.640]   There were a lot of different problems
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.960]   and challenges you are facing,
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.280]   whether you go to school today
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:23.280]   or whether you go to work today,
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:26.560]   whether we live in a society that is hostile
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.120]   to the name of Jesus.
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:31.360]   But Jesus is saying, "Not only I have the key
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:34.760]   "to the kingdom, but I will take care of you.
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:38.720]   "I will make your enemies fall down before you."
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:43.000]   But in fact, this phrase is alluding to
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.920]   some of the Old Testament promises in the past
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:52.200]   that God said all the nations will come to Israel,
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.240]   will come to the true Israel, the people of God,
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:56.760]   and they will fall down and be humble,
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:00.200]   and they will acknowledge that the Messiah, Yahweh,
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:04.840]   God, the true God, is the one that they worship.
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:08.160]   And the nations will one day come before the throne of God
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.760]   and acknowledge and admit that Jesus is the king.
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:14.200]   That is the promise here being alluded to.
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:17.200]   And this letter is giving us so much promise,
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.680]   so much encouragement.
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:23.280]   I don't know what you're going through.
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:26.920]   Sometimes you may be going through some very difficult time,
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:31.920]   but don't you forget, don't you forget who Jesus is.
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:35.600]   He is the one who can conquer enemies.
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.880]   He is the one who hold the key to the kingdom.
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:41.040]   Now, I told you before, there are seven letters
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:42.760]   to the seven churches.
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:46.960]   And if you remember, I said there were two letters
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:51.960]   out of the seven letters that have no condemnation at all.
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:55.560]   Because if you read through all seven letters
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:58.080]   to the churches, they have similar format.
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.360]   They start with self-introduction,
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.480]   how Jesus introduced himself,
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:06.560]   and always followed by the phrase, I know.
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.200]   I understand your situation.
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:11.240]   And then there will be praises and condemnation
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:12.240]   for the church.
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.920]   There are some praises for the church.
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:16.720]   Yes, I know your deeds, I know what you're doing,
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:20.560]   and I wanna praise you guys, I wanna appreciate you guys.
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:22.600]   And then it will be usually followed
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.480]   by some sort of correction.
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:27.460]   Something Jesus has against the church.
[00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:30.280]   The church has gone wrong at some places,
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:31.880]   and they need to repent.
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:34.880]   But there are only two letters that have praises only.
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.640]   There was no correction.
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:40.600]   The first one is the second letter to Smyrna.
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:41.720]   Remember?
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.080]   Praises only.
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.960]   The small churches in Smyrna,
[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.160]   they're going through some hard time,
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.200]   but the second letter says,
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:51.040]   Jesus said, you know, I commend you.
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:52.680]   You guys are doing great.
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:56.600]   And this is the second letter that has only praises.
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.600]   The letter to Philadelphia.
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.600]   Praises only.
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:04.200]   That's letter number six.
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:07.440]   And we should be inspired to become a church like this.
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:10.440]   Smyrna or Philadelphia.
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:14.200]   This church, we receive praises only
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.120]   from the head of the church.
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:18.280]   You know, if Jesus walks into our church,
[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:20.440]   what would he say?
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:23.600]   I'm not so confident that we'll be like
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.960]   the church in Philadelphia.
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:28.840]   However, this letter should be an inspiration
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.880]   for all of us to become like them.
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:34.440]   Church in Philadelphia.
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:37.940]   Not a mecca church, but faithful.
[00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:39.920]   And Jesus said, I know your deeds.
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:45.800]   And this really challenges our perspective on the church.
[00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:50.200]   Our perspective on our lives, our Christian life.
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:54.880]   When Jesus do his assessment, what is he looking for?
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:58.120]   Here it says the church in Philadelphia
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:00.920]   have little strength only.
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:03.320]   Little strength only.
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.920]   Little resource.
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.760]   Maybe they have less people.
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:10.760]   Maybe they have less financial resources.
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:13.720]   Maybe they have less people who are gifted.
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:17.160]   And Jesus observed that in his assessment.
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:20.440]   Jesus said this church, you have little strength.
[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:21.560]   It's just stating a fact.
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.320]   It's not a condemnation, right?
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:26.040]   There's nothing wrong with having little strength.
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:28.480]   Having little resource.
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:32.520]   But according to Jesus' critical assessment,
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:37.520]   he says, but yet you have kept my word
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.280]   and have not denied my name.
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:42.080]   Under pressure.
[00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:42.920]   When you're under pressure,
[00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:44.760]   when you're under difficulties,
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:49.680]   we are always tempted to deny the name of Jesus.
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:52.960]   Maybe today I'll take a break.
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:55.640]   Maybe today I'll forget about Jesus, okay?
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:57.440]   Put him on the side.
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:04.160]   In the old days, I have a lot of books on my bookshelves.
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:08.560]   Today, I've totally transformed into a e-book person
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:11.160]   because I'm running out of space in my house.
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:14.880]   I used to have 5,000 books in my house, physical books.
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:17.840]   And boy, when you have to move,
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:23.200]   it's so painful to move.
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.920]   That's why years ago, I already made up my mind,
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:30.920]   okay, let's digitalize everything.
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:36.720]   So slowly transforming to a totally e-book person now.
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:39.880]   I haven't bought a book for a long, long time,
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:41.600]   but e-books, yeah, I did.
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:46.480]   But in the old days, I have so many books on my bookshelves.
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:51.440]   But in the days of seminary, when I was taking MDiv,
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:55.000]   because studying theology is really, really tough.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:55.840]   It's really tough.
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:57.760]   There were so many books I have to read.
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:02.080]   What is so sad is that in seminary,
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:06.520]   sometimes the least you read is the Bible.
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:10.040]   Amen?
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:14.080]   Sometimes we just don't read the Bible.
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:16.680]   We just don't have time to read the Bible.
[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:18.880]   Because you go to a course, you receive a syllabus,
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:23.080]   and you have to read like 2, 3, 4,000 pages, right?
[00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:27.760]   Church history or exegetical work or whatever,
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:31.760]   commentaries you have to read and reference books, you know.
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:34.720]   And you just don't have time to read the Bible.
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:38.800]   I tell you, sometimes when you are in a lot of pressures,
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:41.880]   you will put the Bible on the side.
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:45.680]   And that's what I did.
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.600]   The word of God, the very word of God.
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:51.200]   And sometimes as Christians, we do that too.
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:55.640]   On your phone, do you have a Bible app?
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:59.640]   How often you open the Bible app
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.840]   compared to open other apps, right?
[00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:08.280]   24 hours a day, you probably always go to TikTok.
[00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:10.760]   Always go to Instagram.
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:13.880]   Always go to social media app, right?
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:18.200]   But the Bible app, you put it on the side.
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:21.400]   Maybe just delete it, right?
[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.400]   You don't need that.
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:27.600]   And when we are pressured, we are so often,
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:30.400]   we would deny the name of Jesus, right?
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:33.400]   The church in Philadelphia, however,
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:39.000]   they insist worshiping Jesus.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.720]   They insist on affirming and keeping the gospel,
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:45.200]   keeping the faith.
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.080]   And that is the encouragement
[00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:49.680]   from Jesus himself to the church.
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:52.480]   You have kept my word, I know it.
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:53.960]   I see it.
[00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:56.400]   You have not denied my name, I see it.
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:59.040]   And Jesus further promised,
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:02.800]   I will put all of this enemies into,
[00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:07.800]   to your feet, to the feet of Christ.
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:10.240]   I will turn them into worshipers.
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:12.560]   Just like what Isaiah a long time ago,
[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:14.480]   he prophesied the Gentiles,
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:18.040]   the nation will worship the King of Kings.
[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:21.800]   Isaiah 49, Isaiah 60,
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:26.360]   that the church will be triumphant because of his grace.
[00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:30.120]   So that's my first point from this letter, your work.
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:34.280]   If you keep the word of God,
[00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:36.520]   if you keep the word of God,
[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:38.840]   if you keep on praising Jesus,
[00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:41.640]   if you keep on following Jesus faithfully,
[00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:45.200]   God sees your work and your work matters to him.
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:48.760]   And secondly, your work will be rewarded.
[00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.680]   And you have to remember that.
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.520]   We have to remember that.
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:55.680]   Sometimes we serve God.
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:58.040]   Sometimes we continue to follow Jesus.
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:00.160]   We lose sight of that.
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:03.960]   We thought this is just here and now, right?
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:05.560]   Why bother?
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:07.960]   Why bother we serve the King,
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:13.240]   our Lord with all of our might and our resources?
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:15.160]   This is so hard.
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:18.200]   And the reality you need to understand ministry is hard.
[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:21.200]   I don't know if this is true or not.
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:24.960]   I heard some time ago about church leadership,
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.040]   about church ministry.
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:31.880]   I attended one of the church conferences before
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:34.600]   and the speaker was saying,
[00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:38.640]   in this world, church leadership or church ministry
[00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:40.920]   is the hardest thing on earth.
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:44.000]   It's the hardest thing to lead.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.480]   It's the hardest work of all.
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:48.600]   I don't know if you agree with that,
[00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:50.880]   but whether it's the hardest,
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:54.320]   the most challenging things on earth or not,
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:55.320]   it is challenging.
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:58.040]   It is not easy.
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:00.000]   You just have to keep on going.
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:04.680]   And what motivates you to keep on going?
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:07.160]   It's not your own strength.
[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:11.520]   It's the hope that we have in Christ.
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:14.200]   It's the eternal reward.
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:17.960]   Yes, sometimes we do our best in our ministry
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.920]   and we don't see fruit.
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:23.400]   What can motivate us to continue?
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:28.960]   Sometimes we're in the midst of challenges in ministry,
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:33.960]   in our church, in our just general work of Christian life.
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:36.000]   Sometimes we will give up
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.760]   because we just think it's not worth it.
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:44.800]   Jesus said it's worth it because there was a future
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:48.320]   and the future is reward.
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:51.360]   Let's continue to read this letter, verse 10 and following.
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:56.720]   Since you have kept my command to endure patiently,
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:59.440]   I will also keep you from the hour of trial
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:02.640]   that is going to come upon the whole earth,
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:07.640]   the whole world to test those who live on the earth.
[00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:08.640]   Now, this is very interesting.
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:09.920]   Let's unpack this.
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:14.920]   He said, "You have kept my word to endure patiently."
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:16.480]   I like the old translation.
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:21.560]   The older translation would use the word steadfastness.
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:24.680]   Steadfastness, yeah, we don't use that word anymore.
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:29.680]   But steadfastness, it means remaining and unyielding
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:34.720]   in the face of passing time.
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:41.200]   As times go by, you are unyielding in your spirit.
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:43.560]   You keep on going.
[00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:48.560]   That is endurance, patience.
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:52.200]   And also Jesus said, "If you do that,
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:53.700]   "I've seen you do that.
[00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:58.440]   "Since you have kept my command patiently and stand fastly,
[00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:03.440]   "I will also keep you from troubles in the future."
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:08.040]   Now, in the later chapters of the book of Revelation,
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:11.640]   the book talks about the coming intense, difficult time
[00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:15.680]   for the first generation, first century church.
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:17.840]   There will be a big calamity,
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:21.560]   apocalypse happening in the world.
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:23.960]   And a lot of people will suffer.
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:27.000]   And a lot of Christians will be tested.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.440]   And many more from the book of Revelation,
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:34.440]   we know that they will be a martyr as well.
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:39.640]   But to this church, because they have little strength,
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:42.920]   but they have kept the word, they kept on going,
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:47.080]   Jesus promised them, "I will not put extra burden on you
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:48.900]   "because you have been faithful day after day,
[00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:52.560]   "and I observe it for a long, long time.
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:57.560]   "So I will shield you from other troubles,
[00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:00.680]   "from other difficulties that are coming."
[00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:03.620]   And that is a word of comfort.
[00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:11.080]   Have you ever asked the question, what God require of you?
[00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:16.320]   I remember when I was studying theology,
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:19.160]   one of my professors said something
[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:21.380]   that really stick into my mind.
[00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:27.520]   He said, "What does God really require of you,
[00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:33.300]   "require of us, especially in our context in North America?"
[00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:35.640]   Well, we are not in a country
[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:39.200]   that is openly hostile to the gospel.
[00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:40.960]   We have freedom.
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:43.240]   We can choose to come to church.
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:45.280]   We can choose to follow Jesus.
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:47.240]   And yeah, there may be some difficulty.
[00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:49.760]   There may be some challenges from our family members
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.560]   who are unbelievers.
[00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:54.620]   Maybe it's from our neighbors or whatever.
[00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:57.800]   But in terms of the level of persecution,
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:00.320]   there is nothing, right?
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:03.480]   So my professor asked, "What does God really require of you?"
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:06.720]   And he asked a very interesting question.
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:10.360]   He said, "Do you think God really requires
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.720]   "so much out of us?
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:14.320]   "What does God demand?"
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:19.400]   In terms of that demand, it's actually very reasonable,
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:23.520]   very light, and God expects us to worship Him,
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:29.700]   to dwell in His Word, day by day, to live faithfully,
[00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:35.560]   to bear the name of Christ, to be a good witness.
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:37.520]   That is not so difficult.
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:42.440]   God is not requiring you to die on the cross physically,
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:47.020]   right, to go through some physical, intense suffering.
[00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:52.040]   There may be Christians in other parts of the world,
[00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:54.480]   like in the Muslim country or communist country.
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:26:00.440]   They may have to go through some of this
[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:03.260]   really, really trying time.
[00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:08.260]   But for us, it's actually pretty light, pretty easy.
[00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:11.820]   And what God has required for us
[00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:15.700]   is that we will follow Christ faithfully day after day.
[00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:19.040]   That's pretty much our habit.
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:21.040]   That's pretty much our pattern of life.
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:26.560]   So this letter reminds us,
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:29.160]   your little work, your faithful work,
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:32.560]   will be remembered and will be rewarded.
[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:34.200]   Let's finish reading this letter.
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:36.360]   Jesus said, "I'm coming soon.
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:38.680]   "Hold on to what you have.
[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:40.480]   "Even though you have only a little,
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:42.340]   "hold on to what you have
[00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:44.880]   "so that no one will take your crown.
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:49.160]   "Him who overcomes, I will make a pillar
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:50.760]   "in the temple of my God.
[00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:52.880]   "Never again will He leave it.
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:57.560]   "I will write on Him the name of my God
[00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:01.260]   "and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem,
[00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:03.800]   "who is coming down out of heaven from my God.
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:06.960]   "And I will also write on Him my new name.
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:08.600]   "He who has ears, let him hear
[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:11.240]   "what the Spirit says to the churches."
[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:15.520]   He says pillar in the temple, in the new temple.
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:17.400]   In the book of Revelation, in the later chapters,
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:20.520]   in the final chapters, God said the new temple will come,
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:22.760]   the new Jerusalem will come.
[00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:24.720]   And as you know, if you study a little bit,
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:27.080]   or know a little bit about architecture,
[00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:31.800]   the ancient temples have big columns, huge columns.
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:35.260]   You know, the Doric columns, the Ionic columns,
[00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:37.120]   the Corinthians column.
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:39.560]   All those different columns are standing
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:43.940]   to support the temple, and it's part of the temple structure.
[00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:49.120]   If you've gone to a film museum, those are the columns
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:51.360]   the ancient architects will put
[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:53.560]   into the structure of the temple.
[00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:56.040]   And the temple is the house of God.
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:58.680]   The temple is where God dwells.
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:02.400]   And here is the picture of stability,
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:07.400]   a picture of security, that we can be part of the pillar,
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:12.960]   part of the house of God, to support it,
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:17.160]   as a fair, be part of the fair structure
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:20.100]   of God's new temple.
[00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:23.920]   The city of God, the new Jerusalem,
[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:27.480]   will descend one day from heaven,
[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:29.380]   and God will dwell among us.
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:35.160]   See, being part of God's temple, God's home,
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:40.620]   means that you are always in God's home.
[00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:44.140]   God will always remember you.
[00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:48.160]   And so often, we don't wanna serve, we don't wanna give,
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:50.000]   because it's too hard for us.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.280]   We don't wanna use our talents,
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:53.100]   we don't wanna give our treasure,
[00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:55.280]   because it's just too difficult for us.
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:59.800]   But if we, if we do that,
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:02.000]   we have this kind of perspective.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.720]   It's only because it's too difficult,
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:05.020]   that's why we don't do it.
[00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:07.920]   But we have to ask ourselves,
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:10.520]   do we really believe in God?
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:14.480]   Do we really believe that God is good?
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:18.640]   Do we really believe that God is our strength?
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:21.600]   And God is sufficient?
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:27.200]   Here, although the letter is a letter of praise,
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:31.720]   it's also a reminder, or perhaps a warning.
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:36.000]   Warning to all of us, as we read through this letter,
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.500]   hey, you need to make sure
[00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:42.780]   that no one will take your crown away.
[00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:48.460]   Yeah, your crown, your glory can be taken away.
[00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:52.080]   If you don't remember, if you forget
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:56.360]   that your work right here, right now,
[00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:59.960]   your work of serving, your work of following Jesus
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:01.760]   will be remembered.
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:03.840]   If you do not remember that,
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:07.440]   it's a warning and reminder
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:09.140]   that your crown can be taken away.
[00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:15.880]   We can lose our place in God, we can.
[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:16.780]   It's possible.
[00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:21.840]   It's possible if we don't keep on trusting God,
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:24.240]   we lose our place in the kingdom.
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:25.320]   We'll lose our crown.
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:29.280]   But the letter reminds us with words of comfort,
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:33.880]   words of encouragement, God will remember your work,
[00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:35.840]   no matter what that is.
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:39.840]   You do it in the name of Jesus, you do it by faith.
[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:41.680]   Maybe you don't see the fruit right now,
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:43.960]   maybe you don't see the fruit tomorrow,
[00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:46.080]   or next week, or next month, or next year.
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:49.200]   But if you do it by faith, God will reward it.
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.160]   God will remember.
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:54.320]   So your work matters to God, and your work
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:56.400]   will be remembered.
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:59.120]   Don't you forget that.
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:03.280]   Don't you forget that as we build a church together.
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:09.400]   Last week we were in our general assembly,
[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:14.840]   and we shared a lot of different updates, right?
[00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:18.320]   And needs.
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:19.920]   As our church grow together,
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:23.800]   we need brother and sister to come on board
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:27.520]   and one of the things we can do is to give.
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:32.960]   Because we are growing and our financial need is bigger.
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:34.160]   It's bigger than ever.
[00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:36.960]   It is part of the growing pain.
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:40.440]   And we have to remember that our work,
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:43.240]   our contribution will be remembered.
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:46.080]   Right?
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:48.040]   It will be rewarded.
[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:51.480]   And don't you forget that your crown,
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:53.040]   our crown can be taken away.
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:55.520]   So let's press on, guys.
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:32:01.480]   Let's press on as a family of God to do the good work,
[00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:03.360]   to do the ministry in the name of Jesus,
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:08.280]   to serve Him, to build His body, to build His kingdom.
[00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:09.480]   Let's all pray together.
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:14.960]   Father, we come before You,
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:17.480]   we just open our hearts and our life.
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:22.120]   And we confess sometimes we are forgetful.
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:27.320]   Sometimes we see things using worldly standard,
[00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:29.280]   worldly perspective.
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:32.200]   And thus we quit.
[00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:39.120]   So we give up because we thought it's not worth it.
[00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:43.480]   But yet Your letter to us
[00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:49.520]   bring us a new and transcendent
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:54.120]   perspective on all the things that we do.
[00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:56.720]   Help us to follow You,
[00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:59.440]   even though we have little strength,
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:05.680]   but we know that our work, our ministries, our serving,
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:09.080]   all that we do in the name of Christ,
[00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:13.560]   all that we do for Your gospel, for Your kingdom
[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:15.560]   will be remembered.
[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:20.480]   And thank You for calling all of us to be Your partners
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:22.440]   so that we can work for Your kingdom,
[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:24.080]   we can build up Your kingdom.
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:28.480]   What a glorious role and responsibility You lay on us.
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:31.000]   And thank You for giving us such an easy context
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.520]   in North America.
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:35.240]   We can follow You freely, we can serve You freely,
[00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:37.960]   and that's why we need to give You more.
[00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:39.960]   And thank You for Your blessing.
[00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:42.760]   We need to give You more to respond to Your goodness,
[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:48.960]   to Your abundance, so that we can give more,
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:50.440]   we can serve You more,
[00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:54.520]   to uplift the name of Jesus in the midst of us.
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:57.880]   And once again, we wanna close in prayer,
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:01.280]   and we just wanna pray that You will make us
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:03.120]   into Your instrument.
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:06.280]   We can glorify Your name, we can bear witness
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:09.600]   to the goodness of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:12.360]   And thank You for being our God.
[00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:13.800]   And thank You for Your love and grace
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:15.600]   and Your comfort and encouragement.
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:18.400]   Help us to press on.
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:23.200]   To follow You faithfully, day by day,
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:24.440]   in Christ's name, we pray.
[00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:26.560]   Well, God bless you all,
[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:30.440]   and hopefully you will go out this week
[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:33.120]   to bear witness to the name of Christ
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:35.600]   and serve God in the name of Christ.
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:39.440]   Do so by faith, and God will remember it.
[00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:40.880]   All right, see you next week.
