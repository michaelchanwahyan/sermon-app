1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
 (speaking in foreign language)

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,920
 In Christ's name we pray.

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:10,840
 - Well, I wanna say Merry Christmas to all of you.

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,880
 And I think like many of you,

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,140
 Christmas can be a crazy time.

6
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:21,560
 It can be a very busy time.

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,280
 And this Christmas season,

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,960
 I'm thinking of fathers, mothers,

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,560
 hardworking people in the restaurants

10
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,920
 who are running, operating in our society,

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,200
 making sure our loved ones are being taken care of.

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,200
 And today I know many of you who are part of our church,

13
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,160
 you did your best to make this church a better place.

14
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,440
 Especially today, those who are in the backstage,

15
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,560
 those who prepare the table,

16
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,880
 those who prepare the good food that we're gonna enjoy,

17
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,800
 and the people and the personnel on stage,

18
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,840
 the musicians and all the helpers.

19
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,320
 I know this is a crazy, busy time,

20
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,200
 but it's also a time for us to slow down,

21
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,400
 to think about what this season is all about,

22
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,200
 what Christmas is all about.

23
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,900
 I also think of many of you,

24
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:27,520
 or even many of us who are joining us online

25
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,680
 and cannot be on site.

26
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,840
 I'm thinking of you because I know you're going through

27
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,360
 some crisis in your life,

28
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,740
 some troubles, some difficulties.

29
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:44,080
 And you are one of those taking care of the sick,

30
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,260
 the dying in your family.

31
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,800
 And know that God is with you.

32
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,880
 This is a challenging time.

33
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,700
 Maybe you are dealing with broken relationships.

34
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,220
 Maybe you're dealing with a lot of uncertainty.

35
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:09,040
 And many of us, this holiday season is not easy.

36
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,460
 It's a tough season.

37
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:15,880
 But this is the time we should turn to God.

38
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,920
 We should turn our eyes to heaven

39
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,160
 because Christmas is a special time

40
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,360
 when we celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ,

41
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,960
 someone who is special.

42
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:34,920
 In Jesus Christ, we have everlasting joy,

43
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,720
 not happiness.

44
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:43,840
 We have everlasting peace, not temporary peace.

45
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:50,360
 In Jesus Christ, we have hope, hope that is everlasting.

46
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:55,240
 I know you probably listen to a lot of songs

47
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:59,760
 about Christmas on radio or on Spotify.

48
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,840
 If you pay attention to some of these Christmas songs,

49
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,120
 Christmas hymns, some of them are hundreds of years old,

50
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,240
 very, very old.

51
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,940
 And you listen to the lyrics.

52
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,560
 All of these Christmas songs

53
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,360
 speak about the most basic human desire,

54
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,640
 the desire deep down in our heart.

55
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,480
 We yearn for peace in our time of chaos.

56
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,780
 We yearn for joy in our time of sadness.

57
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:40,640
 We yearn for someone to be with us, and we feel lonely.

58
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:46,080
 We yearn for hope when we see there's no end in the tunnel.

59
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,280
 It is no wonder that in this Christmas season,

60
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,240
 the rate of suicide and depression increase.

61
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,840
 It's no wonder.

62
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,720
 This is a very depressing time for many of us.

63
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:07,480
 But yes, even though we are in a difficult time,

64
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,640
 even though we see a lot of oppressions, injustice,

65
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,320
 darkness in our world,

66
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,680
 we are reminded on this Christmas Sunday

67
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,600
 that a newborn King was given to all of us.

68
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:30,960
 (speaking in foreign language)

69
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,480
 (speaking in foreign language)

70
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,400
 (speaking in foreign language)

71
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,320
 (speaking in foreign language)

72
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,240
 (speaking in foreign language)

73
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,200
 (speaking in foreign language)

74
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,960
 (speaking in foreign language)

75
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,880
 (speaking in foreign language)

76
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,640
 (speaking in foreign language)

77
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:09,400
 (speaking in foreign language)

78
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,320
 (speaking in foreign language)

79
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,240
 (speaking in foreign language)

80
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,160
 (speaking in foreign language)

81
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,120
 (speaking in foreign language)

82
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,040
 (speaking in foreign language)

83
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,000
 So in this Christmas,

84
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,840
 we wanna turn our attention to this child.

85
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:04,920
 The kid, the infant was born for all of us.

86
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:10,040
 (speaking in foreign language)

87
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:18,080
 We're gonna ask the children's choir to come up here

88
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,360
 and they will help us to celebrate Christmas

89
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,760
 by singing two very old Christmas hymns.

90
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:31,600
 (speaking in foreign language)

91
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:56,240
 (speaking in foreign language)

92
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,760
 Well, let's give them a big hand again.

93
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,920
 (audience applauding)

94
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:06,440
 The first Christmas was recorded in the Bible,

95
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:11,680
 in the book of Matthew, Matthew chapter one.

96
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,160
 This is how Jesus the Messiah was born.

97
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:22,000
 His mother Mary was engaged to be married to Joseph.

98
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,560
 But before the marriage took place,

99
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,000
 while she was still a virgin,

100
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,240
 she became pregnant through the power of the Holy Spirit.

101
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,240
 And Joseph, to whom she was engaged, was a righteous man

102
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,480
 and did not want to disgrace her publicly.

103
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:41,800
 So he decided to break the engagement quietly.

104
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,320
 As Joseph considered this,

105
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,880
 an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream.

106
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,200
 "Joseph, son of David," the angel said,

107
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,960
 "do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife

108
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,080
 because the child within her

109
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,920
 was conceived by the Holy Spirit.

110
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:06,280
 And she will have a son, and you are to name him Jesus,

111
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:11,000
 for he will save his people from their sins."

112
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,360
 (speaking in foreign language)

113
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,800
 (speaking in foreign language)

114
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,720
 (speaking in foreign language)

115
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,640
 (speaking in foreign language)

116
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,560
 (speaking in foreign language)

117
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,480
 (speaking in foreign language)

118
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:40,400
 (speaking in foreign language)

119
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,320
 (speaking in foreign language)

120
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,760
 Now, as you read this portion of the story of Christmas,

121
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,600
 this is a profound mystery,

122
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,640
 perhaps the most profound mystery of all.

123
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:25,040
 God himself incarnate came to our world,

124
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,880
 fully divine, but fully human.

125
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,660
 There's something beyond our rationality can explain.

126
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,320
 This is the most profound truth in the Bible.

127
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,440
 And when Joseph received the news,

128
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,440
 God is saying to Joseph,

129
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,520
 "My plan is different from your plan.

130
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:51,520
 My will is higher than your will."

131
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,560
 Yes, for Joseph, if you can imagine,

132
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,680
 he was trying to build his own simple family, right?

133
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,120
 Have a good life, have a small family in Israel

134
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,020
 to farm or to be a carpenter,

135
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:08,080
 just want to live a normal life.

136
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:14,560
 But God said to him, and to Mary, to this holy family,

137
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:20,080
 he said, "I want to send the Savior through your family."

138
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:24,240
 Now, this is also profound,

139
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,040
 because at times you see in this story,

140
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,940
 God will act in a way that is different from your plan.

141
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,140
 You may have your own plan,

142
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,520
 and you may have thought your plan

143
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,460
 is the most perfect plan of all,

144
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,120
 but God shows up.

145
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:46,560
 Christmas is telling us that God is close to us

146
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,900
 and God can do his work.

147
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,720
 Something that is higher than your will,

148
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,640
 something that is different than your plan.

149
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,560
 But again and again, God's way is different.

150
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:07,900
 Though it's different, it is the best.

151
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,820
 So Joseph obeyed God and took Mary,

152
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,720
 who was conceived by the power of God,

153
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,240
 and son was born.

154
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,460
 And because of their obedience,

155
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:24,080
 God's saving plan for all of us sinners is fulfilled.

156
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:28,340
 (speaking in foreign language)

157
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:32,260
 (speaking in foreign language)

158
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:36,180
 (speaking in foreign language)

159
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:40,940
 (speaking in foreign language)

160
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:44,860
 (speaking in foreign language)

161
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:49,060
 (speaking in foreign language)

162
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:52,980
 (speaking in foreign language)

163
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,900
 (speaking in foreign language)

164
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:01,820
 (speaking in foreign language)

165
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:05,740
 (speaking in foreign language)

166
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:09,660
 (speaking in foreign language)

167
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:13,580
 (speaking in foreign language)

168
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:17,500
 (speaking in foreign language)

169
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,420
 (speaking in foreign language)

170
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:26,420
 the Lord. (speaking in foreign language)

171
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:30,340
 (speaking in foreign language)

172
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:55,940
 Now if you read this scripture again in 121,

173
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:59,900
 in the book of Matthew, it says,

174
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:04,900
 she will have a son and you are to name him Jesus.

175
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,980
 Right?

176
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,140
 Name him Jesus.

177
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,180
 His name will be Jesus.

178
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:14,100
 (speaking in foreign language)

179
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,860
 Now what does it mean?

180
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:22,500
 What does the name Jesus mean?

181
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:29,180
 Now in Hebrew, Jesus will sound like this.

182
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,700
 Yeah, sure.

183
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,820
 In Greek, it's Yesu.

184
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:38,140
 In Mandarin, it's Yesu, right?

185
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,940
 In Cantonese, it's Yesu, right?

186
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:45,780
 (speaking in foreign language)

187
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,740
 (audience laughing)

188
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,780
 The name Jesus, what does it mean?

189
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:55,300
 It means saving, to rescue, to redeem.

190
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,340
 That's why we call him savior.

191
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,420
 Because the name Jesus, Yesu,

192
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:05,800
 it means to save us from something.

193
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:12,140
 And the story says, Jesus is gonna save us from sin,

194
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:17,720
 from death, from the power of darkness.

195
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,200
 Now as I said before, I know many of us

196
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,520
 are facing different challenges

197
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,840
 and seeing a lot of different forms

198
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,260
 of injustice and oppression.

199
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:34,160
 In the time of Jesus, many people thought that way too,

200
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,260
 because they were under the shadow of the Roman Empire.

201
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:43,260
 And the Roman Empire was an oppressive regime.

202
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:47,280
 And today, many of us,

203
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:51,320
 certainly we see some situations similar

204
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,560
 to what they had before.

205
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:57,040
 We see a situation that is oppressive

206
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,640
 in many other countries, or even in our society.

207
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:05,080
 Because we see all the brokenness in our world.

208
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,620
 We see sin and darkness.

209
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:12,380
 Some of the people think if we have the right policy,

210
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:15,640
 if we have the right precedent,

211
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,720
 if we have the right political power,

212
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,180
 all of these issues will be resolved.

213
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:26,300
 But the Bible cuts through all of these answers

214
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,920
 and telling us the root problem is sinfulness.

215
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:35,900
 Is that we are sinful, all of us, living in darkness.

216
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,120
 And we need a savior.

217
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,600
 And only Jesus himself can save us

218
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,040
 from that kind of darkness.

219
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:48,320
 Because until the power of sin is broken,

220
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,880
 all changes are superficial.

221
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,560
 Only when God came to our world in our heart

222
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,280
 and start to transform us,

223
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,900
 then our relationships can be reconciled.

224
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,880
 Our world can be changed.

225
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,320
 And that's why we celebrate Christmas.

226
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,360
 And perhaps the story of first Christmas

227
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,800
 remains the most profound mystery.

228
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,960
 Because on the first Christmas,

229
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:16,200
 this baby, the newborn king, was born,

230
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,560
 fully human and fully divine.

231
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,560
 And he is the bridge between us and God himself.

232
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:28,120
 Christmas shows us God is near.

233
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:33,940
 Now the year of 2022 is coming to a close.

234
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:37,760
 Perhaps this year is tough and challenging for you.

235
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,280
 It's very critical for you.

236
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:45,020
 And my prayer is that we will all turn to God,

237
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:50,200
 knowing that only in Jesus, our newborn king,

238
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:54,520
 we can have true peace, true joy, and true hope.

239
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:59,040
 So as we continue to worship, we will light the candle.

240
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,760
 And as we light the candle,

241
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:05,600
 as we pass the light from one to the next neighbor,

242
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,560
 and then on and on, as we light up the room,

243
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,800
 I want you to say a prayer.

244
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,920
 Say a prayer, first of all, for yourself.

245
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:20,440
 Maybe you are facing some difficulties.

246
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,320
 Maybe you are facing some issues

247
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,060
 that is beyond your ability to solve.

248
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,120
 Say a prayer for yourself.

249
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,500
 Let God be your God.

250
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,240
 Then also say a second prayer

251
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,640
 for someone you know who is needy in this season.

252
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,560
 Maybe a family member, maybe a friend or relative,

253
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,440
 maybe a neighbor.

254
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,160
 Say a prayer for them.

255
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,760
 May God be with them.

 (speaking in foreign language)

281
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,840
 So as we continue to worship, we will light the candle

282
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:05,960
 and we'll pass the light from one to the other.

283
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,720
 I know you have some candles on your table

284
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,520
 and you can get that prepared.

285
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,840
 Make sure you get the tray ready.

286
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:20,120
 This is our tradition at UV in our church.

287
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:24,440
 On Christmas Sunday, we will light the candle

288
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,080
 and pass the light.

289
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,280
 And we will light up the room together.

290
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:35,240
 And this symbolizes the newborn king who has come,

291
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,000
 who has come to save us.

292
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,600
 He dispels all kinds of darkness

293
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,920
 because light always conquers darkness.

 - 1 John chapter four, for God is love.

348
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:49,520
 God show us how much he love us

349
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,480
 by sending his one and only son into the world

350
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,760
 so that we might have eternal life through him.

351
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:01,480
 This is real love, not that we love God,

352
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:06,480
 but that he loved us and sent his son as a sacrifice

353
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,480
 to take away our sins.

354
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:14,600

 (speaking in foreign language)

356
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:37,740
 This is love.

357
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:41,700
 (speaking in foreign language)

358
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,460
 There's no wonder why Christmas is a time

359
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:47,300
 to give gifts to each other,

360
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:51,960
 to exchange gifts with our friends.

361
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:56,880
 I know we will have a game of white oven later,

362
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,580
 but let's hold onto this

363
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:06,300
 because I believe it will be worthwhile

364
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:09,880
 for us to ask ourselves the question.

365
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:15,640
 Now, if you have the opportunity to ask God

366
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:20,640
 for a gift in this season, what would that be?

367
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,140
 If you pray to God, you have the opportunity

368
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:28,980
 to grant you one wish, one prayer, what would that be?

369
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:33,520
 What would that be considered a gift for you in this season?

370
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,780
 Perhaps you are thinking of a lot of different things,

371
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:42,700
 perhaps a better career, a better future,

372
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:47,740
 a better relationship, a better house, a better car,

373
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:51,080
 or whatever that is better than what you have.

374
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:55,840
 And I believe that God can certainly grant

375
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,500
 these good things to all of us.

376
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,540
 But here the Bible says,

377
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:06,180
 "God has already granted us the greatest gift."

378
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:11,020
 And this greatest gift is what we are celebrating today.

379
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:14,940
 It's the one and only Son, Jesus Christ,

380
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:19,360
 His salvation, His one and only Son

381
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,160
 who will grant us eternal life, life indeed.

382
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:28,660
 But this scripture tells us why does God do this?

383
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:32,800
 Why did God give us His one and only Son?

384
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:36,760
 Because of His love.

385
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:42,760
 The greatest gift is given to us because of His love,

386
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:48,980
 because it is who God is and giving us the best,

387
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,180
 the best gift of all.
