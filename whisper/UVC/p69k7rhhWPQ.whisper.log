[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.680]   Good morning family and welcome.
[00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:07.480]   I'm really excited that we're opening God's Word again together this morning.
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.280]   And this morning we're going to start looking at something new, a new study here for the
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.720]   next few weeks, and that is really looking at biblical examples of our response to God's
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:23.080]   goodness, our response as the people of God to God's goodness and God's work in our lives.
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.040]   And specifically this morning we're going to be focusing on gratefulness and on seeking
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.640]   to begin to have an attitude of gratefulness towards God.
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.280]   So I know this is going to be really good for me.
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.680]   Gratefulness is something that I always struggle with and something I need to focus on more.
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.680]   So I'm excited.
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.480]   I think it's going to be good for me and I pray that it'll be really good and encouraging
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.160]   for you as well.
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.840]   We're going to be looking in Exodus chapter 15 this morning.
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:55.600]   And Exodus chapter 15 is this song that's often called the Song of Moses and it's the
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:02.960]   song that the children of Israel composed basically extemporaneously on the spot, spontaneously,
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:09.500]   this song of praise and gratefulness to God just after they came through the Red Sea.
[00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.440]   So if you're not real familiar with this story, I'll kind of give a quick narrative of it,
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.960]   but you could look at these chapters in Exodus for yourself, especially chapter 14, which
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.000]   tells the story of the Red Sea.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.760]   But the preceding chapters in the book of Exodus are the story of the children of Israel
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.960]   being delivered by God from the land of Egypt.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:36.280]   And if you remember that story, the children of Israel, the Hebrew people, the Jewish nation
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.400]   are in Egypt.
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:45.320]   They've been there for generations and over time, what was originally a friendly relationship
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.920]   with the Egyptians has become an oppressive one.
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.880]   And so Pharaoh has enslaved the Hebrew people.
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.120]   And so they're slaves in Egypt and they're forced to do really hard labor to build for
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.400]   the Egyptians.
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.000]   And also Pharaoh decides that he doesn't want their strength to grow, doesn't want their
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   nation to grow.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.960]   And so he begins to kill their sons.
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.960]   And so it's a really, really terrible, oppressive situation, the children of Israel, the Hebrew
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.400]   people are in.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.320]   They're God's people, but they're in a place of deep oppression and deep pain and deep
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:27.220]   hurt because they're enslaved and they're being treated unjustly in so many ways.
[00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.320]   And eventually God raises up Moses to be a deliverer to them.
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.320]   Moses goes and speaks to Pharaoh and tells Pharaoh that God wants Pharaoh to let his
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.880]   people go.
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.200]   And Pharaoh resists and says no.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.840]   And so then Moses brings the plagues into Egypt, really God brings them into Egypt,
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.120]   but Moses is the messenger that continues to speak to Pharaoh and to the Egyptian leaders
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.760]   to tell them that God is bringing these plagues as a result of their rebellion against God
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.800]   and the fact that they won't let his people go.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.440]   And so all these plagues come against Egypt.
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.640]   And again, if you're familiar with that story, you know what those are.
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.800]   If not, you can look at it and read it.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.320]   But God does all these supernatural things basically.
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.720]   Some of them are very fearful and terrifying, but he does them to show the Egyptians his
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:22.160]   own power and to force Pharaoh to let the Hebrew nation go free.
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:28.520]   And so finally after the tenth plague, Pharaoh decides to let the Hebrews go and the entire
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.480]   Hebrew nation leaves Egypt and they go out into the wilderness.
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.480]   Well Pharaoh quickly changes his mind and says let's go get them.
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:44.320]   And at this time in world history, the Egyptian nation was really an empire, really a dynasty,
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.080]   and it was the most powerful empire on the face of the earth and they had the most powerful
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.080]   and fearsome army.
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.920]   And so Pharaoh says we are going to go and get the Hebrews and bring them back and put
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.000]   them back to work and enslave them once again for us.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.640]   And he takes his enormous army to go get them.
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.960]   And as I said, this was the most fearsome army in the world and they had the best technology.
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.840]   They had chariots and other weapons of warfare that were the most advanced technological
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.400]   weapons that existed in the world at that time.
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:23.680]   And so this was a very scary army and by now the Israelites had journeyed down close to
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.040]   the Red Sea and that's where they were when the army of Pharaoh caught up with them.
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.640]   And God was leading them in a pillar of fire by night and a pillar of cloud by the day.
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.200]   So they are literally relying on God day by day for guidance and for leadership and for
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.480]   provision.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.680]   Moses is leading them as a representative between the people and God, but God himself
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.920]   is leading them and protecting them.
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.600]   But when Pharaoh's giant army comes up behind them, they are terrified because they find
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:59.000]   themselves closed in with the sea on one side and this massive fearsome army with all of
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.720]   these weapons of warfare on the other.
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.920]   And they are afraid that they are just going to be destroyed and eradicated and killed
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.240]   and it seems like there is no way out.
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.120]   So they cry out to God for deliverance.
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:17.080]   God puts the thick cloud between his people and Pharaoh's army to keep Pharaoh's army
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:23.480]   away and then God begins to roll back the waters of the Red Sea.
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.000]   And as I said, this story is in Exodus 14.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.200]   If you'd like to look at it, it's a really good story.
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.920]   God moves back the water so much that there are basically walls of water on each side
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:40.200]   with dry land in the middle and the Hebrew nation are able to walk across on dry land.
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.680]   And this is a large group of people by now.
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.560]   The Hebrew nation has grown very large and very strong during this time in Egypt and
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.980]   so it's a huge group of people.
[00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.920]   God holds back the waters long enough for them to get all the way across.
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.320]   It probably took all night for them to cross.
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:00.280]   And then God removes the cloud and the army of Pharaoh sees that the people are gone and
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:05.480]   sees the dry land in the middle of the sea and sees that they've been able to get out
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.440]   and decides, "Hey, we're going to pursue them."
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:13.040]   And begins to pursue and God lets back the water and the waters come rushing back in
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.040]   and destroy the army of Pharaoh.
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:22.320]   And so God in one miraculous event, he delivers his people and he destroys the enemy that
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.320]   are seeking to harm them and to kill them.
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:31.360]   So this is an absolutely amazing and miraculous event in the history of God's people.
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:36.040]   And immediately after this, when they're safe on the other side of the Red Sea, they begin
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.720]   to sing this song of praise.
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.460]   It's found in Exodus chapter 15.
[00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:41.460]   So let's read some of it.
[00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:42.880]   We're going to read the first 13 verses.
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:47.600]   It says this, "Then Moses and the people of Israel sang this song to the Lord, saying,
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.260]   'I will sing to the Lord, for he has triumphed gloriously.
[00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.960]   The horse and his rider he has thrown into the sea.
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:57.940]   The Lord is my strength and my song, and he has become my salvation.
[00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:02.920]   This is my God, and I will praise him, my Father's God, and I will exalt him.
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.200]   The Lord is a man of war.
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.720]   The Lord is his name.
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:11.040]   Pharaoh's chariots and his host he cast into the sea, and his chosen officers were sunk
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.260]   in the Red Sea.
[00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:13.360]   The floods covered them.
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.940]   They went down into the depths like a stone.
[00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:20.820]   Your right hand, O Lord, glorious in power, your right hand, O Lord, shatters the enemy.
[00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:24.400]   In the greatness of your majesty you overthrow your adversaries.
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.900]   You send out your fury.
[00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:27.680]   It consumes them like stubble.
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.580]   At the blast of your nostrils the waters piled up.
[00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.380]   The floods stood up in a heap.
[00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.960]   The deeps congealed in the heart of the sea.
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.820]   The enemy said, 'I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil.
[00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:40.860]   My desire shall have its fill of them.
[00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.140]   I will draw my sword.
[00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:44.420]   My hand shall destroy them.'
[00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:46.300]   You blew with your wind.
[00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:47.380]   The sea covered them.
[00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:49.660]   They sank like lead in the mighty waters.
[00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:51.860]   Who is like you, O Lord, among the gods?
[00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:57.020]   Who is like you, majestic in holiness, awesome in glorious deeds, doing wonders?
[00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:58.540]   You stretched out your right hand.
[00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:00.020]   The earth swallowed them.
[00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:04.220]   You have led in your steadfast love the people whom you have redeemed.
[00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:09.900]   You have guided them by your strength to your holy abode."
[00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:16.020]   And I think there's just so much powerful truth in this passage for us about how to
[00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:23.060]   be grateful and how to learn to celebrate and reflect on and appreciate the goodness
[00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:25.260]   of God in our lives.
[00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:31.420]   The first thing I want us to see here is that when we experience God's goodness in our life,
[00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:36.700]   when we go through something that causes us to reflect on God's goodness, we first of
[00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:40.220]   all need to really place our focus on God.
[00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:41.900]   I love that about this song.
[00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:46.900]   This is the song, like I said, it's often called the song of Moses, but this song doesn't
[00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:48.900]   talk about Moses at all.
[00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:51.860]   It doesn't talk about the Hebrew nation at all, really.
[00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:56.020]   I mean, it does some as their relationship to God, as the people of God, but it doesn't
[00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:58.700]   talk about them and their strength in any way.
[00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:02.780]   It just talks about God and how powerful He is.
[00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:08.100]   The focus in this is clearly on God because of the things that He has done.
[00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:13.540]   And I think that's a really instructive thought for us when we go through things in our life.
[00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:18.540]   A lot of times when something good happens and we experience God's goodness in some way,
[00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:23.620]   we begin to credit ourselves and we think, "Yeah, this happened because I did a great
[00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:24.620]   job.
[00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:25.620]   I figured something out.
[00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:26.620]   I tried harder.
[00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:27.620]   I worked harder.
[00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:30.220]   I am smarter than other people."
[00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:34.020]   We begin to credit ourselves or maybe we credit other humans around us and say, "Well, it
[00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:39.340]   happened because this person that's my friend or my family member or this person that I'm
[00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:43.380]   associated with in some way, they're really good at this."
[00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.100]   And that is true.
[00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:47.260]   God gifts us and He gifts the people around us.
[00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:53.820]   And it's certainly good for us to lift up the people around us and encourage them and
[00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:57.980]   cite their roles in any success that we might have.
[00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:01.380]   But we have to be honest and begin to credit God.
[00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:06.540]   In these verses you see again and again it talks about who is the strength in the song.
[00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:07.700]   That's the Lord.
[00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:09.300]   Who is the one who is worthy of praise?
[00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:10.300]   That's God.
[00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:11.300]   Who's the one who has triumphed?
[00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:12.520]   It's the Lord.
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:16.100]   Who is glorious in power and defeats the enemy?
[00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.700]   That's God and His right hand.
[00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:22.260]   The focus is clearly on God.
[00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:26.700]   And so many times when something good happens, when we get that promotion that we've been
[00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:33.260]   praying for, we do well in school and we finally graduate, or we get that degree that we've
[00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:38.620]   been working for for so long, or we graduate high school, or we get a new place to live,
[00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:43.340]   a new apartment or a new house, or we get a new car, you know, all those things that
[00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:46.420]   we pray and ask God for and we desire.
[00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:49.420]   And then God brings those things into our life.
[00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:54.620]   And then suddenly we just think that we did it ourselves and we forget to credit God and
[00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:59.300]   to begin to praise Him and to begin to focus on Him.
[00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:03.620]   And you know, what's even more sad than that is oftentimes good things happen and we simply
[00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:06.140]   don't consider God at all.
[00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:08.020]   Sometimes we just take things for granted.
[00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:11.340]   Like it's just a coincidence that something happened in our life.
[00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:15.380]   Like it's just a coincidence that that relationship in our life was restored.
[00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:20.340]   It's just a coincidence that our health was preserved in some way.
[00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:23.100]   We just act like all those things are coincidences.
[00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:26.940]   I think it's pretty clear when you look at Scripture and the way God cares for His people
[00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:28.420]   that that's not the case.
[00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:32.260]   God is at work and He is doing good things for His people.
[00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.700]   And so we need to recognize that.
[00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:38.340]   And we shouldn't just assume that everything's a coincidence or that it just worked out that
[00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:41.820]   way because, you know, we're a little bit better, a little bit smarter than someone
[00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:42.820]   else.
[00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:48.140]   We should say, "Hey, this good thing that happened in my life, this is because of God.
[00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:49.140]   And I believe that."
[00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:51.860]   Especially if it's something that we prayed and asked God for.
[00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:56.420]   How self-absorbed are we if we pray and ask God for something and then He provides it
[00:11:56.420 --> 00:12:00.740]   in our life and we turn around and never say thank you and we just act like, "Yeah, this
[00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:06.500]   was supposed to happen anyway," or, "I expected this because I'm so great."
[00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:09.620]   And we never give the credit that is due to God.
[00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:13.460]   We've got to learn to begin to do that more and more in our lives.
[00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:17.060]   And we've got to learn to just start to pay attention to God's work.
[00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:20.140]   Sometimes we're just ignorant of the fact that God is at work.
[00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:23.660]   We don't even see it because we're just not paying attention.
[00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:29.140]   Or sometimes even worse, we have an attitude of entitlement and maybe God does something
[00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:33.420]   really good in our lives and we just say, "Well, yeah, of course that's supposed to
[00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:34.420]   happen.
[00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:37.980]   You know, it's supposed to work out that way for me because I'm a good guy.
[00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:41.140]   I worked hard for this or this is what I deserve.
[00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:43.100]   And so of course I was going to get that."
[00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:48.180]   And again, in all those different ways and circumstances, we forget to focus on God.
[00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:50.500]   We forget to give Him credit for what He's doing.
[00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:55.100]   We forget to praise Him and to thank Him for all of the good things that He does in our
[00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:56.100]   life.
[00:12:56.100 --> 00:13:00.020]   And you know, another important thing that's really essential for us to do in order to
[00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:05.940]   be grateful is to begin to place our focus on God's work and on what God is doing in
[00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:07.180]   our lives.
[00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:11.860]   And this is huge, especially in the midst of times of life where we may not readily
[00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:14.020]   see the goodness of God.
[00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:17.980]   I understand that sometimes we say, "All right, I have no problem praising God and
[00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:21.900]   thanking God when God does something good in my life and when I can readily see God's
[00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:22.900]   goodness."
[00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:27.380]   And some of those examples I just gave and the last point are more examples of times
[00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:29.140]   that we can readily see God's goodness.
[00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:33.940]   When we get a promotion or we get a new car or when we graduate, it's a lot easier for
[00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:35.640]   all of us to say, "Wow, this is cool.
[00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:36.640]   This is good.
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:40.160]   I'm so grateful to God," when something is going well in our life.
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:44.760]   But the reality is even when things don't feel like they're going well in our life,
[00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:50.180]   God is at work and God is always at work for His glory and for our good in so many different
[00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:51.180]   ways.
[00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:56.460]   And so we've got to learn in all circumstances of life, especially those difficult circumstances,
[00:13:56.460 --> 00:14:02.040]   those trials, those challenges, those difficulties, we've got to learn to put our focus on God's
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.440]   work and to say, "What is God doing here?"
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:08.440]   And there are things going on in my life right now, even though it may not feel great, there
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:13.000]   are things going on that God is using and God is working and God is doing something
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.180]   and I can be grateful for that, even if the circumstance that I'm in the midst of doesn't
[00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:20.460]   feel great to me right now.
[00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:23.960]   We've got to put our focus on God's work.
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:28.520]   You know, we can do that by beginning to seek out areas of God's goodness in our lives.
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:32.880]   I think we see this in the passage that we read here in Exodus 15.
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:35.360]   Look at these verses where it talks about what God is doing.
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:41.840]   It's talking about how God is, verse 7, God is overthrowing the adversaries and verse
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:48.200]   8, it talks about God standing the waters up and in a heap, piling the waters up.
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:52.700]   And verse 9, it says, "The enemy said, 'I will pursue, I will overtake.'"
[00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:57.520]   This is not just some overly rosy picture of the goodness of God that just says, "Yeah,
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:01.120]   we were walking through the park and everything was great and everything was fantastic, so
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.840]   we're going to praise God."
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:06.560]   This passage is saying, "No, we thought we were going to die.
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:11.440]   The enemy was pursuing us and about to overtake us, and the enemy was saying that they were
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:17.360]   going to kill us with their sword and take the spoil, and that we were going to be destroyed."
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:21.380]   This passage makes it clear that this was a dark, challenging time.
[00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:26.120]   This was a time of real difficulty in the life of God's people.
[00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:29.260]   But even in the midst of that, God was at work.
[00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:35.040]   And so we can find those times and those places in our life where God is at work, even when
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:37.040]   it's challenging.
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.400]   We may have to search for it a little bit.
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:42.400]   We may have to seek it out and say, "Okay, the circumstances are tough right now, but
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:46.080]   I believe God is at work, and I'm going to look for the areas where God is at work in
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:47.080]   my life."
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:51.560]   And if we'll begin to seek those out, we will begin to find areas that God is working and
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:54.140]   we can begin to praise God for.
[00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:58.080]   Even when we're experiencing those trials and difficulties, we can be grateful.
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:02.000]   We can be grateful for God's presence.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.680]   I've been through some difficult times in my life.
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:09.560]   My wife and I have been through some very difficult circumstances, and the loss of family
[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:13.000]   members and different things that we've walked through, different challenges that we've walked
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.040]   through.
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:18.240]   And I can tell you, honestly, there's been a lot of times in the midst of those experiences
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:21.880]   where it didn't feel great to me, or it didn't feel great to my wife.
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:25.840]   And where we've gone through those times of saying, "Wow, this does not feel good right
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:26.840]   now."
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:29.760]   There have been times when we've said, "You know, pretty much none of what we're going
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:31.120]   through right now feels good.
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:33.760]   Nothing feels good right now."
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:39.000]   But even in those moments, we can be grateful for the presence of God and for the nearness
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   of God.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.960]   And we can say, "You know what?
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:47.360]   Even though nothing feels good right now, and I'm discouraged, and I'm experiencing
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:52.240]   loss, and I'm experiencing grief, and I'm experiencing all of these challenging things,
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:55.600]   I'm so grateful that God is with me in this grief.
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.760]   I'm so grateful that God is with me in this loss.
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:03.440]   I'm so grateful that God is with me in this discouragement, in this setback, in this challenge."
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:09.880]   Because if God was not here, I would be completely alone, and I would be completely in the dark
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.040]   and lost on my own.
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:16.720]   So even if we're in the toughest moments of our life, and nothing feels good, and everything
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.400]   seems to be going wrong, I get it.
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:20.400]   That happens.
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.680]   That's real.
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:26.840]   And even in those moments, we can be grateful for the nearness of God, the presence of God
[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:29.800]   that is with us, that sustains us.
[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:34.440]   We can be grateful for God's people, even in those challenging times.
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:38.880]   God put us in this family called the church, and one of the things that we're supposed
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:42.360]   to do is love one another and care for one another, support each other, encourage one
[00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:46.080]   another, and hopefully we're doing that for each other.
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:49.840]   Hopefully there are people in your life who love you and who care for you and support
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:52.840]   you when you go through challenges, and you can be grateful for that.
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:56.440]   You can say, "God, I'm grateful for the people you've put in my life.
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:00.960]   Even during a time of illness or during a time of grief, I'm grateful that these people
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:01.960]   are here.
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:06.080]   I'm grateful that you're using them to encourage me and to build me up."
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:09.920]   We can be grateful for God's sanctifying work in our life.
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:15.280]   That word "sanctification" is just a church word that means that God is purifying us.
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:17.520]   He's changing us and making us more like Jesus.
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:21.920]   He's taking away some of those things, those impurities, those things that are not healthy
[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:24.800]   for us, those bad habits, that selfishness.
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:29.520]   He's slowly taking that stuff out of our heart and out of our life and slowly turning us
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:34.440]   more and more like Jesus so that we can begin to truly love others and truly be unselfish
[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:38.480]   and truly be focused on the right things in life.
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:45.400]   The honest reality is in my life and I think in the lives of most believers, that sanctifying
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:49.920]   process works best when we're going through some suffering.
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:56.000]   It's hard for us on a bright sunny day when everything is going our way to be unselfish
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.280]   and to be humble and to really care for others and to really focus on God because everything's
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:02.280]   great.
[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:06.480]   But when we're going through something difficult, suddenly it's so much easier for us to see
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:12.320]   our need for God and to focus on Him and to be humble and to love and care for others.
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:17.480]   That sanctifying process a lot of times works best in times of struggle and in times of
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:20.080]   suffering and in times of trial.
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:21.280]   We can be thankful for that.
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:24.460]   When we're going through something difficult, we can say, "You know what?
[00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:29.520]   This doesn't feel good and I don't love being in this moment, but God, I'm so grateful that
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:34.640]   You're using it to work in me to make me more like Jesus, to strip away some of that unhealthy
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:39.080]   stuff, some of that stuff that causes me to be focused on myself, some of that stuff that
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:43.360]   causes me to be self-destructive in the choices I make or causes me to make choices that harm
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:44.360]   the people around me.
[00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:49.480]   God, I'm so grateful that You're changing me and taking that away and making me more
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:50.480]   like Christ."
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:53.200]   Because if you're going through a challenge, if you're going through a trial, if you're
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:58.280]   going through a difficulty and you're a follower of Jesus, then I guarantee you that God is
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:02.960]   using it in your life to try to get you closer to Him because that's what God does.
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:07.740]   We can be grateful for that sanctification that happens in difficult moments.
[00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:10.480]   We can be grateful for God's strength and grace.
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:14.320]   I don't know if you've ever gone through something challenging that you look back on and say,
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:16.160]   "I don't know how I got through that.
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.480]   I've had experiences like that."
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:22.880]   And the truth is that God gives supernatural strength and grace to His people when we go
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:27.440]   through really difficult times of challenge and of grief and when we're stretched to the
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:31.000]   limit and we just feel like, "I don't even know if I can make it."
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.800]   God is there with us in those moments and He carries us and He gives us strength and
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:35.920]   grace.
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:37.200]   And we can be grateful for that.
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:39.360]   We can say, "You know what?
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:44.620]   The challenge I'm encountering right now doesn't feel fantastic, but God is getting me through
[00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:48.520]   and I'm thankful for the strength and the grace that He's giving me, He's sustaining
[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:49.520]   me with."
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:52.500]   And we can be grateful for that growth.
[00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:57.820]   God uses challenges and trials and afflictions to change us and to grow us.
[00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:03.300]   Just like you won't strengthen your muscles, your physical muscles, without kind of stretching
[00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:05.240]   them and straining them a little bit.
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:09.400]   That's literally what we do when we go work out at the gym or we work out hard in any
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:14.800]   other way, is we stretch and strain our muscles a little bit so that they'll become stronger.
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.480]   And God does the same thing with us spiritually.
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:21.080]   A lot of times He has to take us through something that stretches us and strains us a little
[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:26.520]   bit in order to strengthen us so that we can grow and be stronger than we were before.
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:28.440]   And we can praise God for that.
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:32.720]   Even in a tough time, we can say, "God, I thank You and praise You that You stretched
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:34.800]   me, that You strained me, and that You're growing me."
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:38.920]   The next thing that I think is really important to help us begin to practice gratefulness
[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:44.880]   in our response to God's work in our lives is to intentionally celebrate God's goodness.
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:49.920]   When God does something good and we begin to notice that, we begin to see God's work
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:54.840]   in our life, and we begin to see God's goodness in that work when we say, "Okay, I see God
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:57.400]   at work, even in my difficulties.
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:00.280]   And I'm paying attention and I've searched out for God's goodness.
[00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:04.480]   And I do see it, even in this difficult time, I can still see how God's working."
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:07.280]   Or maybe in this really good time, I can see how God's working.
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:12.240]   God blessed me and He brought this wonderful thing into my life, and I see God's goodness
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:13.240]   there.
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:19.520]   Once we see it, and once we see how God is working, we should begin to intentionally
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:21.720]   celebrate it and to say, "You know what?
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:25.920]   I'm not just going to notice it, I'm going to celebrate it.
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:30.160]   I'm going to begin to thank and praise God for His goodness."
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:31.520]   And you might say, "Well, what does that look like?
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:34.440]   What does it look like to thank and praise God for His goodness?"
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:36.520]   Exactly what it sounds like.
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:38.360]   You begin to thank God.
[00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:40.680]   You can thank God in your prayers, silently.
[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:44.520]   You can thank God verbally and say, "God, I thank you for what you're doing in my life.
[00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:47.800]   God, I thank you for the way you've saved me, for the way you're changing me, for the
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:50.680]   way that you're growing me into a new creature in Christ.
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:52.560]   God, I thank you for the blessings that you've given me.
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:58.680]   I thank you for my family, for my community, for my church, for all these different things."
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:00.940]   That's what it sounds like, thanking God.
[00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:05.880]   And obviously we know that the church has a long and beautiful tradition of praising
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:11.800]   God in song, just like here in Exodus 15, where we lift our voices in song to thank
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:15.840]   God, to praise Him, to exalt Him, to talk about how good He is, how great He is, and
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:19.420]   how grateful we are for what He does in our lives.
[00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:23.120]   And that's a beautiful way to praise God, is to praise God in song.
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:24.720]   You can do that by yourself.
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:27.760]   You can do that in a church service with other believers.
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:30.800]   You can do it when you're driving in the car or when you're in the shower.
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:34.280]   You can sing anywhere and thank and praise God.
[00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:38.520]   And that's a good way to intentionally begin to celebrate God's goodness in your life.
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:41.240]   And so I hope that you're doing that.
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:46.680]   But you can also take a break from the busyness of life to celebrate and reflect and praise.
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:48.800]   And I think this is really important.
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.500]   Sometimes we do see God's goodness and we say, "Okay, that's something I know I need
[00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:52.940]   to praise God for."
[00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:57.920]   But our life is so busy that we just kind of go on by, and then a week and a month later,
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:01.720]   we've kind of forgotten about the good thing that God did.
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:06.240]   And we see this example throughout Scripture, and we see it clearly in the Old Testament.
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:08.960]   We see it clearly here in Exodus 15.
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:14.840]   They got a cross and they were safe, and the people who were trying to kill them were destroyed.
[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:17.040]   They could no longer chase after them.
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:21.200]   And they didn't just say, "All right, on to the promised land, on to the next thing.
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:22.440]   Let's get to the next spot."
[00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:24.760]   They said, "No, we're going to stop.
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:28.880]   We're going to take a break, and we're going to sing and dance here on the shoreline and
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:32.520]   praise God for what He's done and for how He delivered us and for His goodness that's
[00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:34.920]   been at work in our lives."
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:37.560]   And like I said, we see that throughout the Old Testament.
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:41.600]   God clearly tells His people so many times to do that.
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:44.120]   I think we need to practice that.
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:48.640]   As modern believers, especially in the U.S., that is not something we practice well.
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:53.260]   Our lives are so busy, and it's all we can do just to find some time to get to church
[00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:56.200]   and to sing two or three songs.
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:25:01.360]   But we don't take breaks from the busyness of life to just praise God, to just reflect
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:03.920]   on how good He's been and to just thank Him for it.
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:04.920]   And we need to do that.
[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:07.320]   And that's something we should practice.
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:11.480]   If you're a single person, you should practice that and say, "Hey, I'm going to take a break
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:17.680]   from my work schedule, from my friend relationships, so that I can just reflect on God's goodness
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:19.560]   and begin to praise Him for it."
[00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:20.760]   And you can do that with other people.
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:22.660]   You can do it with friends.
[00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:24.840]   You can do it in the company of others.
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:26.040]   But take a break.
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:30.800]   If you're a married person, especially if you have children, say, "Hey, we as a family,
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:34.360]   we're going to take a break because God did something big in our lives, and we want to
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:36.440]   stop and we want to celebrate it.
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:37.720]   Maybe it's just for a few hours.
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:38.760]   It's a special dinner.
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:41.520]   Maybe it's a half day or a day off."
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:45.320]   But take a break from the busyness of life and say, "You know what?
[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:47.520]   I'm going to celebrate what God has done.
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:48.520]   I'm going to reflect on it.
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:49.520]   I'm going to think about it.
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:52.640]   I'm going to consider how good God has been in my life.
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:53.900]   And I'm going to talk about it.
[00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:55.360]   I'm going to praise Him.
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:59.920]   I'm going to thank Him for what He's done in my life."
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:05.720]   And you know, God has given us so many things in our life that sadly a lot of times, like
[00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:08.960]   I said, either we take for granted or we're just not grateful for.
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:11.400]   And all of us have things to thank God for.
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:15.960]   You may say, "Well, you know, life's been tough, and there's some things going on in
[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:17.680]   my life that are challenging right now.
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:20.660]   And so it's hard for me to feel like praising God."
[00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:25.280]   But the reality is all of us have things that we can praise God for.
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:28.520]   So I want to think about a few of those things as we close out and just give us some reasons
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:29.840]   that we can praise God.
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:34.820]   You know, God has given all of us as humans special talents and gifts and abilities.
[00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:37.940]   And we can thank and praise God for those things.
[00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:40.400]   You have special talents and gifts and abilities.
[00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:41.440]   Maybe they're artistic.
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:42.680]   Maybe they're creative.
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:43.680]   Maybe they're music.
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:44.680]   Maybe they're analytical.
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:45.980]   Maybe they're scientific.
[00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:49.020]   Maybe they're kind of interpersonal.
[00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:52.560]   Maybe you're really good at relating to other people or you have a great sense of humor.
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:56.600]   Whatever those things are, you can thank and praise God for those.
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:27:01.960]   And it's easy for all of us to look at the talents and gifts that other people have and
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:06.320]   feel like we wish we were someone else and we wish we had their talents and forget about
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:09.320]   the beautiful talents and gifts that God has given us.
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:14.160]   So you can and should praise God for who He made you to be and all the talents and gifts
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.560]   that He's poured into your life.
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:19.220]   Another thing that all of us can praise God for right now is some of the freedoms that
[00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:20.860]   we enjoy in our country.
[00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:21.920]   Today is July 4th.
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:25.740]   It's a day that we celebrate the beginning of our country.
[00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:30.660]   And we can all thank and praise God for the freedoms that we enjoy in the United States.
[00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:34.380]   Obviously, our country is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination.
[00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:37.100]   There's still a lot of problems and a long way to go.
[00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:42.660]   But we do have a lot of freedoms here and people have a lot of good blessings in our
[00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:43.660]   nation.
[00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:46.500]   And I think that's something that we can praise God for and be grateful for.
[00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:49.540]   And we should praise God and be grateful for.
[00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:54.340]   We can be grateful for COVID-19 being on the decline here.
[00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:55.820]   I think that's something huge.
[00:27:55.820 --> 00:28:00.380]   As I talked about earlier, there's so many things we take for granted that God does.
[00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:04.740]   And I think it's easy for us to forget that a year ago and a year and a half ago, we were
[00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:11.180]   really worried about this illness and that we were praying and crying out to God for
[00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:16.140]   deliverance that God would deliver us and deliver our families and deliver our communities.
[00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:19.620]   And God has answered those prayers in many ways.
[00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:23.020]   And I don't say that to diminish the fact that there's still sick people.
[00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:24.020]   I understand that.
[00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:25.620]   And we need to continue to pray for those people.
[00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:29.620]   And especially in other parts of the world where there's still higher levels of disease,
[00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:33.020]   we need to be praying for those places desperately.
[00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:39.500]   But we can also celebrate and thank God that He's brought about so much deliverance from
[00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:43.540]   this pandemic and that a lot of things are reopening and people are healthy and so many
[00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:47.460]   people have been able to take the vaccine and there's much less disease and much less
[00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:48.460]   death.
[00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:50.940]   Hey, we prayed and we asked for that.
[00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:53.060]   And God has answered that prayer.
[00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:54.620]   And we need to give credit to God.
[00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:56.820]   Obviously, God used a lot of humans to do that.
[00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:57.820]   And that's fine.
[00:28:57.820 --> 00:28:58.820]   We should thank them too.
[00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:03.980]   But we need to give credit to God and we need to praise Him for deliverance from this pandemic.
[00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:08.820]   Just like the children of Israel in Exodus here, we're praising God for deliverance from
[00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:10.560]   a fearful moment.
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:13.820]   We can praise God for deliverance from a fearful moment.
[00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:15.860]   We can praise God for the beautiful summer weather.
[00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:18.580]   I hope you've been enjoying the weather lately and getting outside.
[00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:20.620]   And that's something we can praise God for.
[00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:25.100]   We can praise God for the simple things like the fact that He gives us food and shelter
[00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:29.260]   and clothing and meets those basic daily needs in our life.
[00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:34.580]   We can thank God for a lot of other beautiful things that He pours into our life that are
[00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:36.500]   so enriching.
[00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:41.820]   We can thank God for life itself and for the beauty of being able to be alive and for the
[00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:43.140]   health that He gives us.
[00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:44.980]   We shouldn't take that for granted.
[00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:50.620]   The fact that God wakes us up every day and that we have a measure of health.
[00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:54.420]   Some of us may feel healthier than others, but all of us have some measure of health
[00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:55.540]   that God gives us.
[00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:59.180]   As long as we're here alive on this earth, we have some measure of health.
[00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:01.280]   And we should be thankful for that.
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:06.620]   We should be thankful for the beauty of family and of love and of relationships with other
[00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:08.780]   human beings that God has given us.
[00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:14.020]   That is something that enriches our life in an unspeakable way and something that is just
[00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:17.140]   so amazing to experience.
[00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:19.860]   And it's hard for us to describe.
[00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:23.180]   I can't describe the beauty of that as I speak about it right now.
[00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:28.660]   What the beauty of the relationships in my life, my marriage, my relationship to my wife,
[00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:32.980]   our relationship to our children and the love that we have for them and so many other friends
[00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:37.640]   and family members that we enjoy a relationship with.
[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:38.640]   That's a beautiful thing.
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:40.500]   We can thank God for that.
[00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:44.540]   We can thank God for the community of the church that we spoke about earlier, that community
[00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:49.020]   of His people that He's placed us in where we love each other and care for each other.
[00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:50.740]   That's a beautiful thing.
[00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:52.020]   And we can thank God for that.
[00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:54.100]   We can thank God for the beauty of nature.
[00:30:54.100 --> 00:31:00.380]   I am amazed by the beauty of nature and by the diversity and the creativity that is displayed
[00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:03.540]   and just all of the beautiful things God has made.
[00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:04.780]   I love to see it.
[00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:05.780]   I love the mountains.
[00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:09.300]   I love the ocean and kind of everything in between.
[00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:13.020]   And it just fills me with a sense of awe and gratefulness to God.
[00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:16.820]   I love to look up in the night sky and see the stars and just be filled with that sense
[00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:19.020]   of awe and gratefulness to God.
[00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:22.020]   God has put so much beauty in our world.
[00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:23.020]   And He didn't have to.
[00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:26.860]   He made it all gray and beige and really boring.
[00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:27.860]   But He didn't.
[00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:29.700]   He made it beautiful and amazing.
[00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:32.180]   And I'm so grateful for that.
[00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:36.180]   And we see so many beautiful things, even that God allows us as humans to make.
[00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:40.660]   We see artistry and creativity that humans express themselves.
[00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:42.380]   We can be grateful for that.
[00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:44.860]   We can be grateful for the beauty that we see.
[00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:49.460]   We can be grateful for culture and food and all the simple pleasures of life, sitting
[00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:55.220]   down with our family to enjoy a meal or to do something that is fun or listening to someone
[00:31:55.220 --> 00:32:01.860]   tell a really good story or something that just causes us to laugh watching a child play
[00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:02.860]   or something like that.
[00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:07.060]   Those are all beautiful things that we should be grateful to God for.
[00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:14.180]   He's poured so many blessings into our lives, even in the small moments of life.
[00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:17.820]   And we often miss them because we're focused on what we don't have.
[00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:19.620]   We're focused on what we want.
[00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:24.060]   And we don't see all of the goodness that God has already put in our lives.
[00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:29.100]   And we should certainly be grateful for God's love for us and the way He loves every one
[00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:32.860]   of us made in His image and the way He sent Jesus to die for us.
[00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:37.940]   The salvation, the grace and mercy and forgiveness that God has extended to us, that because
[00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:41.060]   of Jesus we can be forgiven, we can be made clean.
[00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:44.300]   All the mistakes we've made can be forgotten and put behind us.
[00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:47.660]   Wow, that is something to praise God for.
[00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:49.460]   That's something to be thankful for.
[00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:56.020]   We can praise God for the rest of our lives and into eternity just for that alone.
[00:32:56.020 --> 00:33:01.020]   There is so much to be thankful for in God's love for us and in the salvation that He's
[00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:03.540]   extended to us.
[00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:08.380]   We can be thankful for the nearness of God, as we spoke about earlier, in those trials
[00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:13.060]   and those difficulties that God is always present with us, even when life is challenging.
[00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:16.540]   And one of the things we can be thankful for is God's truth.
[00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:19.460]   You know, we just spent a year studying through the Sermon on the Mount and the values of
[00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:20.700]   the kingdom.
[00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:23.780]   I am so grateful for the values of the kingdom.
[00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:27.300]   I'm so grateful that God revealed His truth to us.
[00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:31.900]   Without it we would be lost and we'd be fumbling around in the dark and hurting ourselves and
[00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:33.140]   hurting everyone else.
[00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:38.140]   I'm so grateful for God's truth and that He's expressed it to us and He's told us how we
[00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:42.620]   can live and please Him and be in right relationship with Him and right relationship with others.
[00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:45.980]   I am so grateful for that.
[00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:49.620]   The point is, there are so many things that all of us can be grateful for.
[00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:53.420]   Even if in the moment things don't feel good and we think, "I don't know how much to be
[00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:55.420]   grateful for," we do.
[00:33:55.420 --> 00:34:01.620]   And we've got to learn to begin to live out gratefulness and to practice it in our lives.
[00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:06.500]   This is a great start to begin by placing our focus on God, placing our focus on the
[00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:10.860]   work that He's doing in our lives and all the good things that He's doing, and being
[00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:16.500]   intentional about celebrating God's work and God's goodness in our lives, stopping our
[00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:20.740]   lives, taking a break from the business just to reflect and just to praise and to thank
[00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:22.980]   God for who He is.
[00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:24.380]   Let's pray.
[00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:29.260]   God, I thank You right now for Your goodness and Your greatness in our lives, God.
[00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:33.180]   You are so great and You're so powerful and so amazing.
[00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:37.380]   And we see that so clearly when we look at the world and we see the amazing beauty of
[00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:42.980]   nature, but we see it so clearly when we look at each other and see the amazing intricacy
[00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:49.100]   of the human life, not just of our human body, but of the human soul and our emotions and
[00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:52.300]   all of the depth and the layers of that, God.
[00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:54.660]   It's mind-blowing.
[00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:56.180]   That's such a beautiful thing, God.
[00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:59.620]   You are so great and so powerful to make all of that.
[00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:04.860]   And yet You are also so good and You love us and You've extended us forgiveness and
[00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:11.300]   salvation and You've sent Your Son incarnated into this world so that we could have relationship
[00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:17.220]   with You and You've taken on our flesh and gotten on our level and come into our world
[00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:21.580]   so that we can know You because You are so good, God.
[00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:23.900]   God, we praise You for that.
[00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:25.180]   We lift You up.
[00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:27.080]   We thank You, God.
[00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:28.260]   We haven't done anything.
[00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:29.540]   It's all You, God.
[00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:32.420]   And there is no one like You.
[00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:34.980]   There is no one like You in all of the universe, God.
[00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:38.540]   And we just want to profess and proclaim that today.
[00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:44.220]   And God, I pray that You'd help us to begin to reflect on and understand that and to think
[00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:49.260]   about it every day, to not take Your goodness for granted, but every day to be grateful
[00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:52.740]   and to be thankful and to intentionally celebrate how good You are, God.
[00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:54.740]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:35:54.740 --> 00:36:04.740]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
