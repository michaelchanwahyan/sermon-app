[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920]   to a happy Mother's Day.
[00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.200]   Let me begin by a word of prayer.
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.240]   I don't know what kind of spiritual condition
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.560]   or what kind of emotional condition
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.720]   you're coming into the presence of God,
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.680]   but I want you to focus on God himself.
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.880]   I want you to come in, not to see anyone else,
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.760]   but God himself, all right?
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.760]   And know that God is for you.
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.760]   Know that God is present with you, all right?
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.600]   Let's pray.
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.080]   Father, we want to praise you.
[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.720]   We want to come before you and bow our knees.
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.160]   And I pray that you will be with us
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.840]   and help us to sense that you are with us,
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.080]   you are present with us.
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.040]   I pray for each and every one of us.
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.040]   Perhaps we have been fighting our battles
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.960]   in the past week, our past few weeks.
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.680]   We are fighting our worries.
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.040]   We are dealing with our challenges.
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.600]   And sometimes our problems in our lives
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.440]   seem insurmountable.
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.720]   It seems so big.
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.360]   But we come before you, we know that you are bigger
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.880]   and you're biggest.
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.080]   You're bigger than anything else.
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.080]   And you got the whole wide world in your hand indeed.
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.360]   And we pray that you will help us to put our trust in you
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.600]   and know that you are still in control.
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.040]   You are still our king and our leader.
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.000]   Pray that you will forgive our sins,
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.760]   our shortcomings, our weaknesses.
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.800]   And we come before you anew,
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.600]   knowing that your grace is always new every single morning.
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.960]   So we pray that you will renew our commitment to you,
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.320]   our trust in you.
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.480]   No matter what barriers we are facing,
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.280]   we know that you are bigger than all those challenges.
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.200]   And I pray that you're all powerful,
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.520]   you're all knowing and your attributes will encourage us
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.520]   to rely on you because you are worthy of our following.
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.400]   So we pray that you will grant us grace
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.400]   to deal with our own depressed, unhappy,
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.800]   discomfort or discouragement.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.800]   And I pray that you will encourage each and every one of us
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.600]   in the spirit to continue to believe and trust in you.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.520]   Knowing that as we follow you,
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.000]   we need to deny ourselves, bear our crosses,
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   just like what your son Jesus has done for all of us.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.880]   And I pray that we will be a community
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.800]   to encourage one another.
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.320]   As we have a Bible study together today,
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.280]   we pray that in the word we'll grow together.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.080]   In the word we'll encourage one another
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.880]   to build up one another.
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.800]   Build up your church for your namesake, for your glory.
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.920]   Also wanna pray for the mothers in our midst.
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.480]   I pray that you will bless and grant grace
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.080]   to every one of them.
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.760]   Thank you for our mothers.
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.840]   Thank you for your divine appointment
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.080]   that we have only one mother
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.160]   and the perfect mother for all of us.
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.400]   And I pray that you will bless every one of them.
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.800]   And thank you for using them, our mothers,
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.160]   to extend your love, to show your love.
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.560]   Yes, we are all imperfect,
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.560]   but you have shown us the perfect love on the cross.
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.840]   And thank you, Jesus, in Christ, we pray.
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.600]   All right, today we're going to begin
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.760]   our new mini-series on the Apostles' Creek.
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.120]   Now, James has told us we have our daily devotion
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.680]   on the Apostles' Creek.
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.440]   So let's read this together.
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.560]   All right, let's read this together
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.560]   and go through this together.
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.520]   We have the whole Apostles' Creek on the screen.
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.520]   Now I want you to read this verse with the mentality,
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.160]   with the motive to evaluate what we really believe, okay?
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.800]   Sometimes when we go to church for a long time
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.720]   and we've been to church for some time,
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.480]   we have gotten what we truly believe
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.800]   or we have truncated our own belief.
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.600]   We might have thought or we have truncated our belief
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.880]   into just one or two things, and we make up our own idol.
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.600]   And in doing that, we are not believing the gospel anymore.
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.160]   And sometimes it is always good
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.040]   to reveal what we truly believe.
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:57.040]   And the Apostles' Creek is written for such a purpose
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.560]   so that we'll do a daily or regular check
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.160]   of what you really believe, all right?
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.000]   Just like you go to the doctor.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.040]   Now tomorrow, I'll go to the doctor for a regular checkup,
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.280]   okay, nothing wrong with me.
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.240]   You just have to do it once a year.
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.440]   But the doctor will tell me, okay,
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.920]   your blood sugar level or your blood pressure
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.320]   or anything wrong with me,
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.560]   anything I need to pay attention to, right?
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.200]   So the Apostles' Creek is doing exactly
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.960]   this sort of purpose, to check your belief, okay?
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.120]   The Apostles' Creek, let me read the left column.
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.760]   I believe in God, the Father Almighty,
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.680]   creator of heaven and earth.
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.080]   I believe in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord.
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.840]   He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.080]   and born of the Virgin Mary.
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.760]   He suffered under Pontius Pilate,
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.000]   was crucified, died, and was buried.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.960]   He descended to the dead.
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.000]   On the third day, He rose again.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.600]   He ascended into heaven
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.440]   and is seated at the right hand of the Father.
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.880]   He will come again to judge the living and the dead.
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:14.880]   I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Universal Church,
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.640]   the chameleon of saints, the forgiveness of sins,
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:23.220]   the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting, amen.
[00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.120]   This is the Apostles' Creek.
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.800]   Now, it's a quick summary
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.480]   to tell you what our basic belief is.
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.560]   Of course, it's not just that,
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.680]   but it's good enough summary
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.680]   to tell you what you truly believe,
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.040]   what are the central core beliefs, okay?
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.760]   Now, how many of you have been to Chicago for some time,
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.520]   for at least one year?
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.340]   How many of you?
[00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.880]   All right, no one is new to Chicago, right?
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.600]   Now, if someone bump into you
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.840]   and say maybe someone who's new to Chicago,
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.480]   first time in Chicago,
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:00.640]   and if that someone or your friend is a tourist
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.240]   bump into you and ask you,
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.760]   hey, how do you get to downtown?
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.480]   Can you tell him right away?
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:09.320]   Can you?
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.280]   (audience laughing)
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.920]   Who cannot?
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.480]   Who can tell the someone
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.000]   that is the way from here to downtown?
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.280]   Who can say that?
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.800]   None of you?
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:26.080]   Jesus. (laughs)
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.360]   How do you get to downtown from here, right?
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.520]   You can probably, immediately,
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.680]   you can answer the question, right?
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.480]   Now, if you cannot,
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.600]   you probably are deceiving yourself, right?
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.320]   You haven't been to Chicago, right?
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.000]   Perhaps you are being isolated for so long in COVID
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.120]   so you don't know the way, all right?
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.120]   Now, it's kind of like that, a puzzle squeak.
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.280]   It's to tell us what the Bible is all about,
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.800]   what the gospel is all about.
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.960]   No one can actually read the Bible
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.880]   from cover to cover in one sitting.
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:03.440]   No one can understand every single detail in the Bible, okay?
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.040]   I have been teaching the Bible,
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.120]   I've been studying the Bible,
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.280]   I've been reading the Bible almost every single day, all right?
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.040]   There are still a lot of things that I don't understand,
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.400]   I don't comprehend, all right?
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.880]   Amen?
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.360]   Amen, right?
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.440]   So there are a lot of things
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.000]   that I still trying to figure out,
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.360]   and I'm struggling with the meaning,
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.840]   the significance of some of the Bible passages, right?
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.320]   We're gonna have a Bible study later.
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.960]   We are going into the book of Genesis,
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:37.800]   the story of Isaac and Jacob, right?
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:38.640]   Right?
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:39.480]   Isaac and Jacob.
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:42.840]   Some of the familiar stories,
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:47.640]   but there were a lot of details probably you don't know,
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:50.840]   or you have no idea that's in the Bible.
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.840]   So no one can really understand the Bible
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:55.880]   or comprehend every single thing from cover to cover.
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:59.840]   But the Apostles' Creed is to give us a quick summary
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:04.840]   to tell you and tell me what believing in Christ truly is.
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.200]   All right?
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.920]   Now I want you to think about it.
[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:10.520]   When did you come to faith?
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.760]   When did you come to, you know,
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.800]   accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior?
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:15.640]   When?
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:18.720]   All right, think about that.
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.520]   How many years ago?
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:21.640]   What day?
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.760]   What year, what month, and what day?
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.200]   And what circumstances?
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.520]   That you come to know Christ.
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:29.600]   All right?
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.440]   Now, how long have you been a Christian?
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:35.320]   It's a very crucial thing you need to ask yourself.
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:36.200]   Okay?
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.480]   Now, think about how long you've been a Christian,
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.960]   how long you have known the gospel.
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.600]   Have you really known the gospel?
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:48.760]   In the past two years, because of COVID,
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:52.400]   many of the young families in our church, okay,
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.960]   including some of you,
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:57.680]   and including some of those in the previous worship service,
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:03.400]   I haven't been able to, you know, see them face to face.
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:06.800]   And I know maybe two years ago, all right,
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.440]   two years ago when the lockdown came,
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:12.240]   some of the young families actually had babies.
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.320]   They had baby.
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:20.920]   Or they had infant before, right before the lockdown.
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:21.760]   All right?
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.360]   But when the lockdown came,
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:26.200]   I was not able to see them, right?
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:30.240]   Now, as the pandemic is easing out, hopefully,
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.360]   fading out a little bit,
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:35.240]   and then I see them again, right?
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:40.240]   Now, I did not expect the baby remain baby, right?
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.240]   It would be terrible.
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:46.520]   After two years, if the newborn that I've seen
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:49.160]   before the lockdown two years ago,
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:53.400]   and then two years later, they remain baby, right?
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:54.280]   That would be terrible.
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:55.400]   I need to call 911.
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:59.520]   That would be so sad.
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:02.680]   So after two years, when they show up again,
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:04.480]   when they come back to the church, right?
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:07.480]   No longer just seeing each other on Zoom or online.
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.880]   They show up and they bring their young ones.
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.320]   They are, what do you think?
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.840]   Should be walking, right?
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:17.480]   They should be taller, right?
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.320]   They should be tallest.
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:21.480]   And indeed, they are now tallest, right?
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:24.120]   And for those who were two years old before the lockdown,
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.360]   now they are four years old, right?
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:29.600]   Now, it's a very natural thing to see growth, right?
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:32.120]   At least in the physical sense, right?
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:36.160]   At least in the physical sense, they got taller.
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.920]   They got bigger, right?
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:41.320]   Before the lockdown, they could not talk.
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:43.480]   Now, they at least, right?
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:47.800]   At least they can have a conversation, right?
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.520]   Now, it is the same thing, isn't it?
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:54.920]   For Christians, for us.
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:12:00.280]   Rewind the tape, two years ago.
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.640]   Where were you spiritually?
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:05.200]   Where were you in your relationship with God?
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.920]   How was it?
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:12.840]   Now, two years later, where are you?
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.640]   What do you truly believe?
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:19.120]   And have you been growing, right?
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:23.960]   Now, let me give you a very broad brush,
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:28.960]   a very just big picture of our faith journey, right?
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:35.120]   There are some aspects I'm going to tell you
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.600]   that if you know Christ,
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.520]   if you come to believe in the gospel,
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:45.560]   these aspects, you should see some growth, okay?
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:49.520]   The first one is your habit, all right?
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:50.560]   Your time management.
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:54.520]   Before you came to Christ, you were your own boss, right?
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:57.840]   Every single day, 24/7, you were your own boss.
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.840]   How do I use my time, right?
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.360]   How do I use every single minute that I have?
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:07.720]   After you know Christ, Christ is on the seat
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:11.720]   of ownership in our lives, right?
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:14.280]   He died on the cross to redeem us,
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:15.800]   and our life belongs to him.
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.520]   Habit.
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:21.160]   So two years ago, we went back, all right?
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:24.240]   Or how many years ago you come to know faith,
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:25.240]   come to know Christ?
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:30.040]   Your habits should have changed, right?
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:33.800]   In the, at least in the fundamental way, right?
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:38.760]   Before you know Christ, you used your time,
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:42.440]   you were your own boss, but after you know Christ,
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:43.920]   you need to relate to God.
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:46.160]   You need to build your relationship with God.
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.040]   You need to relate to him.
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.520]   Have you been reading the word of God
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.480]   or getting a better understanding?
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:54.280]   Better, remember, the emphasis is better.
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:57.040]   Have you been getting a better understanding
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:58.920]   of the word of God?
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.600]   Are you getting closer to God himself?
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:05.320]   Are you getting closer to the Lord and Savior?
[00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:08.480]   Week by week, we come to worship.
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:11.440]   It's not because we, there's a checkbox
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:15.440]   in our weekly activities.
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:18.320]   There's checkbox, okay, all right, I got it done, all right?
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:19.840]   And then I just put it aside.
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:25.160]   We come to worship because we bow before the true Lord,
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:26.040]   the true King.
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:30.480]   As believers, we are moving,
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:34.400]   should be moving in a progress.
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:37.320]   From seeker, before you know Christ,
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.880]   you may be interested in the gospel,
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:41.120]   may be interested in the church stuff,
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:43.200]   and you come and you try to listen,
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:47.200]   try to understand what Christian faith is all about.
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:50.000]   From seeker, you move on to a spiritual child,
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.040]   and then you move on to a spiritual adult,
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:57.400]   young adult or older adult.
[00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:02.760]   And then you should move on to become a leader, right?
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.840]   That is your faith journey.
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.680]   That is how your faith journey should be.
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:12.480]   So at least there are fundamental change in your habit,
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:15.080]   in your time management, how do you use your life
[00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:18.760]   and your hours and your minute, right?
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:20.880]   Second, it's your relationship.
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:26.120]   Relationship with other sisters and brothers in Christ,
[00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:27.040]   right?
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:30.560]   Interestingly, the Bible always tells us
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:35.080]   there were tons of verses that is about one and other.
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:36.800]   It's about community.
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.560]   When we come to know faith,
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:42.280]   we call each other brother and sisters
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:45.240]   or family members in Christ, right?
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.480]   And this family, this spiritual family,
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.740]   is above all the most important thing.
[00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:55.120]   God will continue His redemptive work on earth
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:59.840]   through the church, not through the angels,
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:04.280]   not through the government, not through other agencies,
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:07.440]   but through the church, through the people of God.
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.240]   That is us, right?
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:10.400]   It's not about numbers.
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:13.120]   Remember in the first century,
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:16.600]   when you opened the pages of the New Testament,
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:21.600]   the churches that we encounter in Corinth, in Ephesus,
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:25.240]   in every single city in the Roman Empire,
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:27.160]   they were the small group church.
[00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:30.920]   They're very, very small, tiny cell churches.
[00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:35.920]   But God's plan is to use the church to extend His kingdom,
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.440]   extend His rule.
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:41.920]   How do we tell the gospel to the rest of the world?
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:44.760]   God did not use angels.
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:45.720]   God could have,
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:52.120]   but God choose to use His churches in every generation.
[00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:55.200]   So relationship-wise,
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.560]   we should have some fundamental change.
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:02.560]   There was some basic reconfiguration in our relationship
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:05.120]   when we come to know Christ.
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:06.800]   Now, before we came to know Christ,
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:08.000]   church is nothing to us.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   Maybe there's a cool thing, maybe there's a good thing,
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.480]   some sort of institute in the society
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:18.360]   that would help people to do better things or good things.
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:21.200]   But when we come to know faith, we truly know faith,
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.840]   there should be some fundamental change
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:25.640]   in how we see the church.
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:27.240]   Church becomes our priority.
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:31.000]   Third, your emotional life.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.120]   There should be emotional growth in your own life as well.
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:39.640]   We know Christ through the gospel.
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:43.200]   We know that we are truly loved by God Himself.
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:47.360]   We're truly loved by the unconditional grace of God.
[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:51.460]   Then we should learn, you know, in the progress,
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:56.400]   I am fully accepted by God Himself,
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:00.100]   and that is how I anchor my identity.
[00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:06.940]   My value, my dignity, is not defined by my popularity.
[00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:09.560]   It's not by how many friends I have.
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:12.180]   It's not by how much money I earn.
[00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:15.280]   It's not by my social status.
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:18.320]   My emotional growth should go from
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:21.800]   before I came to know Christ, it was unsecure.
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:24.860]   I'm trying to find things to anchor my identity.
[00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:30.720]   The figures on your paycheck, how big is your house, right?
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:32.280]   How much things do you own?
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:35.680]   How many friends do you have?
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:38.640]   How popular are you on IG or on Facebook
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.580]   or anything like that?
[00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:42.400]   That was before Christ.
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.960]   Now, after Christ, you came to know Christ,
[00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:49.960]   your emotional life should be always growing
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:54.960]   in light of the gospel, in light of how Christ loves us.
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:58.240]   Because Christ loves us unconditionally,
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.920]   then I am a secure individual.
[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:05.920]   No matter how popular I am, no matter how unpopular I am,
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:11.140]   I know that I'm fully accepted by Christ, right?
[00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:16.140]   Now, since two years ago, because of the lockdown,
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:20.920]   because of the COVID, we have gone online, right?
[00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:23.600]   Now, you should know, right?
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:26.800]   Once you go online, your videos
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:29.320]   or whatever sermon you preach, right?
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:31.420]   Now it becomes something permanent, right?
[00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:37.200]   Now, I always get some comments on YouTube, right?
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:41.720]   Many, I would say, are positive.
[00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:46.320]   But quite a few are negative.
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:49.440]   Quite a few are negative, right?
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:53.120]   I've come to know this reality, right?
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:55.360]   This is the way it is, right?
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:58.720]   That's the world we live in, right?
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:03.720]   Now, in the beginning, you may feel very uncomfortable
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:08.120]   with some negative comments, right?
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:12.800]   Made by some users, made by some customers, right?
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:16.040]   Religious customers, that they have no commitment to you,
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:16.880]   right?
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.560]   They are somewhere else, I don't know where they are, right?
[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:21.600]   They may be in Africa, they may be in Asia,
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:24.880]   they may be in Chicago, but they make some comments, right?
[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:26.280]   They make some critical comments.
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:29.480]   And then you kind of, you know,
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:31.480]   you don't feel good about it, all right?
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:37.640]   But if you are totally secure in Christ,
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:42.440]   all you do in your worship, in your service,
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:44.240]   in everything that you do,
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:49.240]   you are securely anchor your value,
[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:53.480]   your identity, your dignity in Christ alone.
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:56.440]   Then all these comments, will he, doesn't matter.
[00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:58.880]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:02.600]   People can criticize you,
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:07.600]   or people can give you some negative feedback.
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:11.560]   But that should give you, you know,
[00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:15.440]   motives to improve even further, right?
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.560]   But you don't doubt yourself.
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:19.400]   You don't doubt your own identity,
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:23.960]   because I am truly anchor in Christ himself, right?
[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:26.800]   Emotional growth.
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:30.520]   And then there's a purpose, fundamental change,
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:32.920]   in your purpose of your life.
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:37.600]   Your general, overall orientation of your life.
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.880]   Before you know Christ, you're all by yourself.
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:43.680]   You're living your own life,
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:46.160]   according to your own agendas.
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.480]   Now you belong to Christ.
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:52.320]   And the New Testament continues to emphasize one fact,
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:56.200]   that Christ has redeemed you on the cross,
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:22:00.200]   with a great price, and you belong to him.
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:03.800]   And your life and your mission is to glorify him,
[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:08.000]   is to extend his kingdom, to share the gospel.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.680]   God is using you in your own way,
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:14.160]   that nobody else can replace you.
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:18.960]   And you are executing God's own mission,
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:23.640]   to glorify God in your career, in your family,
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.640]   in your community, in your neighborhood.
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:31.560]   That is a fundamental change in your purpose of your life.
[00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:34.600]   Finally, your understanding.
[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:37.880]   Your understanding of the gospel.
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:40.160]   You know, what Christianity is all about.
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:42.200]   What does Jesus think it's all about?
[00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:45.720]   Before you know Christ, you probably were a seeker.
[00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:48.720]   You were beginners.
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.880]   After you came to know the gospel,
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:53.160]   you should have a better understanding,
[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:56.800]   until you get a very solid understanding
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:59.840]   of what the gospel is.
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:02.320]   Now remember what I asked you very beginning,
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:05.000]   the first question, the way in Chicago, right?
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.320]   The way in Chicago.
[00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:08.840]   You have been in Chicago for some time,
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:11.180]   and you're familiar with the city, right?
[00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:13.760]   You can show other people the way.
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:16.960]   Now, I wanna apply this question to the Christian faith.
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:20.480]   If someone you bump into, know nothing about the gospel,
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.800]   and he asked you or she asked you,
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:25.640]   what this Christian thing is all about, right?
[00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:28.600]   How do I get there, right?
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:30.040]   How do I get to know Jesus?
[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:32.760]   What is the way?
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:35.520]   Can you tell the person?
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:38.440]   Immediately, right away.
[00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:39.720]   Now what I'm saying is,
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:43.480]   not only you should get a better understanding yourself,
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:45.560]   you should be able to explain it,
[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:49.400]   to tell other people, right?
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.200]   If you cannot tell other people,
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:54.240]   hey, what is the way to God, right?
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.600]   Then you probably have some work to do, right?
[00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:59.680]   And I encourage you to do that, right?
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:05.000]   So, these are some of the aspects
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.400]   that we need to ask ourselves.
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:10.280]   Our habit, how we use our time.
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:13.520]   Relationship, we configure in such a way
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:17.240]   that we'll enhance the kingdom work of God.
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:21.560]   The emotional growth for yourself,
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:23.800]   for your understanding of the gospel.
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:25.160]   Are you making progress?
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:28.840]   Are you making any progress?
[00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:31.080]   Are you making any step forward
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:35.560]   in your faith, in your faith journey?
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:41.320]   The book of Hebrews, one of the New Testament letters
[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:44.480]   written by a pastor to the church.
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:48.400]   Most of them were Jewish Christians.
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:52.280]   512, he says, "For though by this time,
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:54.920]   "you ought to be teachers."
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:57.720]   You need someone to teach you again and again
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:00.720]   the basic principles of the oracles of God.
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:03.960]   "You need milk, not solid food.
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:08.920]   "For everyone who lives on milk is unskilled
[00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:12.840]   "in the word of righteousness, for he is a child.
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:15.840]   "But solid food is for the mature,
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:19.440]   "for those who have the powers of discernment,
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:21.680]   "trained by constant practice
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:24.880]   "to distinguish good from evil.
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:28.600]   "Therefore, let us leave the elementary doctrine,
[00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:33.920]   "the basic doctrine of Christ, and go on to maturity,
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:38.880]   "not laying again a foundation of repentance
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:40.960]   "from that work and all that."
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:43.800]   Foundation of faith toward God.
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.360]   We don't need the foundation anymore
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:47.760]   because you got the foundation already.
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:49.040]   You see the progress here?
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:54.400]   Back then, you should be having milk, right?
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.120]   It's like a baby.
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:59.640]   Well, you need a milk bottle to feed yourself.
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:01.760]   You cannot have solid food.
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:05.240]   But now, two years later at least, right?
[00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:06.960]   Two years later, you came to know Christ
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:09.280]   at least two years later before lockdown,
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:10.440]   before the pandemics.
[00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:12.040]   Are you making progress?
[00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:14.800]   Or you're still having spiritual milk?
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:19.320]   You should be taking solid food, right?
[00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:23.280]   Otherwise, that would be strange, right?
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:24.760]   It would be strange.
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:27.680]   Year after year, you're still staying
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:29.440]   at the elementary level.
[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:32.200]   We cannot do that.
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:35.000]   The pastor says, "You need to make progress.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.680]   "Stop making excuse in your life."
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:41.400]   You know, we always have our own reasons.
[00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:44.040]   Hey, I wanna postpone this or postpone that, right?
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:50.120]   God is our priority, and you should be making progress.
[00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:54.480]   Now, as I told you, no one can really comprehend the Bible
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:58.640]   cover to cover in one sentence.
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.200]   Nobody can.
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:02.200]   Now, of course, to be honest,
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:04.440]   the simple message of the gospel is easy to understand,
[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:05.280]   right?
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:06.520]   A three-year-old, four-year-old can understand.
[00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:08.720]   God sold off the world, John 3:16.
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:11.760]   Everyone can understand the elementary doctrine,
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:15.040]   but we are not called to stay the same, right?
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:18.760]   That is why we have the Apostles' Creek.
[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:21.440]   The Apostles' Creek is a quick summary,
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:26.240]   a useful summary of Christianity in 12 sentences,
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:29.560]   12 statements, and the creek itself,
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:33.360]   Apostles' Creek, has been around for 1,800 years.
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:34.200]   Can you believe that?
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:37.240]   1,800 years, 1,800 years.
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:41.600]   Even the Roman Empire did not last that long.
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:45.120]   1,800 years, since AD 200-something,
[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:50.360]   we had the most basic form of the Apostles' Creek.
[00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:55.320]   Of course, it was not written by the first apostles.
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:59.080]   It was the rule of faith laid down by the early church,
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:01.000]   the first century church,
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.720]   or the second generation of the Christians.
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:08.680]   And because it goes back to a generation or two
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:12.160]   after the first apostles of Jesus,
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:13.560]   we call it Apostles' Creek.
[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:16.840]   Now, when we go through the Apostles' Creek,
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:19.440]   there were a little, here and there,
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:23.480]   I want you to understand what it is all about,
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:25.040]   Apostles' Creek.
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:28.120]   Now, you can imagine in the first century,
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:30.680]   when the Christian church just started,
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:34.480]   they need some standard of faith
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:38.320]   for the Christians to grasp,
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:42.480]   so that they understand what the true gospel is all about.
[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:46.000]   If you don't have the right content, you cannot grow.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:51.080]   As I said, we truncate, or we reduce the faith
[00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:52.840]   into one or two things,
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:54.720]   you cannot grow strong as a Christian.
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:29:00.960]   Couple weeks ago, Steve, remember that guy?
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:05.480]   Steve, he talk about the letter to the Ephesians.
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:08.400]   Right at the beginning, he said,
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:11.600]   we need to love our Lord, our God,
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:13.560]   with all our heart and all our soul,
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:17.760]   and all our mind, right?
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:19.560]   Your thinking.
[00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:22.280]   If your thinking is wrong, is truncated,
[00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:25.680]   you cannot relate to God, all right?
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:30.680]   Now, let's read the first sentence of the Apostles' Creek.
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:32.880]   Okay?
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:37.440]   It says, "I believe in God, the Father Almighty,
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:39.960]   "Creator of heavens and earth."
[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:44.000]   Did you hear that?
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.440]   I believe in God, the Father Almighty.
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:52.640]   Let me unpack that.
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:57.640]   First, faith, in the biblical sense,
[00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:00.760]   faith is not making something true.
[00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:05.120]   Faith is not making something true.
[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:08.400]   Faith is affirming something that is true.
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:11.320]   Okay?
[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:14.080]   Okay, let's do some intellectual exercise.
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:17.880]   Faith, believe in Christ, believe in the gospel.
[00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:20.200]   Faith is not making something true.
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:24.120]   Faith is affirming something that is already true.
[00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:26.920]   How many of you believe in ghost?
[00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:31.440]   How many of you are afraid of ghost?
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:33.520]   All right, how many of you believe in ghost?
[00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:34.800]   You believe in ghost, right?
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:37.920]   I believe in ghost because the Bible tells me so, right?
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:40.560]   You believe in ghost,
[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:44.880]   have you ever hunt one of those?
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:49.280]   You go out to the haunting house and hunt one of the ghost?
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:52.080]   No, right?
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:54.800]   It stays in the intellectual level.
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:59.440]   You can believe in something, something that exists,
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:03.360]   the existence of something or someone,
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:06.400]   but you don't have the relationship.
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:10.480]   It's all a matter of intellectual only.
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:14.880]   That is how the apostles' quick begins.
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:19.880]   I believe, I believe means not just intellectual checkbox.
[00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:25.000]   I believe means I am believing into God.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.600]   I'm committing on myself to the relationship of God.
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:33.200]   Now, how many of you know my wife?
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:37.120]   How many of you know my wife exists?
[00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:42.880]   She really does, she really does, okay?
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:45.760]   Even though sometimes I ignore it, all right?
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:48.440]   She really does exist, she really does exist.
[00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:51.160]   But the fact that you believe my wife exists
[00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:54.240]   doesn't mean you are committed to her, right?
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:56.800]   For me, it's a totally different thing.
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:32:01.840]   I believe she exists and I commit to her, right?
[00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:04.680]   You see the difference?
[00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:06.960]   Now, the Bible has two parts,
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:11.040]   the Old Testament and the New Testament, right?
[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:14.000]   Have you ever wondered why there's a word testament there?
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.240]   The word testament comes from Greek word
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:19.920]   and that means covenant.
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:25.080]   It is a lifelong commitment, right?
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:29.360]   It's the same thing as intellectually,
[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:30.720]   I know my wife exists,
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:35.760]   but in terms of life, in terms of my life commitment,
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:38.720]   I am committing myself to her,
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:41.680]   not just affirming she exists only,
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:44.480]   but I'm committing to her, right?
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:48.880]   I believe in God, the Father Almighty,
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:53.360]   means that I'm not just affirming the existence of God.
[00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:55.720]   There's no use, right?
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:57.160]   It doesn't impact your life.
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:01.600]   I believe in God, the Almighty,
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:05.080]   means I'm committing myself to Him.
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:07.800]   So the Christian faith is not about
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:11.120]   affirming the existence of God, right?
[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:12.440]   I would be totally comfortable
[00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:14.200]   if someone check in our church,
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:16.200]   what do you believe in?
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:18.040]   What you don't believe in.
[00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:20.920]   If he asks what I don't believe in,
[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:23.240]   what the church does not affirm,
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:27.080]   I would be totally comfortable to answer and say,
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:29.200]   we do not affirm the existence of God.
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:31.840]   Yes, we don't,
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:38.280]   but we affirm the God who exists and relate to us.
[00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:40.720]   You see, there's a total different thing, right?
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:44.760]   Many people come to faith thinking,
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:47.480]   oh, this is an intellectual checkbox.
[00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:48.880]   I believe in the existence of God,
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:51.520]   but it doesn't really impact your life.
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:54.600]   You're not believing in the biblical sense.
[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:58.480]   You believe the God who commit himself to you.
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:02.560]   His son died for you on the cross,
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:05.200]   and that's why you believe in God who exists.
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:06.320]   It's a totally different thing
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:08.840]   than affirming the existence of God only.
[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:11.720]   You see the difference?
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:14.680]   Genesis 1.1.
[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:18.920]   In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:23.720]   In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.
[00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:26.440]   You open the pages of the Bible.
[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:30.120]   Do you find it interesting?
[00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:32.560]   There's no intellectual argument in the Bible
[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:36.320]   that you can find that would prove the existence of God.
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:38.840]   The Bible doesn't waste time doing that.
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:40.560]   The Bible simply assume,
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:46.720]   simply presuppose that only with God everything exists,
[00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:52.720]   only because of God himself, everything works.
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:56.920]   On this presupposition, you have to choose
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:35:01.680]   whether you come to faith in this God, creator, or not.
[00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:04.240]   That is what the Apostle Creeks is all about.
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:06.920]   So you open the pages of the Bible.
[00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:10.720]   You're always confronted with the God who created you,
[00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:15.880]   the God who exists,
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:19.320]   and he rules over the entire cosmos,
[00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:21.640]   entire life of yours.
[00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:25.000]   And what is your relationship with God who created you?
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   You owe your life to him.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.960]   How do you relate to this God?
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:36.920]   You're always confronted with this cosmic question.
[00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:38.880]   Who is God to you?
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:42.080]   Now what does it mean to believe in God?
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:42.920]   I believe.
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:49.480]   It means for us today that I will worship God and God alone.
[00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:55.840]   I show that in my use of time,
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:36:00.600]   in my emotional status,
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:06.640]   in my configuration with the church, with other people.
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:09.720]   You cannot be double-minded.
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:13.040]   You gotta put your entire trust in him.
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:17.080]   And secondly, what does it mean for us
[00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:18.360]   when we say I believe?
[00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:21.240]   I will continue to seek God's will
[00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:23.640]   in all the decisions in my life.
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:29.400]   You ask God whether I should do this or do that.
[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:33.400]   You always have that in your mind.
[00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:37.120]   Whether I should wake up today to worship him or not.
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:39.560]   I'm always confronted with this question.
[00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:44.560]   I set my orientation of my life to please God himself.
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:49.840]   And thirdly, it means I'm making a commitment
[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:53.840]   to know God and know him better every day.
[00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:56.040]   I'm making a commitment to him.
[00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:59.480]   That is what it means I believe, all right?
[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:06.200]   Let's end with doing the Apostles' Creed.
[00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:07.520]   Let's recite it.
[00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:10.760]   Let's all stand together.
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:12.280]   And then we'll close by prayer.
[00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:13.120]   Let's all stand.
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:18.560]   We're gonna read the English only,
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:21.040]   but you can do the other language if you want.
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:25.840]   Apostles' Creed, let's do it together.
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:29.160]   I believe in God, the Father Almighty,
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:31.440]   creator of heaven and earth.
[00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:35.160]   I believe in Jesus Christ, his only son, our Lord.
[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:38.720]   He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:40.920]   and born of the Virgin Mary.
[00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:43.240]   He suffered under Pontius Pilate,
[00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:46.280]   was crucified, died, and was buried.
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:48.240]   He descended to the dead.
[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:50.480]   On the third day, he rose again.
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:53.000]   He ascended into heaven and is seated
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.920]   at the right hand of the Father.
[00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:58.440]   He will come again to judge the living and the dead.
[00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:02.680]   I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy universal church,
[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:06.440]   the chameleon of saints, the forgiveness of sins,
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:10.200]   the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting.
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:11.560]   Amen.
[00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:12.760]   Let's all pray together.
[00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:16.760]   Father, thank you for the opportunity to get to know you.
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:19.960]   And I pray that every single one of us
[00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:23.640]   will make progress in our faith,
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:25.920]   to get to know you, to get to know your power.
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:32.640]   I pray that you will help us to commit ourselves into you,
[00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:38.120]   as you have committed yourself into us.
[00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:42.280]   You show us on the cross, you show us on the empty tomb
[00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:44.240]   that you are the Lord and Savior.
[00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:47.720]   And I pray that our belief will continue to grow,
[00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:51.640]   how we see ourselves, how we see the world,
[00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:55.640]   how we see you as our king and our Savior.
[00:38:55.640 --> 00:39:00.160]   So I pray that you will exercise your lordship in our lives.
[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:03.720]   Yes, we face a lot of different problems in our lives.
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:07.200]   Our own personal growth, our own personal career,
[00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:11.320]   our relationship, our family, our future.
[00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:15.800]   But we know that you above all, you are God alone.
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:18.240]   And I pray that we will make our commitment into you
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:20.440]   and we'll grow into your word.
[00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:24.240]   And I pray that as we gather to study your word,
[00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:26.840]   your spirit will continue to speak to us,
[00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:31.840]   to build us up, that we will be a solid Christians,
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:35.040]   we will be solid church that will please you
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:36.560]   and worship you.
[00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:38.720]   In Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:39.920]   Well, you may be seated.
