00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 I believe that in 1974, when Linda Stratton wrote "Sing Hallelujah to the Lord",

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 she never imagined that this song would become a song that has a political connection to the present.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 In Hong Kong, when there are police officers and government officials,

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 the public surround them and sing "Sing Hallelujah to the Lord".

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Indeed, when we listen to this song,

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 the tune of this song is very calming and calming.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 When we sing this song, we can feel that there is a greater truth and peace in this world.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 In this turbulent and unstable world, everyone wants to be safe.

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 This song has five verses.

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Many people sing this song, including those who do not know Jesus Christ.

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 What message does this song want to convey?

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 Let me explain the meaning of the five verses.

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 The first verse is "Sing Hallelujah to the Lord".

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 "Hallelujah" means "Praise the Lord".

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 It is a praise from the bottom of the heart.

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 How beautiful is God?

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 The four verses of this song give us some inspiration.

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 The second verse is "Jesus is risen from the dead".

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 In the Christian faith, Jesus Christ is the Son of God.

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 He died on the cross to save people.

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 He saved people from being released from sin.

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 When he died, he conquered death and the evil that controls people's lives.

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 Why do we praise the Lord?

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 Because God saved us from death and saved us from being released.

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 So that people can have a new beginning.

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 The third verse is "Jesus is Lord of heaven and earth".

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 This is a very important message.

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 In the first chapter of Genesis, God created the world.

29
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 When we understand the word "creation",

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 we understand that it is not about evolution or creation.

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 For the Jews, it is very practical.

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 If this world is created by our Lord,

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 it means that this world is owned by this Lord.

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 If this world is owned by this Lord,

35
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 we must obey him because he is the master of this world.

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 He is the Lord of heaven and earth.

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 That is, no sovereignty in the world can be greater than Jesus Christ.

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 No sovereignty is greater than the Lord of heaven and earth.

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 The Lord of heaven and earth reminds those who believe in the Lord that there is only one Lord in the world.

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 The fourth verse is "Jesus is living in his church".

41
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 It is true that the Bible always says that the head of the church is the Christian,

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 but the body is the church.

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 It means that people should see Jesus,

44
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 Jesus' goodness, Jesus' kindness, Jesus' kindness, Jesus' justice,

45
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 through the true believers.

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 Some people say, "Ask Jesus to come and see me."

47
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 Jesus has already come to see you and me.

48
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 He tells people through the church what is justice and what is love.

49
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 The fifth verse is "Jesus is coming for his own".

50
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 When Jesus Christ created this world,

51
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 he saw that the world was harmed by sin,

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 and that the relationship between man and God was completely destroyed,

53
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 and that when people lived in sin and tears,

54
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 God came to this world to conquer evil and death.

55
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 He came to this world again.

56
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 In the 21st chapter of the Book of Ecclesiastes,

57
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 the third and fourth verses say that God is in the world,

58
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 and that God will be in this world again.

59
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 There will be no more death, sorrow, and pain.

60
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 These teachings are included in the verses.

61
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 But what do they mean to us?

62
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 They give us a few meanings.

63
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 First, when we sing this song,

64
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 we must remember that there is a God in heaven who loves us.

65
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 He is not only coming to get rid of the unjust world government

66
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 and the unfair social system.

67
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 Those are important.

68
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 But most importantly, he wants you to know him,

69
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 so that our lives can be changed,

70
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 so that the evil and death in our lives can be solved.

71
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 When I was young, there was a saying that came out of my mind.

72
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 "Every day, five or four young people visit each other."

73
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 Every person, every regime can turn from love and hatred to evil.

74
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 Only when Jesus Christ returns to this world,

75
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 can we turn the world around.

76
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 One of the ways to change our lives is to save us,

77
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 so that we can be set free from sin,

78
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 so that people in this world can see what love and justice are.

79
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 So, first, he hopes that when you sing this song,

80
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 you will not only see the problems in society,

81
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 but also your own problems, and be willing to return to him.

82
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 He also wants people to know that he is the true master of the world.

83
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 All the regimes in the world,

84
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 whether you are a democratic or an extreme right wing society,

85
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 all have the tendency to tell us that he is the true master.

86
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 Sorry, the true master of this world is Jesus Christ.

87
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 So, the church in this world is telling everyone in this world

88
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 that there is only one master in this world.

89
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 And this master invites us to live a new life of another kind of nation,

90
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 a new life, a life of love, a life of justice,

91
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 a life of justice, peace and love.

92
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 The regime is not our master.

93
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 We are not our own masters.

94
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 The rich are not our masters.

95
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 Only Jesus Christ is our master.

96
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 So, here is the second reminder for us.

97
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 When we sing this song,

98
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 we are welcoming the fact that there is a master who loves us.

99
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 He is waiting for us.

100
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 Finally, the church is telling people to know Jesus,

101
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 to believe in the Christian community of Jesus Christ.

102
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 The church on earth is telling people that there is love,

103
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 there is light, and it comes from Jesus Christ.

104
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 He will ultimately rule this world,

105
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 and bring people back to his side once again,

106
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 and give them true freedom.

107
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 So, when we sing this song today,

108
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 whether you are a Christian or not,

109
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 I hope you will sing this song,

110
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 and you will see the God who commands justice and peace.

111
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 I do not deny that God really wants us to

112
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 carry out justice and peace in society.

113
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 This is important.

114
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 But at the same time,

115
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 he also invites you and me to walk with him.

116
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 Our life is to be returned to him,

117
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 and our life is to be led by Jesus Christ,

118
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 not by any regime.

119
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 We are to be led by Jesus Christ,

120
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 to reveal the love of justice and peace

121
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 in our society,

122
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 and to wait for him to return,

123
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 to show the love of justice and peace

124
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 to the whole world.

125
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 You and I live every day

126
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 to reveal the love of justice and peace of Jesus Christ.

127
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 I hope that at this moment,

128
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 we can experience God's peace,

129
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 peace, and blessings to everyone.
