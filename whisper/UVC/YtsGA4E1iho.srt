1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,500
 Awesome. Well thank you very much for having me.

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:14,480
 It's great to be here and be with your pastor, Pastor Mark.

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:22,740
 Yeah, it's really neat for me because I was in a, so I'm in the process of

4
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,860
 planning a church, all people's church in the West suburbs, and Pastor Mark was

5
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:32,540
 one of the trainers, the facilitators, so it's really cool to come and be with

6
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:40,340
 you all now. So well let me pray for us before we get in.

7
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:46,700
 Father in heaven, I pray that you would be with us now.

8
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:56,400
 Bless the words of my mouth and the meditations of all our hearts. In Jesus

9
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:07,540
 name we pray, amen. Amen. What we believe about God is the most important thing

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:19,500
 about us. What we think about God, it's the most important thing about us. Do we

11
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:29,820
 see God as distant? Do we see God as a some kind of cosmic killjoy? It matters.

12
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:37,140
 It matters our view of God. I got four points for us today as we look at what

13
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:42,140
 Paul is saying, what Paul is saying, and just a little background here. We're

14
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:48,540
 jumping just right into the verse, these verses in Philippians chapter 3, and this

15
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,900
 probably comes out of my church had been going through the book of Acts for like

16
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:57,060
 a year plus, and then we jumped into Philippians because in the book of Acts,

17
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:03,700
 kind of the last half of it, we get a picture of into Paul's life as he is

18
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:09,020
 going around much of the known world at the time, 2,000 years ago, sharing about

19
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:15,940
 Christ, and the Holy Spirit is making disciples, and it's this amazing thing

20
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:21,220
 that God is doing. And then he finally gets to Rome where he's under house

21
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:28,100
 arrest, and he's under house arrest for two years as he's looking to stand

22
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:34,240
 before the Emperor Nero. And the Emperor Nero, many of you have heard of him, he was a

23
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:39,200
 pretty bad dude as we know through history. And so he's waiting, he's waiting

24
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,860
 for two years, and we get a few letters. We get these amazing letters of

25
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,380
 scripture that Paul writes during this time as he's just waiting in prison. We

26
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:51,780
 get this letter of the Philippians, we get Ephesians, we get Colossians, we get

27
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:57,180
 some of these letters. And so he's writing from under house arrest, and I

28
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:01,300
 saw that's important, that's important. And so he writes the

29
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,020
 Philippians, he hears how they're doing, and he has to write to them. And so

30
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:08,300
 that's where we get, starting off right here in verse 1, to write the same

31
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:15,420
 things to you is no trouble. The same thing. So he's previously instructed them,

32
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:20,260
 he knew them, he was with their right, Paul and Silas, maybe you remember that

33
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:25,820
 story growing up. And he wants to write them the same things, especially he wants

34
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:32,860
 to pinpoint, laser focus on the gospel, on the gospel. See the gospels is as Tim

35
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:38,420
 Keller says really well, not the ABCs of Christianity, but the A through Z of

36
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:43,740
 Christianity. He doesn't want them to be distracted by some other doctrine or

37
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:47,900
 teaching or something else because there's been false apostles, there's

38
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:54,900
 false teachers, and people are spreading lies about that. And so he wants us to

39
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:02,660
 look right at the gospel. And what he's talking about, I'm reminded today is

40
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:09,220
 you guessed it, no not Halloween, it's Reformation Day. It's Reformation Day.

41
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:18,180
 Yes, yes, of course. Yeah, so I'm a nerd and I got a really bad joke for you. So

42
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:23,380
 it's Halloween and some kids come to the door, they knock on Martin Luther's door.

43
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:38,740
 All right, they knock knock. "Who is it?" "Ah, trick or treat!" "No, no kids, I said 95

44
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:46,140
 feces, not 95 Reese's, okay? I don't have any candy for you. I got the gospel though."

45
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:51,980
 Okay, yeah, bad joke, bad joke. I just had to though, I couldn't resist. All right, so

46
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:57,700
 at least Pastor Mark is laughing with me, he gets the joke. All right,

47
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:03,660
 Reformation Day reminds us of how Martin Luther, John Calvin, these reformers, these

48
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:08,460
 others, they point us back to the truth because the church had gone way off and

49
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:16,500
 they reminded us of two huge things. That our trust is in the Word of

50
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:22,660
 God alone. That's our authority, God's Word. We got to find truth there, nowhere

51
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:28,660
 else. That's the ultimate place. And then secondly, that we are saved by grace. We

52
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:34,740
 are saved by grace through faith. And that's what really he is wanting to

53
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:39,340
 pinpoint and remind the Philippians of today. And I think we need that

54
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:43,780
 desperately as well. So that's what's coming up. That's what's going on. That's

55
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:50,140
 why the stupid joke. And Martin Luther, I love he said this, he says justification.

56
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:55,700
 Justification is the biblical Christian word that just means that we are saved

57
00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:00,580
 by grace, we're accepted by God, we've declared and made righteous by his work,

58
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:05,860
 not our. He says justification is the article by which the church stands or

59
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:13,860
 falls. But he wants them to remember the gospel. He tells them this, "Therefore my

60
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:20,940
 brothers and sisters, you whom I love and long for, my joy in my crown, stand firm

61
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:25,900
 in the Lord this way, dear friends." He wants them to stand firm on the gospel.

62
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:33,100
 Stand firm in what I taught you. What Silas and I, what we taught you when we

63
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:37,700
 shared the gospel. And that's the same thing for us, brothers and sisters. Stand firm on

64
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:43,820
 the gospel. So that's our first point that I want us to get. We want to

65
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:49,220
 rejoice in the Lord. We rejoice in the Lord. We need to know the gospel. We need

66
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:53,660
 to stand firm on the gospel and nothing else. Friends, what are you standing firm

67
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:58,260
 on? What are you standing firm on today? Is it anything else other than the gospel?

68
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:03,580
 Then that will really be shaken. I can tell you from experience that will be

69
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:08,700
 shaken. All right. And we're just gonna continue to explore this even more.

70
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:14,860
 Second point is this, Paul has for us, is to reject works righteousness. If we

71
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:21,620
 really want to rejoice in the Lord, to take joy in knowing Christ, because

72
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:25,940
 that's what this passage is all about, then we have to reject works

73
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:33,500
 righteousness. We see that in verses 2 through 6. Look with me there. He says,

74
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,540
 "Watch out for those dogs, those evildoers, those mutilators of the flesh."

75
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:45,340
 Wow. He's got some strong language there. Strong language. He's not, he's not holding

76
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:52,060
 back. Dogs. All right. So he calls them dogs. So what's going on here, all right?

77
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:55,900
 What's going on here? They talk about circumcision before and maybe some

78
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:00,540
 of you get a little squeamish now. So there are these Jewish

79
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:05,740
 Christians and people who are coming in. There was this huge tension between Jews

80
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:10,700
 and non-Jews. Jews and Gentiles at the beginning of the church. And a lot of

81
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:14,380
 these Jewish Christians, some Jewish Christians were saying, "All right, you

82
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:20,580
 have to be circumcised in order to be a follower of Christ." And in fact, they so

83
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:25,300
 tied it to it that it was part of their justification, it was part of their salvation.

84
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:29,780
 That, all right, in order to know that you're really saved, you've got to be

85
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:35,900
 circumcised. All right? Maybe some Christians today, you think of, you think

86
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:40,340
 of, all right, you have to be baptized in order to be saved. It's like, all right,

87
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:45,340
 you know, you get saved because you, or you become saved, you become a follower

88
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:49,340
 of Christ, and then you get baptized. All right? But that doesn't mean it's not

89
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:53,900
 works-based. And so that's what he's getting at with this. That's what he's

90
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,300
 getting at. And he calls them dogs because back in the ancient world, 2,000

91
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,300
 years ago, it wasn't like your sweet little puppy dog, you know, it wasn't your

92
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:10,220
 nice pet dog. 2,000 years ago, all right, dogs were gross. They were filthy. No one

93
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:15,300
 had them as pets. They ran wild in the streets, okay? They were disgusting. All

94
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:21,740
 right? So he's saying, "The dogs." And you know what? It was a ethnic slur,

95
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:27,980
 actually, that Jews would use for non-Jews. They'd say, "Man, those dirty,

96
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:35,300
 uncircumcised Gentiles, those non-Jews, they're dogs." So Paul turns it around, he

97
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,860
 flips it around, he says, "You know what? Who really are the dogs? These people who

98
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:44,900
 are saying, 'Oh, you have to be circumcised in order to be a Christian.'"

99
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:49,340
 Because what did you have to do to be a Christian? To believe, to be saved by

100
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:53,420
 grace through faith, right? So he's saying, "All right, these evildoers, these

101
00:09:53,420 --> 00:10:00,100
 mutilators of the flesh." He goes on, he says, "We are the circumcision, who

102
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:05,780
 worship by the Spirit of God in glory in Christ Jesus and put no confidence in

103
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:08,980
 the flesh." So he's saying, "You need to reject works righteousness. You're not

104
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:16,900
 saved by this ritual, all right? No, you're saved by faith." Circumcision in the Old

105
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:22,860
 Testament was never meant to be a thing that, "Oh, that's a work that

106
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:27,820
 saved you." No, it was a sign. It pointed to the reality that you had been

107
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:33,780
 saved, that sin has been cut away in your life and now you're a follower of God.

108
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:40,700
 I love this. He goes on, verse 4, let's keep going, "Though I myself have reasons

109
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:46,340
 for such confidence." So now Paul is, all right, he's worked up here. He's like,

110
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:51,660
 "All right, if you want to say some confidence in the flesh of what our

111
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:56,540
 works are, he doesn't want them to be that way." So he says, "All right, I have

112
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:01,500
 some confidence in my flesh that I could talk about. If someone else thinks he has

113
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:08,980
 reasons to put confidence in flesh, I have more." All right? So then Paul goes

114
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:15,460
 into this and he has seven things that he can have confidence in, all right, that

115
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:20,220
 he was this amazing Jewish person, all right, circumcised on the eighth day.

116
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:24,100
 All right, you were supposed to do that according to Leviticus, according to the

117
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:31,620
 command of God, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin. All right,

118
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:35,980
 Benjamin, that tribe was one that sometimes stayed more faithful to God

119
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:40,780
 when other tribes fell away from God throughout Old Testament history. He was

120
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:43,900
 a Hebrew of Hebrews. All right, what does that mean? All right, we know, we already

121
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:49,780
 know you're Jewish, Paul, okay? No, so what that meant was that he was not only

122
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:56,740
 Jewish, but he actually spoke Aramaic and his parents spoke Aramaic. That was the

123
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:02,060
 Hebrew language of the day. So he's saying, "I don't just speak Greek, I speak,

124
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:06,500
 man, I'm..." So he's building his credential, all right? His resume is building. He's like,

125
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:11,140
 "Man, wow." All right, he keeps going though. In regard to the law of Pharisee,

126
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:16,580
 Pharisees were regarded as the strictest kind of Jewish sect at the time. There are

127
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:20,820
 a few kind of branches, if you will, of Judaism, and Pharisee, that was strict, and

128
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:29,980
 he was climbing that ladder. As for zeal, persecuted the church. I persecuted the

129
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:36,300
 church. Man, I was so zealous for my faith in God, I was such a good Jewish boy that,

130
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:41,020
 man, I held the cloaks for those, I held the coats, I was the coat rack for those,

131
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:45,900
 who stoned Stephen, the first Christian martyr. You can go back and look at

132
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:51,660
 that, it's like Acts 7, I think. I persecuted the church. As for

133
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:56,460
 righteousness based on the law, faultless. As for righteousness based on the law,

134
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:00,500
 faultless. All right, so this doesn't actually mean that Paul was without

135
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,620
 sin. You can read Romans 7, you can read a lot of the rest of his letters, he is

136
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:10,860
 very... He says, "I'm the chief of all sinners. I'm the worst." Right? But he said, "On the

137
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:15,740
 outside, I kept all the laws. On the outside, it looked like I was perfect."

138
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:21,020
 That's what he's talking about here. So he's telling, all right, this is...

139
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:25,620
 Paul's supposed to sound just crazy. All these things, though, they sound very,

140
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:33,660
 very good. The Jews would be wowed by his resume, you know? Maybe for some of you,

141
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:38,700
 maybe some of you young people who are looking to go to college, or went to

142
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:43,580
 college, or going to get your master's, or whatever. Man, you did so many

143
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:50,220
 extracurriculars, right? And you're Asian too, I know how it is. No, I'm just kidding.

144
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:57,620
 Hey, hey, yeah, exactly. I shout out because I grew up in San Francisco Bay Area. I was

145
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:02,500
 talking to Pastor Mark before on this. I was just back after 11 years, San

146
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:07,140
 Francisco Bay Area. And I got a lot of my Asian friends there, man. All the Asian

147
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:12,580
 love, man. I'm telling you. All my friends were Chinese, and all my friends,

148
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:17,620
 most of my friends were Asian because I was in the honors AP classes, right? They

149
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:21,300
 were in the honors AP. So they were all Asian. I'm just saying, I'm just saying. I

150
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:26,460
 know how it is. I know your parents and how your parents are. Yeah, there you go.

151
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:32,100
 But yeah, maybe you were building that resume to try to impress your parents.

152
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,900
 But maybe you keep doing that to try to impress God. Man, God, I've done this for

153
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:41,420
 you. I've sacrificed. I went on that mission trip. Man, I'm praying hard. I'm

154
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:45,740
 reading my Bible. It's just the same thing like circumcision. All right, I'm

155
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:53,860
 all right. That'll make me earn your approval. I know for me, I was just

156
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:59,460
 the same way, a huge way. I remember when I was in college, I became part of this

157
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:03,860
 church. And it was a very passionate church. There were a lot of good

158
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:08,980
 things there. I remember I was coming out of a, I've shared with many people in my

159
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:14,700
 church, I deal with situational depression. And I had the worst, my

160
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:21,060
 first bout when I was 17. And I would have been depressed out of my mind. I had

161
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:25,980
 considered myself before that a mature Christian. But God really humbled

162
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:30,340
 me. And so I have all that baggage and I'm going, I come out here to the Midwest

163
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:34,740
 to go to school. I go to Wheaton College. And right, it's just this, supposed to be

164
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:40,500
 this evangelical flagship that just, and there's, I'm on a dorm floor and there's

165
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:48,460
 40 other Christian guys. And you know, we were praying in the classroom. I have

166
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:52,460
 professors who are Christian. I go to chapel three times a week, three times.

167
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:59,900
 Chapel. I get involved in this passionate church, right? I go on mission trips. Man,

168
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:04,500
 God totally changed my life through this dorm discipleship group, these

169
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,980
 guys. He started to bring me out of this depression and really restore my

170
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:14,420
 relationship with him again. This group was so intense that it meant three

171
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:20,380
 nights a week as a very rigorous academic school. Three nights a week. This

172
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:25,140
 meant, and they totally changed my life. I got real with these other guys and

173
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:31,260
 they got real with me about their lives and we encouraged each other. And so I

174
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:36,540
 just wanted to share my faith with others as well. And I would go to some

175
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:43,140
 local campuses, college campuses, and share my faith with them. And I would go

176
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:49,100
 one to three times a week to share the gospel with people at campuses. I started

177
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:54,580
 leading small groups with my church. I was passionate and I would fast

178
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:58,940
 one or two times a day because I want to set apart time to meet with God. I would

179
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:05,220
 spend two or three hours in the morning meeting with God. You know, after a couple

180
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:10,500
 years of all that, I remember at one point I was trying to spend just a few

181
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:17,340
 minutes with God. This was after I was married and my wife and I, our picture of

182
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:20,340
 the world and our worldview of Christianity had been totally turned upside

183
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:23,940
 down just a few months before because we had realized some very dysfunctional

184
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:29,700
 things about that church. It was very passionate but it was so works

185
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:34,340
 oriented. And I had this huge burden on my shoulders of self-righteousness

186
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:40,660
 because I was a Pharisee of Pharisees, guys. See, I had an impressive resume too.

187
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,940
 On the outside I looked really good, but man on the inside I felt like dead man's

188
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:48,820
 bones. And that's Paul's story too. And so he's passionate about telling the

189
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:56,220
 Philippians here, "Man, trust in the gospel of grace." Preaching the gospel to

190
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:00,860
 yourself. It requires us, you see here, "reject works righteousness." He says, "All

191
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:06,500
 right, reject it. Don't put it, base it on anything else, your own works, your own

192
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:14,340
 goodness, whatever, other than Christ's goodness, His grace." All right, let's keep

193
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:19,380
 going. Third point, "Remain in faith righteousness." Remain in faith

194
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:27,260
 righteousness. We see this in verses 7 through 11. "But whatever were gains to me

195
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:35,020
 I now consider loss for the sake of Christ." So if you will, he's got

196
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:40,660
 these two columns, right? Your gains and losses column. He says, "All right,

197
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:45,260
 just as I went through all these gains, he went through all these gains. I'm a

198
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:48,900
 Hebrew of Hebrews. I was circumcised on the eighth day. I was a Pharisee. I

199
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:54,380
 persecuted the church. Man, I was there. I was so passionate for God." He's got

200
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:58,980
 all these gains. He says, "You know what? They're in the losses column now.

201
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:05,540
 Every single one of them. Every single one of them. Where gains to me now I

202
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:09,100
 consider as a loss for the sake of Christ. What is more?" He goes further,

203
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:13,700
 verse 8, "I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of

204
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:23,340
 knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things." Remember,

205
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:30,260
 he's in house arrest in Rome. Man, he's been shipwrecked a couple

206
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:38,660
 times. He's been beat with rods. He's suffered the lashes. He's been stoned. One

207
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:42,220
 time they thought he was dead. He was just been stoned. They were about to

208
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:46,380
 make him, they were about to sacrifice to him. They were calling him Zeus and

209
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:52,860
 Barnabas, him Hermes and Barnabas Zeus. They were about to make sacrifices to

210
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:58,180
 him. And then some Jews come in and they start stoning him. Man, what a

211
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:02,940
 contrast there. They thought he was dead, but he ends up getting up. This guy had

212
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:09,020
 been through so much, right? He says, "All right, because of this grace, because this

213
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:15,580
 free gift of grace, not works righteousness, lost all things because I

214
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:21,300
 want to know Jesus. I want to know Jesus. I consider them garbage." So not only

215
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:26,180
 are they in the loss column, but I consider them garbage. That's this word

216
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:32,060
 that means refuse. Refuse. So I want to say then, just think about what this word

217
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:40,020
 means. They didn't have running water or a sanitation system like we do now.

218
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:50,700
 Nuff said. Refuse. He says, "All these good works, I consider them refuse and be found

219
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:55,100
 in him." Verse 9, "Not having a righteousness of my own that comes from

220
00:20:55,100 --> 00:21:00,620
 the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ." The righteousness from

221
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:05,060
 God on the basis of faith.

222
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:13,900
 It's amazing. It's good news. It is good news. We're learning to preach the

223
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:18,740
 gospel to ourselves. We need to learn to preach the gospel to ourselves to know

224
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:24,340
 this. So what is it for you? Maybe is it your own purity? Maybe that your

225
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:31,740
 parents are Christian? That you're Christian? That you go to church? Maybe

226
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:36,300
 you've done some significantly good things in your life? Your knowledge of

227
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:42,980
 the Bible? Your giving? Your overall just you're a good moral person? Is

228
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:49,340
 that what you're basing your acceptance with God in? Or is it in Christ's work?

229
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:59,860
 Verses 9, he talks about the life of righteousness. That we're saved by faith

230
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:04,740
 alone, Luther said, but that faith that saves is not alone. So how do we remain

231
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:10,500
 in faith righteousness? Yeah, we keep on rejecting it. We find ourselves in that.

232
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,700
 We encourage ourselves in that. That it's by grace. We keep on preaching that to

233
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:19,420
 ourselves, but we also want to continue. We want to obey. We want to keep

234
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:25,980
 following Christ. And this is amazing what he says here. Let's keep going on.

235
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:30,300
 Verse 9, he says, "And be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that

236
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:35,440
 comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ." I want to know

237
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:41,340
 Christ, yes. I want to know the power of the resurrection and participation in

238
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:46,180
 sufferings, becoming like him in his death, and so somehow attaining to the

239
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:52,060
 resurrection of the dead. That I may know him. Man, we make life about so many

240
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:58,100
 things, guys, right? But do you, every day, do you get up and say, "All right, I want to

241
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:05,060
 know Jesus today. At the end of today, I want to know Jesus." He says, "I want the

242
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:09,660
 power of his resurrection." What's the power of his resurrection? The power to

243
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:17,980
 save sinners. That sinners are saved. That, all right, we get the righteousness of

244
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:24,340
 Christ because he got all our sin on the cross, and God punished him for that. But

245
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:30,460
 then that means we get the righteousness of Christ. That's amazing. The power of

246
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:35,500
 the resurrection is also God saves us through Jesus on the cross, but then he

247
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:41,860
 also helps us to live a life of love, of loving others, of loving God. It's the

248
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:47,580
 power to live holy lives. That I may share in his sufferings. Man, did you see

249
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:51,140
 that this last week? Did you say like, "Man, you know what? I want to share in the

250
00:23:51,140 --> 00:24:00,460
 sufferings of Jesus." I doubt most of you said that. Man, we might not be persecuted

251
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:06,260
 in a way that Paul is, but we will in other ways. If we're sharing the gospel,

252
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:10,620
 we can do that. If we're living as Christians, as we just go through

253
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:14,540
 hardship in our lives because of the choices that we make to follow Jesus,

254
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:19,740
 it's gonna be difficult. It is hard to be a Christian. The way is narrow, and it's

255
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:26,420
 hard, but it leads to life. He says, "Becoming like him in his death." Becoming

256
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:33,620
 like him in his death. That we also can die to ourselves. We can die to our sin

257
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:41,900
 to follow him. That he would attain the resurrection of the dead. So don't get

258
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:47,740
 Paul wrong. He's saying, "Once saved, always saved," but we have to endure to the

259
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:55,140
 end. He's encouraging that you have to continue to follow Christ. It's the cross

260
00:24:55,140 --> 00:25:02,540
 before the crown. That we die before we can live, and we do that each day in our

261
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:09,700
 lives. So how do we, again, rejoice in knowing Christ? We remain in faith

262
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:16,580
 righteousness. In our righteousness, we are righteous because of our faith in him,

263
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:22,980
 not our own works. Fourthly, fourth point, he says to reside in his work of

264
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:29,980
 righteousness. We rest in his work of righteousness. We see this in verses 12

265
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:35,820
 and also through the end of the passage in 4.1. How do we do this? How do we do

266
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:40,180
 this? I love there's this, there's this line in the book of Hebrews, and he's

267
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:44,500
 talking about the rest of God. The rest of God. The Sabbath rest for God's

268
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:49,420
 people. And he says, "You know, man, you guys need to rest." He says, "How do you do that

269
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:58,780
 though? You strive." What? "You work really hard to not work." So what he's saying is,

270
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:04,620
 you got to work, you got to fight to remain in his righteousness. That it's

271
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:09,580
 not your work to be accepted by God. You got to work at that. You got to work to

272
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:14,460
 also live a life of holiness as you continue, because he wants to strain

273
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:18,660
 toward the goal. We see this in verse 12. He says, "Not that I have already obtained

274
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:24,260
 this." Alright, so I'm not with Christ fully now. I'm not in heaven. I'm

275
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:29,140
 not arrived at that goal. I'm not perfect, but I press on to take hold of which

276
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:34,500
 for which Christ Jesus has taken hold of me. Alright, so I can I can strive for

277
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:38,220
 that because, man, I'm already Christ. He took hold of me. Can you get out of

278
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:47,780
 Christ's hand? No. How absurd would that be? How can you go out of God's hand? So I

279
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:55,060
 want to keep on going to make Christ my own. I want to press on, take hold of it.

280
00:26:55,060 --> 00:27:04,540
 It's like this picture, right? I love the great artist, sculptor, Michelangelo,

281
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:11,140
 right? You guys probably know that famous statue of David, picture of David,

282
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:17,220
 and Michelangelo was asked, "Alright, how do you do this?

283
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:21,660
 You produce these amazing works, sculptures and works of art. How do you

284
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:26,180
 do this?" He says, "I just..." See, back then what they'd get is this big

285
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:32,620
 rectangular or block of marble, just huge massive block of marble, alright? And he

286
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:37,660
 says, "I would look at the block of marble and I would see the man in there. I would

287
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:41,460
 see the man in there and I just have to try to call it out. I have to like bring

288
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:47,980
 it out of there." Isn't that beautiful? But how he does that, there's this block of

289
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:53,060
 marble and he would have to go over there and have this huge block and slowly chip

290
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:59,900
 away at this block of marble all around it to get this amazing, just very

291
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:09,300
 intricate, detailed body of David that we see. That's what God does to us. Holiness,

292
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:18,180
 striving toward God, is as we continue to reside, to rest in his work for us,

293
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:25,140
 we have to press on toward the goal. It's painful at times. He's chipping it away

294
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:31,180
 at our sinful nature, but that prize, he says, "The prize is the fullness of

295
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:37,300
 rewards and joys in heaven." And so he sets his eyes on that, the fullness of

296
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:45,740
 the rewards and joys in heaven. It's this perfect life with Christ forever.

297
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:53,780
 Verse 17, he says this, he says, "Join together in following my example,

298
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:59,500
 brothers and sisters, just as you have us as a model. Keep your eyes on those who

299
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:05,940
 live as we do." Alright, so look at me, look at your Christian leaders, look

300
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:12,020
 at your pastor here, look at the leaders and mentors that you guys have. To imitate

301
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:16,460
 them, imitate them, to have godly discipleship. Maybe some of you need to

302
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:20,820
 say, call up or text someone in the church and say, "You know what? I need to

303
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:26,300
 talk to you. I love, I need your help in following Christ. Let's do this together.

304
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:32,460
 Let's follow Christ together." That's huge. That's massive. That has totally changed

305
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:36,540
 my life, walking with other believers, walking with other men of God who I want

306
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:40,540
 to be like, and we can sharpen one another.

307
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:50,500
 Verse 18, "For as I have often told you before and now tell you again, even with

308
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:55,380
 tears, many live as enemies of the cross of Christ. Their destiny is destruction.

309
00:29:55,380 --> 00:30:00,140
 Their God is their stomach. Their glory and their shame, their mind is set on

310
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:06,140
 earthly things." So what's he talking about here? So these are these Judaizers,

311
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:11,060
 again, who, they're on a self-salvation project. They're saying, you know, you need

312
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:15,220
 to add these dietary laws, you need to add this circumcision, whatever, so it's

313
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:19,420
 Jesus plus something equals your acceptance with God, rather than just

314
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:25,020
 Jesus equals your acceptance with God. He's wanting to add these things to them.

315
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:31,980
 And Paul says their destiny is final judgment. They worship themselves. That's

316
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:34,660
 what we're talking about. They worship their belly. They just worship

317
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:40,100
 themselves. Man, when I was so burdened by my own self-righteousness and just

318
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:44,020
 living, I was just always navel-gazing, as I like to say. I just

319
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:48,060
 always like, "Man, how am I doing? Am I doing good? Am I doing enough for God? Man,

320
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:53,580
 that's so exhausting, right? That's so exhausting." He says the things that we

321
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:57,380
 can do, the earthly things, the works of the flesh, they're consumed with earthly

322
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:06,500
 things, rather than Christ's external work, His work. Verses 20 through 21, here's

323
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:12,060
 another thing that the Philippians could have boasted. He says, "But our citizenship

324
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:18,340
 is in heaven." You see, Philippi, they thought they were all that, because they

325
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:22,380
 were a Roman colony. So they're like, "You know what? I get free taxes. How cool

326
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:27,420
 would that be, right? Free taxes." I mean, what am I saying? Free tax. That's what we

327
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:33,420
 get all right. No. They had freedom from taxes. They wouldn't get taxed, because

328
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:38,220
 they were a Roman colony. And so everyone there who was born there, you were a

329
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:43,460
 citizen automatically. You had this special thing. It was the status at

330
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:49,180
 the time. And so he's saying, "All right, your citizenship is in heaven. It's not

331
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:55,300
 with Caesar. It's not with Rome, right? So our identity, right? Our identity is not in

332
00:31:55,300 --> 00:32:00,300
 our performance. It's not in other people's approval of us. It's our identity is in

333
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:06,340
 Christ, in heaven. And from there, we eagerly await a Savior, the Lord Jesus

334
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:11,260
 Christ, who by the power that enables Him to bring everything under His control

335
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:16,620
 will transform our lowly bodies so that they will be like His glorious body." So he

336
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:20,660
 says, "All right, there's the prize. There's the prize." He's using that imagery of the

337
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:24,140
 ancient world. They were really big into sports, just like we are today. And

338
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:31,060
 there was that image of a wreath that at the finish line, that they would be

339
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:38,140
 given this crown, this wreath. And he's saying, "All right, there's this prize you can go for

340
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:45,020
 of reaching Christ, of running the race." And he's saying, "Yeah, I know it's hard to

341
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:49,020
 transform your lowly bodies because right now we are dying every day, right?

342
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:55,260
 We're dying every day. We're fighting against sin. We're slugging it out

343
00:32:55,260 --> 00:33:02,140
 and different hardships in our lives. But he says, "One day, we'll have a glorious body.

344
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:13,020
 We're gonna have a glorious body. Perfection is coming." He says, "Therefore,

345
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:20,220
 brothers and sisters, with you whom I love and long for," he wants to see them

346
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:28,900
 again, "my joy and my crown." There's that crown, that imagery, right? "My joy and my

347
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:33,660
 crown. Stand firm in the Lord in this way, dear friends." He says, "Keep on going.

348
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:39,260
 Remain in the gospel. Remain faithful." And maybe some of you need to hear that

349
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:45,140
 now. You know, the uncertainty of maybe things with COVID, uncertainty maybe with

350
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:49,380
 things with your job, things with how your future is gonna be maybe after

351
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:54,460
 graduation, with a relationship you're in, with your family dynamics. I don't know

352
00:33:54,460 --> 00:34:00,460
 what's going on with you. Just stay firm in the gospel. Just stay firm in following

353
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:08,220
 Christ because we can rejoice in Christ because His work for us, not our work,

354
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:14,460
 that saved us. That we are totally accepted by God. Just as Christ is

355
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:20,620
 accepted, He treats us the same way. We are accepted before God. That is a good

356
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:28,100
 news. I'll close with this. You know, it reminds me, we can rejoice in Christ.

357
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:34,180
 We can rejoice in knowing Him, that we know Him. It's like this. It can be

358
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:40,180
 like marriage. It can be like falling in love. Have any of you fallen in love?

359
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:49,260
 She's saying that, you know, as her husband, I think, is next door. You know,

360
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:55,180
 you'll do, you'll do. People in love are crazy. They'll do anything. They're nuts,

361
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:59,220
 right? You know what I'm saying? They're nuts. They're crazy. You'll do anything.

362
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:04,380
 They start acting weird ways, right? I just, you know, you're like, you're like,

363
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:08,020
 "Oh, I thought I knew him. Like, I thought he would never, you know, we were still

364
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:13,180
 gonna be friends. Now it's like, she came in and it's like, who are you?" You know,

365
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:18,580
 they start doing crazy things. You know, public displays of affection.

366
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:26,260
 I thought, I never thought that they would do that. People in love are crazy. You'll do

367
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:32,060
 anything for that person. You didn't care about anything else. But imagine this.

368
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:38,220
 Imagine, each of you, you're married to Mr. Law. Imagine with me here. You're

369
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:44,140
 married to Mr. Law. And Mr. Law, he likes everything very particular. He likes

370
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:49,380
 everything very particular. So he would come home every day at 5. He eats the

371
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:56,660
 same breakfast every morning. He comes out at 5. He demands a kiss and dinner on

372
00:35:56,660 --> 00:36:03,540
 the table. You always had to look just right for him. Otherwise, you'd hear from

373
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:10,100
 it. You could never really be real in your authentic self with Mr. Law. No, you

374
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:16,500
 definitely couldn't be. All the time, you just felt like you were striving to be

375
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:22,860
 good enough. You never felt good enough for him. Like, sure, yeah, he'd married you,

376
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:30,300
 but no matter how desperately hard you try, you always felt like you were just

377
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:36,660
 letting him down. And in fact, he would tell you that. He would tell you that. You

378
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:40,460
 were never good enough for him. You're always working on yourself. You're always

379
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:51,740
 trying to gain his approval. But then one day, Mr. Law died. And Mr. Faith

380
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:57,340
 Righteousness came. I sound like Pilgrim's Progress, John Bunyan or

381
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:03,540
 something right here. Jesus comes. Mr. Righteousness by faith. Mr. Grace. He

382
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:10,780
 comes and he sweeps you off your feet. Indeed, it seemed he always loved you, no

383
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:21,820
 matter all your deep shortcomings. He always put your needs above his.

384
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:29,700
 Every day, every moment, he was dying to himself for you. He always took out the

385
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:37,620
 trash. He cleaned the bathroom. With him, you were still so very in touch with

386
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:43,900
 your massive shortcomings. You just felt even more like, "Man, I'm so messed up." But

387
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:53,940
 you knew how much he loved and accepted you. You always found yourself actually

388
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:59,940
 just loving him more. Loving life more. Loving other people more. And you were

389
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:06,020
 slowly even changing and becoming a better person. That's what Paul talks

390
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:10,180
 about in the letters. And I think what he's getting at here, he says in

391
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:14,420
 Romans, he writes this. He says, "Likewise, my brothers and sisters, you have

392
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:21,300
 died to the law." You were married to Mr. Law. You died through the body of Christ

393
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:27,020
 so that you may belong to another. That's marriage language. To him who has been

394
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:32,540
 raised from the dead that you may bear fruit for God. For a while, you are still

395
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:36,900
 living in your flesh. Your sinful passions aroused by the law were at work

396
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:41,500
 in your members to bear fruit for death. But now you're released from the law.

397
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:49,300
 You're no longer under this. You have to earn your way. But Christ earned

398
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:56,300
 your way for you, having died to that which held us captive. Friends, I want

399
00:38:56,300 --> 00:39:01,500
 you, I want myself to know the joy rejoicing to knowing Christ. Here's how

400
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:06,580
 you do this. Paul says right here, "Rejoice in the Lord."

401
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:14,180
 Reject works righteousness. Remain in faith righteousness. Rest in his work of

402
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:18,700
 righteousness. Let's pray. Father in heaven, we thank you that you sent Jesus

403
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:26,540
 and we're reminded of that today. Lord, that what you do, you did what the law

404
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:32,140
 couldn't do. Lord, I pray that we would rejoice. We'd have so much joy flowing

405
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:36,980
 out of our lives because we know Jesus. That we would make our life about that.

406
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:41,860
 That we would revel in what you've done. That we would reject any other kind of

407
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:46,980
 righteousness, any kind of way of making ourselves acceptable to you God, whatever

408
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:54,500
 that may look like. In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
