[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600]   Just a word of reminder, I'm looking forward to next week,
[00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.740]   Dr. Ko-Hee Sun will be with us,
[00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.960]   and maybe a few more people will join us as well.
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.280]   So please come here early, all right, early,
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.320]   which is 11, and we're gonna share a portion
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.580]   of the whatever you call it, roasted pig, right?
[00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.420]   It's gonna be great, yeah, it's gonna be great.
[00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.800]   I talked to the cafe team,
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.160]   and we originally planned to have a birthday cake
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.760]   so we can cut it together,
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.360]   but Ada, one of the heads of the cafe team,
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.320]   called me and said, "Oh, I compared the prices,
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.960]   "and roasted pig is actually the same price as the cake,
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.640]   "right, so why don't we just go for roasted pig?"
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.720]   And okay, I said, "Yeah, why not?"
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.080]   Since it will be more delicious, I guess, right?
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.840]   So I come here at 11, so we're gonna join together
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.920]   in the cafe and have a good meal together, all right?
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.800]   So today, we are going to have a short message
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.800]   on the importance of this week, which is the holy week.
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.480]   Today is the Palm Sunday,
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.600]   that's why we have a brother getting baptized today,
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.080]   and seriously, you need to read his testimony.
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.080]   He came from China, from a pagan worshiping background,
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.040]   and he was led into a government church,
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.040]   and he found it uncomfortable,
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.920]   and eventually, he went to a family church, or house church,
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.920]   and he was introduced to Jesus,
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.600]   and then he came over to the United States not too long ago,
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.400]   started to come to our church actually months ago,
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.760]   and then I was talking to him
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.680]   about his decision to get baptized,
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.680]   and I actually asked him if he minds to wait a little bit,
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.560]   you know, wait till Christmas,
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.000]   we may have a few more people getting baptized, right?
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.640]   Because we're going to prepare one water tank anyway,
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.560]   whether you have 10 people getting baptized
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.400]   or one person getting baptized,
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.600]   it's gonna be one big water tank, right?
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.520]   So I asked him whether he's okay to wait until Christmas,
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.600]   we're gonna have baptism in Christmas,
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.780]   and he said, "No, I wanna get baptized."
[00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.780]   I said, "Whoa, okay, all right, then how will you answer?
[00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.160]   "How will you answer such a desire
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.200]   "to get baptized just himself, right?"
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.160]   So I talked to him, "You'll be just you,"
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.860]   and I didn't tell him, I said,
[00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.280]   "In my mind," I said,
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.480]   "We're gonna prepare one water tank anyway,
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.280]   "so may as well wait for other people to get baptized."
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.780]   And he said, "No, I wanna get baptized
[00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.620]   "because God has washed away my sin,
[00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.600]   "and I wanna tell the world that Jesus is my Lord,
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.320]   "and dude, amen to that, right?"
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.040]   So I had no answer, I said, "Yeah, let's do it, let's do it."
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.560]   So our team prepared the water tank for just one person,
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.620]   you know, one person getting baptized,
[00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.600]   and that is the most meaningful thing, right?
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.800]   We believe in Jesus Christ, we are in the name of Christ,
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.920]   and we receive the name of Triune God,
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.520]   Father and Son of the Holy Spirit,
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.480]   and the name being upon the person,
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.400]   and what a celebration, right?
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.040]   So read his testimony, it's very, very interesting.
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.160]   So this week is all about this,
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.520]   it's all about the salvation Jesus has done
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.080]   for all of us on the cross,
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.560]   and that is the last week, the final week of Jesus.
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.120]   Just very, very quickly, I wanna give you some survey.
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.120]   How important this week is,
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.720]   the last seven days of Jesus Christ
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.080]   on his earthly ministry, his earthly life.
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.600]   The last seven days is the most important thing
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.280]   recorded in the Bible.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.880]   All four gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.080]   spend over a quarter of its content,
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.220]   its pages, to record and to tell us the story,
[00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.920]   the crucified Messiah, Jesus Christ.
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.920]   If you turn to the fourth gospel, the gospel of John,
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.400]   actually half of the book is about Jesus Christ
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.640]   on the cross.
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.200]   He prepared himself to be nailed on the cross,
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.640]   and that is how important it is.
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.000]   If you add those up, if you add those up,
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.300]   if you're good at math, you add those up,
[00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.720]   you've got 30-some chapters
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.640]   talking about just this final week of Jesus,
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.640]   almost one-third to one-half of the four gospels combined.
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.420]   So this is the very, very important week
[00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.360]   that changed the world,
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.700]   changed the lives of the people who believe,
[00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.980]   all of us, each and every one of us.
[00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.440]   So it's a good thing to remind us
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.920]   to reveal what is going on in this final week.
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.120]   So we backtrack two days on Friday
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.120]   before the Palm Sunday,
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.040]   Jesus was annoyed by Mary at Bethany,
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.080]   and then it was Shabbat, resting day,
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.040]   and then Sunday is the Palm Sunday, which is today,
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.040]   and Jesus riding on a donkey,
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.840]   he enters Jerusalem as the king,
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.680]   and then he weeps for the city
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.000]   because the city of Jerusalem does not repent.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.680]   And in one generation in AD 70,
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.340]   in that year, the Romans would come
[00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:46.340]   and destroy the entire city and the temple.
[00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:50.880]   And he weeps about the end, the judgment on the city,
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.000]   and then he returns to Bethany.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.080]   And then on Monday and Tuesday,
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.480]   he returns to Jerusalem and have debates
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:04.440]   with all these religious leaders who would not repent,
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.120]   who would not recognize him as a Messiah.
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.480]   He also cursed a fig tree,
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:15.080]   which is a symbol of the Israel, the nation Israel,
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.080]   not willing to repent and bear fruit,
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:23.040]   which symbolizes the temple and the city of Jerusalem.
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.880]   And the Jewish leaders plot to kill him.
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.720]   So we come to Thursday and Friday,
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.800]   Jesus and his disciples share the last Passover meal,
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.900]   what we call the chameleon in later generations.
[00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:42.800]   And he talks so much about things for the disciples,
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.060]   which we call farewell discourse.
[00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:47.960]   So he's gonna say goodbye,
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.000]   but he's gonna have tons of things
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.160]   reminding the disciples, right?
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.440]   He's giving them the Holy Spirit to be with them,
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.020]   to walk with them so that they can grow in discipleship.
[00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.800]   And finally, he prays at Gethsemane,
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.740]   which is a garden at the foothill of Mount Olive.
[00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.980]   And he there was betrayed and arrested.
[00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:13.760]   And it was in the middle of the night,
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:18.040]   he was on trial and condemned by the Jewish court,
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.880]   by the Jewish leaders.
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:26.000]   And then Peter, as you remember, denies Jesus three times.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.160]   And then it was sunrise.
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:33.880]   And Jesus was tried by the Roman governor Pilate,
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.800]   and was mocked by King Herod.
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.960]   And then he eventually was crucified on God Gotham.
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.160]   And at the time of his death,
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.640]   the veil of the temple,
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:49.620]   which separate the Holy of Holies and the Holy place,
[00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:52.240]   there was a long veil hanging down
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:56.160]   from the roof of the temple all the way down to the ground.
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.120]   When Jesus died on the cross,
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:01.860]   that veil, according to the gospel of Mark,
[00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:04.920]   split into two from top to bottom,
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.480]   not bottom to top,
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.020]   from top to bottom, which is a miracle.
[00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:11.240]   And the veil was open,
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.600]   because Jesus now is the center
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.080]   of people meeting God himself,
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.020]   not the stone building, not the temple,
[00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:22.240]   not in Jerusalem, but in Jesus Christ,
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.800]   no longer in the city of Jerusalem,
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.240]   no longer in the Holy temple,
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:30.120]   but in the person and work of Jesus Christ,
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:33.280]   so we can be saved and come to the Father
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.840]   and be restored to him in relationship.
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.400]   And then Shabbat came,
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:40.560]   because he was buried in such a hurry manner,
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:43.640]   and the disciples or people who asked for Jesus' body
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:46.160]   from the cross, they just didn't have time
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.440]   to prepare the whole body,
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.200]   because Shabbat, there's no work,
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.520]   so they have to call it off.
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.060]   And then they left the tomb,
[00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:58.320]   you know, happily prepare his body,
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.200]   and then it was Shabbat,
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:04.400]   for 24 hours, the Jews were not allowed to work.
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:07.280]   And then Sunday morning,
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.360]   when the sun rises,
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:14.360]   the women go back to the tomb, why?
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:18.320]   Because they want to finish up the preparation
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:21.080]   for the body of Jesus,
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.480]   but they discover an empty tomb.
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:28.880]   And the empty tomb can be explained in a lot of ways.
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.920]   There are a lot of strange theories,
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.360]   you can explain away the empty tomb.
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.840]   But the Bible give us the biblical reason
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.960]   why Jesus' tomb is empty,
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:43.160]   why only his tomb is empty,
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.480]   because by the power of the Holy Spirit,
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.320]   Jesus is risen from the dead.
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:53.120]   Now, I've talked through the entire week
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.880]   in two and a half minutes, right?
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.840]   Three minutes, right?
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:00.920]   And this is the most important week of all in human history.
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.160]   What Jesus has done in this seven days
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.400]   changed your life and changed my life,
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.560]   and changed the lives of many, many people
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:09.240]   from generation to generation
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.000]   in the past 2,000 plus years.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.180]   Jesus has changed the course of our lives.
[00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:17.020]   Just as I told you,
[00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:21.160]   the person who received baptism today
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.520]   in the 10 o'clock service,
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:27.680]   he gave the testimony how God has touched his life,
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.240]   how Jesus has touched his life,
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.280]   and he wants to follow Jesus,
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:34.360]   and change the course of his life journey
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.000]   toward the kingdom.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.360]   And that is why the gospels, all four gospels,
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.200]   and even the gospel of Mark,
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.280]   spend so much energy,
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:46.560]   and so much verses and chapters
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:49.360]   on this past,
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.240]   on this holy week,
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:55.480]   especially on Thursday and on Friday.
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:58.800]   So I want to take you a very, very quick survey
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.360]   of what is going on at the end,
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.840]   the ending two days,
[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.320]   the last two days of Jesus' life.
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:09.060]   If you turn with me to the gospel of Mark chapter 14,
[00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:13.520]   here I give you some sort of a map, right?
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:15.540]   I want to encourage you in the holy week,
[00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:17.440]   go back home in your devotional,
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.800]   spend five minutes a day,
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.520]   pick the best time of your day.
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:22.600]   If you're an early riser,
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.000]   how many of you are early riser?
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.740]   You wake up, you feel refreshed all the time?
[00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:28.000]   None of you.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.360]   No wonder you guys are late.
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.880]   (audience laughing)
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:33.680]   No wonder you guys are always late, right?
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.320]   All right, how many of you,
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.200]   your best hour is at night?
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.720]   Best hour is at night.
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:40.880]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:42.480]   Nothing wrong with that, okay?
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.320]   Nothing wrong with that.
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.520]   But use it.
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.220]   Use three minutes, five minutes,
[00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:49.960]   turn to the gospel of Mark chapter 14 and 15.
[00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:52.520]   That is all about the Thursday and Friday,
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:55.200]   the last two days of Jesus' earthly life.
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.520]   And here I give you a map.
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:02.780]   Imagine yourself to be a movie director.
[00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:09.040]   You're gonna shoot the scenes of Jesus' last 48 hours.
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:12.400]   Here in chapter 14 of gospel of Mark,
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:16.880]   you see it's switched from A to B, A to B, A to B, right?
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:20.860]   All the A's are characters other than Jesus.
[00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:25.000]   All the B's are pretty much the focus of the camera
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.160]   is on Jesus himself, of what he said and what he did.
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:32.720]   A, you would start with 14, verses one and two.
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:35.280]   The Jewish leaders trying to kill Jesus
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:37.600]   and they have a plot to do so.
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.560]   So the focus is on the Jewish leaders,
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:43.520]   those who betrayed Jesus out of self-interest.
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:46.120]   They're trying to protect their own authority.
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.520]   The religious leaders in Jerusalem
[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:49.760]   trying to protect their own power
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:53.580]   because Jesus is getting the popular movement going on.
[00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:55.040]   So that's why they hate Jesus.
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.160]   They don't want Jesus to take their place.
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.200]   So they try to take away Jesus, trying to kill him.
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:04.160]   And then B, the second part is Jesus is anointed
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:09.260]   at Bethany by Mary.
[00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.960]   And Mary did that in order to prepare Jesus' death, right?
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.000]   You anoint the body, the dead body,
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.480]   in order to prepare the body for burial.
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:23.160]   And Mary probably understood the Messiah has to die.
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:28.160]   That's why she came with expensive perfume
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:32.240]   and trying to anoint the body of Jesus.
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:33.800]   And then it's switched to A again,
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:38.000]   which is the third paragraph, is Judah, one of the 12,
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.720]   joins the plot to kill Jesus.
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:43.860]   And then the camera shifts back to Jesus
[00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:46.500]   preparing for the Passover meal.
[00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:50.260]   And then one of the 12, again, Judah,
[00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:54.780]   will betray Jesus.
[00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:56.460]   And then switch to number six,
[00:13:56.460 --> 00:14:00.740]   which is the sixth section, verses 22 to 25.
[00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:05.740]   Jesus shares the Passover meal with his 11 disciples.
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:09.480]   And all the disciples will betray Jesus,
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:12.560]   and Jesus foretells that.
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:14.900]   And then switch back to Jesus praying
[00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:17.300]   in the garden of Gethsemane.
[00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:23.660]   And then the camera switch back to Judah, one of the 12,
[00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:28.740]   betrays Jesus, and all the disciples flee in the night.
[00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:34.180]   They all escape, trying to save their own lives.
[00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:38.860]   And then he was being brought in front of the Jewish court.
[00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:44.900]   Jesus revealed himself to be the Messiah, to be the Christ.
[00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:48.860]   And then lastly, we all remember this story.
[00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:50.400]   Peter's trying to get warm
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.940]   and get into the court of the high priest.
[00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:57.700]   And then he was being interrogated, being interrogated.
[00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:59.620]   And he was afraid.
[00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:03.080]   And he denied Jesus as his Lord,
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:05.800]   first time, second time, and third time.
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:10.500]   And then everybody fled.
[00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:12.480]   Jesus was alone.
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:17.400]   That is chapter 14 of the Gospel of Mark.
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:21.160]   And you see from top down, from top to bottom,
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.640]   all the people around Jesus trying to betray him,
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:30.480]   flee from him, to leave him alone, right?
[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:32.520]   To abandon him.
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:35.720]   From the Jewish leaders trying to kill Jesus,
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:39.560]   one of the 12 Jews trying to plot against Jesus,
[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:42.440]   and all the so-called faithful disciples,
[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.480]   they thought they would be strong enough
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:47.760]   to follow Jesus all the way to the end, but they did not.
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:49.500]   They were fragile.
[00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:52.220]   Their faith is shaken.
[00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:53.960]   And they left.
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.780]   From top to bottom, all the people around Jesus left.
[00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:02.380]   But from top to bottom, we find that Jesus is determined
[00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:03.740]   to go to the cross.
[00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:09.680]   Step by step, he prepared himself to go to the cross,
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:14.340]   to be crucified, shamefully, on the cross.
[00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:16.900]   Because he understands this is the will of the Father
[00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:21.900]   to save humankind, to save each and every one of us.
[00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:24.440]   Right at the center of the story,
[00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:29.360]   Jesus shared the last meal with his disciples,
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:32.040]   encouraging them and saying to them,
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:34.540]   "This is the covenant.
[00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:37.240]   "This is the promise I give to you.
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:41.540]   "As I die, as I shed my blood, and we drink this cup,
[00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:46.300]   "you know you belong to me, no matter what."
[00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:49.360]   And he foretold the disciples would betray him,
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:52.040]   but he also promised, "I will go to Galilee
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:54.840]   "after I resurrected from death.
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.800]   "So I will restore you guys."
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:57.640]   Right?
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:00.080]   What a promise, right?
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:02.940]   In the entire story, in the entire chapter,
[00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:04.780]   no one can boast.
[00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:08.520]   No one can boast his faith or her faith is strong enough
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:12.080]   to follow Jesus to the end.
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:13.520]   Nobody.
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.960]   Everyone around Jesus is powerless.
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:21.360]   Everyone is going after his own self-interest.
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:24.200]   Chapter 14.
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:28.880]   In chapter 15, also the camera is switching back and forth
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:33.880]   from people around Jesus and Jesus on the cross.
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:39.820]   First of all, B, all of B is about Jesus.
[00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:43.820]   He revealed himself to Pilate, the Roman governor.
[00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:47.620]   Now at this time, no longer the Jewish court,
[00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:49.740]   but the Roman court.
[00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:54.740]   And then the crowd wanting to crucify Jesus,
[00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:59.900]   they asked for the release of Barabbas.
[00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:04.580]   Barabbas was a criminal convicted in Jesus' day.
[00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:09.580]   And the crowd want to release this guy, a rebel,
[00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:12.280]   but they want to crucify Jesus.
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:17.400]   What injustice, you know, the greatest injustice
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:21.120]   is being done to an innocent man, Jesus himself.
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:24.700]   But Jesus was silent because he accepted
[00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:29.460]   as the will of the father to die on behalf of all of us.
[00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:31.240]   And then Jesus is proven to be innocent
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:34.520]   by the Roman governor, Pilate.
[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:38.380]   And mockingly, Pilate called Jesus king.
[00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:41.040]   "Are you the king of the Jews?"
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.620]   And Jesus said, "I am."
[00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:48.540]   Remember we did the Bible study of Gospel of Mark?
[00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:52.460]   Whenever someone says, "I am,"
[00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:56.660]   it's not just a simple statement, right?
[00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:59.300]   It's the declaration of his divinity.
[00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:01.500]   He is God, he's the son of God.
[00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:03.260]   So he said to Pilate, the Roman governor,
[00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:05.860]   "I am the king of the Jews."
[00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:11.060]   But mockingly, Pilate, we got him as king.
[00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:14.260]   And then the soldiers mock him as king.
[00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:19.260]   He put on a purple robe, purple robe on Jesus and mock him.
[00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:23.840]   And then at the center of the story, Jesus is crucified.
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:28.980]   And then as we go on in this chapter, chapter 15,
[00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:32.060]   all these people around Jesus mock him as king.
[00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:35.340]   And then finally Jesus dies.
[00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:39.820]   A Roman centurion, a commander,
[00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:42.460]   proclaims at the foot of the cross,
[00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:45.660]   "Truly, this is the son of God.
[00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:47.460]   "Truly, this is the king."
[00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:49.720]   And he was looking at Jesus on the cross,
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:53.140]   who shamefully died and sacrificed himself
[00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:55.660]   on behalf of sinful mankind.
[00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:59.180]   This is kingship, this is leadership.
[00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:02.180]   He died so that others can live.
[00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:05.300]   He sacrificed himself so that we can be released,
[00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:06.860]   we can have freedom.
[00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:09.420]   And truly, this is the son of God.
[00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:12.980]   This is the true king, the servant king.
[00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:18.380]   And then finally, the women watching from a distance.
[00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:23.240]   And then at the end of this chapter, Jesus is buried.
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:25.180]   Now, as you can see, very quick,
[00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:29.040]   from 14 to 15 chapter of the Gospel of Mark,
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:32.540]   Jesus becomes more passive and more passive.
[00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:35.660]   He's taking on the actions of others.
[00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:38.660]   People shame him, people mock him,
[00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:42.100]   and crucify him and kill him.
[00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:44.940]   Jesus is no longer the active agent.
[00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:49.860]   He's becoming more the object of the actions of other people.
[00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:53.900]   Some Bible scholar has counted how many verbs
[00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:55.660]   are there in these two chapters.
[00:20:55.660 --> 00:21:01.020]   And there are 50 some verbs,
[00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:04.100]   50 some actions done to Jesus.
[00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:07.900]   He's being passive, the victim,
[00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:14.120]   until he's crucified and died and buried in the tomb.
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:20.740]   Now, at the center of it all is Jesus on the cross.
[00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:23.180]   Truly, he is the son of God.
[00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:28.480]   That is the climax of the entire Gospel of Mark.
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:31.340]   And it's very ironic, right?
[00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:35.860]   Now, we just had our primary election week, right?
[00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:37.260]   Did you vote?
[00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:41.500]   All those of you who could vote, you should have voted.
[00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:46.660]   But we're looking for leaders, or political leaders,
[00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:49.940]   to bring us hope, right?
[00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:52.460]   To make some positive changes in our neighborhood,
[00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:55.660]   in our city, in our government.
[00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:58.200]   We're looking for strong men and women.
[00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:03.360]   We're looking for someone who is qualified to lead us, right?
[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:06.760]   Who has the power, military power, political power,
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:11.180]   or willpower to make changes, right?
[00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:12.520]   To make people follow him.
[00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:15.940]   Now, this is totally different.
[00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:18.560]   The leadership of Jesus is the other way around.
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:21.840]   It's the upside down leadership.
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:26.840]   He died, he sacrificed himself so that we can be born again.
[00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:30.960]   Here, I want to bring out two points.
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.060]   The first point is,
[00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:36.560]   Jesus sees through the logic of the cross.
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:42.000]   We kind of read through chapter 14 and 15
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.680]   of the Gospel of Mark.
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:46.040]   And you see, what Jesus was doing
[00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:48.600]   is that he lays down his life.
[00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:52.480]   He seems to be absolutely powerless.
[00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:54.960]   He has no power in his hand.
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:58.760]   He was nailed on the cross, he was totally passive.
[00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:02.560]   But he alone fulfills the will of God.
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:05.400]   He alone can save us from sin.
[00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:10.480]   A sinless one became sinful
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:16.440]   so that we, the sinners, can be forgiven.
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:20.680]   And that is why we call the Friday of the Holy Week,
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:22.400]   what do we call it?
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:24.060]   Good Friday.
[00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:25.280]   Why is it Good Friday?
[00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:30.280]   Jesus died on the cross on Friday, right?
[00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:32.360]   There's nothing good about him.
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:35.080]   But it was nonetheless called Good Friday
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:40.080]   because he has done the greatest great things for all of us.
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:43.160]   The salvation on the cross.
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:45.600]   That is the logic of the cross.
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:48.480]   And Jesus is condemned according to the will of the Father
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:50.020]   so that we are accepted.
[00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:55.920]   Jesus is punished so that our sins can be forgiven.
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:57.600]   We can be redeemed.
[00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:00.280]   He is cursed so that we can be blessed
[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:03.040]   and we can be restored to God himself.
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:05.820]   He suffers so that we have peace with God.
[00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:10.020]   He dies so that we can have eternal life.
[00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:13.540]   And that's the most amazing logic.
[00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:17.040]   Nobody would have understood it
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.920]   until Jesus died on the cross.
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:23.360]   And I think the life of Jesus being summarized
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:28.360]   in four gospels is to challenge us and to remind us
[00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:32.120]   if we say Jesus is our Lord and our Savior,
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:36.640]   then our lives should reflect the value of the cross.
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:37.920]   What is the value of the cross?
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:41.720]   The logic of the cross is that we lay down our own will
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:47.880]   and we say to God, God our Father, your will be done.
[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:53.880]   Every day you pray, you do devotion.
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:58.880]   The ultimate attitude we have is in front of God,
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:04.320]   we say, hey God, your will be done.
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:06.600]   Ultimately, it's not my will.
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:09.240]   Ultimately, it's not my interest.
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:12.480]   But your interest, your kingdom's interest
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:16.120]   is the utmost important to me, right?
[00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:18.760]   Your kingdom come and your will be done.
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:20.480]   That is the logic of the cross.
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:22.280]   That is the logic of Christian life.
[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:25.600]   We come here to worship God,
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:28.520]   not because out of self-interest,
[00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:33.520]   because we know that Jesus should be praised.
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:37.260]   God should be worshiped today.
[00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:39.300]   We lay down our own interests
[00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:43.400]   so that we can exalt the name of God, right?
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:46.340]   That is the life pattern of all Christians.
[00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:49.960]   All normal Christian life should be like this.
[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:53.520]   I asked you what's your best hour of the day, right?
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:55.680]   Probably it's the middle of the night, right?
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:57.640]   You do your own quiet time.
[00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:59.080]   Now, quiet time is very important
[00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:04.080]   because we kind of calibrate our own heart to the kingdom.
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:10.020]   We spend time with God so that God can speak to us
[00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:12.980]   when we read the word of God from the Bible.
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:18.500]   And we also pray to him and we speak to him our desire
[00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:21.660]   and ask him to change us, ask him to lead us.
[00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:24.340]   And that quiet time should be a calibration time
[00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:29.220]   so that we can calibrate our heart toward Jesus our Lord,
[00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:32.060]   so that our life can be constantly aligned
[00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:35.420]   with the discipleship pattern, right?
[00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:38.960]   The cross, which means thy kingdom come,
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:42.580]   thy will be done, not my will, but the will of the Father.
[00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:48.140]   Now, I wanna point you to the logic of the cross
[00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:53.140]   by quoting from chapter 10, verse 45 of the gospel of Mark.
[00:26:53.140 --> 00:27:01.020]   Here's one verse, and some of you already memorize it, right?
[00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:04.700]   "For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve,
[00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:10.580]   "but to give his life as a ransom for many."
[00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:14.300]   Some of you may have heard about this verse
[00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:15.800]   or even memorize it.
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:22.020]   Here, Jesus summarized the entire gospel
[00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:27.020]   or his entire life and our life as Christian
[00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:30.380]   in just one verse.
[00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:31.980]   Here he states two things.
[00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:34.500]   He makes two claims.
[00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:40.340]   He came for the purpose of serving, to serve other people.
[00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:43.660]   And he came to die.
[00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:46.220]   He came to die.
[00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:48.580]   Now, when we do Bible study,
[00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:51.260]   sometimes we pay attention to some little words
[00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:57.860]   that usually we just don't focus on
[00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:00.200]   because the word is so little.
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:01.760]   And I have a highlight for you.
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:05.020]   And the word is actually,
[00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:09.500]   you can translate the word as "and," A-N-D.
[00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:12.380]   It's a conjunction in Greek.
[00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:13.660]   It's a very simple word, right?
[00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:17.380]   And he does that, and they do that,
[00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:19.340]   and something happened, and something happened.
[00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:20.860]   The conjunction, right?
[00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:23.220]   You can translate it as A-N-D, "and."
[00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:26.460]   Simply, simple translation, literal translation.
[00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:27.620]   But you can also translate
[00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:29.340]   because of the context requires you
[00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:31.300]   to translate it differently.
[00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:34.540]   So here, all the English versions,
[00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:38.460]   English translations, render it as "even."
[00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:40.300]   You see that?
[00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:41.140]   Even.
[00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:44.860]   Now, I was trying to dig through all the Chinese translations.
[00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:47.820]   They all missed this, except one,
[00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:51.220]   the contemporary Chinese version.
[00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:54.060]   It says, "Even the Son of Man
[00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:57.020]   "came not to be served, but to serve."
[00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:58.020]   Now, what's the effect?
[00:28:58.020 --> 00:28:59.460]   What's the difference?
[00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:00.740]   There's a huge difference
[00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:04.020]   if you translate this little word differently.
[00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:07.860]   If you translate "and," you still get the sense.
[00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:11.740]   But if you translate "even," it becomes more important
[00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:15.820]   because it tells you, when you translate as "even,"
[00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:20.660]   even for this, for "even the Son of Man came to be served,"
[00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:23.300]   or came not to be served, but to serve.
[00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:26.580]   If you translate "even," the effect would be,
[00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:29.340]   it tells you,
[00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:35.740]   if anyone could reasonably be expected not to serve,
[00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:37.420]   but to be served by others.
[00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:39.500]   It is the Son of Man.
[00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:41.660]   It's Jesus himself.
[00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:47.940]   Jesus reasonably expect all the other people around him
[00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:52.220]   to serve him, right?
[00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:54.700]   He's not here to serve other people, right?
[00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:59.860]   Think of yourself as king and queen,
[00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:04.100]   princess or prince, right?
[00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:07.500]   Think of yourself on a high status.
[00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:12.100]   You expect other people to serve you, right?
[00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:16.220]   I have some friends in Hong Kong,
[00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:21.220]   they hire servants to do the housework, right?
[00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:25.460]   Do you have a servant in your household
[00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:27.680]   to manage the do-the-dishes?
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:29.660]   Maybe your husband is, right?
[00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:32.660]   Somebody do the work for you.
[00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:34.740]   You expect someone to serve you.
[00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:39.700]   Here Jesus said, "Even the Son of Man came not to be served."
[00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:42.820]   And the effect is, even he himself
[00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:47.500]   can reasonably, legitimately,
[00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:51.580]   require everyone around him to serve him.
[00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:56.020]   But even the Son of Man came not to be served,
[00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:59.220]   but to serve other people, right?
[00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:04.620]   Think of the 24 hours each day.
[00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:07.380]   You know, what is your attitude, right?
[00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:11.400]   Our normal, typical attitude as a human being
[00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:16.400]   is being occupied by our own self-interest, right?
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:22.320]   Our own self-desire usually, or most of the time,
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:25.420]   is the top priority, right?
[00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:28.180]   Even for us who come to church,
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:34.740]   our desire mostly are out of self-interest.
[00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:37.780]   I come because I want to get something out of it, right?
[00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:39.280]   Oh, you got good food, okay?
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:41.720]   So I come, right?
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:44.640]   Oh, your food is crappy.
[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:46.660]   I don't come, right?
[00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:49.680]   I'd rather spend my time somewhere else, right?
[00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:54.600]   I come to church because I expect to be served, right?
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:56.920]   I'm preoccupied by my own self-interest.
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:59.840]   People come and pray for me,
[00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:01.800]   or care about me, right?
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:05.060]   Or treat me well, right?
[00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:07.780]   That is our normal, typical expectation.
[00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:12.240]   But here, Jesus said, "Even the Son of Man,"
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:13.680]   even the King himself,
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:17.040]   "came not to be served,
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:21.600]   "but the other way around, to serve other people."
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:24.220]   So I want to remind you in this Holy Week,
[00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:29.220]   the life of Jesus, as all four Gospels emphasize
[00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:32.380]   how important these seven days,
[00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:35.280]   these seven last days for Jesus.
[00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:38.500]   He came to serve us,
[00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:41.720]   not to be served by us.
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:45.240]   And you would say Jesus is your Lord.
[00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:49.280]   And if you say, "I am a Christian, I follow Christ,"
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:52.500]   shouldn't our pattern,
[00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:55.960]   shouldn't our expectations be different?
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:59.400]   Our life pattern should be different.
[00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:03.900]   To reflect a little bit more what Jesus is,
[00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:07.600]   to serve other people, and not to be served.
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:12.960]   Think of one thing you can do for the church,
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:14.960]   for the church family,
[00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:19.920]   that you are not being served, but to serve other people.
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:25.100]   One thing they all suggest, to pray for the church, right?
[00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:28.400]   Spend some time and pray for the church.
[00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:30.740]   Pray for the church ministry.
[00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:33.140]   People devote their time and energy
[00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:35.640]   in order to make it work, right?
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:38.900]   In order to run the church, in order to grow the church.
[00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:39.740]   Pray for them.
[00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:43.020]   And secondly, I would suggest,
[00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:45.900]   maybe find something you can plug in, you know?
[00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:48.340]   You can try to help out, you know?
[00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:51.020]   Maybe just talk to new people, right?
[00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:54.480]   Come in with a smile, as simple as that.
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:58.500]   The pattern of discipleship.
[00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:02.980]   Not to be served, but to serve, right?
[00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:07.740]   Pray for those who are preparing the service next week.
[00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:12.300]   You know, Josh was leading worship today,
[00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:17.300]   and we spent a couple hours practicing, right?
[00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:20.180]   That's why he didn't sing our tune, right?
[00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:21.980]   He practiced.
[00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:25.420]   He came to serve, not to be served, right?
[00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:28.300]   So that we can enjoy worship together, right?
[00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:30.820]   There are many, many things I would suggest
[00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:35.340]   that you have to think just upside down, right?
[00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:38.220]   Not to be served, but to serve other people, right?
[00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:40.660]   To do good to other people, right?
[00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:42.300]   Or even after the service, you know,
[00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:46.300]   go to the people in the backstage,
[00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:49.940]   encourage them, appreciate them.
[00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:53.120]   'Cause they took their time, they took their energy,
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:56.180]   not out of self-interest, right?
[00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:59.020]   There's no benefit, right?
[00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:00.900]   But they serve, nonetheless.
[00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:05.260]   Do something so that we can build up the church together.
[00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:06.740]   Do something so that we can walk
[00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:09.460]   a little bit more like Christ himself, right?
[00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:11.500]   Let's do that, amen?
[00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:13.100]   Let's pray.
[00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:16.200]   Father, we come before you in this holy week,
[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:20.780]   on this Palm Sunday, to remember what you have done for us.
[00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:23.300]   And thank you for being our sermon king.
[00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:26.980]   Thank you for dying on the cross so that we can have life.
[00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:31.980]   Thank you for experiencing the shame of the cross
[00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:34.060]   so that we can be honored.
[00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:36.260]   And thank you for your redemption.
[00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:39.620]   Thank you for granting us this new life
[00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:43.560]   so that we can reflect the value of the kingdom.
[00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:47.200]   And Jesus, we come before you.
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:49.420]   We ask that you change our heart
[00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:56.120]   so that we are not to be served, but to serve others,
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:59.700]   just like Jesus did for all of us.
[00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:01.680]   Thank you for your love,
[00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:04.840]   and thank you for the new life we can experience,
[00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:07.520]   and help us to know how to follow you,
[00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:10.880]   to build up your body, to build up your kingdom,
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:14.100]   to extend your kingdom, to preach the gospel,
[00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:16.160]   to invite people into your kingdom.
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:19.160]   There are so many different things we can do
[00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:21.400]   in the pattern of Jesus.
[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:24.380]   And I pray that you will lead us,
[00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:27.500]   help our church to grow spiritually,
[00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:32.500]   to grow in the image of your son, more and more.
[00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:36.360]   In Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:38.180]   Well, God bless you,
[00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:40.440]   and make sure you come a little bit early
[00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:44.060]   so that we can enjoy the eighth anniversary,
[00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:47.520]   I don't know what you call it, what, refreshment?
[00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:48.520]   special refreshment.
[00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:49.280]   OK?
[00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:50.400]   All right.
