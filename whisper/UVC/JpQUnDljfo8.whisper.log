[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   [Music]
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Hello everyone, I'm Miss Rebecca.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   Welcome to Family Sunday School.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   This is the fourth episode.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   What did we talk about last time?
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   Remember?
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   We talked about Jesus being arrested.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   A very important distinction,
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   a very important difference is
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   being tied up and dragged away.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Or what?
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   Jesus allowed them to drag him away.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   Do you want to tie him up? No need.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   Do you want to lock him up? No need.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   Do you want to drag him away? No need.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   Jesus just followed them.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   I haven't mentioned this before.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   This is God's plan to save people.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   God said this plan must be fulfilled.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   So Jesus had to obey.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   Jesus knew what was going to happen.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   So he just went with it.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   Remember?
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Last episode, the last Chinese time,
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   I gave you a challenge.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   Remember the challenge?
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   Because last time we talked about a lot of different things.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Angles.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Right?
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Different perspectives, different angles.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   We looked at the story from different angles.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Judas, John, Peter, Jesus.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Right?
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Does anyone remember the Chinese challenge?
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   Let me remind you.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   We said that "角" can be used as "angle".
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   If triangle is "三角形",
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   then what is hexagon in Chinese?
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Does anyone know?
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Does anyone remember?
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Have you talked to your family?
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   I'll break it down. Ready?
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Triangle. "Tri" means "三",
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   "Angle" means "角",
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   "三角形" means "three-angle shape".
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   How many "角" are there in hexagon?
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   One, two, three, four, five, six.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Right?
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Six.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   "六角形"
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Right?
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Hexagon.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   "Hex" means "six", "hexagon".
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Wow.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Let's repeat the numbers.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   If I say "octagon",
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   you will know, right?
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Let's repeat the numbers.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Backwards.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Countdown.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   What is "octagon"?
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Let's talk about it in Chinese.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Hold the thought.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Okay.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   In this episode, we will continue the story.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Jesus followed them to be taken away.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Where did he go?
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   What did he do?
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Do you remember who was following them?
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Who was secretly following them?
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Yes.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   John and Peter.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   John and Peter.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   John and Peter.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Hmm.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Was it dangerous to follow them?
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Was it dangerous for John and Peter?
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Hmm.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Where did they take Jesus?
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   What happened to Jesus?
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   We, as modern Christians,
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   know a little bit about it.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Because we know what "Easter" means.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   But at that moment,
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   John and Peter didn't know, right?
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Hmm.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   So today, we will continue the story.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Before we talk about the story,
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   we must play a game, right?
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Mr. Becker loves playing games.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Okay.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Let's go.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   The game we are playing this time is called "Name That Animal".
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Guess what animal it is.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   How to guess?
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   It's not based on eyes.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   It's based on ears.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   You have to listen to these sounds
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   to guess what animal it is.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Here it comes.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   The first animal.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Or you can close your eyes.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Then you can hear these sounds clearly.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   And you can guess what animal it is.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   The first animal.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Who is it?
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Guess.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   Frog.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Here comes the next one.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   The hint is,
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   "I am large and loud."
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Hmm.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   What is large and loud?
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Let's listen.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   [Name That Animal]
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   It's loud.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   Can anyone guess what it is?
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   Elephant.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   Elephant.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Can you hear the different sounds?
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   Of course the message is different.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   What it wants to say.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   What it wants to express is different.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   Elephant.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Here comes the next one.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   The hint is,
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   "I am alarming."
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   Alarming is like an alarm clock.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   It wakes us up.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   It's loud.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   Alarming.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Hmm.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   Who has this animal?
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   Wake it up.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   Who has heard this sound?
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   Wake it up.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   [Name That Animal]
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   Anyone knows?
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   Guess.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   [Name That Rooster]
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   Anyone has this sound?
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   Here comes the next one.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   The hint is,
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   "I wake up when you go to sleep."
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   [Name That Animal]
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   Hmm.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   Anyone has this animal?
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   [Name That Bird]
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Do you want to hear it again?
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   [Name That Bat]
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   Hmm.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   Guess.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   Bat.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   [Name That Squeak]
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   [Name That Bell]
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   Here comes the next one.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   The hint is,
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   "I am cleaner than you may think."
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   [Name That Bird]
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   Let's hear this sound.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   Or,
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   "Has anyone been to the farm?"
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   You may have heard this sound.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   [Name That Animal]
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   Do you know what animal it is?
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   We usually think it is dirty,
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   but it is actually a very clean animal.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   Let's guess.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   Pig.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   [Name That Pig]
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   In the story,
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   we may say, "Oink, oink."
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   But actually, it sounds like this.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   [Name That Pig]
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   Okay.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   The last animal.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   The hint is,
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   "I like to talk at night."
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   [Name That Animal]
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   Let's listen.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   [Name That Animal]
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   Okay.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   Let's listen quietly.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   [Name That Bird]
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   What is it?
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   Have you heard of it?
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   Is it familiar?
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   It is a cricket.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   [Name That Cricket]
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   You heard the sound.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   It is not just one cricket,
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   but many crickets.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   Let's talk.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   I want you to think about
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   which animal will appear
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   in the next story.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   Please pay attention.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   Okay.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   Let's continue the story.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   Peter and John follow Jesus.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   What will happen?
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   They will take Jesus away.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   They will find a way to take Jesus away.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   They will find a way to take Jesus away.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   John and Peter must follow Jesus.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   Let's see what will happen.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   Where will they follow Jesus?
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   They will go to a big temple.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   In the past, religious leaders
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   would gather in a big place.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   There are buildings,
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   and a small garden.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   A woman sees him in the garden.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   "Oh, you look so familiar.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   You look like your friends in Jesus' story."
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   What will Peter say?
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   "We have said that
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   Peter will not deny Jesus,
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   no matter what."
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   "He said so."
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   What will Peter say?
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   "Yes, what Jesus said will happen,
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   will happen."
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   Peter said, "No, no, no, not me.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   I don't know him.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   Not me, not me.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   I don't know him."
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   They went to another place.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   It was cold outside.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   It was dark.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   They went to a fire to keep warm.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   There was no heater in the past.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   They cooked with fire.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   They kept warm with fire.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   They walked around.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   Another woman came to Peter.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   She asked him,
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   "Aren't you the one
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   who followed Jesus?"
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   "Do you know Jesus?"
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   "Hmm,
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   what do you think Peter will say?"
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   "He denied Jesus last time.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   Will he do it again?"
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   "Yes," she said.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   "Not me, not me, not me."
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   They walked away.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   They saw many people were drunk.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   They felt safe.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   They went to the main hall.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   They hid and covered themselves.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   No one would notice.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   They just stood there.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   Who would know?
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   It was a big deal.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   Among the men,
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   one said,
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   "Hey,
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   aren't you the one
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   who cut off the ear?"
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   "Yes, it's you.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   You cut off the ear
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   of the man
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   who cut off the ear.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   You are with Jesus.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   It's you.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   Don't deny it.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   You are with Jesus.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   Hey,
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   do you know
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   what Peter will say?"
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   "Who is it?
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   It's not me.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   It's not me."
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   "Ah!"
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   "Uh-oh!
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   What happened?"
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   "The cock crowed."
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   "Oh!"
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   "It was that moment.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   The moment of the cock crowing."
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   "Cuckoo!"
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   Peter stood up.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   "Oh, Jesus said
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   the cock crowed before.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   You will deny me.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   Huh!"
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   Three times.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   Did he deny Jesus three times?
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   One, the woman.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   Two, the other woman.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   Three, the man who cut off the ear.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   Huh!
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   It was that moment again.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   Cuckoo!
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   Jesus was inside.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   He was inside the house.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   He looked out of the window.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   He was outside the house.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   Peter heard the cock crow.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   He looked at the window.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   They were good friends.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   They remembered the conversation.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   They looked at each other.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   Jesus was sad.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   What did Peter feel?
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   He was sad and guilty.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   Huh!
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   What Jesus said would happen,
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   we thought it would never happen.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   We thought we were not like that.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   We would not do that.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   But Jesus said it would happen.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   It would happen, right?
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   Huh!
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   I wonder how Peter feels now.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   I want you to pause and discuss.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   Why did Peter deny Jesus?
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   He loved Jesus and followed Jesus.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   Why did people ask him
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   if he followed Jesus?
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   Did he cut off his ear?
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   Did he cut off his head?
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   Did he cut off his head?
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   No, no, no.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   He obviously lied.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   Why did he do that?
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   Huh!
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   I know, you know, Peter knows.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   It's not good to lie.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   It's not true, right?
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   Telling lies isn't good.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   It's not honest.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   But why did he do that?
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   Pause for a moment.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   Think about it.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   Discuss.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   We will come back.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   Okay?
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   Let's suppose something.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   We might think,
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   Wow! Peter?
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   He's so bad.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   He obviously loved Jesus.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   Why did he deny Jesus?
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   I will bring you into a story.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   See how you will feel later.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   Or you will change your mind.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   Let's see.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   What if?
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   If?
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   If?
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   You see some kids
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   break a window while playing football.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   Oh no!
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   The auntie at home
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   comes out and scolds them.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   Who broke my window?
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   She sees your friend nearby.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   Wow!
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   She accuses your friend.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   She brings him back.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   Scolds him.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   And she asks his mom and dad
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   to clarify what happened.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   Oh! Big trouble!
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   Right?
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   But your friend
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   has a big question mark.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   Huh?
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   What happened?
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   Your friend doesn't know what happened.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   But do you know what your friend is doing?
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   He is playing football with you.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   But the ball you play with
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   and the ball that broke the window
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   are different.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   Actually, they are not.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   But why is the auntie
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   your friend?
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   Hmm...
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   How do you feel?
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   Wow!
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   She sees my friend.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   Huh!
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   She scolds him.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   I am so nervous.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   Do you think you will say something?
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   If the auntie asks you
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   "Hey!
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   You play football with him, right?"
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   "Of course!"
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   "You broke the window."
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   "Do you know him?"
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   "Do you know that kid?"
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   "Do you play football with him?"
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   "What should I do?"
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   "Do you know what to do?"
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   Or maybe you are like Peter
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   who doesn't want to say anything
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   but you don't know him.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   Actually,
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   Peter didn't expect
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   to deny Jesus.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   We talked about this in the last supper.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   He said he would never do that
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   because he thought
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   there was no reason
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   or situation
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   to deny Jesus.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   But think about it.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   Jesus was just arrested.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   A lot of things happened, right?
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   Peter was so nervous
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   and scared.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   It's like this story.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   The adults asked him
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   "Hey!
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   Do you know that kid?"
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   "He broke the window."
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   "Are you with him?"
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   "Oh!"
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   Or maybe you would say
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   "No, no, I am not with him.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   I don't know him. Bye bye."
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   Right?
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   It's possible, right?
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   So it could have been you too.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   Actually, we could have also been Peter.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   From this perspective,
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   it's also a perspective, right?
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   Actually, when we put ourselves
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   into the Bible story,
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   we will understand more
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   that these characters
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   are not just characters.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   They are real people.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   Real life, real people.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   We can understand
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   and empathize.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   We can imagine
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   and feel their feelings.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   When we feel empathy,
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   we will understand more.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   "Yes, Peter loves Jesus so much.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   Of course, he won't deny it.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   But compared to me,
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   I am also scared.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   Why am I being pulled into this?
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   Or maybe I won't say it.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   But I feel guilty inside.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   Guilty, right?
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   So we can put ourselves
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   into the situation
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   and feel more of the other person's feelings.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   Sometimes, when we lie,
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   we are protecting ourselves, right?
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   Who has done it?
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   I can be very honest.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   Who has done something
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   that we are afraid of getting into trouble
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   and being recognized?
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   What will happen if we are recognized?
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   What will happen if we are not recognized?
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   When I was young,
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   I used to eat chocolate cake secretly.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   My mom told me not to eat it.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   After the party,
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   the guests ate it all.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   I ate the leftovers.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   But that box of cake
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   was really delicious.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   But I told my mom,
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   I promised not to eat it.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   I won't eat this cake.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   I won't eat a single piece, mom.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   Mom went out.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   I and this box of cake
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   are very close, right?
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   I opened the box of cake.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   I took a piece of cake from the back.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   I closed the box.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   I closed the box.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   No one would know, right?
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   But it's not just once.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   Wait a minute.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   It's me and this box of cake.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   The first piece was delicious.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   I ate the second piece.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   The third piece.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   Mom came back.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   She was going to take the cake out
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   and put it on a plate
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   for the guests to eat.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   She opened the box of cake.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   She put the cookies in the box.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   She took more.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   I was the third person.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   She took out the first piece of cake
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   and put it on the plate.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   She put the second piece of cake on the plate.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   The third piece of cake.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   This is the one I stole.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   She stole the third piece of cake.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   Uh-oh.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   She saw it.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   It was obviously a new one.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   Why didn't she see a few pieces of cake?
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   What did she do?
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   She walked around.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   She was busy.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   She read books.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   She drew.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   She sat down and slept.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   She did a lot of things.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   Mom asked,
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   "Do you know where the cookies are?"
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   "I don't know."
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   "Why did you do that?"
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   "You knew. Why didn't you tell me?"
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   She asked again.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   "But you were the only one at home with the cookies."
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   "Grandma was in the back garden."
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   "Grandma didn't like to eat. Where did the cookies go?"
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   "Uh-oh."
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   "Oh, no. What now?"
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   "I don't know."
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   She kept running away.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   She looked for a place.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   She pretended not to know.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   She pretended not to see.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   She asked again.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   "Tell me honestly."
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   "Did you eat the cookies?"
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   "Oh, no."
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   "I was found out."
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   "I didn't steal them. I just ate them."
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   She said,
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   "You know there are a lot of cookies on your clothes, right?"
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   "I don't know about my face, but I feel very guilty."
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   "I feel so guilty."
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   Mom asked,
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   "You mean you opened the cookies without thinking,"
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   "put your hand in it without thinking,"
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   "and took the cookies out without thinking,"
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   "put the cookies in your mouth without thinking,"
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   "and chewed them without thinking,"
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   "and swallowed them without thinking?"
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   "Right?"
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   "Uh... yes."
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   "Isn't this story funny?"
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   "It's true."
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   "I'm the one who's telling the truth."
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   "I ate the cookies without thinking."
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   "But..."
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   "You asked me, 'Hey, Miss Rebecca, will you tell a lie?'"
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   "I said, 'No, no, no, no, no, no.'"
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   "I'm a very honest person. I'm very honest."
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   "But..."
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   "Sigh..."
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   "When I feel in trouble,"
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   "when I feel dangerous,"
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   "I might do it."
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   "Right?"
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   "Everyone does it, right?"
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   "Have you tried it?"
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   "You can be honest."
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   "You can pause and talk."
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   "You can be honest."
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   "Why?"
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   "Because God forgave us."
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   "We forgive others."
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   "Right?"
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   "God knows our hearts."
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   "God knows that when I was a kid,"
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   "I couldn't resist this delicious chocolate cake."
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   "It was so delicious."
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   "I didn't have junk food at home."
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   "A customer said, 'Wow, your chocolate chip cookie!'"
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   "I couldn't resist it. I ate it."
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   "He understood."
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   "I regretted it later."
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   "I told my mom, 'Sorry.'"
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   "Not only did I eat the cake, right?"
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   "I'm sorry."
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   "Not only did I eat it, I also lied."
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   "But after I told her, I felt much better."
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   "Do you think..."
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   "Jesus knows."
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   "I think my mom knows, too."
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   "I'm wearing a cake dress."
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   "She knows I did it."
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   "But she gave me a chance."
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   "Do you think Jesus can give you a chance?"
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   "Let's talk next time."
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   Chinese time.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   What is our special animal today?
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   There are many animals in our show.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   Is it a pig?
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   A elephant?
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   No?
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   Hmm...
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   A bat.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   What is our special animal today?
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   A bat?
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   No, of course not.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   It's a rooster.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   Now,
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   "公雞" is "rooster" in English.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   "母雞" is "hen" in Chinese.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   Okay, Chinese time.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   We remember that English has different names,
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   male and female.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   Right?
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   But in Chinese,
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   we often add "公"
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   or "母"
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   or "那".
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   That's it.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   Like "牛", "cow".
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   "母牛"
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   "母牛"
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   Oh!
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   Interesting.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   "母" means "mother".
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   So, if you add "母" to "母"
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   it becomes a female animal.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   Wow!
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   Then you don't have to remember so many things.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   Right?
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   I know that
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   people often ask
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   "Is your dog male or female?"
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   "公" means "male".
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   Right.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   "那" means "female".
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   Oh!
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   Also,
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   in the beginning of the Chinese time,
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   there was a challenge.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   In the beginning of the intro,
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   I said that there was a challenge in Chinese time.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   "Octagon"
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   What is it in Chinese?
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   What is a triangle?
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   Right.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   What is a hexagon?
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   What is an octagon?
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   Octopus
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   "八爪魚"
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   What is an octagon?
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   Right. Octagon.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   You got it!
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   OK. Let's go back to practice.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   See what other animals can add "公"
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   and "母".
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   See you next time!
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   Bye!
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   Hello everyone!
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   I have taken out my Bible.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   Here.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   There is a Bible.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   We are very familiar with the Bible
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   of our children.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   This is the Bible.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   Right?
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   This one.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   This one.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   It is in cartoon style.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   It is for children.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   A common theme in this Bible is that
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   the picture is usually very big.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   The words are smaller.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   The story is more like one, two, three pages.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   Usually,
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   like this one
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   and this one,
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   each story is separate.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   Especially,
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   like you said,
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   when Daniel and the lions
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   jump to the next story.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   There are not many stories connected.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   It is like a big story.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   But actually,
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   the Bible is a big story.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   The Old Testament and the New Testament are together.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   This Bible story,
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   Jesus Storybook Bible,
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   is connected to a theme.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   Each story of the Old Testament
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   and the New Testament
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   points to Jesus Christ.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   So,
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   this is the major difference.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   But the style is similar.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   I want to talk to you about
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   the Bible of children.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   There are many kinds.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   But what do we want to pay attention to?
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   We want to pay attention to the illustration.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   The text, the words,
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   the vocabulary.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   How difficult is the word "born"?
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   Do children read it by themselves?
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   Or do adults read it?
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   We can also look at the storytelling.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   How deep is it?
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   Are there details?
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   We know that there are.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   This kind of Bible,
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   and our adult Bible,
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   adults' Bible has more details.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   But there are also
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   other Bible for children
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   that have more details.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   For example,
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   this series.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   Each story is drawn out of a book.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   The Last Stepper.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   The Last Stepper.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   Alone.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   There are more than 20 pages.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   So the story is more substantial.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   They will think that
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   the story is really long.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   So,
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   if you add them up,
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   it becomes a series.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   Then,
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   why
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   if there are so many exposures,
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   children will know that there are many different perspectives.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   Right?
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   They will appreciate it more.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   You can also see that
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   this illustration is different from other illustrations.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   The second kind is this one.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   It's about facts.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   This is graphic, infographic.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   This is also like an encyclopedia.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   Right?
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   You can see that the illustrations
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   are more realistic.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   Right?
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   It really looks like a real person's handwriting.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   Right?
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   The Bible says that
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   there is a river,
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   and there is a hill,
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   and there is a hill,
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   so there are many things happening.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   You will know that it really happened.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   Wow!
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   So many things,
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   plus the children,
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   make the Bible stories more profound.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   They know that
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   just like adults,
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   if you continue to study the Bible,
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   more exciting things will happen.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   So we give them more exposure to
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   not just the stories,
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   but also the perspectives
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   of the stories, the telling,
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   and the art.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   They will know that there are so many
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   ways to express
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   our knowledge of Jesus,
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   our knowledge of God.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   It can be abstract,
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   abstract,
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   or realistic.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   It can be like a real person's handwriting.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   There is also a type of Bible
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   that looks like a comic book.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   We see a lot of words in adult Bibles.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   We imagine what we see.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   We imagine what we see.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   We have seen
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   painters who draw Jesus,
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   or paint with oil paint.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   painters who draw Jesus,
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   or paint with oil paint.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   But there is more than just this representation.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   But there is more than just this representation.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   You can use comic books
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   to represent Jesus.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   The difference is that
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   you need to know that
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   some things are taken for granted.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   You may not know if Jesus really said
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   these words.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   But the reference is in the Holy Bible.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   But the reference is in the Holy Bible.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   There is also this type of Bible.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   This is actually quite old.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   This is also a comic book.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   Look at this.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   The picture is more realistic.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   You can see every expression.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   As the story goes along,
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   the expression will be different.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   Why is this important?
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   Because in so many Bibles,
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   the children's understanding of the Bible
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   is deeper because
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   there are different perspectives.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   There is a geographic perspective.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   There is a geographic perspective.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   It's like this book.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   There is an emotional perspective.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   You can see the emotional and
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   psychological aspects of the Bible.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   You can see the emotional aspects of the Bible.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   You can feel the emotional aspects of the Bible.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   Or you may like data.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   Or you may like data.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   Factual perspective.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   Historical perspective.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   There are also many different
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   perspectives and
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   different perspectives.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   The more you think and
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   know, the deeper the understanding.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   There is a connection.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   I have talked about many different
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   Bibles. Children's Bible.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   I want you to
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   refer to
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   the version I talked about
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   and
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   the version in your
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   children's Bible.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   What is included?
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   Look for the part
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   of Rooster.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   Look for the part of
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   Peter denying Jesus.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   Look at
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   which Bible has some things
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   which Bible has some things
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   and look at the illustrations.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   and look at the illustrations.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   So,
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   we talked about perspective in the last episode.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   This time,
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   there is more exposure.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   Actually,
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   children know this story
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   more deeply.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   The more connection,
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   the better.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   The more connection,
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   the deeper the understanding.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   The more connection,
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   the better.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   Story.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   Look at different stories,
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   different Bibles, different illustrations.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   Connecting.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   Connecting your
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   personal story.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   Right?
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   Have you ever lied?
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   Have you ever denied someone?
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   Yes, you have.
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   The connection
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   between Peter and you
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   is deeper.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   OK.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   Challenge yourself to do this.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   Also, if your children
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   like animals,
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   also like animals,
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   you can play the game.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   Go to the Internet
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   and look for sound effects
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   or animal sounds.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   Play with your children.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   Guess which animal it is.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   Alright.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   See you next time.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   [music]
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   [music]
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   [music]
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   [music]
