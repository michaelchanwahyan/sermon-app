1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Hey guys, thank you very much for being here

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,740
 and we'll continue our series on Apostles' Creed.

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,400
 And my quiz for you is what is the Apostles' Creed?

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,140
 What is it?

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:18,000
 It's an ancient document,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,020
 has been around for almost 1800 years,

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,520
 and it's a summary of our faith.

8
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,100
 It's a map of the Christian faith.

9
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,660
 And if people ask you, what do you believe in,

10
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,700
 or sometimes you may be questioning,

11
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,700
 what do I really believe in, and what should I believe in,

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,980
 you go to a summary or a quick document

13
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,300
 like the Apostles' Creed,

14
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:44,180
 and then you'll find out the basics, the core,

15
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,940
 the must do, the must believe,

16
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:53,780
 the core beliefs of our faith.

17
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:58,100
 Yesterday, I was blessed to attend a wedding

18
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,300
 in the West Suburb.

19
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,860
 I've never been to that neighborhood,

20
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:05,920
 never been to that part of the Western Suburb,

21
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,380
 so I turned to Google Maps.

22
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,380
 So I put in the destination, I put in the place,

23
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:15,660
 and I wanna find out where that is.

24
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:19,260
 And of course, in our days and age,

25
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,500
 and it is very convenient.

26
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,220
 You just key in the address

27
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,860
 and then you'll find out how to get there.

28
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,620
 So it shows me about an hour driving,

29
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,980
 passing through different neighborhoods,

30
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,780
 those are the details, right?

31
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,060
 I don't really care.

32
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,940
 And Google Maps doesn't show me that.

33
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:40,200
 It really show me is how to take a turn

34
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,600
 and what road to take in order to get me there, right?

35
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,220
 That is the summary, that is the quick,

36
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,580
 you know, core knowledge that I need

37
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,500
 to get to my destination, right?

38
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,060
 So I didn't get lost, I came back one piece, right?

39
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,580
 So that is the good thing about summary

40
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:02,700
 and Apostles Creek is doing something like this.

41
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,580
 Now, as the pandemic fades away, hopefully,

42
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:10,740
 I know we're all getting tired of it,

43
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:14,580
 but it is kind of being sort of under control, right?

44
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:19,740
 Those who are infected with COVID suffer,

45
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,180
 it depends on depending on your condition,

46
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,500
 suffer quite a bit.

47
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,420
 Or some people suffer slightly.

48
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:29,940
 But as the pandemic fades away,

49
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,800
 some of the people in this church are asking me,

50
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,280
 when are you going to Israel, right?

51
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,660
 When you're leading a group to Israel.

52
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,740
 And then I talk to some people, I talk to some of you,

53
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:46,300
 and say, yeah, I think it's doable, right?

54
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,900
 If you get enough people, we can go next week, you know?

55
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,740
 The border is open and it's very convenient.

56
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:56,540
 If you have a US passport, it's really convenient.

57
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,540
 I still remember talking to people

58
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,220
 about leading a group to Israel.

59
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,340
 I've been to Israel for more than 10 years,

60
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,760
 almost 20 times.

61
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:13,220
 I still remember in the early days, 2008, 2009,

62
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:19,460
 when we go to Israel, it was not that convenient.

63
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:22,300
 I still had that atlas.

64
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,220
 Do you know what atlas is?

65
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,660
 Atlas of maps, right?

66
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,060
 No?

67
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,700
 Is that yeah?

68
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,700
 Atlas, you know, to print maps.

69
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,140
 It's like a book, okay?

70
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,060
 It's like a book.

71
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,380
 So it's different kinds of maps.

72
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,560
 And then, of course, you have the big map, right?

73
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,180
 So when you travel, when you're driving,

74
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:47,980
 especially in places that you are not familiar,

75
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,180
 you need those maps, right?

76
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,540
 And then you have to plan ahead of time

77
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,580
 in order to know where to turn and what road to take

78
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,580
 and how to get to your destination.

79
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:00,860
 But now, of course, it's a totally different ballgame, right?

80
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,200
 You go to the airport, you rent a SIM card,

81
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,380
 and then you plug into your smartphone

82
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,780
 and everything is there, right?

83
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,380
 You key in your address and you will get there.

84
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:13,180
 So it helps you with your navigation.

85
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:17,740
 Apostle's Creek is also a tool of navigation.

86
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:20,700
 Sometimes you may wonder,

87
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,620
 I know many of you, or maybe most of you,

88
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,940
 have not really read the whole Bible,

89
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,820
 cover to cover, right?

90
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,720
 Now, when people ask you, what do you believe in,

91
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,140
 sometimes you may wonder, you have a question mark,

92
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,220
 hey, what do I really believe in?

93
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,500
 What is the heart of the gospel?

94
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,100
 What is the heart of the Bible,

95
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,340
 of the heart of Christianity?

96
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,820
 And it is the Apostle's Creek.

97
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:46,900
 So last week, we were working through Psalm 19,

98
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,340
 the first part of Psalm 19.

99
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,740
 Now we come to the second part of Psalm 19.

100
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,140
 I told you the flow of Psalm 19 is very easy

101
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,460
 and it's very meaningful.

102
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:59,200
 The first part is the words of creation.

103
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:04,200
 The creation is singing and expressing their praises

104
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,620
 and worship to the creator.

105
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:09,620
 That is what we call general revelation.

106
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,020
 Everyone who walk in this world,

107
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:17,940
 every single square inch of this universe

108
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:22,900
 is the property of God, has a signature in it, right?

109
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:27,900
 Whether you look at the world in details,

110
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,500
 the micro perspective, or you look at the whole

111
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,900
 entire universe, the galaxies and all that stuff,

112
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,660
 the macro perspective.

113
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:42,660
 Every square inch of this creation marks the property

114
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:46,700
 of the creator, God himself.

115
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,820
 So the first six verses talking about general revelation,

116
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,860
 the universal revelation, everyone should know that.

117
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:56,700
 Everyone should be able to listen to the music

118
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,820
 of the creation, singing about the creator

119
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,220
 behind all of this, the intelligent designer

120
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,060
 of the entire universe.

121
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:09,300
 And then the second part is words from the creator.

122
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,780
 And that is what we call the special revelation.

123
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,940
 God is not just a distant creator.

124
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:20,280
 He created the world, boom, and it's there,

125
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:25,280
 and have his own mechanism and laws and principles,

126
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,020
 and then the universe run on itself.

127
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:32,900
 No, the Bible presents to us the God who is super involved

128
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:37,500
 in every single thing since the first creation

129
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,020
 until now, his hand is there,

130
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,380
 even though it's invisible to our own eyes,

131
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:47,500
 but God is always involved in the creation.

132
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,760
 So we come to verses seven to 10, seven to 10.

133
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,680
 Okay, let's read that.

134
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,340
 The law of the Lord is perfect, reviving the soul.

135
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,820
 The statue of the Lord are trustworthy,

136
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,980
 making wise the simple.

137
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,040
 The precepts of the Lord are right,

138
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,220
 giving joy to the heart.

139
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,400
 The commands of the Lord are radiant,

140
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,380
 giving light to the eyes.

141
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:19,140
 The fear of the Lord is pure, enduring forever.

142
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,580
 The ordinances of the Lord are sure

143
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,540
 and altogether righteous.

144
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,260
 They are more precious than gold,

145
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:28,940
 much, than much pure gold.

146
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:32,100
 They are sweeter than honey, than honey from the comb.

147
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:36,480
 Now you can find three pairs of terms

148
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,700
 that describe the word of God.

149
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,300
 Can you find them?

150
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,940
 Three pairs, so a total of six terms.

151
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:46,580
 Six different technical terms from the Old Testament

152
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,660
 describing the word of God.

153
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,980
 Can you find them?

154
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:53,260
 The first one being the law, right?

155
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,100
 Law.

156
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:58,980
 Now behind this English translation, law, L-A-W,

157
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:03,980
 is the Hebrew word Torah, Torah.

158
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:09,080
 Torah means more than, so much than the law, right?

159
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,480
 When we think of law today,

160
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,420
 well 55 miles per hour speed limit, right?

161
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:17,760
 Don't park there and all that stuff, right?

162
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,940
 You park there, your car get towed.

163
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:25,500
 Those are the connotation that we have today

164
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,260
 when we hear the word law.

165
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:32,180
 However, Torah means so much more than that.

166
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:37,020
 Torah means instructions, direction.

167
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,660
 You know, like your Google map,

168
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:43,900
 like a compass, compass on the map.

169
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,180
 You know, showing you the instructions

170
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,860
 to teach us to go the right way.

171
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,620
 The second term is testimony, right?

172
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,300
 Or a statue, right?

173
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,660
 Testimony, some of the English translation will do that.

174
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,180
 Statue or testimony.

175
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:05,580
 And the meaning of the word is reminder.

176
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,020
 Are you forgetful?

177
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,260
 You are, right?

178
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,960
 I am very forgetful.

179
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,420
 I'm very, very forgetful.

180
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:19,140
 You know, my family members can testify to that, right?

181
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:22,740
 I'm very forgetful because I'm so focused, you know?

182
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,180
 I'm so focused.

183
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,760
 I'm so focused on a few things, right?

184
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:31,260
 And then sometimes I need to forget other things, right?

185
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:34,400
 But testimony or statue is reminder.

186
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,060
 Some sort of reminder in our daily life

187
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:40,260
 to bring us back to the relationship with God, right?

188
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:45,100
 Number three is precepts, precepts.

189
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:49,580
 Now, all these six terms are pretty synonymous.

190
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,460
 They could point to the same thing,

191
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,460
 but their connotation, their meaning

192
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:57,020
 is a little bit, you know, distinguishable.

193
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:01,420
 You can just, by meditating upon different words,

194
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,260
 and you see how the word of God

195
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,500
 can be at work in your lives.

196
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,500
 So number three is precepts.

197
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,940
 Precept has the meaning of leading and overseeing.

198
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,140
 Overseeing.

199
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,060
 Are you a supervisor in your workplace?

200
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:19,140
 Or you work under a supervisor, right?

201
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,060
 Usually they suck, but.

202
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:24,060
 Usually, right?

203
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:24,880
 Usually they suck.

204
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,140
 But, you know, the word of God is the precept.

205
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:33,540
 It's to give us the leadership or give us the guidance,

206
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:36,460
 especially we get lost or confused.

207
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,500
 You go back to the word of God,

208
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,300
 he will give you the precepts.

209
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,220
 Number four is commands, right?

210
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,980
 Or commandments.

211
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:48,340
 Command is authoritative and clear.

212
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:51,940
 And this, especially so, I remind you many times,

213
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,140
 the Bible is not written to us.

214
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:57,260
 It's written to the ancient people in the Near East.

215
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:03,020
 What they used to believe in are those false gods, right?

216
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:06,660
 Babylonian gods and Assyrian gods, Egyptian gods,

217
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,220
 many gods, but none of them,

218
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:12,460
 none of them is clear about what they want.

219
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,360
 Sometimes they are like us, right?

220
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,100
 Because in the ancient Near East,

221
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:21,100
 in the pagan environment where ancient Israel was located,

222
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:24,940
 in their environment,

223
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:29,780
 the pagan gods are just like people.

224
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:32,580
 Because the gods, the false gods,

225
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,980
 are made in the image of men.

226
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,940
 All right?

227
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,140
 So you remember Genesis one.

228
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,460
 We are made in the image of God, right?

229
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,140
 But in the pagan environment,

230
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:49,520
 the gods are imagined by people, right?

231
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,440
 That's why they are like people.

232
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,720
 So they are unpredictable.

233
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:58,720
 So commandment has the meaning of God being clear

234
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,500
 about his moral view.

235
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:06,500
 His moral view is to help you live in holiness,

236
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,680
 righteousness, justice.

237
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,220
 Everything is spelled out in the Bible, right?

238
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,220
 Everything is spelled out in this word.

239
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,300
 God doesn't play hide and seek with us.

240
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,460
 So sometimes when we say,

241
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,500
 oh, what is the will of God in my life?

242
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,660
 Sometimes we got the question wrong.

243
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:26,380
 Of course, the will of God is clear.

244
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:31,380
 He wants you and me to live in his image,

245
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:34,620
 to live holy, right?

246
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,700
 To be righteous, right?

247
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:40,860
 Your relationship has to be holy.

248
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:47,120
 Your work ethics has to be holy.

249
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,260
 Somehow you can display the wisdom of God, right?

250
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,860
 The image of God.

251
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,420
 So commandment is number four.

252
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,460
 Number five is fear, right?

253
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,300
 The fear of the Lord.

254
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,660
 Now, if you're familiar with the wisdom literature

255
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,180
 in the Bible, which is right in the center,

256
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:06,220
 some Psalms and the book of Proverbs,

257
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,860
 Ecclesiastes, the book of Job,

258
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:11,600
 all of this are called wisdom literature.

259
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,780
 They often have a phrase, the fear of the Lord,

260
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,220
 the fear of the Lord.

261
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,060
 It means you have the right relationship

262
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,940
 with this holy God, right?

263
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,640
 Right relationship with him.

264
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,300
 Then you are living according to his will.

265
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,940
 The fear of the Lord, meaning wisdom.

266
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:33,420
 You will live in your practical situation having insights.

267
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,120
 And where that insight comes from?

268
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,740
 It's come from the Bible, the will of God.

269
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:42,740
 Number six is judgment.

270
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:47,060
 Now that has to do with God's judicial discernment.

271
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:50,780
 If you read the first five book of Moses,

272
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:55,480
 sometimes the five books of the law, right?

273
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,760
 You find some case laws.

274
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,600
 If this happen, then what is the judgment?

275
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,680
 If this happens, what should be the decision?

276
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,480
 And all those stuff.

277
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,480
 Judgment has a sense of God's wise discernment

278
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,040
 of different situations.

279
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,620
 So God's general will is always clear.

280
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,480
 To have the people of Israel in the Old Testament

281
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,680
 and the New Testament church like us

282
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,840
 to be walking in his way.

283
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:28,420
 And then this Psalm talks about the benefits,

284
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:32,200
 the effects of the will of God.

285
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,200
 Reviving the soul, making wise the symbol,

286
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:41,200
 giving you joy, giving you fulfillment,

287
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:46,240
 enduring forever, altogether righteous.

288
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:51,240
 So the Psalm is encouraging you to go into the will of God,

289
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:56,660
 to go into scripture, to find that treasure.

290
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:59,060
 It takes some work.

291
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,520
 It doesn't come to you automatically.

292
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,620
 You need to be trained, you need to learn, right?

293
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,560
 This is what every disciple needs to learn, right?

294
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,400
 From the first day you believe in Christ,

295
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,720
 from the first day you acknowledge,

296
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,000
 I come to believe and faith in Jesus Christ.

297
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,640
 I need to learn how to interpret,

298
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,540
 how to understand and apply the will of God, right?

299
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:30,800
 So that is what Psalm 19 trying to encourage us to do.

300
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,800
 And that's why one of the core in the Apostles' Creek,

301
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:40,000
 I wonder if you can notice that.

302
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,800
 If you read through the Apostles' Creek,

303
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:47,840
 it gives you the very core of our belief.

304
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,180
 There are many things that can get you distracted,

305
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:57,280
 but these are the things that you always return back to.

306
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:01,140
 These are the things that you build your foundation upon.

307
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:04,520
 These are the most important things.

308
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:07,460
 That is what the Apostles' Creek is all about.

309
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:12,080
 I wonder if you read this, how many statements are there?

310
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,920
 12 statements, okay?

311
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,800
 12 statements.

312
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,940
 Do you notice what stand out to you?

313
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:22,320
 Now, let me tell you,

314
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,440
 what is not being said in Apostles' Creek

315
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:32,080
 is how Christians behave.

316
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,720
 You don't find this statement,

317
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,880
 I believe in the good Christians.

318
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,520
 I believe in how good the church is.

319
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:48,600
 You don't find this statement in our Apostles' Creek, right?

320
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:54,840
 There's not a single mention of the Christian testimony

321
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,920
 or the examples Christians have.

322
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:04,260
 You don't build your faith upon people.

323
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,120
 You don't.

324
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,040
 I understand in recent years,

325
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:14,080
 churches, leaders, rise and fall.

326
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,940
 I understand that.

327
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:22,360
 Pastors, Christian leaders, they fail.

328
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:28,260
 And sometimes it shatters our faith, right?

329
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:31,180
 Because so often, we build our faith

330
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:34,860
 on broken people just like us, right?

331
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,840
 We do.

332
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,600
 There's a temptation to idolize institution,

333
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:47,600
 idolize the big institution, the big names, right?

334
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:54,640
 Here, the Apostles' Creek makes no mention

335
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,980
 how good the Christian behave, right?

336
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:02,720
 And what is being emphasized is what Jesus has done for us.

337
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:08,100
 Out of this 12 statements, there are five statements

338
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:12,760
 on Jesus himself, on Christ alone.

339
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,820
 In fact, most of the statements,

340
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:20,420
 if you take it by proportion, are about Jesus.

341
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:25,420
 It really centers on the historicity of Jesus Christ,

342
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:30,280
 that he did something in human history,

343
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,680
 that Christ did something in our lives.

344
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,000
 Five out of 12 statements are on Jesus himself,

345
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,960
 the historical Jesus.

346
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,000
 He came to die on the cross.

347
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,440
 He came to rise from the dead.

348
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,480
 He came to accomplish our salvation.

349
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,280
 He is our focus and he is our only foundation.

350
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,160
 You see what I'm saying?

351
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:02,160
 You don't believe in the person of a Christian leader.

352
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:07,600
 You don't believe in any institution,

353
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,200
 any institution you can see today,

354
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,560
 or any institution or organization, churches,

355
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:19,080
 parachurch organizations that have come to pass.

356
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,920
 You don't believe in that.

357
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,240
 They all rise and be gone.

358
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,920
 What is eternal?

359
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,360
 What is most important is Jesus Christ himself.

360
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:36,160
 God speaks and he reveals himself.

361
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,000
 The Old and the New Testament are the historical record

362
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 of what God has done in human history.

363
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,360
 And God is still active, doing his things.

364
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:52,300
 Maybe mysteriously, our eyes may not be able to pick it up.

365
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:58,100
 But God is and God will be.

366
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:01,980
 The focus is always on God himself.

367
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:07,860
 So let me remind you, if anyone or anything

368
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:13,180
 that has disappointed you in your Christian walk,

369
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:18,100
 seriously, who cares?

370
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:25,020
 What's most important is Jesus Christ and his cross

371
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,300
 and his empty tomb.

372
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:31,780
 Psalm 19 is telling us God is revealing himself

373
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:34,300
 in his word and the word ultimately

374
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,340
 is Jesus Christ himself, right?

375
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:40,980
 The word of God, ultimately, the revelation of God

376
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,100
 is his son, Jesus Christ.

377
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:47,500
 That's why the creek is on Jesus, centered on Jesus.

378
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,580
 So Psalm 19 is encouraging you,

379
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:53,980
 hey, put your faith in God and his word alone.

380
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,860
 It ends with a prayer.

381
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:00,260
 And I hope this is your prayer today.

382
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,540
 This is your response.

383
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:07,020
 The psalmist says, by them, the word of God,

384
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:11,020
 the revelation of God, right, ultimately is Jesus Christ.

385
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,080
 Is your servant wanted?

386
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:18,380
 In keeping your word, there is great reward.

387
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:21,140
 Who can discern his errors?

388
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:25,220
 Forgive my hidden sins, my hidden faults.

389
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:29,500
 Keep your servant also from willful sins.

390
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,940
 May they not rule over me.

391
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:32,900
 That's interesting.

392
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:39,220
 Then will I be blameless, innocent of great transgression.

393
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:43,980
 May the word of my mouth and the meditation of my heart

394
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,100
 be pleasing in your sight.

395
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:49,300
 Oh Lord, my rock and my redeemer.

396
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:53,620
 You can pick up the attitude of the psalmist

397
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,860
 as he ends the psalm.

398
00:21:55,860 --> 00:22:02,380
 He realized his brokenness as well, right?

399
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:07,380
 He's tempted, a prone to great transgressions.

400
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:11,540
 Just like us, right?

401
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:14,980
 Look deeply into your inner life, right?

402
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:18,380
 We are all ultimately broken.

403
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,660
 We are all depraved.

404
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,660
 We are all sinners.

405
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:29,260
 I think about 400 years ago, there was a church reformer,

406
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:31,500
 what we call reformer.

407
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,660
 His name is Martin Luther.

408
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:38,780
 And he has something to say, really meaningful.

409
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:41,460
 He said, ask question.

410
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:48,820
 Because we're fully justified by the blood of Christ,

411
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:52,720
 by the cross, so we're 100% same.

412
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:58,340
 Because of the grace of God, I'm 100% same.

413
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:04,020
 Yet, I'm also 100% sinner.

414
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:10,100
 Even you come to saving faith in Jesus Christ,

415
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:15,100
 you are not from 100% sinner become 75% sinner, right?

416
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:19,420
 Doesn't take this account in our sinfulness.

417
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,900
 We're still 100% sinner.

418
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,300
 And yet, we are fully justified in Christ.

419
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:31,260
 The psalmist, how many times he described himself as servant?

420
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:34,460
 Servant.

421
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,420
 Two times.

422
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:39,140
 Two times in this short prayer,

423
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:45,420
 praying as a servant to the Lord, right?

424
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:51,740
 Center on the authority, right, of God.

425
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:55,980
 Not himself, humble himself before God.

426
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:59,700
 He realizes fallenness, he also realized he needed

427
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,540
 the instructions, the word of God.

428
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:08,460
 Now, in a sense, whenever we think of the word of God,

429
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:12,900
 whenever we think of God, we should not stand,

430
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,500
 and we must not stand above the word.

431
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:20,100
 We don't stand alongside with the word either.

432
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:23,220
 We stand under the word.

433
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:26,980
 When we get together to do Bible study,

434
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:30,580
 when you read the word, when you think and meditate

435
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:35,340
 on the word, you stand under, and always under,

436
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,260
 under scripture.

437
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:40,260
 You come before the word of God as a servant,

438
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:45,220
 ready to obey, ready to listen, ready to even wrestle

439
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:49,700
 with the meaning of what the word means for us today,

440
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:54,060
 always being teachable, always being teachable.

441
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:58,700
 Now, that does not mean we don't need to think.

442
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,620
 That does not mean we don't need to use our brain.

443
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:04,060
 We need to, right?

444
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:07,060
 Sometimes we have to read the word critically,

445
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:09,780
 not in the sense that we're against it.

446
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:13,420
 Critically means we're thinking it through, you know?

447
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:17,220
 We're using our intellect, God's gift to us, right,

448
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:22,220
 to reason, to struggle, to wrestle with the word, right?

449
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:28,220
 However, the ultimate position that we take

450
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:33,340
 in front of the Bible is to stand under the word of God,

451
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:36,020
 to be teachable, ready to obey.

452
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,260
 Let's all pray together.

453
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:42,780
 I pray that we'll come to God as servants.

454
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:47,900
 Dear God, you are the king.

455
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,100
 You are the leader.

456
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:53,180
 You are the Lord of all.

457
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:58,020
 And we stand under you.

458
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,860
 We sit under you.

459
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:03,540
 And we position ourselves as your servants.

460
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:07,140
 And we pray that as we meditate on your word,

461
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:12,140
 as we try to understand the contemporary relevance,

462
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:15,940
 how it applies to our lives today,

463
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:19,700
 we'll always stand under your authority.

464
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:24,020
 And we praise you because you speak to us.

465
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:30,180
 No mortal can speak about you

466
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,700
 because we are creatures.

467
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,220
 We are humble.

468
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,900
 We are actually nothing.

469
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:42,100
 Our existence depends on you.

470
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:46,980
 So we realize that we cannot speak about you.

471
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:53,740
 It's just because of your grace, you speak to us.

472
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,500
 You speak to us.

473
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:59,700
 You introduce yourself to us.

474
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,780
 And thank you for your revelation.

475
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,860
 Thank you for your word.

476
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:10,460
 From the time of ancient to our time modern,

477
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,780
 you are still speaking.

478
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,980
 And as you speak,

479
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:19,180
 we pray that you will speak in our lives as king,

480
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:21,660
 as the ultimate creator.

481
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:26,060
 And I pray that you will grant each and every one of us

482
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:29,300
 heart and spirit of obedience,

483
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:33,900
 the spirit of being your servant,

484
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,420
 ready to obey, ready to be taught.

485
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:41,220
 We pray that you will grow our church in your word,

486
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:45,660
 that we'll worship you, we'll follow and obey your will.

487
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:49,780
 And pray that in the rest of the week,

488
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:54,100
 you will send us into different situations,

489
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:58,100
 different positions, different ministries to serve you,

490
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:02,420
 to bring the impact of your gospel into our community.

491
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,420
 In Christ, we pray.
