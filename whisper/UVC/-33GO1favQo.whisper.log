[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.420]   There we go.
[00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.480]   Sorry about that.
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.580]   For all you folks online,
[00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.780]   sorry you're gonna have to ask somebody else what I said.
[00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.780]   (audience laughing)
[00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.380]   So if you will turn in your Bibles
[00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.160]   or you can take a look at the screen
[00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.660]   and we'll have the scripture text available for you.
[00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.360]   I'm really glad to be back
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.100]   and it's good to see familiar faces
[00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.700]   and some new faces too.
[00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:31.900]   If I remember right,
[00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.680]   I think it might have been the very last sermon
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.080]   that one of the kind of things that I had said
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.460]   that I was thinking like,
[00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.220]   no, this might be controversial,
[00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.060]   but I said, okay, enough's enough.
[00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.580]   Let's all come back to church, right?
[00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.980]   And so I know that probably may have upset some people,
[00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.460]   but I still stick by those words.
[00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.260]   I'd say, all right, enough's enough.
[00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.460]   Let's come back to church.
[00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.780]   Let's enjoy the fellowship that we have
[00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.580]   with our brothers and sisters.
[00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.140]   And with that, maybe there's all these accounts
[00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.420]   is clicking off right now.
[00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.780]   They're like, okay, I don't wanna hear this guy anymore
[00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.140]   after he said that,
[00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.460]   but I hope you will stick around.
[00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.100]   And I believe God's got something for us
[00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.260]   that is just so timely and it's timeless too,
[00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.260]   because it's something that Jesus said 2,000 years ago
[00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.900]   and it still meets us right where we are today, right now.
[00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.420]   So let's just get right into it.
[00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.420]   So over the last couple of years, it's nothing new.
[00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.940]   I'm not saying anything revolutionary here
[00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.540]   that we've all gone through stuff together
[00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.420]   that is probably more difficult,
[00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.740]   more challenging than anything,
[00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.940]   any season that we have experienced in our lifetime.
[00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.500]   So while only one or two things
[00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.100]   of these things that we've experienced
[00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.940]   over the last couple of years,
[00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.460]   one or two things would just shake the foundation
[00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.780]   of our lives, of our daily lives,
[00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.700]   we've experienced collectively a whole bunch
[00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.100]   of what I'll call fear factors.
[00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.700]   And the challenges of a global pandemic,
[00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.540]   the widespread racial tensions,
[00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.140]   and there's systematic supply chain issues
[00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.380]   we keep hearing about,
[00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.020]   and wave after wave of geopolitical intrigue.
[00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.340]   And then it's compounded by, you all know it,
[00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.900]   go to the gas station, go to the grocery store,
[00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.180]   economic instability, maybe it's in the workplace.
[00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.180]   And then that doesn't even include
[00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.540]   like what are we experiencing when we're all by ourselves?
[00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.780]   Maybe it's a sadness or loneliness or depression,
[00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.700]   feelings of inadequacy, feeling like we're failures,
[00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.100]   all these things that are just weighing on us.
[00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.940]   And while worry and fear are going to try
[00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.940]   and seize this opportunity to lead and control our lives,
[00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.940]   Jesus invites us to authentic faith in God,
[00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.980]   to not be ruled by fear and worry,
[00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.740]   but that our lives will be ruled by faith in God.
[00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.980]   And one of the principle ways that we express our faith
[00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.980]   on a day-to-day level is in the way that we pray.
[00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.980]   And so today's passage,
[00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.780]   Jesus has something to say to us about prayer.
[00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.740]   So why don't we begin with prayer?
[00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.380]   Father God, thank you so much
[00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.260]   that you invite us to come and speak with you,
[00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.820]   to meet with you, to know you,
[00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.280]   have relationship fellowship with you.
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.980]   And sometimes God, the reality is we don't know what to do
[00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.580]   once we are with you.
[00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:00.540]   And so would you today speak to us and teach us
[00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.980]   how do we relate to you?
[00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.060]   Who are you?
[00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.040]   And teach us Lord how to pray.
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.060]   Just as the disciples asked Jesus, your son,
[00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.300]   the very first time we ask joining the generation
[00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.580]   after generation of disciples who have said,
[00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:20.820]   teach us how to pray.
[00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.760]   And it's in Jesus name we ask it, amen.
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.860]   So God, our father in Jesus Christ
[00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.020]   is going to reveal himself today, I believe that.
[00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.560]   So let's be ready to receive what he has for us.
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.780]   So we go to Matthew chapter six, verses five through eight.
[00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.580]   We're in the Sermon on the Mount,
[00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.680]   you know, Jesus' famous sermon.
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.340]   And this is what he says in chapter six of Matthew,
[00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.340]   verses five through eight.
[00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.900]   "And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites."
[00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.740]   I should give you the passage, there it is.
[00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.900]   "Do not be like the hypocrites,
[00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.540]   for they love to pray standing in the synagogues
[00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.140]   and on the street corners to be seen by men.
[00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:07.820]   I tell you the truth,
[00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.820]   they have received their reward in full.
[00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.900]   But when you pray, go into your room,
[00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.900]   close the door and pray to your father who is unseen.
[00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.660]   Then your father who sees what is done in secret
[00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.940]   will reward you.
[00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.140]   And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans,
[00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:25.460]   for they think they'll be heard
[00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.580]   because of their many words.
[00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:28.900]   Do not be like them,
[00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.260]   for your father knows what you need before you ask him."
[00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.460]   So while this passage from Jesus' Sermon on the Mount
[00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:42.300]   might look like, okay, it's his instructions on prayer,
[00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.460]   and it is, it is his instructions on prayer,
[00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:46.540]   but it's more.
[00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:51.100]   The whole Sermon on the Mount I submit to you
[00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.700]   is really Jesus' Sermon on what does it mean
[00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.020]   to have a real relationship with God.
[00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:06.740]   Because how we pray reveals the one to whom we pray,
[00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:12.060]   how we pray reveals our relationship to the one
[00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.700]   to whom we pray,
[00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:19.260]   and third, how we pray reveals what we believe
[00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.380]   about the one to whom we pray.
[00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:27.020]   So here, Jesus first approaches the subject
[00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.180]   from the negative,
[00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:29.660]   and then he's gonna go back and forth
[00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.660]   between positive, negative, positive.
[00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.940]   So he starts and he says in verse five,
[00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.460]   "And when you pray," here's the negative,
[00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.780]   "Do not be like the hypocrites,
[00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.500]   for they love to pray standing in the synagogues
[00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:45.180]   and on the street corners to be seen by men."
[00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.580]   Simply don't pray like hypocrites.
[00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:52.780]   Don't pray like those who have all the wrong reasons,
[00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:55.820]   all the wrong motives for praying.
[00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.460]   Don't do it for show.
[00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.760]   Don't do it to keep up appearances,
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.780]   not even for the appearance of spirituality.
[00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:09.020]   Don't pray so that people think you're godly.
[00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.340]   Don't pray just so that people can say,
[00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.460]   "Wow, look at that relationship they have with God.
[00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.760]   Look how close they are with God."
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.760]   Because that's how the hypocrites pray.
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.780]   They are people who have little
[00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:25.980]   and maybe no relationship to God.
[00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:29.180]   Yet they wanna suggest,
[00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:33.960]   and you could say they're all about this hustle.
[00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.860]   I want everybody to think I'm something I'm not.
[00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:44.380]   Remember, we are speaking to our Father in heaven.
[00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:47.940]   And what does Jesus say next?
[00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:52.060]   And this ought to be a shock, a surprise
[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:56.820]   for those who have settled for that kind of communication
[00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:58.340]   and relationship with God.
[00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:03.240]   Jesus says, "I tell you the truth,
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:06.780]   they have received their reward in full."
[00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:08.900]   Why is that a shock?
[00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:11.660]   Why is it like a punch in the stomach
[00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.840]   for those who would pretend,
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.760]   act like they are spiritual,
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:19.100]   who are acting like they're talking with God?
[00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:24.400]   Because let's unpack something here.
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:29.100]   You know, Jesus often points to an absurdity
[00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:32.860]   so that he can show us what's so obviously true.
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.580]   And what's the absurdity here?
[00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:37.340]   I mean, think about it.
[00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:39.400]   What is the purpose of prayer?
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:43.260]   If we go back to Sunday school,
[00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:44.880]   and I don't know if you guys learned this,
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.760]   I learned this in VBS in Sunday school.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.820]   Hey, you know, if you don't know how to pray,
[00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:52.420]   consider using this acronym, the Acts of Prayer.
[00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:55.780]   A stands for adoration.
[00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:59.420]   C stands for confession of your sins.
[00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:03.100]   T for thanksgiving and gratitude to God
[00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:04.580]   for what he has done for us.
[00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:06.580]   And then S, supplication,
[00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:11.060]   which means asking God what we need, our supply.
[00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:13.860]   So think about it.
[00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:18.220]   If you're a hypocrite and you pray great words,
[00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:21.980]   beautiful words of worship and adoration to God,
[00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:24.820]   sing wonderful songs to him,
[00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:27.060]   but you're doing it for show.
[00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:29.180]   Or you confess your sins,
[00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:30.300]   but you're not doing it
[00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:34.860]   because you want God to know that you're repenting,
[00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:37.180]   you're admitting to your flaws,
[00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:38.940]   but you just want people to think like,
[00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:41.740]   wow, look how godly he is, how humble he is.
[00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:43.340]   He's confessing his sins.
[00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:47.220]   And if you're thanking God for all that he's done for you,
[00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:48.780]   but you're not really talking to God,
[00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:50.740]   you're talking to the people.
[00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:55.300]   Or if you are presenting this long list of all your needs,
[00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:58.620]   and we all have long lists of needs,
[00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:03.620]   but we don't bring it to the one who can actually supply us.
[00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:05.540]   How ridiculous is that?
[00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:08.340]   When the opportunity is right there,
[00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:13.340]   the invitation is there, come, come, let's hang out.
[00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:15.340]   Let's fellowship together.
[00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:20.340]   Let's have a personal one-on-one appointment together.
[00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:27.660]   And then instead of taking advantage
[00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:30.780]   of such an amazing opportunity, an invaluable,
[00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:34.780]   such a priceless opportunity to be spending time
[00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:37.740]   with the God of the universe, the creator,
[00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:40.340]   our heavenly father,
[00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:42.500]   instead we're spending time with the people
[00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:44.900]   so we can show off.
[00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:49.220]   We have failed to do the very thing,
[00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:53.580]   the most important thing, the very purpose of prayer.
[00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:55.620]   We have not communicated with God.
[00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:58.860]   We have not spent time with God.
[00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:02.220]   Instead, we receive our reward in full.
[00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:03.380]   And what is that?
[00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:05.380]   That somebody might pat you on the back and say like,
[00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:08.380]   boy, aren't you a good Christian?
[00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:12.940]   Aren't you spiritual?
[00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:18.700]   And what good is it to receive that reward?
[00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:22.020]   What is that compared to the reward
[00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:24.740]   of spending real time with God?
[00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:29.540]   Then Jesus declares,
[00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:32.340]   truly they have received their reward in full.
[00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:33.900]   People have seen them.
[00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:38.900]   People have congratulated them, approved them,
[00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:41.180]   thought highly of them, respected them.
[00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:46.980]   If we're gonna do that, why would we do that?
[00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:49.900]   But if we're gonna do that, why do we go to church
[00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:53.500]   if it's not just to be able to put on our calendar,
[00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.420]   like check, we are at church.
[00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:57.460]   Look at our attendance record.
[00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:00.340]   Or why would we carry a Bible just so people would say like,
[00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:03.660]   wow, look at that, that guy still carries a Bible.
[00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:05.100]   All I carry is my phone.
[00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:11.580]   Or why would we teach or preach or serve or lead
[00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:17.180]   just so that people can say great job?
[00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:23.620]   When the opportunity is there to receive a greater reward
[00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:24.860]   from our heavenly father.
[00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:29.860]   So then he pivots to the positive in verse six,
[00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:32.180]   and he says, instead pray like this.
[00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:33.820]   But when you pray in verse six,
[00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:37.420]   go into your room, close the door.
[00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:40.620]   I'm gonna go back here so you can have the passage again.
[00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:43.500]   Sorry, I think the app froze.
[00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:44.620]   Oh, there it is, okay.
[00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:48.300]   But when you pray, go into your room, close the door
[00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:50.620]   and pray to your father who is unseen,
[00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:53.540]   then your father who sees what is done in secret
[00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:54.420]   will reward you.
[00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:59.940]   You know, I had a brother that if you would ask him
[00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:02.660]   to pray during worship service or in a Bible study
[00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:06.540]   or in a meeting or before a meal, he'd say, no, no, no, John,
[00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:09.860]   I don't do that because citing this very passage,
[00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:11.700]   Jesus says we should pray in secret.
[00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:16.980]   Well, friends, I hope we can all agree that Jesus
[00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:18.620]   in saying what he is saying here
[00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:23.620]   is not prohibiting public prayer or vocalized prayer.
[00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:28.940]   He's not saying the only way to pray is in a closet
[00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:33.580]   or in secret, but that he is emphasizing
[00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:36.780]   the opportunity we have that we can have
[00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:41.140]   an intimate relationship with God, a one-to-one,
[00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:45.300]   almost like a secret relationship with God.
[00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:47.460]   And you know what we do, right?
[00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:50.940]   When we know that we have, that somebody is gonna be,
[00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:55.820]   you know, they're gonna value a secret that we share,
[00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:57.740]   they're gonna guard the secret,
[00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:59.340]   we know we can say anything.
[00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:01.980]   When we're with somebody we trust, somebody we love,
[00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:03.940]   and we're close right next to them,
[00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:05.980]   and we can whisper into each other's ear,
[00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:10.220]   we know we can say anything and it's safe.
[00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:12.980]   We don't have to hide, we don't have to pretend,
[00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:15.540]   we don't have to put up some kind of air of,
[00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:18.620]   oh, you know, I'm actually better than I really am.
[00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:21.580]   No, we can be completely honest, revealing everything.
[00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:25.120]   And Jesus says, you can be that way with God.
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:31.860]   You can be that way with God, going into a secret place.
[00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:39.460]   You see, God is not a disinterested God.
[00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:42.740]   He is not aloof and far away.
[00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:49.420]   He is our Father who invites us to come near to Him,
[00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:53.340]   who invites us to seek Him out,
[00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:56.940]   and then promises us that we're gonna find Him,
[00:14:56.940 --> 00:15:00.220]   that He's not like trying to be evasive.
[00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:03.420]   You know, you ever get ghosted by somebody?
[00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:05.180]   I get, that happens to me.
[00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:06.340]   I know, you'd think like,
[00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:08.220]   yeah, how could that happen to this guy?
[00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:09.940]   He seems like such a likable guy.
[00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:12.300]   No, I get ghosted all the time, and I'm like,
[00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:15.540]   man, I know how text messages work.
[00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:16.900]   He just got that message.
[00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:19.460]   Why isn't he answering, right?
[00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:21.340]   So you just hope they're probably in a meeting,
[00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:22.740]   they can't answer right now.
[00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:25.340]   God's not gonna ghost us.
[00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:30.420]   He doesn't get tired of His children and say,
[00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:33.820]   you know, oh, gosh, this guy, he won't stop talking.
[00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:36.460]   He always wants to hang out with me.
[00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:38.900]   God's not that kind of a Father.
[00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:41.500]   He loves it when we spend time with Him.
[00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:46.980]   He wants us to come closer and closer to know Him better.
[00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:55.220]   'Cause remember, we're speaking with our Heavenly Father.
[00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:58.300]   I hope we all believe this,
[00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:03.300]   that this is the God that invites us to come near to pray.
[00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:08.140]   He's intimately close, He loves us,
[00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:12.500]   and in fact, the Bible says He loves us so much
[00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:17.500]   that His own Holy Spirit has made our bodies His temple,
[00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:18.500]   His home.
[00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:24.900]   But He says that we are to abide, have unity with His Son.
[00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:31.300]   And then He tells us, we're so close,
[00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:35.620]   that nothing can separate us from His love
[00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.300]   in Christ Jesus, our Lord.
[00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:40.180]   And that's close.
[00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:45.340]   And this is the Father to whom we pray.
[00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:50.340]   And as in a secret place, we can enjoy unparalleled,
[00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:54.060]   uninhibited access to the Father
[00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:58.940]   so that this reward of knowing Him
[00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:05.980]   is so much greater than that meager reward you get
[00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:10.460]   when you pray for the sake of what people might think.
[00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:16.140]   Sure, there's stuff that comes with this reward.
[00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:17.700]   You know, we bring our lists and we say,
[00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:20.180]   God, please help me, please provide for me.
[00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:21.540]   I have this need.
[00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:25.400]   And sure, God takes care of material needs too.
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:29.100]   But that's like having a steak and saying like,
[00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:32.240]   man, this is the most awesome salt I've ever had.
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:36.080]   (congregation laughing)
[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:39.440]   There's something even better
[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.560]   than the stuff that God provides.
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:42.920]   It's Himself.
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:45.080]   It's Himself.
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:51.000]   So let's not let the stuff that is good
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.720]   distract us from what's really the best.
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:58.360]   It's God Himself, the Father.
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:02.280]   So in verse seven, then He said,
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:03.480]   well, let's say, you know,
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.360]   the authentic relationship with the Father
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:08.240]   requires us to believe who He is.
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:14.720]   And actually it requires us to believe who we are too.
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:18.800]   That when we pray, we're not praying as strangers
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:23.040]   or the enemies of God, but in Christ Jesus,
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:25.040]   we are His children.
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:30.040]   We are talking to Daddy God, Abba Father.
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:32.120]   So we had to know who He is.
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:33.600]   We got to know who we are.
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:34.480]   And then when we pray,
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:38.080]   it also includes knowing what kind of Father is He.
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:39.920]   So in verse seven, Jesus says,
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:42.760]   "And when you pray," going back to the negative,
[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:46.840]   "do not keep on babbling like pagans,
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:47.920]   for they think they'll be heard
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:49.640]   because of their many words."
[00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.100]   So what kind of Father is He?
[00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:54.840]   The first thing we see is He's not the kind of Father
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:57.840]   who's really impressed by lots of words.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.760]   Words by themselves don't do it for Him.
[00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:05.280]   You know, in many religions,
[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:08.160]   including many traditions of Christianity,
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:12.560]   you know, writing down prayers, reading prayers,
[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:14.800]   memorizing and reciting prayers,
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:17.920]   and even praying a long time.
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:21.560]   These are valuable things, highly valued things.
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:24.640]   And don't, just like we're not gonna do
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:25.760]   Bible studies anymore,
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:28.660]   doesn't mean there's no more prayer meetings either, okay?
[00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:31.340]   By the way, we are gonna have Bible studies,
[00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:32.580]   right, Pastor Mark?
[00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:34.140]   And yes, we should pray.
[00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:36.100]   So these are all still valuable.
[00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:39.260]   Yes, write down your prayers, journal your prayers,
[00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:41.180]   because you know, you're gonna come back one day
[00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:42.420]   when you're really discouraged,
[00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:43.980]   and you're gonna go back and read your journal,
[00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:47.220]   go, "Man, I totally forgot about this.
[00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:49.700]   Six months ago, I was so depressed,
[00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:54.460]   and I asked God, 'Lord, would you please give me joy
[00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:55.560]   and peace?
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:57.940]   Would you give me contentment?'
[00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:00.580]   And I have it, and I totally forgot I asked Him."
[00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:02.540]   And then you can write next to your little prayer
[00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:05.260]   that you wrote down, "God did it.
[00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:06.900]   He came through.
[00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:08.620]   How faithful He is."
[00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:09.980]   And then we'll worship Him.
[00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:15.820]   So write them down, recite prayers, memorize prayers,
[00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:18.480]   'cause sometimes, you know this experience,
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:21.380]   you get to your quiet time, your prayer closet,
[00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:22.420]   and you're just like,
[00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:25.380]   "Man, I don't even know what to say to God today."
[00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:26.580]   So what do you do?
[00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:28.420]   You might go back and read the prayers of others.
[00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:29.500]   That's valuable.
[00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:34.300]   And then sometimes, you wanna discipline yourself and say,
[00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:35.140]   "You know what?
[00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:38.060]   I don't have much to say, but I am not leaving this room
[00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:41.660]   until I have prayed 10 minutes, or 15 minutes,
[00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:43.700]   until I've talked to God for half an hour,
[00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:47.380]   or prayed for an hour, or more."
[00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:50.080]   Those are great disciplines.
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:55.080]   But even those valuable things can become empty and void
[00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:58.580]   of value and meaning if we're not careful.
[00:20:58.580 --> 00:20:59.500]   Let me give you an example.
[00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:01.220]   You know, when I was a small boy,
[00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:02.820]   you know, I probably learned from my parents
[00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:04.940]   more than anybody else how to pray.
[00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:07.180]   And one day, when my dad would hear me saying the same things
[00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:10.060]   over and over again in prayer, like at the dinner table,
[00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:12.880]   he said, "Hey, why don't you kinda mix it up a little bit
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:15.180]   and be more creative?
[00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:19.300]   'Cause it doesn't sound like you mean it when you say it."
[00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:21.820]   So he said, "For example, maybe you might wanna start
[00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:24.100]   with not just, you know, 'Thanks for the food, God,'
[00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:26.980]   but you might say, 'Thank you, God, for a beautiful day.
[00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:29.980]   Thank you for taking care of me.'"
[00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:32.460]   And, you know, so he would provide these suggestions.
[00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:34.380]   And I remember thinking, "Yeah, that's a great idea."
[00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:37.060]   So I added in my prayers,
[00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:39.640]   "God, thank you for this beautiful day."
[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:43.420]   As a child, that just like, "Hey, that's simple.
[00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:44.460]   That makes sense."
[00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:49.040]   And, but I remember, I was in elementary school,
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:53.540]   and I was praying over my cereal and milk.
[00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:55.420]   And I remember praying,
[00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:56.940]   "God, thank you for this beautiful day."
[00:21:56.940 --> 00:22:00.520]   And immediately, I looked out the window
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:05.520]   and noticed it was dark, it was raining, it looked cold.
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:08.980]   And here I was thanking God for a beautiful day.
[00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:11.060]   And immediately I realized, like,
[00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:13.460]   "Man, I just said something I don't even mean."
[00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:19.140]   Unless, you know, even as a kid, I was super spiritual,
[00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:21.300]   like, "I'm praying for a beautiful day.
[00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:24.300]   I'm believing God's gonna give it to me."
[00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:27.940]   Or, "I'm so spiritual, I'm gonna be content
[00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:30.640]   as I'm getting soaking wet and freezing in the rain."
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:32.340]   No.
[00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:36.100]   Even something that was meant to be good
[00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:39.260]   had become meaningless 'cause it was just words.
[00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:42.420]   And you know what I'm talking about
[00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:44.660]   'cause I'm sure you've experienced that too.
[00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:46.100]   We gotta check ourselves.
[00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:49.340]   And sometimes it's even the very name of God,
[00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:52.260]   the calling God Lord.
[00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:53.380]   You know, have you ever had,
[00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:54.500]   sorry, this isn't in the notes,
[00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:56.980]   have you ever had one of those conversations with somebody?
[00:22:56.980 --> 00:23:00.580]   Wouldn't it be annoying if I was talking to Mark
[00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:02.940]   and I said, "Hey, Mark, how's your day, Mark?
[00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:04.940]   Mark, you wanna go out for lunch, Mark?
[00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:08.620]   Is Wendy doing okay, Mark?
[00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:09.940]   Are your kids doing okay, Mark?"
[00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:12.420]   And if I kept saying his name over and over again,
[00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:13.260]   and you know what?
[00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:16.420]   If you think about it, that's how we often pray, right?
[00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:20.140]   Like, "Lord, thank you so much for this beautiful day, Lord."
[00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:22.460]   And then, "Lord," and then now you're all gonna get
[00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:25.520]   really self-conscious about public prayer or something.
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:28.860]   But like, even Lord,
[00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:33.980]   that He is the master of all things, King,
[00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:36.660]   and it becomes meaningless.
[00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:37.900]   It's just another word.
[00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:41.420]   Because we don't mean it when we say it.
[00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:45.140]   Or Father, or maybe even the name of Jesus.
[00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:48.380]   It just becomes something that we automatically insert
[00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:50.060]   into every sentence at the beginning,
[00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:52.020]   in the middle, at the end, you know?
[00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:55.080]   As if somehow, like the pagans think,
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:59.700]   that their many words are gonna get God to hear them.
[00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:04.760]   God is not a respecter of lots of words.
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:09.820]   So when we pray, let's pray,
[00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:13.000]   meaning what we say and saying what we mean.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.640]   And here's another thing.
[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:19.420]   You know, God is not like other gods, and He's not,
[00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:20.900]   you know, though He is our Father,
[00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:23.020]   He is not like our earthly father.
[00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:26.100]   And here's what I mean.
[00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:29.120]   How many parents do we have in this room?
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:33.020]   Well, we got a young room, not a lot of parents.
[00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:35.460]   Two parents.
[00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:38.260]   Well, when you're parents, you're gonna experience this,
[00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:40.820]   and this is where your children will,
[00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:42.000]   well, we've all been children,
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.940]   so maybe we remember when we've done this,
[00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:46.860]   that we negotiate with our parents.
[00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:51.520]   That we might even say things like adore them,
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:55.380]   love them, flatter them, like worship and praise them,
[00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:57.400]   just so we can get what we want.
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:01.960]   God's not like that.
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:07.360]   We don't adore Him, confess our sins, and thank Him,
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:10.440]   just so we can hurry up and get to the list of things
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:13.680]   that we need, thinking that if we butter Him up,
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.480]   if we get Him in a good mood,
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.920]   He's gonna give us what we need and what I want.
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:20.320]   Or we might bargain.
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:25.200]   God, if you'll do this for me, I'll do this for you.
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:27.760]   You know what my favorite one is?
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:33.400]   God, if you make me rich, I promise I will start to tithe.
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:36.640]   Give me a million dollars,
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:38.720]   and I promise I'll start to tithe.
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.720]   And you know how ridiculous that is?
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:42.480]   It's like, God, give me a million dollars,
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:45.160]   and I promise I'll give you 100,000 back.
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:47.080]   What a great deal for God, right?
[00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:51.200]   But that's how we pray sometimes.
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:53.960]   We're thinking we're doing Him a favor in these deals.
[00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:59.280]   Let's not do that.
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:02.700]   That's not the kind of God we serve.
[00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:04.740]   That's not the Heavenly Father.
[00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:09.800]   Are we using many words, strategic words, insincere words,
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:13.760]   maybe even empty words because we're forgetting
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:17.960]   who we're talking with, who we're dealing with,
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.520]   that He's not impersonal?
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:24.480]   He's not an absentee father,
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:28.280]   but rather we are speaking to our Heavenly Father
[00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:29.280]   who loves us.
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:34.720]   Yes, we believe our God is our Father,
[00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:38.960]   but do we really believe what kind of God He is?
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:40.960]   And then Jesus reminds us again,
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:43.080]   He doesn't respect words
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:45.040]   because that's 'cause He's not an empty God.
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:47.760]   He's not a dead God who receives empty prayers
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:50.760]   from empty pray-ers.
[00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:55.600]   So He says in verse seven again,
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:58.720]   "When you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans,
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:00.240]   "for they think they will be heard
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:02.600]   "because of their many words."
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:06.320]   Second, though, we have to remember that our Father
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:09.480]   is one who already knows what we need.
[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:16.480]   In other words, when we give our list of needs,
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:20.300]   God's not like, "Wow,
[00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:24.500]   "here's information I did not have.
[00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:28.980]   "I'm so glad He gave me a detailed list."
[00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:30.840]   Or it's not like time goes by
[00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:33.840]   and we forget to tell God we need something,
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:36.480]   and God says, "Oh man, why didn't you tell me
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:37.600]   "you needed that?
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.600]   "I would've taken care of it,
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:41.620]   "but you never told me.
[00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:43.820]   "I had no idea that was going on in your life.
[00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:45.700]   "I didn't know."
[00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:50.700]   God is a Father who already knows what we need.
[00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:55.920]   You know, in a season when our prayer life
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:57.440]   can become very imbalanced,
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:00.240]   you know, when it seems like there's so many needs,
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.800]   that the list at the end
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:07.640]   becomes the large part of our prayer
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:11.320]   that we kind of rush through praising and worshiping,
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:13.160]   and we rush through
[00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:17.920]   sincerely confessing our sins
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:19.360]   and asking for forgiveness,
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:21.960]   where we rush through and try, you know,
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:23.000]   have a hard time remembering,
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.440]   "What has God done for me lately?
[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:25.720]   "I gotta thank Him for something.
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:27.620]   "I gotta come up with something
[00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:29.360]   "just so I can get to the list."
[00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:36.040]   Let's not forget
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:42.120]   what kind of God, what kind of Father is He?
[00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:44.720]   That He is one who knows what we need,
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:46.640]   and in knowing what we need,
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:49.120]   we have a God who is able,
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:52.920]   He is capable of providing what we need.
[00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:53.760]   Do we believe that?
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:54.580]   Amen?
[00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:57.840]   This side doesn't sound convinced.
[00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:58.680]   Amen?
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:01.120]   Can He take care of us?
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:02.240]   Yes.
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:05.440]   But here's something that's equally important.
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:08.440]   Yes, He is able to take care of us.
[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:12.080]   The Bible tells us He is a king
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:16.240]   that owns cattle on a thousand hills.
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:19.080]   I mean, maybe like in today's vernacular,
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:20.040]   that might be like,
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:25.040]   He's a car dealer who owns a thousand lots of cars,
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:26.520]   you know?
[00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:31.320]   If you need a car, He's got one for you, okay?
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:34.220]   By the way, I don't know how many times
[00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:37.680]   God has provided a car when I've desperately needed a car,
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:39.780]   and others have said the same thing to me.
[00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:44.240]   But not only can He do it,
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:50.200]   what's equally important is that He is gracious.
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:54.760]   He cares, He loves us, so He wants to do it.
[00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:57.600]   He wants to take care of us.
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:59.040]   He wants to bless us.
[00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:01.720]   He doesn't want us to go without.
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:04.220]   He wants to bless us.
[00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:10.960]   He wants to make sure that He is supplying us.
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:14.280]   These two things, it might seem obvious,
[00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:16.980]   but these two things in combination
[00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:21.720]   are so incredibly important.
[00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:28.740]   You see, if He was a powerful and wealthy God,
[00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:32.940]   it would be like having a father who is a billionaire,
[00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:37.560]   but he never asks, "Hey, did you have lunch today?
[00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:42.820]   Hey, there's holes in your clothes.
[00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:44.520]   Do we need to get you a new shirt?
[00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:51.760]   Hey, you look sad today.
[00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:55.900]   How can I help you today?"
[00:30:55.900 --> 00:31:01.820]   It would be having a God who is a billionaire,
[00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:06.260]   who has everything that a person could want or have,
[00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:09.680]   and then, but they don't care about us.
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:12.100]   They won't lift a finger to help us.
[00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:16.080]   But what if God was unable to help us,
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:19.620]   but He really cared about us, and that was all He,
[00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:20.460]   you know what?
[00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:23.060]   It would be like the impotent father
[00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:26.020]   who desperately sees his desperate children
[00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:29.140]   starving to death, freezing in the cold,
[00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:32.520]   having no roof over their heads, no bed to sleep in,
[00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:36.940]   and because He's powerless, He's helpless,
[00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:38.040]   He can do nothing.
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:44.500]   But God is able, and He so cares about us.
[00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:53.580]   There's no place I see it better than in the words of Paul.
[00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:55.140]   I gotta ask, sister, I don't know if you read
[00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:59.780]   the sermon manuscript before I preach today,
[00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:03.080]   but I hear she quoted the very verses.
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:10.100]   In Romans 5, six through eight, Paul says,
[00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:12.780]   "You see, at just the right time,
[00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:17.780]   when we were still powerless, you know, helpless,
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:20.120]   Christ died for the ungodly.
[00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:23.020]   Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous man,
[00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:27.680]   though for a good man, someone might possibly dare to die."
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:31.480]   And here it is in verse eight.
[00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:35.420]   "But God demonstrates His own love for us in this.
[00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:39.980]   While we were still sinners, Christ died for us."
[00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:45.000]   Our father knew exactly what we needed
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.840]   more than anything else.
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:52.600]   We had a problem that was the elephant in the room.
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:55.680]   We could not get past it, we could not ignore it.
[00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:59.840]   It is a sin problem that we have offended
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:02.260]   our heavenly father, our creator.
[00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:08.000]   And God had the solution because we were helpless,
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.100]   powerless to do anything about it.
[00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:18.100]   And the solution was in His son.
[00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:21.340]   And God could say, "Oh, no, no, wait,
[00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:23.380]   the price is way too high.
[00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:26.560]   I cannot give up my son for these losers.
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:29.100]   They're my enemies.
[00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:33.660]   Why would I sacrifice my son for them?"
[00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:36.900]   But He didn't do that because He demonstrated
[00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:40.140]   His love for us like this.
[00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:43.700]   And while we were still sinners, still His enemies,
[00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:48.500]   He gave His son.
[00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:50.180]   Jesus died for us.
[00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:54.380]   Amazing.
[00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:58.060]   This is amazing love, the song that we sang.
[00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:01.060]   This is amazing.
[00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:04.220]   We needed a savior.
[00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:06.620]   The father was able to provide a savior.
[00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:09.700]   And because He loves us and cares for us,
[00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:13.820]   He was willing to pay the price,
[00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:18.820]   that high price so that we could be saved from our sin.
[00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:26.180]   Jesus' words on prayer reinforced for us
[00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:29.700]   that God desires an authentic relationship with us.
[00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:34.820]   Not just religiosity, not just piety,
[00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:40.740]   not just ritualism, He wants a relationship.
[00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:43.660]   Come close to me.
[00:34:43.660 --> 00:34:47.780]   Come close, come even closer.
[00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:51.060]   You're still too far away, come closer.
[00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:56.940]   And He gives us access through faith in Jesus Christ,
[00:34:56.940 --> 00:34:57.780]   His son.
[00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:00.740]   If you don't know Jesus as your Lord and savior,
[00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:05.180]   why wait a moment longer?
[00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:07.580]   Trust in Him today.
[00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:12.820]   He said Himself, no one comes to the Father
[00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:14.540]   except through Him.
[00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:18.180]   I'm gonna ask you to just bow your heads for a moment.
[00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:20.580]   And I'm gonna ask you to,
[00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:26.460]   we'll just go through the acts, the acts of prayer.
[00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:33.060]   God, thank you that you are indeed a loving Father.
[00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:39.260]   Thank you that you are a God who is powerful
[00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:42.380]   and you are able.
[00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:47.060]   We don't have a weak God, we don't have a distant God,
[00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:49.180]   we have a God who is intimately close.
[00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:54.900]   A God who doesn't have to hang out with us,
[00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:56.980]   but God who wants to.
[00:35:56.980 --> 00:36:02.700]   We praise you for being a God like no other.
[00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:07.420]   For being our heavenly Father.
[00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:09.140]   And we confess our sin to you,
[00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:12.140]   we admit that we have sinned against you
[00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:14.620]   when we have tried to live life our own way.
[00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:18.660]   God, we have said no to you.
[00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:20.820]   We have said your way is not good enough.
[00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:24.980]   Your way isn't good enough for me, it's not my way.
[00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:29.980]   And we have chosen to rebel and we ask you for forgiveness.
[00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:34.860]   For every choice that we have made,
[00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:39.860]   which only confirmed that we are in rebellion against you.
[00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:45.340]   But Lord, thank you that you have sent your son, Jesus.
[00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:50.780]   Knowing exactly what we need, a savior,
[00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:53.340]   you have provided a savior,
[00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:57.060]   the perfect Lamb of God in your son, Jesus Christ.
[00:36:57.060 --> 00:36:58.020]   And you have said to us,
[00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:01.420]   if we will just believe in your remedy
[00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:05.340]   for our sin problem, the solution to our sin problem,
[00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:09.180]   if we would just receive in faith that remedy
[00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:12.580]   that you have said, you will forgive us.
[00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:17.020]   You'll give us a new life, a new identity,
[00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:18.460]   no longer an enemy of God,
[00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:21.540]   but now a child of God, a friend of God.
[00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:27.540]   That you promise us eternal life and not death.
[00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:34.700]   Thank you for the gift of salvation in Jesus Christ.
[00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:39.740]   And Lord, we do lay before you all our needs.
[00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:43.860]   And we know that we're going to keep being tempted.
[00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:45.480]   We're gonna keep being distracted.
[00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:47.580]   We're gonna think that things that are fool's gold
[00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:48.700]   is real gold.
[00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:51.700]   We're gonna think that what isn't valuable is valuable.
[00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:53.820]   Our priorities are gonna get messed up
[00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:55.420]   and we need your help, Lord.
[00:37:56.700 --> 00:38:01.380]   Teach us, teach us how to get it right.
[00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:03.220]   We can't do it without your help.
[00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:07.940]   And there are other needs in this room,
[00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:12.940]   financial needs, concerns about career or education,
[00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:21.180]   relational issues, broken families, broken friendships,
[00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:26.500]   broken relationships with, in our workplaces,
[00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:29.620]   in our schools, Lord, with this world,
[00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:32.460]   we pray you will heal those relationships.
[00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:40.340]   And God, we also ask, again,
[00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:43.180]   that you would teach us how to pray.
[00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:46.540]   Because we want to have that relationship with you,
[00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:48.300]   that communication with you,
[00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:52.340]   that Jesus has now, he's wet our appetite
[00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:55.420]   and has shown us how much better
[00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:58.780]   how much more there is for us.
[00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:02.740]   Lord, teach us how to pray.
[00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:09.300]   I'm gonna ask you to open your eyes for a moment.
[00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:13.900]   And we're gonna finish prayer this way.
[00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:16.940]   'Cause Jesus did give us a specific prayer.
[00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:19.140]   And it's probably one that everybody in the room
[00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:21.100]   has memorized.
[00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:22.820]   But how many times when somebody says,
[00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:25.860]   "Okay, let's pray the Lord's Prayer together,"
[00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:27.260]   we're able to just, you know,
[00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:28.620]   we could be like texting somebody
[00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:31.660]   and we could still do the Lord's Prayer, right?
[00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:34.540]   You're watching a video, YouTube,
[00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:36.380]   and we can recite the Lord's Prayer.
[00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:40.060]   But how about right now, we'll just focus,
[00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:43.700]   pull away from all the distractions,
[00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:47.660]   and let's look at the Lord's Prayer,
[00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:50.980]   the prayer that Jesus taught us afresh.
[00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:55.180]   'Cause he said, "This then is how you should pray."
[00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:57.740]   Let's do it together.
[00:39:57.740 --> 00:40:00.300]   Our Father in heaven,
[00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:02.820]   hallowed be your name.
[00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:04.740]   Your kingdom come,
[00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:08.900]   your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:11.820]   Give us today our daily bread.
[00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:13.740]   Forgive us our debts,
[00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:17.380]   as we also have forgiven our debtors.
[00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:19.900]   And lead us not into temptation,
[00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:22.420]   but deliver us from the evil one.
[00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:31.180]   And Jesus invites us to an authentic relationship
[00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:33.060]   with his heavenly Father.
[00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:34.100]   And I ask you,
[00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:37.980]   do you accept that invitation?
[00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:43.020]   Are you all in on this relationship?
[00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:49.100]   I hope your answer is a resounding yes,
[00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:51.180]   absolutely, that's what I want.
[00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:57.460]   That's in Jesus' name we have prayed, amen.
[00:40:57.460 --> 00:41:07.460]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
