[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   And let's welcome Pastor Mark for the sermon.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.200]   - Hey, good to see all of you, at least most of us, right?
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.040]   I know it's a very exciting game, the World Cup.
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.280]   It comes down to penalty kicks,
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.020]   and I don't know, which team are you rooting for?
[00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.000]   Which team are you rooting for?
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.400]   Here.
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.520]   It's over?
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.280]   It's already over.
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.920]   So Argentina won, right?
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.400]   All right, all right, let's celebrate, let's celebrate.
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.400]   Okay, anyways.
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.920]   Well, good to have the update so we can pay attention,
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.560]   and we can concentrate of why we're here,
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.160]   because we're here to worship, right?
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.760]   So I would like to share something
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.640]   about the Christmas story recorded in the Bible,
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.320]   in the New Testament.
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.760]   When we come to Christmas,
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.680]   when we come to this Advent season,
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.800]   there are many questions that we may ask about Christmas.
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.160]   For example, especially Christmas,
[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.680]   you know, it has inherited a lot of different traditions,
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.920]   in our Western world, at least, right?
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.760]   So one tradition is Santa Claus, right?
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:16.680]   Santa Claus.
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.480]   Do you think Santa Claus has anything to do
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.840]   with the Bible Christmas story?
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.560]   What do you think?
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.400]   - No.
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.240]   - Yeah.
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.060]   (congregation laughing)
[00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.900]   You know where Santa Claus come from?
[00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:27.960]   - Coca-Cola.
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:28.800]   - Coca-Cola?
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.960]   (laughs)
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:30.800]   You know.
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.320]   - St. Nicholas?
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.720]   - St. Nicholas, yes, yes, you're right, James.
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.920]   Yeah, St. Nicholas.
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.600]   Is a bishop in today's Turkey.
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.840]   He was a Christian leader and known for being kind
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.280]   and helpful to those who are needy.
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.280]   Back in the days, AD 200, 300, something like that,
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.640]   or 200 to 300 years after Christ.
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.300]   So it's an early church leaders.
[00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.380]   One of them is called St. Nicholas.
[00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.300]   Because of his kind work,
[00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.520]   you know, the tradition has developed
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.200]   that someone who is giving gifts to those who are needy
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.400]   in the history, in the church history.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.440]   So that's why we have Santa Claus, right?
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.800]   So although Santa Claus today has very little to do
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.400]   with the Christmas story,
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.920]   have very little to do with the Bible,
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.040]   but you need to understand the root of the tradition,
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.520]   the root of the legend comes from a bishop
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.480]   called St. Nicholas.
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.960]   Secondly, why December 25th?
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.040]   Why?
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.560]   Have you ever asked this question?
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.680]   Now, according to the Bible,
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.580]   actually Jesus was born in the summer days.
[00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:48.420]   You know?
[00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.240]   Actually in the summer days.
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.080]   You know why?
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.480]   Because Luke 2 tells us the shepherds
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.820]   are grazing the sheep in the field of Bethlehem.
[00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.480]   Now, according to the ancient way of working
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.060]   between farmers and shepherds,
[00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.880]   after the harvest of the barley and wheat,
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.560]   they would invite the shepherd to come with their sheep,
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.320]   and they will eat the stubble of the leftover
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.460]   from the harvest.
[00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.640]   So they would let them into the field.
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.440]   So that is right in the summer days, right?
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.640]   Right in the summer days.
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.240]   'Cause harvest happens in April and May,
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.760]   and then the summer season kicks in.
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.000]   The shepherd will come to the farming fields,
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.480]   to the land.
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.360]   They will graze in the land of the farmers.
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.120]   So there was a contract between the shepherd
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.960]   and the farmers, and they would let them in.
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.140]   So with that background,
[00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.300]   we kind of know Jesus was actually born in the summer days.
[00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.000]   All right?
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.760]   I'm wrong, okay?
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.120]   But why December 25th?
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.400]   Now, one theory, one theory,
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.480]   is that during the early church,
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.600]   when Christianity was being recognized,
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.180]   they found that on December 25th, or around this time,
[00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.800]   in the Roman empire, the Roman people
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.360]   would celebrate the sun god.
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.400]   It's a sun god festival.
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.560]   They would give gifts and lights,
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.980]   and something like that, like candles,
[00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.880]   to celebrate the arrival of sun god.
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.920]   But when Christianity is being recognized properly
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.200]   in the Roman empire,
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.600]   the Christians, the Roman Christians,
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.220]   they took over the festival,
[00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.320]   and replaced it with the celebration of Christmas,
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.920]   the coming of true God, son of God.
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.240]   So that's how it has developed,
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.600]   December 25th, instead of worshiping the false god,
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.960]   the sun god, instead of being controlled by him
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.920]   to worship him, the Christians were saying,
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.920]   let's celebrate the true God, son of God, Jesus Christ,
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.040]   who come into our world, right, to give us hope.
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.600]   Not the sun god, not the false god,
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.620]   but the true God, son of God.
[00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.920]   So with that background, you understand
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.080]   the first Christmas was actually counter-cultural,
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.080]   because the entire cultural world of the Roman empire
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.920]   was celebrating following the false god,
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.360]   you know, the sun, the moon, and the stars.
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.200]   But the Christians come along and saying,
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.560]   hey, let's not do that, and replace it
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.120]   with the true meaning, with the true God, son of God.
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.920]   So that's why December 25th, right?
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.240]   And another theory is how they figure out
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:46.240]   is 25th of December was the birth of Jesus Christ,
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.720]   that they count nine months from Passover.
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.160]   Because according to one tradition,
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.840]   Mary was conceived by the Holy Spirit on Passover,
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.320]   but there's no other better day for her to be conceived,
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:09.320]   I guess, so they thought of the conception happened
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.820]   in Passover, and then count nine months,
[00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:17.120]   because in the ancient days, they believe after conception,
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.880]   there'll be nine months in the womb,
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.120]   and then giving birth to a child.
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.440]   So they count nine months from Passover
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:29.120]   to end up on December 25th, right?
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.720]   But there are different Western and Eastern church,
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:34.720]   they have different traditions
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.000]   of using different calendars.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.720]   So sometimes they calculate the Passover
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.720]   would be on a different day.
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.640]   So some of the Eastern Christians, Eastern Orthodox,
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.480]   they will not celebrate Christmas on December 25th.
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.080]   They instead, they celebrate in January.
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.720]   So if you go to a Eastern Orthodox church,
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.840]   you worship with the Orthodox communities,
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.480]   they would not celebrate on the 25th of December,
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:06.480]   they would do so on January 7th or 6th, something like that.
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.560]   So there are a lot of questions
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.620]   we can ask about Christmas.
[00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:11.520]   However, there are one question
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.880]   there is one question we have to ask
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:18.240]   is what does the Bible say about the Christmas story, right?
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.800]   So today I would like to turn to the Gospel of Luke,
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:26.560]   Luke chapter one, to take a few verses
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.440]   out of the first two chapters of the Gospel of Luke
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:33.040]   and see what the Bible writers want us to know
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.920]   about the Christmas story.
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:38.400]   Of course, there are tons of things that we can ask
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.620]   about the birth of Jesus Christ,
[00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:42.760]   the scenario, the circumstances,
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.640]   what kind of diaper did he use,
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:47.000]   there are all sorts of different things we can ask,
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.620]   but what the Bible want us to know
[00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.480]   and don't want us to miss,
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:54.320]   we have to go back to scripture, right?
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.360]   So there are two Gospels
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.560]   that talk about the Christmas story, okay?
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:59.400]   Which one?
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.680]   The Gospel of Luke is the first one, it's one of them,
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.680]   one of the two.
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:08.680]   The second one is Gospel of Matthew, right?
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.180]   Only the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke
[00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:14.780]   talk about the Christmas story.
[00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:16.740]   So Luke chapter one, here we go.
[00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:21.740]   When Herod was king of Judea,
[00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:24.300]   there was a Jewish priest called Zechariah.
[00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:27.340]   He was a member of the priestly order of Abijah
[00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.060]   and his wife, Elizabeth.
[00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:35.040]   She was also from the priestly line of Aaron.
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:39.980]   Now, Zechariah and Elizabeth were righteous in God's eyes,
[00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:43.660]   careful to obey all of the Lord's commandments
[00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:44.900]   and regulations.
[00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:48.300]   They, however, had no children
[00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:51.780]   because Elizabeth was unable to conceive
[00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:54.460]   and they were both very old.
[00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:57.940]   Now, notice how the story goes.
[00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:02.300]   This is the stage setting first.
[00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:06.560]   Tell us what happened in the first Christmas, right?
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:09.080]   So chapter one talks about the birth of John the Baptist,
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:13.780]   the cousin of Jesus, the pioneer of Messiah, right?
[00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:15.560]   The foreigner of Messiah.
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:18.620]   So they talk about a couple, Zechariah and Elizabeth.
[00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:22.360]   Now, how does the Bible describe them?
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.560]   When you read the Bible,
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:27.000]   sometimes you can pick up some details
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.160]   and ask the question,
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:32.500]   what kind of social statements are these?
[00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:36.340]   Social statement meaning statements of descriptions
[00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:39.020]   that talks about their social status,
[00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:40.460]   their position in the society,
[00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:42.420]   their ranking in the society.
[00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:45.300]   What kind of people do they belong to?
[00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:50.300]   Zechariah and Elizabeth, old couple, no children, right?
[00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:55.580]   Now, in those days, in the biblical world,
[00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.180]   when you had no children,
[00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:02.160]   you cannot conceive, you don't have a child,
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.240]   especially you don't have a son.
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:07.900]   You are considered being under curse.
[00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:10.840]   You're being under curse.
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:15.000]   If you're able to give birth, you have God's blessing.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:15.840]   But in those days,
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.980]   in the ancient society of honor and shame,
[00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:23.880]   not being able to conceive is considered as a curse,
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.920]   is considered as a shame.
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.740]   It's a social shame.
[00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:30.320]   So you don't have the social currency of boasting,
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.740]   hey, I have son, right?
[00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:32.700]   I have a daughter.
[00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:33.720]   I have my own family.
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.600]   I have a next generation.
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:39.120]   In those days, you are considered a curse
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.520]   if you cannot have a son or daughter.
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:45.520]   And also, they are hopeless.
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.640]   Elizabeth and Zechariah as a couple,
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:52.560]   very old, hopeless.
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:57.560]   So you have no hope of bearing another son
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.600]   because the day is coming, you're counting down,
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.840]   you're very, very old.
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:05.120]   So when Luke talks about the first Christmas,
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:10.020]   he introduces us to the first main characters,
[00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:16.200]   Elizabeth and Zechariah, under curse, hopeless, very old.
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.520]   Now, let's fast forward.
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:21.040]   Chapter one, the rest of the chapter one
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:25.200]   talking about the birth of John the Baptist.
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:29.860]   And then chapter two, we'll talk about the birth of Jesus,
[00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:32.280]   the real story of Christmas.
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.200]   Chapter two, verse one.
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.800]   At that time, the Roman emperor Augustus
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:42.800]   decreed that a census should be taken throughout the empire.
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.440]   This was the first census taken
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:48.680]   when Quirinius was the governor of Syria
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:52.440]   and all the people returned to their own ancestral towns
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.520]   to register for this census.
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:59.440]   So that's why we have the story, Mary and Joseph,
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.840]   they probably got a donkey.
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:03.000]   I guess they didn't.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.200]   They didn't have enough money to rent a car or something.
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:09.720]   So they travel all the way from the north, Nazareth,
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.360]   where they are, and then all the way down to the south,
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:14.840]   to the central hill country, south of Jerusalem,
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:17.640]   to Bethlehem, go back to their hometown.
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:21.160]   And then the story goes, as you can imagine,
[00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.120]   they went back to their hometown
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.840]   in order to register for this Roman census.
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.320]   They couldn't find an Airbnb,
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:30.200]   so they end up in a barn or something.
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:33.260]   They end up in a fairly humble place.
[00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.380]   That's how the story goes.
[00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:41.160]   Now, notice when I read Luke 1, 5,
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:45.400]   the introduction of the Christmas story, John the Baptist,
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.760]   and then chapter two right here,
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:50.880]   talking about the birth of Jesus, the first Christmas,
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.720]   how many characters are being introduced?
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:59.480]   Or maybe I should ask, how many powerful characters
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:02.020]   are being introduced in those days?
[00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:06.460]   Chapter one, five, Herod the Great, right?
[00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:07.600]   Herod the Great.
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:10.320]   He was a mighty great king.
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:14.480]   He ruled the land of Palestine and Israel in those days.
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:15.960]   He has so much power.
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.880]   Actually, he had the absolute power in the region,
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:22.080]   in the eastern frontier of the empire.
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:25.600]   Here, chapter two, and other two powerful characters
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.240]   are being introduced.
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.080]   Augustus.
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:33.560]   Now, in those days, the superpower of the entire world
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:35.880]   was the Roman emperor,
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:39.320]   and Augustus was the first emperor of Roman history.
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:43.120]   And then the second character is Quirinius.
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:46.600]   Quirinius is the prophet of Syria,
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.340]   which include Israel and Palestine,
[00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:54.400]   the governor of Syria, and Quirinius is the commander.
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.800]   He's the governor of the entire province.
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.520]   Now, as you can tell,
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:01.920]   the three powerful characters in those days,
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:06.320]   absolute power, super powerful figures,
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:09.280]   are being introduced in the first Christmas story,
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:11.160]   according to the Gospel of Luke.
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:17.640]   Herod the Great, Quirinius, and then Augustus.
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:20.960]   Now, think about it.
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:23.160]   Now, if you walk into a bookstore, okay,
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:26.880]   I know bookstore is fading away, okay?
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:30.000]   Let's imagine you go to a library or go to a bookstore.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.800]   You go to the biography section,
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:33.700]   biography section.
[00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:37.480]   What kind of biographies you will find?
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:40.200]   Or what kind of biographies will be the best sellers?
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.680]   Has to be a famous figure, right?
[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:48.040]   Not too long ago, I was in the library.
[00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:53.040]   I bumped into a book written by Hillary Clinton.
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:56.360]   Biography of hers.
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:59.680]   She's famous, right?
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:00.740]   Or she's powerful.
[00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:06.300]   So these kind of biographies will be the best sellers.
[00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:11.240]   In Jesus' day, it was the same way.
[00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:14.900]   The powerful characters, the powerful people
[00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:18.560]   who have influence in their own world
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.280]   or in the lives of many other people,
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:23.200]   they have their own biographies.
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:24.740]   Sometimes they have inscriptions.
[00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:28.240]   Sometimes they have some public billboard
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:31.840]   to talk about their good deeds, to talk about their birth.
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:36.840]   For example, Augustus, he was born on a certain day,
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:41.440]   and that certain day becomes a special holiday
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:45.420]   for the entire empire, for all the people.
[00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:47.420]   And when Augustus was born,
[00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:50.940]   when people talk about his biographical information,
[00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:54.340]   Augustus was being called the son of gods,
[00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.380]   the savior of the world.
[00:15:56.380 --> 00:16:00.820]   He bring peace, the Roman peace, the Pax Romana,
[00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:05.220]   because of the Romans, because of the Roman military might.
[00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:08.420]   You will have peace, Pax Romana, Roman peace.
[00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:12.000]   So when Augustus comes, when he was born,
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.180]   he brings the gospel.
[00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:18.180]   You know, the gospel was a political term in those days.
[00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:21.660]   The gospel meaning the news, the good news
[00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:26.640]   of the king being born, the kingdom being ushered in,
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:29.860]   being launched because of this figure.
[00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:34.860]   So because of Augustus, you have joy and peace
[00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:37.640]   and good tidings and gospels.
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:40.040]   And he is the son of gods.
[00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:43.240]   Now, these kind of powerful figures
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:46.840]   will have their own famous biographies,
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.920]   the best sellers of those days.
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:50.540]   People would read that.
[00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:54.520]   People would listen to those stories and thinking,
[00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:57.520]   geez, they really control our lives.
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:01.100]   They really are very powerful.
[00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:02.960]   But according to the gospel of Luke,
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:06.920]   when he writes about the story of Christmas,
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:12.680]   these guys, they are not occupying
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.460]   the foreground of a stage.
[00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:18.920]   They are not in the front of a stage.
[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:20.820]   They are in the background of a stage.
[00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:24.640]   These guys who can do a lot of things
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:27.100]   to control the lives of the common people,
[00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:28.960]   they are in the background.
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.360]   And who is in the foreground?
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:32.480]   The minor characters.
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:38.400]   Zechariah, Elizabeth, John the Baptist,
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:41.940]   Joseph and Mary, and Jesus.
[00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:44.880]   They should belong to the background.
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.880]   But in the gospel of Luke,
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:50.420]   they are being brought forth to front stage.
[00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:54.680]   Now let's take a look at the first Christmas story,
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:58.180]   chapter two, verse four.
[00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:02.640]   And because Joseph was a descendant of King David,
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:06.240]   he had to go to his hometown Bethlehem in Judea,
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.180]   David's ancient home.
[00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:11.400]   He traveled there from the village of Nazareth
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:13.740]   in Galilee in the north.
[00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:17.400]   He took with him Mary to whom he was engaged,
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.960]   who was now expecting a child.
[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:22.200]   And while Joseph and Mary were there,
[00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:25.240]   the time came for her baby to be born.
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:29.040]   She gave birth to her firstborn son, Jesus,
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:32.620]   wrapped him, and then put him in the manger.
[00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:36.740]   Because there was no lodging available for them.
[00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:39.600]   Now this is how the story goes, right?
[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:44.060]   As I said, they came to their hometown Bethlehem.
[00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:47.600]   They had no place to stay.
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:51.060]   Now in this short passage,
[00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:56.480]   many times it talks about census, the Roman census.
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:19:00.200]   Now it happened that we know
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:03.500]   the Roman emperor would call for census
[00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:08.300]   for the entire emperor once every 14 years.
[00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:12.620]   So about 10 to 14 years, they would call for another census.
[00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:15.920]   And the census will dictate the people
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:18.100]   to go back to their hometown.
[00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:20.140]   Maybe they're working somewhere else,
[00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:22.060]   some other town, some other cities.
[00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:26.520]   But according to the decree of the Roman emperor,
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:30.780]   they have to return to their hometown to register,
[00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:32.180]   to pay taxes.
[00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:38.400]   Kind of like, you know, once a year we have to pay tax, right?
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:43.760]   In March, the tax day, the IRS.
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:46.300]   Here, Luke is talking about the Roman IRS
[00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:50.760]   calling you to go back to your hometown to pay for taxes.
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:54.980]   But a little bit different is that when they decree you
[00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:58.560]   or they dictate you to pay the Roman taxes,
[00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:04.240]   it is heavy tax, very heavy tax.
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:09.240]   So whenever the Roman emperor called for a worldwide census,
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:15.060]   there was always unrest in the society.
[00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:19.620]   People would fight back and people would revolt,
[00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:21.060]   something like that.
[00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:24.740]   As you can imagine what kind of time they live in.
[00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:29.740]   Joseph and Mary, they rush from Nazareth
[00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:31.980]   back to their hometown, Bethlehem.
[00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:35.780]   And you see a lot of social unrest,
[00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:37.380]   just like what we see today.
[00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:38.940]   It's very unsafe to travel.
[00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:42.500]   They end up in Bethlehem.
[00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:49.060]   And verse five says, "Now expecting a child," right?
[00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:52.660]   And you can imagine how difficult it is to travel
[00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:55.060]   with a pregnant woman, right?
[00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:56.960]   And the last verse here, it says,
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:00.980]   there was no lodging available for them.
[00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:04.540]   Now, according to our modern imagination, as I told you,
[00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:07.900]   they went to Bethlehem and they couldn't find an Airbnb
[00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:10.900]   or a Motel 6, and then they end up in a barn or something.
[00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:14.500]   But if you understand the background of the story,
[00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:17.620]   most of the Palestinian houses were designed
[00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:21.120]   as a two-flat house.
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:22.540]   There were two stories.
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:27.000]   The top upper level is the guest room
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.560]   or the living room or the sleeping quarter,
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.680]   or the bedrooms, it's upstairs.
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:39.680]   And then downstairs is the manger
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:43.940]   or the kitchen or the area of productivity.
[00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:48.800]   They cook, they sew, they work on their farm stuff
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:51.760]   and crafts in the lower level,
[00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:56.580]   where you have sheep and donkeys and goats and all that.
[00:21:56.580 --> 00:22:01.320]   Now, if you can imagine, there were two stories of the house.
[00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.980]   The upper level is actually the guest room.
[00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:09.420]   Actually, that's what the gospel is telling us.
[00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:12.640]   The word being used is a special word
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:16.300]   for guest room, for the upper room.
[00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:19.340]   Remember Jesus had the last supper?
[00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:23.020]   Where did he have it with the disciples?
[00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:23.880]   The upper room.
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:27.960]   The gospel used the same word.
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:31.500]   It's the upper room that they had the last supper.
[00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:34.100]   They had the Passover meal, the last Passover meal.
[00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:37.180]   And the lower level is where the animals are.
[00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:40.780]   Now, this kind of design is very practical.
[00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:41.860]   You know why?
[00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:46.020]   Because when in the winter days or at night,
[00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:48.040]   who's keeping you warm?
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:50.620]   Now, in Chicago, it's getting really, really cold,
[00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:53.900]   getting really, really chilly here.
[00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:55.120]   We have heater, right?
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:23:01.020]   We have water heater, we have the pipe heater
[00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:03.500]   to keep us warm.
[00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:06.540]   But the Palestinian houses are designed in such a way
[00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:09.020]   as to keep warm of the people who stay
[00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:11.300]   or who sleep in the second floor.
[00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:14.060]   The first floor, who's keeping you warm?
[00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:17.260]   The donkey, the animals, right?
[00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:19.240]   Anyone who have pets here?
[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:21.000]   Dogs and cats?
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.160]   Do you sleep with them?
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:24.540]   You do, right?
[00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:25.380]   Why?
[00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:28.220]   They want to, right?
[00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:32.120]   Why, why do they want to sleep with you?
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:35.040]   Because you keep them warm, right?
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:37.320]   And that they keep you warm, all right?
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:39.160]   So that's the same way.
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:41.000]   Lower level, where the donkeys are,
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.360]   where the horses or goats or sheep,
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:48.540]   they will keep the upper level warm, right?
[00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:50.580]   Hot air rises.
[00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:55.040]   So that's how the house was designed in those days.
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:56.660]   So if with that background,
[00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:59.580]   we can actually translate the last verse here,
[00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:04.300]   because there was no room in the guest room
[00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:06.140]   available for them.
[00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:09.200]   Now, as you can imagine, the Roman IRS comes in,
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:11.900]   everyone has to go back to their hometown, right?
[00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:13.740]   And when you go back to your hometown,
[00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:14.980]   where are you gonna stay?
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:20.960]   Usually you stay with your relatives, right?
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:24.320]   Your forefathers or your family members, right?
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:25.840]   Or your distant family members.
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:27.640]   You knock on their houses and say,
[00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:28.640]   "Hey, can I stay here?"
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:29.480]   Right?
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:32.120]   Something like that.
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:35.400]   Next week, I'm traveling to California
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:38.640]   after the Christmas service here.
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:42.920]   So four of us will travel back to Northern California,
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:46.860]   where most of my in-laws are there.
[00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:51.860]   You think we would have to rent an Airbnb?
[00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:56.020]   No, no, we knock on their houses.
[00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:59.460]   And we stay with them, right?
[00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:01.660]   That's what happened with Mary and Joseph,
[00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:04.060]   because Joseph's hometown is in Bethlehem.
[00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:05.900]   So they went back to their hometown.
[00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:10.800]   So many people are being squeezed into the guest room.
[00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:16.180]   And Mary and Joseph just happened to be at the doorstep.
[00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:18.960]   They couldn't find any place on the upper level.
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:23.820]   And by all means, Mary was pregnant, right?
[00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:25.660]   It's pretty tough for a pregnant woman
[00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:28.500]   to climb to the second level anyway, right?
[00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:31.620]   So they probably stay in the first floor, right?
[00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:33.940]   So there's nothing like, "Oh, they're so poor,
[00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:36.680]   "and we pity them," right?
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:39.360]   It's actually a story of inviting
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:42.120]   and welcoming the Holy Family.
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:47.020]   This family, whoever that is, in Bethlehem,
[00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:49.980]   are actually inviting Joseph and Mary.
[00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:53.260]   I can imagine they would go to the first floor
[00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:58.220]   and try to put things together, put things in order,
[00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:02.760]   so that Joseph and Mary can stay in a warm place, right?
[00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:07.380]   To wait for doing their things, their taxes in Bethlehem.
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:09.900]   With that background,
[00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:15.100]   Gospel of Luke chapter two is actually a story
[00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:19.060]   of inviting Jesus into their home, into their house.
[00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:21.960]   Now, we started with chapter one.
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:24.000]   Now we're in chapter two.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.600]   And as you know, there are different parts
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:26.800]   of the Christmas story.
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:30.160]   The shepherd welcomed Jesus.
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:31.460]   They received the gospel.
[00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:37.120]   Zechariah, Elizabeth, they saw God is speaking.
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:39.840]   They saw God is working.
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:44.120]   The history of redemption continues.
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:47.160]   God show up again, speaks to them again.
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:51.520]   Chapter two, this family in Bethlehem
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:52.840]   welcomed Joseph and Mary,
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:55.780]   and ultimately, the birth of Jesus.
[00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:57.900]   It's a welcoming story.
[00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:00.080]   When Jesus comes,
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:03.960]   do you have room for him?
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:08.660]   Are you inviting him to come into your lives?
[00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:12.240]   Now, as I told you, chapter one and chapter two,
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:16.320]   all this superpower, all the important figures
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:18.740]   are being pushed back into the background.
[00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:23.440]   And what comes forth to the center of the stage,
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:26.960]   getting the spotlight, are the common people,
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:32.360]   the lower level, those who are ordinary,
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:36.800]   those who are being seen as unimportant people,
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:40.760]   or even shamed, being cursed.
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:43.840]   Unimportant people are taking the center stage
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.120]   in the Christmas story.
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:50.720]   Now, every year comes to the month of December,
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:51.940]   to the end of the year.
[00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:56.240]   If you notice, Time magazine
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:28:01.000]   always elect someone who is important, right?
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.280]   Someone who is important.
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.760]   To be the icon of the year,
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:07.500]   to be the person of the year, right?
[00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:09.360]   The icon of the year, this year,
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:12.000]   who is it, do you know?
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.940]   Michelle Yao.
[00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:16.640]   Michelle Yao, right?
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:17.800]   You know Michelle Yao?
[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:20.820]   Michelle Yao.
[00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:22.240]   Y-E-O-H.
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:23.880]   Yo, right, yo, or Yao, right?
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:29.840]   She has been an action figure,
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:35.040]   Asian actress, for so many years, right?
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:37.500]   How is she right now?
[00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:42.560]   60s, 60s, yeah.
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:44.920]   She's being elected icon of the year.
[00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:48.040]   And the person of the year in 2022, who is that?
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:52.920]   Zelensky, Zelensky.
[00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:57.600]   Ukrainian prime minister, right?
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:04.240]   Because of him, he keep up the spirit of the Ukrainians,
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:10.960]   you know, to fight back of the Russian invasion.
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:15.440]   Now, this kind of people are being regarded important.
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:20.840]   Now, who among of us would be qualified
[00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:24.520]   to be called Time's magazine person of the year, right here?
[00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:27.280]   Who is it?
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:30.560]   Who would have the qualification to be like that, right?
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:32.560]   Nobody, probably, right?
[00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:34.100]   Nobody.
[00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:34.940]   None of us.
[00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:38.960]   So, according to the eyes of the world,
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:40.720]   we are not important.
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:43.840]   And sometimes we feel that way.
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:49.360]   Subjectively, personally, we think that people don't care.
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:55.240]   We don't think people would care about our future.
[00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:57.060]   What are we doing?
[00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:01.620]   But in the eyes of God, according to the gospel of Luke,
[00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:04.060]   you are important.
[00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:08.280]   The ordinary people have the spotlight.
[00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:12.660]   The ordinary people, the powerless people,
[00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:16.860]   as they receive Jesus,
[00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:21.860]   they would be regarded as valuable in God's sight.
[00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:23.580]   It's valuable in God's sight.
[00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:30.040]   Some years ago, I read something about Mother Teresa.
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:32.860]   You know Mother Teresa, right?
[00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:34.860]   And she was famous, right?
[00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:37.860]   You know, she was not very famous in the beginning.
[00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:42.140]   For many years, nobody knows about her existence.
[00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:46.340]   It's only because in 1970s, I believe it's 1970s,
[00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:51.340]   when a BBC reporter went to Calcutta to interview her,
[00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:54.620]   to ask what Mother Teresa is doing
[00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:56.140]   on the streets of Calcutta.
[00:30:56.140 --> 00:31:00.560]   What she was doing is to wash the bodies
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:02.860]   of those who are dying on the streets,
[00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:06.060]   bring them home so that they can die in dignity.
[00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:09.260]   That is Mother Teresa.
[00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:12.040]   Day after day, she was doing something like that.
[00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:14.380]   So nobody knows, nobody pay attention.
[00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:19.540]   Only one day, a BBC reporter was curious
[00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:24.540]   about what she's doing, and air an interview.
[00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:27.940]   So the whole world know who Mother Teresa is.
[00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:32.100]   But for many years, she was silent.
[00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:34.640]   She was quiet, doing her work.
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:39.980]   Mother Teresa once said, and I want to quote,
[00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:43.240]   "Not all of us can do great things,
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:49.100]   "but we can all do small things with great love."
[00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:51.220]   (audience member sighs)
[00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:53.220]   Not all of us can do great things,
[00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:55.780]   but we can do small things with great love.
[00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:59.540]   You see, that's the Christmas story.
[00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:03.300]   Not all of us can do great things, right?
[00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:07.100]   Sometimes we just thought that our works are insignificant.
[00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:08.900]   Nobody pay attention.
[00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:13.480]   But we can all do small and little things with great love.
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:18.340]   Couple weeks ago, I came into the church
[00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:19.640]   during the weekdays.
[00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:23.340]   So as usual, I check out some of the mails that come in.
[00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:27.780]   So I open some of the envelopes.
[00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:29.880]   Some of them are junk mails, right?
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:31.680]   But I receive a card.
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:36.540]   And then I notice, where is it from?
[00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:38.280]   It's from our state.
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:40.380]   It's not from Illinois, it's from other state
[00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:41.940]   of the country.
[00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:48.100]   So I was curious, who would write a card
[00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:50.280]   to us, right?
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:53.500]   So I open the envelope.
[00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:55.300]   There was a card in there.
[00:32:55.300 --> 00:33:00.300]   There was a small offering being made to our church.
[00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:04.180]   And I read the content of the card.
[00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:10.260]   It's addressed to the Yuvi family, to our church.
[00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:16.220]   It's written from a very old couple, very old parents.
[00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:22.220]   And they wrote to us and thanked our church
[00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:28.060]   for reaching out to one of his children.
[00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:35.420]   Because they have been praying for the children
[00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:38.380]   for a long time, adult children.
[00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:42.660]   Praying for them for a long, long time, for many years.
[00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:46.860]   And because of our ministry, we received this family
[00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:50.940]   into Christ.
[00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:55.900]   And I read that card, I read the message.
[00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:59.260]   I finally realized, this is what our church
[00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:02.260]   should be doing, right?
[00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:05.940]   This is what we are here.
[00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:07.580]   That's why we are here.
[00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:09.980]   That's the purpose of our existence.
[00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:12.580]   We're here, it's not because to please ourselves,
[00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:16.180]   but as instrument of the grace of God.
[00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:20.500]   We can receive someone who has been lost for a long time
[00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:23.100]   into, back to the family of God.
[00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:26.740]   And in fact, this is the spirit of Christmas.
[00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:29.900]   Now in this Christmas, as we end,
[00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:33.260]   I want you to ask yourself, what can you do?
[00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:38.860]   What small things can you do with great love?
[00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:44.660]   Perhaps visiting someone, or attending to someone
[00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:45.580]   who is lonely.
[00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:51.100]   Now ask about someone who has been forgotten.
[00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:53.500]   Who's gonna do that?
[00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:56.140]   You are going to do it.
[00:34:56.140 --> 00:35:00.780]   Small and little things with great love, right?
[00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:06.100]   But the ultimate question is,
[00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:08.780]   do we have room for that great love?
[00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:13.940]   Jesus Christ himself came into your world.
[00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:17.820]   Open your home, open your lives,
[00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:20.020]   open your heart to receive it.
[00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:24.060]   Because without Jesus in our lives,
[00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:27.740]   we would not be able to do small things with great love
[00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:28.860]   in the kingdom of God.
[00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:33.180]   So think about some of the people you can reach out to
[00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:35.540]   in this season.
[00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:38.060]   Think about it, all right?
[00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:40.780]   Pray for them and do something.
[00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:45.540]   Doesn't have to be great things, small things,
[00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:46.700]   but with great love.
[00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:47.980]   That's the closing prayer.
[00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:52.980]   Father, we give you thanks because you see us as important.
[00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:54.980]   Father God, we give you thanks
[00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:58.460]   because we are valuable in your sight.
[00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:01.780]   And I pray that in this season,
[00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:06.780]   as we celebrate the birth of Jesus, our Lord, our Savior,
[00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:09.300]   we would remember that in your sight,
[00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:14.660]   in your vision, that we can be your instruments.
[00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:18.900]   Help us to do small things, to bless other people,
[00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:24.420]   to be your instrument, to bring love and joy and peace,
[00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:28.460]   the gospel, the true gospel to our world.
[00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:34.500]   Maybe someone that we know, maybe our friends,
[00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:37.340]   maybe writing a card, you know,
[00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:40.980]   send some words of encouragement to say hello,
[00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:43.780]   to connect, to reconnect.
[00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:47.180]   I ask that you will use us as your instrument
[00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:52.860]   to bring forth your peace and your joy in this Christmas.
[00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:55.300]   In Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:59.300]   Well, God bless you and Argentina one,
[00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:01.900]   and we can have lunch, okay?
[00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:04.940]   I wanna see you next Sunday, 25th.
[00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:07.500]   We're gonna have a banquet here,
[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:10.700]   luncheon here with a special Christmas dinner.
