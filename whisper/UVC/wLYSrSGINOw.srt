1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
我地交比佢

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
大英姐妹好

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
我係準備好啦

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
啱啱有個隊友就話

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
趕唔切你呀

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
因為唔記得帶credit card

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
所以返咗去攞credit card

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
好緊要呀攞credit card

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
最緊要有護照同埋credit card

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
仲有credit card credit limit要幾萬蚊

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
咁就ok啦

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
一定會返到黎嘅

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
首先多謝大英姐妹

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
同埋特別教育同工

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
有個好嘅配搭

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
以致我就能夠帶大英姐妹去Israel

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
咁我地帶佢幾多個UV呀

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
十個係咪呀

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
十七個係世界各地唔同地方去

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
咁已經有一啲團友已經到咗啦

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
安全到咗所以佢地報咗平安

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
咁我想多謝教會同埋同工嘅配搭

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
就係我地能夠去祝福到其他人

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
大家知道我唔係做呢行㗎

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
我唔收小費嘅

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
我唔收小費我去到目的

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
希望大家充充份份有一個

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
豐盛嘅一個旅程

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
That's my purpose

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
我嘅job就係做呢樣嘢

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
咁我唔介意去流多少少汗嘅

32
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
咁但係我就唔係做呢行食飯

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
我唔係靠呢行食飯嘅

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
咁但係可以有一啲資源同人地去分享

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
呢個係一件樂事

36
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
我地教會能夠祝福更多嘅人

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
咁今日我地睇一個主題

38
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
咁就係敬拜

39
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
上個禮拜我地睇多咗一啲敬拜嘅經文

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
同敬拜有關嘅題目

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
記得Brenda黎咗

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
咁我地就開始黎到講一講敬拜

43
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
乜嘢叫做worship

44
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
你入到嚟教會

45
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
你呢個主日崇拜

46
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
到底一回咩事

47
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
我地值得去思考一下

48
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
呢個係我地基督徒應有嘅習慣

49
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
一個正常基督徒應有嘅習慣

50
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
每個主日我地去崇拜

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
咁到底崇拜係一回咩事呢

52
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
詩篇第95篇

53
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
我覺得呢篇詩篇係眾多嘅敬拜嘅詩歌

54
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
你知詩篇裏面有150首嘅歌

55
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
呢啲都係以色列人舊約嘅時候

56
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
神嘅子民用嚟去敬拜

57
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
其中一首講到敬拜呢

58
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
就係95篇

59
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
我哋先讀

60
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
來呀我哋要向耶和華歌唱

61
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
向拯救我哋嘅盆石歡呼

62
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
我哋要以感謝來到佢面前

63
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
用詩歌向佢歡呼

64
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
因耶和華是偉大嘅上帝

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
是超越萬神嘅大君王

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
地的深處在佢手中

67
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
山的高峰也屬佢

68
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
海洋屬佢

69
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
是佢造的

70
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
罕地也是佢手造成的

71
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
來呀我哋要

72
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
俯伏敬拜

73
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
在做我哋嘅耶和華面前

74
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
跪拜

75
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
因為佢係我哋嘅上帝

76
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
我哋係佢草場嘅百姓

77
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
係佢手中的羊

78
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
惟願你哋今天聽佢嘅話

79
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
你哋不可硬著心

80
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
像在米利巴

81
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
就在曠野馬殺的日子

82
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
那時你哋的祖宗

83
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
視我探我

84
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
並且觀看我的作為

85
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
四十年之久

86
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
我厭煩那世世代說

87
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
這時心裡模糊的百姓

88
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
竟不知道我的道路

89
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
所以我在路中起誓

90
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
他們斷不可進入我的安城

91
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
呢篇詩篇有啲古怪

92
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
如果你揀一首歌

93
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
去到敬拜去唱

94
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
好似頭先幾首歌去敬拜

95
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
去到唱出讚美詩詞

96
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
通常都係end with

97
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
結束的時候都係比較正面少少

98
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
呢首詩歌就去到呢度

99
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
就冇了

100
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
你唔好返去搵12節13節

101
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
就呢度完

102
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
有啲古怪

103
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
我哋就睇下呢篇詩篇

104
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
就俾我哋聽敬拜係一回咩事

105
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
今日嚟到教會坐喺度

106
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
我哋大家喺度敬拜

107
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
係到底一回咩事

108
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
第一個問題想問大家嘅今日嚟呢度嘅時候

109
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
你做咗咩準備功夫呀

110
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
有咩準備功夫你做咗呀

111
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
食早餐係咪

112
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
飲咖啡呀等等

113
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
到底有咩準備功夫我哋要做

114
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
我覺得我哋一個現代嘅世代

115
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
教會 基督徒

116
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
我覺得呢個敬拜呢回事

117
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
好多時係一個lost art

118
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
一個已經失去咗嘅藝術

119
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
我哋彷似呢嚟到主日崇拜嘅時候

120
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
我哋好似係冇咩準備

121
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
你都可以講有啲嘢準備

122
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
但通常我哋講緊準備嘅嘢都係

123
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
人哋做俾我哋嘅

124
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
係咪

125
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
有冇早餐呀 有冇咖啡呀

126
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
邊個煲呀

127
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
嗰啲早到嗰啲人煲係咪

128
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
我嚟到我expect有啲咩

129
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
就有杯熱咖啡

130
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
冇理由呢度凍冰冰嘅隔夜咖啡係咪

131
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
下次你唔會嚟啦係咪

132
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
仲有啲咩要準備

133
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
嗰啲敬拜隊呀

134
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
音樂呀

135
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
上嚟做嘢嗰啲人呀

136
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
或者後面後台要做嘢嗰啲人呀

137
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
全部所有嘅preparation都係佢哋做嘅

138
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
powerpoint出得啱唔啱呀

139
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
等等呀 有冇打錯呀

140
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
有啲乜嘢我哋需要準備

141
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
還是我哋嚟到敬拜嘅時候

142
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
我哋只會覺得人哋需要準備

143
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
我哋唔需要準備

144
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
你知唔知古代嗰啲建築呀

145
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
去一啲聖堂或者去一啲聖殿呀

146
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
或者教堂呀

147
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
嗰啲嘅樓級呀

148
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
係好多時一長一短一長一短

149
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
我哋叫佢做processional steps

150
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
點解

151
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
係咪特登整到你撲親咁呀

152
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
係咪裝你呀

153
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
唔係呀就係要人

154
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
去聖殿或者去敬拜嘅時候

155
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
佢要小心每一步

156
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
係減慢佢速度

157
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
係一個preparation嚟㗎

158
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
佢slow down

159
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
你去到上帝面前嘅時候

160
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
你去敬拜嘅時候

161
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
唔係一啲等閒事

162
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
因為you are approaching a sacred space

163
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
啱呀

164
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
呢啲可能都係lost art

165
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
我哋去以色列之前就有啲嘢準備

166
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
裝束問題

167
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
因為去某啲地方

168
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
係唔能夠露咁多肉㗎

169
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
各位女士

170
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
現代教會ok

171
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
我哋都算係唔係ok

172
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
當然唔好太少

173
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
即係大家都好規矩

174
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
即係費事有啲分心嘅情況出現

175
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
咁所以係囉

176
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
係咪

177
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
姐妹講㗎

178
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
唔係男人講

179
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
我哋就講裝束

180
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
因為去到某啲地方你係唔能夠著短褲

181
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
你唔能夠著背心

182
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
男人都唔得㗎

183
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
去到某啲地方

184
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
你就要帶埋頂帽

185
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
但係去某啲地方就要除頂帽

186
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
好奇怪

187
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
上幾個月去一個基督教教堂

188
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
因為我要拍嘢

189
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
好辛苦我做嘢

190
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
仲要做埋義工

191
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
自己拍埋嘢自己錄埋嘢

192
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
去到嗰個教堂

193
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
跟住嗰個看更

194
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
嗰個修士

195
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
一嘢打到我頭嗰度

196
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
除帽

197
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
基督教教堂就要除帽

198
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
但係去猶太人嘅會堂就要帶帽

199
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
咁咩極煩呀

200
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
啱啱先去完猶太人嘅會堂

201
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
咁就帶住頂帽

202
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
或者嗰啲keeper

203
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
跟住去嗰啲基督教嘅古教堂

204
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
跟住你又要除低頂帽

205
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
係有啲嘢要prepare

206
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
有冇諗過聖經裏面都有講

207
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
你敬拜嘅時候

208
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
係需要有啲preparation要做

209
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
你記得耶穌

210
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
登山補佛

211
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
佢話你哋去獻祭嘅時候

212
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
當時仲有聖殿去獻祭

213
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
獻祭之前你要做咩

214
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
要同嗰個同你有拗叫嘅論者

215
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
盡可能你都去和好

216
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
你去和好

217
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
你去和好

218
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
你唔可能你都去和好

219
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
係咪

220
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
大家和解咗你先至好去獻祭

221
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
即係搞掂咗

222
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
你嘅關係先

223
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
你先至可以approach上帝

224
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
當然我哋知道世界唔完美

225
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
有啲人

226
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
有啲情況有啲處境唔能夠

227
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
但係個精神你知道嗎

228
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
個精神嗰個spirit

229
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
就係我哋需要有preparation

230
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
relational嘅preparation

231
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
physical嘅preparation

232
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
等等

233
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
盡可能嘅我哋同人哋和解

234
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
盡可能起碼我釋懷咗

235
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
我哋到上帝面前

236
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
呢啲都係我哋需要有嘅準備

237
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
咩叫做敬拜

238
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
詩篇95篇

239
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
分開兩半

240
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
頭一半頭七節

241
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
跟住嗰半就係七節到

242
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
七節下半節

243
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
至到十一節

244
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
係一啲好典型嘅

245
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
敬拜嘅詩歌

246
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
點解話典型

247
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
因為你睇詩歌嘅時候

248
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
通常呢啲敬拜詩歌

249
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
佢都會有一個所謂叫做宣召

250
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
一個call to worship

251
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
一個叫醒你

252
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
一個提醒你

253
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
係時候啦我哋要去敬拜

254
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
你睇下呢度第一節第二節第三節

255
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
佢話

256
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
來呀我哋要向耶和華

257
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
歌唱

258
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
要向拯救我哋嘅盆石

259
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
歡呼

260
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
要以感謝

261
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
來到他面前

262
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
要以詩歌向他

263
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
歡呼

264
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
你諗唔諗到呢段頭一半

265
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
有啲咩動詞

266
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
唱歌歡呼

267
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
讚頌

268
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
singing shouting

269
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
呢啲全部都係要energy嘅嘢嚟

270
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
換句話講

271
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
嚟到神面前唔係一個被動嘅

272
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
情況

273
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
一個主動

274
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
嘅參與係咪

275
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
call to worship

276
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
好多時都話畀我哋聽

277
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
the reasons

278
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
乜嘢原因要去敬拜

279
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
點解要去敬拜

280
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
搞清楚乜嘢叫做

281
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
敬拜搞清楚乜嘢叫做

282
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
原因點解要敬拜

283
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
三四五節

284
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
因為

285
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
你見唔見到嗰個字因為

286
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
因為

287
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
因為耶和華

288
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
係最大嘅神

289
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
耶和華係唯一嘅神

290
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
地嘅深處

291
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
喺佢手中 山嘅高峰

292
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
也屬佢 你見到寫得好靚

293
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
地嘅深處

294
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
山嘅最高峰

295
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
由最低去到最高

296
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
然之後

297
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
海洋 旱地

298
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
中間

299
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
都係佢手所做

300
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
整個世界 整個宇宙

301
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
都係佢所做

302
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
你睇頭一半

303
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
你諗起咩經文

304
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
創世紀第一章

305
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
創世紀第一章

306
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
創世紀要講咩神學

307
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
就係上帝創立

308
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
所有嘢

309
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
你見到呢個世間 呢個宇宙

310
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
仍然係有規律嘅

311
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
仍然係有規則嘅

312
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
有設計嘅 邊個去創立

313
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
邊個去design 係上帝自己

314
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
特別講到海

315
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
頭先講到地嘅深處

316
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
山嘅高峰

317
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
海

318
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
海對當時

319
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
古代嘅人嚟講

320
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
或者甚至今日

321
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
都係一啲唔能夠戰勝嘅嘢

322
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
唔能夠control嘅嘢

323
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
untainable

324
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
冇得去conquer佢嘅

325
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
因為海就係咁

326
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
海洋 正如我哋今日所講

327
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
稀山磨稀水

328
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
前兩日我睇一個新聞

329
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
佢講到鐵達利號

330
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
鐵達利號 幾時沉

331
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
記得 鐵達利號

332
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
1912年嘅時候

333
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
鐵達利號

334
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
我哋今日現代嘅人

335
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
諗返啲鐵達利號

336
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
呢個所謂unsinkable boat

337
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
unsinkable ship

338
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
我哋都好fascinated

339
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
一艘好大好大嘅

340
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
郵輪

341
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
喺海洋嗰處去沉咗

342
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
然之後拍埋電影出嚟

343
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
等等

344
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
有好多好浪漫嘅故事

345
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
前兩日睇一個新聞

346
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
講到有一個

347
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
深海嘅研究

348
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
嘅公司

349
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
深海研究公司

350
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
佢哋就去到終於做咗第一個

351
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
鐵達利號沉船

352
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
海底嘅掃描

353
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
3D scan

354
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
咁就係用咗

355
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
70萬張嘅圖畫

356
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
scan出嚟嘅圖畫

357
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
然之後再組合出嚟

358
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
用電腦用咗200個小時

359
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
先能夠砌返呢一個

360
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
嘅鐵達利號嘅

361
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
即係殘骸

362
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
你諗下幾咁

363
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
難去到做嘅一件事

364
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
1912年

365
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
沉過呢個船

366
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
成100年有多

367
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
我哋而家先至可以點呀

368
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
用科技將佢

369
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
唔係打撈出嚟添

370
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
將佢scan咗佢

371
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
大家知唔知呀

372
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
你見到呢啲咁嘅image

373
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
係好hunting嘅image

374
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
即係好

375
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
深寒嘅

376
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
一啲嘅圖畫

377
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
同呢個好唔同呀

378
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Jack and Rose

00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
到今日我哋都覺得海洋

380
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
係唔能夠

381
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
tameable

382
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
欺山磨欺水

383
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
但係呢啲嘢係上帝

384
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
嘅control

385
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
你諗下我哋心靈裏面有啲乜嘢

386
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
係untameable

387
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
最近我去咗幾個喪禮

388
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
有後生嘅

389
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
有年長嘅

390
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
你話咪有啲untameable

391
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
嘅威脅

392
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
一啲嘅勢力

393
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
係影響住你同我

394
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
但係上帝

395
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
係最大嘅上帝

396
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
佢有權能

397
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
包括控制埋呢啲嘅

398
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
勢力

399
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
呢度就講到

400
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
點解要去敬拜

401
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
因為講到上帝嘅權能

402
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
佢係創造主

403
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
當然我哋好多時

404
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
諗到創造主好大力

405
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
好多能力呀等等

406
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
我哋總會覺得呢個神

407
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
佢係一個上帝

408
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
係一啲同我哋距離好遠嘅嘢

409
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
可能好耐之前

410
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
佢曾經創立咗呢個世界

411
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
跟住佢就係absentee father

412
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
即係佢就唔再

413
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
同我哋一齊

414
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
唔再喺度同我哋冇乜關係

415
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
可能我哋都會咁諗

416
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
或者呢個culture要我哋咁諗

417
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
但係呢篇詩篇講咩

418
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
佢話唔係喎

419
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
你唔好忘記

420
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
第六節講咩

421
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
佢話來呀

422
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
我哋要俯伏敬拜

423
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
做我哋嘅夜幻面前

424
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
跪拜

425
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
因為又因為

426
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
因為他是我哋的上帝

427
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
我哋是他

428
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
草場上面嘅百姓

429
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
是他手中的羊

430
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
你留意呢度

431
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
佢越嚟越

432
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
第一節嘅時候佢咪話

433
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
你呀我哋要去敬拜

434
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
要去歡呼要去到歌場

435
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
然後慢慢慢慢好似呢個動詞

436
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
越嚟越靜落嚟

437
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
靜到乜嘢地步呢靜到跪拜

438
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
跪喺船

439
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
You bow down

440
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
靜止

441
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
認識到上帝嘅偉大嘅時候

442
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
我哋就喺佢面前去靜止

443
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
第七節

444
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
佢話神係我哋嘅目者

445
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
我哋

446
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
係佢嘅羊

447
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
我哋係佢嘅子民

448
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
我哋又係現代人

449
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
我哋睇唔明呢啲嘢

450
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
我哋諗起羊嘅時候

451
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
諗起支竹羊腩煲

452
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
即係死咗嘅嘢

453
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
我哋好少見到生嘅羊

454
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
生嘅狗呀貓

455
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
我哋成日見

456
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
但生嘅羊我哋好少見

457
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
以色列揸車經過

458
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
羊呀羊呀好似全世未見過羊

459
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
因為我哋太少見

460
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
我都諗起羊同埋目者

461
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
係乜嘢

462
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
係一種好親密嘅關係

463
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
好似你養嘅狗同埋貓

464
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
佢識認你

465
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
佢就唔認其他人

466
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
十幾二十年前

467
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
有一單新聞

468
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
喺巴勒斯坦地發生

469
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
就係以色列軍隊

470
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
就走去一個巴勒斯坦嘅村落

471
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
咁就去到

472
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
即係攻佔咗佢

473
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
攞晒裏面嘅嘢

474
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
其中就攞咗幾百隻羊

475
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
咁就嗰啲軍隊就趕晒啲羊

476
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
走咗去一個羊欄

477
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
喺個ranch 裏面

478
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
咁有一個巴勒斯坦嘅牧羊

479
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
牧羊人

480
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
佢返到嚟唔見晒啲羊

481
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
佢有二十幾隻羊

482
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
唔見咗

483
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
咁佢就走去嗰個羊欄嗰度同嗰個

484
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
以色列嘅士兵講

485
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
士兵就守住嗰個羊欄

486
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
嗰度有幾百隻羊

487
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
嗰個牧羊人就同佢講

488
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
可唔可以攞返我啲羊

489
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
咁嗰個年青嘅

490
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
以色列士兵就同呢個老人家講

491
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
佢話

492
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
你有本事你就攞返你嗰二十幾隻

493
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
呢度成堆羊 隻隻都係羊

494
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
咁嗰個牧羊人就話

495
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
你等我試下

496
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
佢就企喺羊欄嘅門口

497
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
佢就喺度講一啲好簡單嘅說話

498
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
come come come 咁晒下

499
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
然之後幾分鐘之後

500
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
屬於佢嗰二十幾隻羊

501
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
就走到佢面前

502
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
其他羊就唔理佢

503
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
好奇怪

504
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
耶穌講咩

505
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
羊係聽牧羊人嘅聲音

506
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
佢真係認到

507
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
個主人牧羊人

508
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
嗰把聲

509
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
我哋是他

510
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
草場上嘅羊

511
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
係他手所做嘅

512
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
草場上面嘅百姓

513
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
係佢手中嘅羊

514
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
係要聽佢嘅聲音

515
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
聽到上帝嘅聲音

516
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
並且肯聽上帝嘅聲音

517
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
所以點解呢

518
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
第七節開始佢就講聲音

519
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
邊個嘅聲音

520
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
你睇下

521
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
唯願我哋今天

522
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
聽他的話

523
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
你唔不可硬著心

524
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
像在米利巴

525
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
就是在曠野馬殺的日子

526
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
那時你們祖宗視我探我

527
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
並且觀看我的作為

528
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
四十年之久

529
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
四十年之久

530
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
我厭煩那世代

531
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
這時心裡模糊的百姓

532
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
竟不知道我的道路

533
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
所以我在路中起誓

534
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
他們斷不可進入

535
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
我的安城

536
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
我頭先開頭嘅時候講

537
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
話呢篇詩篇係一篇好奇怪嘅詩篇

538
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
係咪

539
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
就係咁樣完

540
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
就正係咁樣完

541
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
開始就係歡呼

542
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
我好似開過Party咁

543
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
你閉嘴

544
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
你冷靜下

545
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
你聽

546
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
聽

547
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
係一個警告

548
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
好嚴肅嘅教訓

549
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
好多時我哋睇詩歌

550
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
我哋都唔覺得詩歌係

551
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
所謂的教育機構

552
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
好多時我哋覺得詩歌唔係一啲

553
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
教導我哋嘅媒體

554
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
因為詩歌有幾長

555
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
一首詩歌大概

556
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
都係三至四分鐘

557
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
五分鐘

558
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
一首比較長嘅詩歌

559
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
我哋好多時覺得詩歌咁短

560
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
係冇咩教導嘅功能

561
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
諗起詩歌

562
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
我哋諗起都係抒情嘅嘢

563
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
我唔記得我年輕嘅時候

564
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
都老

565
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
有啲後生嘅都唔知道有啲咁嘢

566
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
以前年輕嘅時候

567
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
我哋揸車係用cassette帶

568
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
有用過

569
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
有用過

570
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
我哋年輕嘅時候

571
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
我哋鍾意嗰首歌

572
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
我哋就dub咗佢

573
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
成個鐘都係唱嗰首歌

574
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
因為我哋唔想翻帶

575
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
翻帶好煩

576
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
鍾意嗰首歌

577
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
點解呢?因為想聽返

578
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
諗起詩歌

579
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
當然唔會諗起啲好複雜嘅

580
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
lecture或者課程

581
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
但詩歌係一個好重要嘅

582
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
教導工具

583
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
所以點解有150首詩歌

584
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
並且裏面有好多詩歌

585
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
都係要去到

586
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
做一啲teaching

587
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
呢一首就係

588
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
講到話神嘅子民

589
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
同上帝嘅關係

590
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
就講到咩馬殺的日子

591
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
米利巴

592
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
點都好佢講咩嘢

593
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
講緊以色列人出咗埃及之後

594
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
上帝帶領住佢哋

595
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
藉住摩西帶領住佢哋

596
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
佢哋就去

597
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
厭煩上帝

598
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
點解唔畀水我

599
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
點解唔畀嘢食畀我

600
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
跟住入到去

601
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
加冚地

602
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
去窺探嗰個地嘅時候

603
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
又返返嚟又話唔可以入去

604
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
所以上帝就喺

605
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
曠野嘅時候佢就話

606
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
好 你哋唔聽我講

607
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
你唔想入我嘅安息

608
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
佢就話好 你就喺曠野

609
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
40年

610
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
第一代出埃及

611
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
就喺曠野

612
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
就流離咗40年

613
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
點解會睇呢樣嘢

614
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
因為呢個係

615
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
一個最典型嘅

616
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
喺舊約整本聖經嘅故事裏面

617
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
講到叛逆

618
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
講到硬著心腸嘅

619
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
一個故事

620
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
你諗起咩叫做硬著心腸

621
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
猶太人

622
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
猶太人係硬著心腸

623
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
硬頸嘅

624
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
你就諗起呢啲咁嘅故事

625
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
馬殺的日子 即係試探嘅日子

626
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
等等

627
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
所以呢首詩歌完結嘅時候

628
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
佢話乜嘢 上帝話你哋

629
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
唔能夠進入

630
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
我應許之地

631
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
因為你唔聽我

632
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
說話

633
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
你可能會

634
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
睇完呢篇詩篇

635
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
你會有個結論

636
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
呢個上帝真係好鬼死惡

637
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
惡死到不得了

638
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
如果你睇完聖經

639
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
或者睇完舊約

640
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
你會覺得呢個上帝

641
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
淨係無故去發脾氣

642
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
無故去發嬲嘅 去激打人嘅

643
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
咁可能我哋睇錯

644
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
因為你如果睇聖經

645
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
你淨係睇到嗰啲嘢

646
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
會唔會有啲

647
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
選擇性閱讀

648
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
其實睇返整本嘅舊約

649
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
整本新舊約都好

650
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
你睇到一個好patient嘅上帝

651
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
一個好有忍耐

652
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
好有寬容 其實係一個好有愛嘅上帝

653
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
詩篇95篇都係一樣

654
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
係 縱使我哋

655
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
嚟到敬拜嘅時候

656
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
我哋需要一個warning

657
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
一個嚴肅嘅

658
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
責備

659
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
我覺得咁樣先係一個好嘅敬拜

660
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
我見到上帝 遇見上帝

661
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
然後畀佢可能當頭棒喝也好

662
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
或者好嚴肅嘅啲提醒

663
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
咁樣先至係一種真正同上帝嘅遇上

664
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:09,000
真正同上帝遇上未必一定係好溫馨

665
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
好舒服

666
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
好多時係當頭棒喝

667
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:19,000
E3篇詩篇就係咁樣完結

668
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
我哋嘅Attention

669
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
我哋嘅焦點

670
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
唔好放喺任何嘢身上

671
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
放喺上帝自己身上

672
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:33,000
一個英國嘅文學家

673
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
我覺得佢講嘢好有趣

674
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:41,000
有幾個著作

675
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
佢講到敬拜

676
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
一個真正嘅敬拜

677
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
一個同上帝

678
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
創造天地嘅主

679
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
愛你嘅上帝係你嘅牧羊人嘅上帝

680
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
去到相遇一個敬拜

681
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
真正嘅敬拜

682
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
True worship 係點樣

683
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
True worship 好似一對好嘅鞋

684
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
一對好嘅鞋

685
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
咩意思

686
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
佢話一對好嘅鞋

687
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
係你唔會留意到

688
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
你唔會留意你著緊一對好嘅鞋

689
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
唔會喺你嘅對鞋上面

690
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
True worship 係咁

691
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
好似一對好嘅鞋

692
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
正如好似一個好嘅閱讀一樣

693
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
你唔會留意眼鏡啱唔啱

694
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
有冇老花等等

695
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
夠唔夠光

696
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
你係進入閱讀裏面

697
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
就好似你著住對鞋

698
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
進入一個步行嘅功能

699
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
佢係一個perfect church worship

700
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
完美嘅敬拜

701
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
係一個敬拜過咗之後

702
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
unaware

703
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
唔會驚異到

704
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
唔會留意到

705
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
不知不覺地就到過

706
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
因為

707
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
你嘅焦點

708
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
係喺上帝身上

709
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
你唔會留意到底首歌唱得好唔好

710
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
你唔會留意嗰啲傢俬啱唔啱

711
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
燈光好唔好

712
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
因為你全神貫注嘅

713
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
就係上帝

714
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
好似一對好嘅鞋

715
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
結束嘅時候

716
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
畀我哋一啲提醒好嗎

717
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
咩叫敬拜

718
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
諗一諗點樣預備

719
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
你嘅敬拜

720
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
去同上帝

721
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
面對面啲度相聯

722
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
詩篇九十五篇

723
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
寫畀每一個

724
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
人嘅子民

725
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
唔係嗰啲美人呀

726
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
或者嗰啲聖職嘅人員

727
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
寫畀每一個神嘅子民

728
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
點樣讓我哋嘅敬拜

729
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
能夠更加不知不覺地

730
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
係到過

731
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
因為你嘅專注

732
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
全部放喺上帝

733
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
自己身上

734
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
預備下我哋嘅心靈

735
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
以色列人同上帝

736
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
係一代裏面嘅關係

737
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
四十年

738
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
唔係話因為佢哋大奸大惡

739
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
你留意到佢哋

740
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
冇咩大奸大惡

741
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
冇犯過咩crime

742
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
但佢哋

743
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
最horrible嘅嘢係乜嘢

744
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
唔係做咗啲

745
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
咩刑事嘅事

746
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
而係佢哋心硬

747
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
你知心硬就無得救

748
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
唔肯去聽

749
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
唔肯去到return

750
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
最好嘅預備

751
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
嚟到敬拜 嚟到神面前

752
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
甚至你每一日

753
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
你返開聖經嘅時候

754
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
同上帝建立關係嘅時候

755
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
最好預備就係

756
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
你先嚟到上帝面前 我謙卑度過

757
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
你知我係會心硬

758
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000

嗰個程度就好煩

762
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
就係上帝話厭煩嗰個世代

763
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
就係佢偏唔聽
