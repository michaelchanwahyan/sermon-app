1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,780
 - All right, thanks Kelly.

2
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:03,560
 I know some of you cannot be here

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,760
 and some of you are online being with us

4
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,520
 because they got sick and we wanna pray for them.

5
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:13,040
 And some of those in our community also out of town,

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,840
 they went back home and visit their own country

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,420
 and they will be back, all right?

8
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,700
 So let's pray.

9
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,360
 Father, give thanks for giving us this community,

10
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,280
 this spiritual family.

11
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,600
 We can study your word and we can worship you together.

12
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,320
 And we pray for those who are not with us today.

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,400
 Maybe they are sick,

14
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:36,400
 maybe they're going to their home country for visitation

15
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,120
 and I pray for safety, I pray for healing.

16
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,160
 And especially those of us who are struggling

17
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,480
 with our own personal challenges,

18
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,880
 remind us God, remind us that you are our great God

19
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,640
 and you are greater than all the issues

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,360
 and all the problems and challenges that we are facing.

21
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,800
 So we come before you and to get to know you,

22
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,200
 come before you to worship you and exalt your name

23
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,520
 because we know that you are a great God

24
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,280
 and we can trust in you.

25
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,600
 And increase our faith, increase our love for the community

26
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,800
 that we can grow your church together.

27
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,440
 We can glorify your name together in Christ name pray.

28
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,920
 Well, as you can see on the screen,

29
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,080
 I'm going to start a new sermon series.

30
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,000
 This series is on the TV series,

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,960
 very successful, very popular these days.

32
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,400
 It's been popular for a while, "The Chosen."

33
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,600
 How many of you have been watching "Chosen"?

34
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,320
 None of you?

35
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,920
 Only two, oh my God.

36
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,600
 Well, you have to watch it because for a long while,

37
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,000
 I resist to watch it because I just didn't have time, right?

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 But in the past few weeks,

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 my daughter finally convinced me to watch episode two.

40
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,760
 And I was kind of trying to entertain her desire

41
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,560
 and sit down and watch with her.

42
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,560
 And watching like a few episodes and I just love it

43
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:05,320
 because the scenes that they take

44
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,400
 and the storylines that they create,

45
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,240
 although it's not straightly biblical storyline,

46
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,720
 but of course they add some poetic license

47
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,640
 and some creativity there and here.

48
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,640
 But I'm just amazed how well it is done.

49
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:30,800
 And I have watched quite a few episodes already.

50
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,680
 And as you know, this is a historical drama

51
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,320
 based on the true story of Jesus.

52
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:42,320
 And we know that we are followers of Jesus Christ

53
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,840
 and Jesus is a historical figure.

54
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,200
 Now you can find the record of Jesus' life

55
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,880
 in sources outside of the Bible.

56
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,640
 There are some Roman sources, there's some Jewish sources.

57
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,680
 We can find a little bit the story of Jesus,

58
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,600
 but mostly we find in the gospels, in the New Testament.

59
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,320
 And as you know, the first four books of the New Testament,

60
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,520
 Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, the gospels,

61
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:19,280
 the four gospels have recorded quite a bit details

62
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,380
 about the life of Jesus.

63
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:26,380
 And I know the church is always composed of people

64
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,840
 of different walks of life.

65
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,840
 Some of you may be just beginning in your faith journey

66
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,040
 trying to know Jesus,

67
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,080
 trying to understand who this guy is, right?

68
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,880
 And some of us have been a Christians for a long, long time

69
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,680
 and your experience for church

70
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,160
 and your experience of what the Bible says.

71
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,440
 I think as we watch this series,

72
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,460
 and I do encourage you to watch episode two,

73
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:56,680
 this series will help you picture

74
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,520
 the first century life of Jesus.

75
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,400
 It will help you to understand

76
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,600
 what the Bible is talking about.

77
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,080
 And for seekers, it is helpful.

78
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,760
 For new Christians, it is helpful.

79
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,800
 Then for experienced long-time Christians,

80
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,720
 it is also helpful.

81
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,080
 Even I find it helpful.

82
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:21,080
 And I'm going to do the series by referring to the episode,

83
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:25,320
 and then I'll come back to the Bible and say something

84
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,980
 and pinpoint something

85
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,800
 that is highlighted in different episodes.

86
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:35,340
 I hope you understand, this is not the Bible,

87
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:39,640
 but it's a recreation of the biblical stories about Jesus.

88
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,440
 So do watch "The Chosen."

89
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,240
 I don't get commission, right?

90
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,160
 We don't get commission.

91
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,500
 I don't get any money,

92
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,760
 but do watch it because it is so well done.

93
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,380
 And watch "The Chosen" and think the Bible and your faith.

94
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:57,800
 That would be the slogan here, all right?

95
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,900
 As I told you, the gospels, we call it the life of Jesus,

96
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,880
 and Jesus is a historical figure.

97
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,920
 And you can find sources outside of the Bible.

98
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,440
 You find something about Jesus and his context

99
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,800
 and his background.

100
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,320
 Now, Jesus was a Jew living in Israel, Palestine.

101
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,120
 And back in Jesus' day, the Jews, or the Jewish people,

102
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,020
 were under the military occupation of the Roman Empire.

103
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:26,360
 They had a pretty tough life.

104
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,600
 And they were under heavy weight of taxes,

105
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,540
 all kinds of taxes, income taxes, property taxes,

106
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:40,140
 all kinds of taxes pressing on the Jewish people.

107
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:44,700
 And as we all know, we also have our tax day, right?

108
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,160
 And we don't like the IRS, right?

109
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,100
 We don't like them.

110
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,060
 I'm sorry if you work for IRS, good job.

111
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:56,060
 But we generally refuse to think about taxes, right?

112
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:01,980
 And you can just imagine what life would have been

113
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:05,300
 for the Jewish people under the Roman occupation.

114
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,180
 They had a very, very tough life.

115
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,020
 And because the Jewish people had a long traditions

116
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:14,260
 for yearning for freedom, yearning for liberty,

117
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,960
 yearning for having their own nation,

118
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,320
 and every single year in the Passover meal,

119
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,060
 they will recite one story,

120
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:26,980
 and the foundational story in the Old Testament.

121
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,600
 And what was that?

122
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,120
 The Passover, right?

123
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,140
 The Passover.

124
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:36,140
 Moses came and liberate them from the land of slavery,

125
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:40,260
 defeat the oppressor, the Pharaoh, the king of Egypt,

126
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,700
 and then free the people up,

127
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:46,420
 and then they can really be the people of God, right?

128
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,940
 So they were yearning for freedom,

129
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,420
 they were yearning for liberty,

130
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,260
 and that's why in the Jewish tradition,

131
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:56,060
 there's always been people who was trying to fight back,

132
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,100
 right?

133
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,460
 That is the entire Old Testament,

134
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:04,140
 trying, saying something about the hope

135
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:08,380
 that God will reestablish his long lost kingdom on earth.

136
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:11,300
 Now the Jewish people were under Rome.

137
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,580
 And that is the context of the life of Jesus

138
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,740
 and the first four books of the New Testament,

139
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,820
 Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.

140
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:22,540
 Now if you compare the Gospels, the four Gospels,

141
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:29,140
 and other ancient biographies of the day,

142
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:32,780
 you'll find that there were similarities

143
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:37,460
 because the ancient biographies,

144
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:40,260
 they were not interested in the personal life

145
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,660
 of the public figure.

146
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:46,860
 You know, we, modern people, we are really interested

147
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:51,180
 in the private life of the public figure, right?

148
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,860
 You know, the autobiography of Obama, right?

149
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:57,180
 Trump, Hillary Clinton, right?

150
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,660
 You check all those books, you know,

151
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:01,020
 they're trying to dig out, you know,

152
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,980
 their romances, right?

153
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:06,260
 Their history of personal life, right?

154
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,220
 Did they ace the test?

155
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,300
 And did they fight with their classmates, right?

156
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,220
 What happened when they grow up?

157
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,860
 And all that stuff.

158
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,220
 This is modern biographies.

159
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,460
 We're interested in the private life of the individuals.

160
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,140
 But ancient biographies, like the Gospels,

161
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:26,340
 they're not interested in the private life

162
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,740
 of the individuals.

163
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:32,860
 They are interested only in the public record

164
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,380
 of the individual.

165
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:38,260
 Something you can find in the official archive,

166
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,300
 you know, from the database.

167
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,700
 Everybody knows about it, right?

168
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:47,700
 And then they write autobiographies of the famous people.

169
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:53,300
 People like Plato, Aristotle, philosophers,

170
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:57,700
 Augustus, Roman Empire, Pilate,

171
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,580
 the Roman governor of Palestine at the time.

172
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:03,340
 They are only interested in their public life.

173
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:08,420
 That is ancient biographies, and that is Gospels.

174
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:12,060
 So you flip the pages of the first four of Gospels,

175
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,580
 Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,

176
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:16,300
 it doesn't talk about, you know, Jesus.

177
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:20,820
 Any girl had a crush on Jesus when he was in high school.

178
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,700
 Nobody cares, right?

179
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,700
 They only care about his public ministry, public life.

180
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:31,260
 So let's say we are in the fellowship,

181
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:34,380
 the Paneo fellowship, we are doing Bible study,

182
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:38,340
 and on chapter one, Gospel of Mark,

183
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,220
 all of a sudden Jesus came, right?

184
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:43,740
 And he started preaching the message of the kingdom.

185
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,260
 The kingdom is here, right?

186
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:48,900
 So you repent, and we turn back to God.

187
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,180
 Jesus was already an adult.

188
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:55,180
 So they only are interested

189
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:58,780
 in the public life of the individual.

190
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:03,660
 So we have to keep that in mind when we read the Gospels,

191
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,380
 Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.

192
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:10,380
 So here we compare the Gospels and the Chosen, all right?

193
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:14,140
 So this is episode one, all right?

194
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:18,260
 So go back home, and I think it's on Netflix, right?

195
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:22,140
 It's on Netflix, or Amazon Prime, or even on the website.

196
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,660
 You can watch the Chosen.

197
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,860
 Let me highlight episode one here.

198
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:30,180
 Of course, it's based on the true stories of Gospel,

199
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:35,180
 and the movie makers make their own creativity

200
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:38,020
 and add their poetic license in there.

201
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,420
 This is one of the screen cap in the beginning.

202
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:43,620
 But episode one, let me summarize it,

203
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,220
 and I translate for those who are reading Chinese.

204
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,900
 But on the left column, episode one is called

205
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,260
 I Have Called You By Name.

206
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:57,820
 Now, let me give you a summary, only four points.

207
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:01,540
 Now, the story start with 2 BC, all right?

208
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,860
 Two years before the common era.

209
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,540
 There was Mary Madeline.

210
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:10,580
 She was a little girl, and she was with her father,

211
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,860
 and she wakes up all the time in the middle of the night,

212
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:16,260
 and don't know why, she was scared of something.

213
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:20,420
 And her father reminds her, Isaiah 43, one.

214
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:23,060
 And that is a scripture we're gonna read later.

215
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:27,500
 But she was afraid, but because of this word of God in her,

216
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,780
 and she could go through all these dark times.

217
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:35,580
 And then, the second point, the story is fast forward,

218
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:40,580
 28 years later, now Mary Madeline was an adult.

219
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:44,740
 And she goes by the name Lilith.

220
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:49,300
 Lilith, because she was possessed by demons, many demons.

221
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,740
 And she was suffering so much.

222
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:56,740
 Perhaps in the video, in the movie,

223
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,740
 she is involved in prostitution,

224
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,820
 or she was attacked by people,

225
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:05,740
 but she fought back and she hurt someone,

226
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:08,660
 and so the community were very, very concerned

227
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:13,660
 about her being heavily possessed by the demons.

228
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:16,660
 Then number four, no, number three.

229
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,860
 There was a rabbi, well respected in Jerusalem,

230
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:23,860
 and also in Galilee, but his name is Nicodemus.

231
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:29,100
 He travels to Capernaum, which is a fishing port

232
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:34,100
 by the Sea of Galilee, and some fishermen were catching fish

233
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:39,320
 on the Shabbat, which was illegal.

234
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,900
 And they did so because they wanna avoid taxes,

235
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:46,100
 the Roman taxes, 'cause whatever you catch on the Shabbat,

236
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,620
 it's not counted as your income, I guess.

237
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:53,540
 So they were violating the law of Shabbat,

238
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:58,340
 and they don't wanna pay extra income tax.

239
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:02,380
 But the Romans asked Nicodemus,

240
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,900
 the well-respected leader, the rabbi,

241
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:09,900
 to help catch or arrest some of the Jewish fishermen.

242
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:15,940
 And then later on, Nicodemus found himself

243
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:20,740
 facing the demon-possessed Mary Magdalene, or Lilith,

244
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:26,780
 trying to cast the demons out of her, but he failed.

245
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,740
 He failed miserably, and finally,

246
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,420
 Jesus comes on scene, unexpectedly,

247
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:36,940
 and he cast out the demons and free Mary

248
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,900
 from demon possession.

249
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:44,940
 So Jesus call her not Lilith,

250
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:48,100
 call her by name, Mary.

251
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,100
 So that's episode one.

252
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:54,540
 We do some biblical reflection here.

253
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:57,300
 Another main storyline in episode one

254
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,460
 is definitely Mary Magdalene.

255
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:03,500
 She goes by the name Lilith.

256
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,420
 Now, you have to understand why Lilith,

257
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,060
 why people call her Lilith,

258
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:10,980
 because when she was possessed by demons.

259
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,380
 Because in later Jewish traditions,

260
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,780
 or later legends in Jewish mythology,

261
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:21,740
 Lilith was the name for the female demon.

262
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:25,940
 So the entire community, according to this episode,

263
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:30,500
 call her Lilith, because she was heavily possessed

264
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,860
 by demons, and she suffered quite a bit.

265
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,140
 And Jesus came to redeem her.

266
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,460
 And you have to understand,

267
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:42,500
 this is actually mentioned in the gospels.

268
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:47,140
 Let me turn to the gospel of Luke, chapter eight.

269
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:51,060
 In chapter eight, we find the name Mary Magdalene.

270
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,780
 In fact, we find a list of names,

271
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:58,780
 people, male, and especially female, following Jesus.

272
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:02,500
 Here Luke says in chapter eight, verse one,

273
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,700
 "Soon after, Jesus began a tour

274
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,840
 "of the nearby towns and villages in Galilee,

275
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,540
 "preaching and announcing the good news

276
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,980
 "of the kingdom of God.

277
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:16,260
 "He took with him 12 disciples," the 12, right?

278
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,780
 "And along with some women,

279
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:21,820
 "who had been killed of evil spirits and diseases.

280
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:26,140
 "Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary Magdalene,

281
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:30,500
 "from whom Jesus had cast out seven demons."

282
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,500
 So again, is it really seven?

283
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,740
 Count one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

284
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,380
 Or maybe this is a complete number.

285
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:41,500
 That means she was being possessed by many demons,

286
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,860
 completely controlled by the demon.

287
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:49,740
 Mary Magdalene, and then Joanna, and Susanna,

288
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,940
 and some other women, they were following Jesus,

289
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:55,940
 contribute to his ministry and support Jesus

290
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:59,700
 and his disciples with their own financial resources.

291
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,900
 And that is the first time Mary Magdalene

292
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,860
 show up in the Bible.

293
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:08,140
 If you chase this name, this character in the New Testament,

294
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,940
 you find an amazing character being transformed

295
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:14,220
 by the grace of God, Mary Magdalene.

296
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:17,100
 So here I summarize Mary Magdalene in the Bible.

297
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,820
 Now she's called Mary Magdalene

298
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:25,820
 because Magdalene means the person from Matalah.

299
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:31,780
 And Matalah is a fishing port just south of Capernaum.

300
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:37,100
 Now some people would follow me to tour Israel

301
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,100
 from time to time, right?

302
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:42,660
 I lead a tourist group to Israel almost every single year.

303
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:49,100
 You'll find if you drive today, if you drive,

304
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:54,100
 usually we drive, I drive from Capernaum to Matalah,

305
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:58,300
 it only take about 15 minutes, right?

306
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:01,300
 If I drive faster, probably 10 minutes, I'll be there.

307
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,620
 Right, so it's very close by fishing ports.

308
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:08,540
 And both these fishing ports are on the main

309
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:11,940
 international highway of the ancient day.

310
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:15,500
 So they're small towns, but they're very, very important

311
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,620
 because they are by the seashore of the Sea of Galilee,

312
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,300
 and they're selling fish and catching fish.

313
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:26,300
 And Jesus began his public ministry in Capernaum.

314
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:34,500
 That is the reason, because he could preach the good news

315
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,900
 of the kingdom of God on the international highway, right?

316
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,900
 On the 1994, right, Kennedy Highway, right?

317
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,380
 And who would not catch that, right?

318
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:46,100
 And he was announcing and preaching the good news

319
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,100
 in Capernaum.

320
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:51,580
 And just some of it is this fishing town,

321
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,700
 fishing port called Matalah.

322
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:58,540
 So Mary Madeline simply means Mary from Matalah.

323
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:03,960
 And then you chase the story, we read Luke 8 too.

324
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,460
 She was one of the female followers of Jesus.

325
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:14,020
 Now in this list, what is surprising is, Luke 8,

326
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:17,080
 we just read there are many names of women.

327
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,580
 What is surprising, and you have to understand the Bible

328
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,580
 in its own context.

329
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:25,460
 Because in Jesus' day, Jewish rabbis, there were many

330
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:30,460
 of them, they usually will find, will have male students.

331
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:37,420
 You know, male disciples would follow a certain famous

332
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,420
 rabbi, right?

333
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:41,500
 Just like us, we wanna, when we go to university,

334
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,780
 we wanna go to the best university, right?

335
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,260
 We wanna go to Hartford, right?

336
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,180
 Go to Stanford.

337
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,840
 In those days, you know, male students, you know,

338
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,280
 like the 12, they really, really wanna get into

339
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,360
 the best school of their day, right?

340
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,280
 And Jesus was one of the rabbis.

341
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,240
 And of course, male students would want to follow him.

342
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,480
 But here's the day, this is the norm of the day.

343
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,480
 Rabbis only have male students, male disciples.

344
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,540
 Hardly you find any rabbi would have females following him.

345
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:21,020
 And Jesus broke the norm.

346
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:27,260
 He was calling and allowing females to follow him

347
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:31,140
 from town to town, village to village, city to city,

348
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:34,620
 to do the ministry and to preach the gospel.

349
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,660
 And Mary Madeline was one of them.

350
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:40,940
 And how did the Bible introduce Mary Madeline?

351
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:43,260
 Not in a very good way, right?

352
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:48,440
 Because she had been cast out, seven demons out of her.

353
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:53,440
 She was heavily suffering, oppressed by the demons.

354
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:59,180
 But you can see how the Bible introduced her.

355
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,300
 Her life has been changed.

356
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:05,680
 Her life has been changed by Jesus.

357
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:10,360
 Now, you know a thing or two about life change.

358
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,160
 When we make the commitment to Jesus Christ,

359
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:19,140
 our lives should have been changed, at least fundamentally.

360
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:23,000
 Now, it doesn't convert me from a sinner to a saint.

361
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,800
 It doesn't do that.

362
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,780
 Because no matter how many years I'm in Christ,

363
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:31,560
 I'm still 100% a sinner, right?

364
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:35,740
 I've known Jesus for, for how many years?

365
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:39,700
 Oh boy, 30 some years.

366
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,460
 Yeah, 30 some years, right?

367
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,660
 Since I was a youth.

368
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:47,360
 No, my life has been fundamentally changed.

369
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:52,080
 You know, my value system, my perspective on the world,

370
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,780
 my perspective on myself, my self image,

371
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,320
 how I understand other people.

372
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,020
 These are all changed because of Jesus,

373
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,520
 because of the gospel.

374
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,780
 How I see, you know, how the world

375
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,540
 has been changing around me.

376
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,500
 And how do I see that from the kingdom of God

377
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,060
 perspective?

378
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:14,700
 Those are the things that should happen in your life

379
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,660
 when you make a commitment to make Jesus Christ

380
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,660
 your Lord and Savior.

381
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:22,580
 That is the life change that should be a reality

382
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,700
 for all Jesus followers.

383
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:28,660
 And that was the reality for Mary, Marylyn.

384
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:31,700
 Now, I think the best analogy for talking about life change

385
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,500
 is immigration, immigration.

386
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,580
 Now, some of you, some of you know what immigration

387
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,020
 is all about, right?

388
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:41,340
 Because you know it firsthand.

389
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:44,620
 Immigration means you leave your own country, right?

390
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,300
 And you come to a new country,

391
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,300
 and you try to settle down here.

392
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,700
 When you come to this new country,

393
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:54,820
 you learn new culture, right?

394
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:58,660
 New customs, other language.

395
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:01,260
 And you still remember your old ways of life, right?

396
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:07,660
 As an immigrant, you still remember your old ways of life,

397
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,980
 but now you're in a new land, right?

398
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:15,260
 You probably still value your cultural root, right?

399
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,220
 Like Chinese New Year, right?

400
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,980
 I mean, who cares?

401
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,220
 Oh, you care, right?

402
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,180
 I've been to America for many, many years,

403
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,580
 and I lost track, right?

404
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,340
 I don't do all of this.

405
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,860
 I don't give money to my kids.

406
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:32,940
 My kids are born here.

407
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:36,060
 And once they find out, oh, they have the Chinese heritage,

408
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:38,180
 sometimes when they were still younger,

409
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,800
 they were still hopeful that I'll give them money

410
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,720
 in Chinese New Year.

411
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,780
 I said, no, this is America.

412
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,700
 We don't do that.

413
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:49,960
 Now they don't have that hope anymore, right?

414
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,660
 Because we are in a new land, new custom, right?

415
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:56,500
 And you understand you still value your cultural tradition,

416
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,960
 but there's a huge difference.

417
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:02,960
 The huge difference for you is the previous kingdom,

418
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:07,820
 the previous authority, the political power,

419
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:12,100
 or rules no longer have any holds on you, right?

420
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:17,740
 You drive here, it's not the same way you drive

421
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:20,020
 in Hong Kong or in China, right?

422
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:20,860
 Or in Japan.

423
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:23,740
 You drive differently in America.

424
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:26,300
 In Chicago, you drive differently, right?

425
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,800
 You drive totally different,

426
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,760
 because you belong to the new country, not the old one.

427
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,760
 Yes, you still have some memories,

428
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,140
 but now you're in the new land.

429
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,980
 You're under a different kingdom, right?

430
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:45,020
 The previous political power had no holds on you.

431
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,940
 And the Bible tells us the same sense.

432
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:50,260
 We were under the kingdom of Satan,

433
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:54,760
 darkness and sin and shame before Christ.

434
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,380
 And now we came to Christ, we came to know Jesus.

435
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:01,740
 The power of sin and shame will still have influence on us,

436
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,260
 but it shouldn't have any authority over you.

437
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:07,360
 It may influence you.

438
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,100
 It may affect you, still, it may.

439
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,900
 But you don't answer to those authorities.

440
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,700
 You don't answer to sin.

441
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,820
 You don't answer to darkness.

442
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:20,060
 You don't answer to Satan.

443
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,420
 You only answer to the new authority,

444
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,480
 which is the kingdom of God.

445
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,480
 God is the only king in this new order of things, right?

446
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,560
 You answer to Jesus only.

447
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:36,800
 Whenever you make decisions, especially important decisions,

448
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:41,800
 you should think in terms of what the true king,

449
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,420
 what the true king desires.

450
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:48,740
 You should always orient your life

451
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:51,200
 according to this new kingdom of God.

452
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,760
 And that is the life change that should be happening

453
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,680
 in all the followers of Jesus.

454
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,600
 And that is what happened to Mary Magdalene.

455
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,540
 Her life was changed.

456
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:05,560
 And that's why in this episode, when Jesus came,

457
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,040
 cast out all the demons,

458
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:13,540
 the demons had no holds on Mary Magdalene.

459
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:16,800
 And that's the same story for all of us.

460
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,880
 Jesus came to redeem us, to save us

461
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,480
 from the old order of things,

462
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,520
 and brought us into a new order, a new kingdom,

463
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,640
 the kingdom of God.

464
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:30,640
 And one of the passages that captures this message

465
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,800
 is found in episode one of "The Chosen."

466
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:37,160
 And that is Isaiah 43.

467
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:41,360
 Isaiah 43, verses one and two.

468
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:46,000
 It says, "But now, O Jacob,"

469
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,220
 and Jacob is the nickname for the people of God,

470
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,380
 the nation of Israel.

471
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:55,920
 "Now, O Jacob, listen to the Lord who created you.

472
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,920
 O Israel, the one who formed you says,

473
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:03,160
 do not be afraid, for I have ransomed you.

474
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:07,920
 I have called you by name, and you are mine."

475
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,900
 Isaiah 43.

476
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,840
 Now, one more thing you need to understand,

477
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,840
 because when the Bible quotes a verse

478
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,920
 from the Old Testament,

479
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:22,760
 people don't take verse out of context.

480
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:27,080
 They quote the entire chunk, the entire block of materials.

481
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:30,000
 And that material is the book of Isaiah, right?

482
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,120
 Have you read the book of Isaiah before?

483
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,240
 It's a huge, long book, right?

484
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,760
 So whenever the Bible refers to this verse, 43, one,

485
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,400
 it's actually referring to the huge chunk of materials

486
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,840
 found in the book of Isaiah.

487
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,760
 And you need to understand why the book of Isaiah

488
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,320
 was written.

489
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,440
 It was written for those who were under oppression.

490
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,800
 The Jewish people at that time, in Isaiah's time,

491
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:58,800
 100 years before Jesus, were under the Babylonian Empire.

492
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:03,260
 They were under the military oppression of Babylon.

493
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:05,960
 And these chapters, including 43,

494
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:10,960
 summarizing all the Jewish hopes that we have in God.

495
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,400
 The people of God were waiting.

496
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:17,000
 They were yearning for a new king to set them free,

497
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,480
 to rule over them.

498
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,400
 The new order of things they were yearning for.

499
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:25,400
 A new son of David, a new descendant of David,

500
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:29,200
 like Solomon, who established the first kingdom.

501
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,120
 Someone like the son of David will come

502
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,880
 and restore us back to God, from oppression to liberty,

503
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,240
 from oppression to freedom.

504
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:41,040
 And God will give us power to witness His greatness

505
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,040
 to the ends of the earth.

506
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,640
 That's what Isaiah's all about.

507
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,680
 I just summarized the whole book for you

508
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,440
 in the last 30 seconds, all right?

509
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,400
 And God tells the people,

510
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,560
 no matter how difficult your situation is,

511
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:55,240
 fear, unknowns, or challenges, I am with you.

512
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,520
 Because I have called you by name.

513
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,880
 I have called you by name.

514
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,860
 In the biblical culture,

515
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,960
 whenever you say, "I call you by name,"

516
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,560
 whenever they talk about naming,

517
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,760
 naming someone, or renaming someone,

518
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,840
 like Abram to Abraham, right?

519
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,120
 Sarai to Sarah.

520
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,600
 Whenever you have name changing,

521
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,240
 you know, naming in the biblical culture

522
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,800
 is not simply a label.

523
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,160
 It's not like among the crowd,

524
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,000
 "Hey, Mark, can you stand up?"

525
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,520
 That's just a label, right?

526
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:32,440
 That's how we modern people understand naming.

527
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,360
 But in biblical culture,

528
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,060
 naming is a totally different booking.

529
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:38,100
 Because naming in the ancient culture

530
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:41,240
 has to do with authority and belonging.

531
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,840
 You are being named because you belong to someone

532
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,560
 who named you, right?

533
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:52,160
 You remember there's a,

534
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:56,160
 you understand there's a very, very important ritual

535
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,160
 in the Christian journey,

536
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,840
 which is baptism, right?

537
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,740
 Baptism, you dunk someone in the water,

538
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:06,600
 and then you lift him or lift her back up, right,

539
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,120
 out of the water.

540
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:11,220
 And what did we say when we do that?

541
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,680
 We say we baptize you in the name of the Father,

542
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,480
 the Son, and the Holy Spirit, right?

543
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,160
 And what does it mean?

544
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,920
 Does it mean getting a license?

545
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,840
 Do pastors get a license to do that,

546
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,880
 to dunk people in the water?

547
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,600
 No, the formula says,

548
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,680
 in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,

549
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,200
 I baptize you.

550
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,360
 That means you have the name of the triune God.

551
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,200
 You have the name of God of Trinity.

552
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,280
 The name, singular,

553
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,280
 the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,

554
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:44,200
 and that means you belong to God himself.

555
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:50,720
 When you get baptized, God's name is on your life,

556
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,200
 and he has authority because he is the new king.

557
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,000
 And according to him, there will be life change,

558
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,840
 and new order of things.

559
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,920
 So call you by name, it says Isaiah.

560
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,560
 Do not be afraid, I have ransom you.

561
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:08,040
 I have called you by name, and you are mine.

562
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,140
 You belong to me.

563
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:12,420
 No longer you belong to the oppressor,

564
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:15,740
 or your previous political power,

565
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,900
 or anyone that has a hold on you,

566
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:21,280
 or anything that has hold on you.

567
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:25,540
 Whether it's the shame, guilt, depression,

568
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:30,580
 all those things no longer have any hold on you

569
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:33,220
 because you don't belong to them.

570
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:36,900
 You belong to the God who ransomed you, who saved you.

571
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:40,140
 God knows you by name and call you by name

572
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:43,380
 because you are his.

573
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,980
 And he said, "You are mine."

574
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:49,380
 God know us, thank God, right?

575
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,940
 We belong to the new king, Jesus Christ,

576
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:54,180
 who died on the cross for our sin,

577
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:58,380
 to set us free from any oppressive powers,

578
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:01,820
 ultimately sin and darkness and death.

579
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:06,620
 And Jesus free us and give us this new life, right?

580
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,420
 And Mary Magdalene experienced it,

581
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:11,700
 and we should too, we should too.

582
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:15,300
 Now, before we close in prayer,

583
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:19,420
 we would close today's service with a communion.

584
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:23,220
 I think we have the communion elements ready.

585
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:26,860
 And by doing that,

586
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:31,220
 we proclaim to the world,

587
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:33,740
 as we protect the bread and the cup.

588
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:38,140
 Remember, this is the Passover meal

589
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:43,140
 Jesus set up for generations of Christians, right?

590
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:47,420
 The Passover story, find fulfillment in Jesus

591
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,340
 because Jesus is the lamb of God.

592
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:52,300
 He set us free, right?

593
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,980
 He set us free and we belong to him.

594
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:58,540
 And by protecting the cup and the bread,

595
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:01,820
 we know we belong to Jesus and to him alone.

596
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,620
 Let's do that because of grace of God,

597
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:09,100
 then we can be called the children

598
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,260
 of the kingdom of the light.

599
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,100
 Let's all pray.

600
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:20,940
 Father, as we bow our heads to pray to you,

601
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:25,340
 we know we belong to you.

602
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:29,980
 And thank you for being our king,

603
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,780
 being our Lord.

604
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:39,500
 You have called us by name and we are yours.

605
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:45,500
 Thank you for loving us so amazingly and so unconditionally.

606
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:48,620
 As we see the cross,

607
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:54,260
 as we see Jesus hung on the cross because of our sin,

608
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:57,300
 in order to love us and to redeem us and ransom us

609
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:00,460
 from all kinds of powers on the earth,

610
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,180
 sin and darkness and death,

611
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:06,380
 they no longer have any holes in our lives.

612
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:11,020
 Thank you for the change that you brought about

613
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,100
 in your grace.

614
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:15,500
 It's not because of what we have done,

615
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:20,420
 but because of what your son has done for all of us.

616
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:23,660
 So as we observe the communion together,

617
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,460
 taking the bread and the cup,

618
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,140
 bring us back to your table.

619
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,500
 Bring us back to your table of grace,

620
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:35,060
 knowing that we can partake in eternity

621
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:38,100
 because of your sheer grace.

622
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,980
 Thank you, Jesus.

623
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,260
 In Christ's name, we pray.
