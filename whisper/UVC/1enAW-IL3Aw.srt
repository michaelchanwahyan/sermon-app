1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
 - Right.

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,540
 Well, this is a time of craziness.

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:06,960
 It's a time of chaos.

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,560
 We still in the midst of a pandemic,

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,400
 two years long, right?

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,180
 Probably something at the end of a tunnel.

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,620
 I don't know yet, right?

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:20,820
 We don't know yet.

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,420
 So we just put on masks for now, right?

10
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,540
 Except those who are singing or speaking,

11
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,700
 just for the sake of clarity.

12
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:31,780
 So you look around, there's so much uncertainty.

13
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,980
 And last week, the horrible news

14
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:38,260
 of Russians invading Ukraine, that is horrible.

15
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:42,460
 You read all the stories and all the news reports.

16
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:43,860
 It's just time of chaos.

17
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,160
 Sometimes in times of crisis,

18
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,860
 we will think of what the Bible says.

19
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,940
 We try to find answers from the word of God.

20
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,380
 And sometimes we think of words from the Bible

21
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,060
 saying in the end times,

22
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,180
 there will be war and conflicts on the earth.

23
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,900
 Or sometimes we think of the book of Revelation, right?

24
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,060
 I'm sure you have read this book.

25
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,260
 It's very easy to find as the last book of the Bible,

26
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:15,020
 the last book in the New Testament.

27
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,820
 But it's a very strange book.

28
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,120
 It's a very difficult book to tackle.

29
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:24,620
 So today, we would like to start a kind of a mini series.

30
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:25,600
 We'll see how it goes.

31
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,020
 And we will take some passages from the book of Revelation

32
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,780
 and learn how to read it, learn how to understand it.

33
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,300
 Especially we know the Bible,

34
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,980
 even though it's not directly written to us,

35
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,160
 but it's definitely written for us.

36
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,540
 So how do we read that?

37
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,460
 I chose this book, book of Revelation,

38
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,660
 because at times of crisis,

39
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,740
 sometimes we go to this book and say,

40
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,740
 you see, this is what the Bible predicted.

41
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,280
 And this is what the book of Revelation is all about, right?

42
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,300
 We look at the conflicts, happened last week,

43
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,120
 and we look at all these tensions,

44
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,100
 international tensions or pandemic,

45
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:07,740
 or just unrest, just look around.

46
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,460
 And we go back to the Bible and say,

47
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,860
 hey, this is what the book says, right?

48
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,140
 This is what the book predicted.

49
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,540
 So how true is that, right?

50
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:20,540
 So I want you to think with me how to understand this book,

51
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,260
 how to understand the book of Revelation.

52
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,540
 If you remember last week,

53
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,880
 I told you to do something, right?

54
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,460
 Every day, turn to the Bible,

55
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,640
 10 to 15 minutes in prayer, right?

56
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,940
 Reading the word of God, you know,

57
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,060
 absorbing the word of God.

58
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,060
 Did you do that?

59
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,020
 All right, I'll make sure you do it, okay?

60
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:38,980
 Make sure you do it.

61
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,820
 But sometimes there are passages in the Bible,

62
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:41,940
 some portions in the Bible,

63
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,980
 it's very difficult to do devotion those out of, right?

64
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,900
 Including the book of Revelation.

65
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,660
 So we wanna turn to this book, book of Revelation.

66
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,580
 If you have your Bible in your phone app, turn to it now.

67
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:00,580
 In your languages, there will also be passages

68
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,420
 we project on the screen.

69
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,840
 We'll start with chapter one.

70
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,620
 The revelation of Jesus Christ,

71
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,380
 which God gave him to show his servants

72
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,820
 what must soon take place.

73
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,220
 He made known by sending his angel to servant John,

74
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,460
 the apostle John.

75
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,940
 He testifies to everything he saw.

76
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,260
 That is the word of God, the testimony of Jesus Christ.

77
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:26,040
 Blessed is the one who reads the words of the prophecies.

78
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,940
 The book of Revelation, this book.

79
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:33,220
 Blessed is the one who reads the words of this book.

80
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:36,180
 And blessed are those who hear it and take to heart

81
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,500
 what is written in it.

82
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,740
 Because the time is near, the time of Jesus' second coming.

83
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:44,320
 He came 2,000 years ago into human history

84
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,900
 and accomplished salvation for us on the cross.

85
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,420
 But he will come back.

86
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,380
 The book of Revelation is all about the second coming.

87
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:54,260
 What will happen, what will soon take place?

88
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,480
 The first word, apocalypses.

89
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,540
 This is the word very familiar to us, right?

90
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:04,540
 Because we get the English word apocalypse out of this word.

91
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:07,700
 Remember two years ago when we first locked down,

92
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:14,360
 I went out with my two children to pick up some takeouts

93
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,300
 from a restaurant.

94
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,640
 It was March, right?

95
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,580
 2020, right?

96
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,100
 2020.

97
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,560
 So it was at night.

98
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,120
 So we drove out there to a restaurant nearby.

99
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,040
 We're trying to pick up some takeouts for dinner.

100
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,660
 It was the first day of lockdown and we drove on the street.

101
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:39,040
 And it was quite a sight.

102
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,280
 Because as you know, in Chicago,

103
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,360
 you know, the traffic is crazy, right?

104
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,000
 All the time.

105
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,640
 But it was the first day of lockdown

106
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,400
 and the street is totally empty.

107
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,960
 It was like a ghost town.

108
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,440
 It was kind of crazy, right?

109
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,340
 This is how we describe situations like this.

110
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,140
 Apocalypse, right?

111
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:05,040
 It's the modern meaning of the word apocalypse.

112
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,120
 Means doomsday, right?

113
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,840
 Destruction of all kinds.

114
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,720
 But originally in the first century,

115
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,820
 when this word is spoken,

116
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:19,380
 the basic meanings means uncover, disclose.

117
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,160
 Something which was unknown before.

118
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,400
 Now it's being revealed.

119
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,720
 So that is what apocalypse means.

120
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,680
 The revelation of Jesus Christ.

121
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,520
 Reveal something to us that is not known before.

122
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,760
 What is it?

123
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,320
 What must soon take place

124
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,500
 before the second coming of Christ?

125
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:42,200
 And then the passage goes on to explain to us

126
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,900
 what is the situation.

127
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,440
 Verse four, John the apostle,

128
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,360
 writing a letter to seven churches in the province of Asia,

129
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,360
 which is today's Turkey.

130
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,980
 John, your brother, I am with you guys.

131
00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:00,980
 Company in suffering and kingdom and patient.

132
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:01,980
 And patience.

133
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,780
 And doings.

134
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,260
 There are hours in Jesus.

135
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:11,260
 Who, John is saying that I'm writing it

136
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:15,060
 from the island of Patmos,

137
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,020
 which is a small island

138
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:22,100
 off the coast of Ephesus from Turkey.

139
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,420
 So he was exiled, why?

140
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:28,100
 Because the Roman Empire was oppressing the churches,

141
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,700
 the early churches in those days.

142
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:34,460
 It was kind of the 1890s,

143
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:38,180
 so '90s after Christ.

144
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:42,880
 So the Roman Emperor was instituting

145
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,340
 some sort of systematic persecution,

146
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:50,980
 systematic pressure on the early church.

147
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,480
 So it was time of crisis for the church.

148
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,300
 And then John was exiled

149
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,540
 because he was one of the leaders, one of the pastors.

150
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:04,260
 He was exiled on Patmos, on the island.

151
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:07,500
 And he was suffering with other brothers and sisters

152
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:12,020
 who were in the mainland under the Roman persecution.

153
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,700
 So this is what the book of Revelation is all about.

154
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,140
 Sometimes we describe the book of Revelation

155
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:23,580
 as some special type of literature.

156
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:27,480
 We call this type of literature apocalyptic literature.

157
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,700
 And what it says is it's a group

158
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,980
 or a collection of many different writings,

159
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:33,820
 different kinds of writings.

160
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,380
 Some of them end up in the New Testament.

161
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,820
 Some of them is outside the New Testament.

162
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,420
 Some are written by Jewish writers,

163
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:43,340
 some are by early Christian writers.

164
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:46,500
 And they have some commonalities.

165
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,880
 You know, think of Old Testament, the book of Daniel,

166
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,220
 or some chapters in Ezekiel.

167
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,940
 Some of the passages in the Gospels or Paul's letters.

168
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:02,060
 Some common languages all these writings would use,

169
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,800
 including the book of Revelation.

170
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,480
 So as we turn to the book of Revelation,

171
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,500
 it's a strange book, right?

172
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,280
 It talks about horses, it talks about locusts,

173
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,480
 it talks about all kinds of strange phenomenon

174
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,800
 that is foreign to us.

175
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,500
 But you need to remember this.

176
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,000
 This sort of writings, apocalyptic literature,

177
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,700
 is written to the people of God who are in crisis

178
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,180
 in order to encourage them,

179
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:34,180
 in order to let them see what the real reality is.

180
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,660
 It's not what you see here now.

181
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,100
 It's something happening in the future,

182
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,700
 and something happening above,

183
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,140
 in another realm, in the heavenly realm.

184
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,380
 What is really happening?

185
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,220
 You see conflicts on Earth,

186
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,580
 but there's spiritual warfare,

187
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:52,580
 which is so real up there and in soon future.

188
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,900
 So the book of Revelation or apocalyptic literature

189
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:58,060
 is trying to write to,

190
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,700
 to say to the people of God who are under pressure,

191
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,860
 their faith is being tested.

192
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:08,860
 And the purpose is to help them see a different reality

193
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,860
 so that they will find hope in God.

194
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:14,020
 They will not find hope on Earth.

195
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,900
 They will be encouraged in times of chaos.

196
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,320
 Don't we all need that?

197
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,340
 We need this today, right?

198
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:24,300
 We see conflicts and we see chaos

199
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,820
 and uncertainties,

200
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,380
 all sorts of crazy things happening in our world.

201
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,740
 What is going on?

202
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,260
 And the apocalyptic literature,

203
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,860
 especially the book of Revelation,

204
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,780
 is trying to talk to us.

205
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,780
 It's a message written for us

206
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:40,260
 so that we will understand what God is doing.

207
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,180
 So the first three chapters,

208
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,140
 we're not going to go into details,

209
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:47,440
 but first three chapters is actually Apostle John

210
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,580
 writing seven letters to seven churches.

211
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,620
 And they will circulate those letters

212
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,140
 and to encourage the churches

213
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,900
 who are under trials and temptations.

214
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,780
 And then in chapter four,

215
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,540
 the Apostle John is being lifted up,

216
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:02,180
 being taken away from the Earth.

217
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,100
 And he entered into the heavenly realm.

218
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:10,020
 And he saw something like a Roman Empire royal court,

219
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,420
 like the king's court, right?

220
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,740
 Going to the White House up there.

221
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:18,900
 So he looked around and see who is seated on the floor.

222
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,540
 It's not the Roman emperor.

223
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,380
 It's not Caesar.

224
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:28,380
 He saw who is seated on the floor is God himself.

225
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:32,340
 Is the God of history.

226
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,180
 The God who's still in control.

227
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:38,180
 And then it launched many, many different chapters

228
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,300
 talking about the visions that he saw.

229
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,420
 And he reported back to the churches.

230
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,020
 Let's take a look.

231
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,580
 Chapter five.

232
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,200
 Let me get this ready.

233
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,260
 It's so dark here.

234
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,540
 Hold on one second.

235
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,380
 All right.

236
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,540
 Chapter five, verse one.

237
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,380
 See that?

238
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,540
 Chapter five, verse one.

239
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:06,500
 Then I saw in the right hand of him,

240
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,680
 who sat on the floor,

241
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,060
 a scroll with writing on both sides

242
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,340
 and sealed with seven seals.

243
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,660
 I saw a mighty angel proclaiming in a loud voice,

244
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:21,140
 who is worthy to break the seals and open the scroll.

245
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,620
 But no one in heaven or on earth,

246
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:27,140
 under the earth could open the scroll

247
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,380
 or even look inside it.

248
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:32,340
 So I wept and wept

249
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:35,260
 because no one was found who has authority,

250
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:38,140
 who was worthy to open the scroll

251
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,600
 to see what is written inside.

252
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,980
 Now in the ancient world,

253
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:47,980
 important information is always written on the scroll.

254
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:51,260
 Made of animal skin or paper.

255
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,060
 And then they roll it up

256
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:55,340
 and then they put some lumps of clay

257
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:59,820
 on top of the roll up document.

258
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,940
 And then someone who has authority

259
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:04,100
 with a ring or with a stamp,

260
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:07,740
 will put the stamp on the lump of clay

261
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,760
 and seal it, close it up,

262
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,140
 and archive it in the royal bank

263
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,980
 or royal building or temple, anywhere important.

264
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,580
 In the, say in today's language,

265
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,860
 the White House office, right?

266
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,340
 In the government archive.

267
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:29,440
 So whoever wants to check what was written in the document,

268
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,700
 he has to bring his stamp or the ring

269
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:38,540
 and to match with the impression on the clay

270
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:41,340
 to break the seal and open it up.

271
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:44,100
 Now what John saw was this.

272
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,920
 He saw a scroll with seven seals.

273
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,340
 The document is closed up.

274
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:52,960
 But he found no one who could open the scroll.

275
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,420
 What is written inside the scroll

276
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,300
 is definitely words of judgment.

277
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:01,420
 If you have some Old Testament background,

278
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:04,100
 you understand a scroll written,

279
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,740
 words with front and back all over the place.

280
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:12,740
 Book of Ezekiel, talking about the word of judgment from God.

281
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:17,880
 He will vindicate the oppressed,

282
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,080
 vindicate the people of God.

283
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,720
 He will help the people of God

284
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,480
 and will bring judgment on the oppressor,

285
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:27,380
 on the evil forces that is pressing down on the church.

286
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:30,960
 John found no one having the authority to open the scroll.

287
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,280
 So what will happen?

288
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,000
 Nobody knows.

289
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,040
 What is the fate?

290
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,440
 What is happening to the church?

291
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,840
 What will look like tomorrow?

292
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,440
 Nobody can tell.

293
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,440
 That's why he was weeping.

294
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,360
 Nobody can be found to open the scroll,

295
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,820
 to tell us who is in control tomorrow, right?

296
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,660
 Especially in the church

297
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:58,020
 when they were under so much pressure.

298
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,180
 Then in verse five,

299
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:04,800
 then one of the elders who was worshiping in the throne room

300
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,040
 said to me, "Do not weep.

301
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,480
 See the lion from the tribe of Judah, the root of David.

302
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,160
 He has triumph.

303
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,800
 He is able, he has the authority to open the scroll

304
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,960
 and his seven seals.

305
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:21,960
 Finally, the lamb of God, who was slain and rose again.

306
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:26,160
 He is also the lion from the tribe of Judah,

307
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,720
 from the tribe of David.

308
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,440
 He is the real conquering king.

309
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,600
 He has conquered death and evil,

310
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,500
 and he has the authority to open and break the seal,

311
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,720
 to help us see what will soon happen.

312
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,240
 Who is in charge tomorrow?"

313
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,440
 So chapter six, six verse one.

314
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,880
 "I saw as the lamb opened the first of the seven seals,

315
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,440
 that I heard one of the four living creatures, the angels,

316
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,880
 say in a voice like thunder, 'Come!'"

317
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,960
 Verse two.

318
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:07,800
 "I look, and there before me was a white horse.

319
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,040
 Its rider holding a bow.

320
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,800
 He was given a crown, and he rode out as a conqueror,

321
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,800
 bent on conquest."

322
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:22,480
 Now definitely this is some strange images for us.

323
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,560
 For sure, this is negative.

324
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,680
 It's a world of judgment, right?

325
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,120
 So definitely it's judgment of God

326
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,480
 against the church oppressor, right?

327
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,720
 God will do something to stop the oppression.

328
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,880
 God will do something to the evil empire.

329
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,880
 And definitely in this image, we see war, white horse,

330
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:53,200
 rider holding a bow, conquest, military image.

331
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,640
 Now here's what we struggle with,

332
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:00,320
 because we modern readers, we modern people,

333
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,720
 we often misunderstand the images

334
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,200
 from the book of Revelation.

335
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:10,160
 There are all sorts of, we're trying to read our own meaning

336
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,000
 into the text, right?

337
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 We try to impose our own understanding onto the text.

338
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,160
 Let me demonstrate how,

339
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,480
 you probably heard something like this.

340
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,840
 Many people would misinterpret the images here.

341
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,840
 Let me demonstrate how to do it wrongly, okay?

342
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,760
 All right?

343
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,240
 Let me try to demonstrate how to do it wrongly.

344
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,080
 And this is so wrong, okay?

345
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:37,080
 So you see in this image, there's color white.

346
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,120
 There's white horse, right?

347
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:44,880
 And you see, no, military conflict, right?

348
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,480
 Conquest.

349
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,400
 Let me demonstrate.

350
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:55,200
 You see the flag of Russia has white color, right?

351
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,000
 White, blue, and red, right?

352
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,120
 White, bingo.

353
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:06,640
 You got Revelation chapter six, white horse, right?

354
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,920
 And then if you Google white horse Putin,

355
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,120
 you find pictures like this, right?

356
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,640
 Bingo.

357
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,440
 Revelation six, right?

358
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,920
 That's the first seal being broken, right?

359
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:22,600
 And then you say, "Ha ha, you know, prophecy fulfilled.

360
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,920
 "2,000 years ago it was written there, right?

361
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,280
 "Chapter six of Revelation, the first seal, right?

362
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,560
 "Last week it happened, it broke the seal."

363
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,840
 (laughs)

364
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,640
 You see a lot of misinterpretation,

365
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,520
 just so wrong these days, you know?

366
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,920
 Because we just don't know how to interpret

367
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,160
 this sort of, you know, imageries.

368
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,720
 They're strange to us.

369
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,520
 Now I want to tell you how to read the Bible,

370
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,440
 especially the book of Revelation.

371
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,840
 The Bible, the book of Revelation,

372
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,720
 is not written to us, right?

373
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,120
 It's not directly written to us.

374
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,520
 It was originally in Greek, not in English,

375
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:04,520
 not in Chinese, not in any contemporary languages.

376
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,840
 It was written in Greek.

377
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,000
 It's not written to us, but it's written for us.

378
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,520
 So when we try to understand what is going on here,

379
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:17,520
 we should stop from reading our own meaning onto the text.

380
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:22,960
 We should ask, how did the first audience,

381
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,400
 the early churches in the first century,

382
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,680
 how would they understand these images, right?

383
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,640
 So this is totally wrong, okay?

384
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,400
 Don't take it home, all right?

385
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,240
 Don't take it home.

386
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,840
 This is the wrong interpretation.

387
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:39,200
 But you see this kind of problem

388
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,480
 whenever we try to understand

389
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,240
 what the book of Revelation is all about?

390
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,840
 Don't do that.

391
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,360
 Instead, we ask, how would the first century Christians

392
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,680
 understand the imageries?

393
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:54,240
 White horse rider with a bow.

394
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,080
 Let me show you some.

395
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,160
 Ancient coins.

396
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,880
 Parthian coins, all right?

397
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,880
 Do you see a soldier holding a bow?

398
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,720
 Yeah, the triangular thing, right?

399
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,400
 It's not very clear, but it definitely is a bow, okay?

400
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,720
 And then underneath, horses, right?

401
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,440
 White horse.

402
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,760
 And the king was riding on the horse.

403
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,240
 These are Parthian coins.

404
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:29,920
 And it just happened for the ancient Parthian empire,

405
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,880
 the sacred color happens to be white.

406
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:40,040
 In their army, there's always white horses.

407
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:43,080
 Let's take a look at the map.

408
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,240
 The Roman Empire on the left,

409
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,320
 the Parthian Empire on the right.

410
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,800
 For 400 years, this is the ancient, powerful empire.

411
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:59,040
 It always posed a military threat

412
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:04,160
 to the eastern border of Roman Empire, the Parthian Empire.

413
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,360
 In fact, the Roman historians,

414
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,600
 when they talk about the threat against the empire,

415
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,040
 the old Roman Empire,

416
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,840
 they would talk about the Parthian Empire.

417
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,600
 In those days, even the Jewish people

418
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,880
 living on the east coast, the east border,

419
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,160
 the land of Palestine,

420
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:26,160
 from time to time when they talk about the last day,

421
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,400
 the final battle, right?

422
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,560
 Some big battle would happen.

423
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,320
 They would say the Parthians would be involved.

424
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,040
 In fact, in first century,

425
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:41,280
 there were two major battles

426
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,360
 fought between the Romans and the Parthians.

427
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:50,560
 Two times, the Parthians successfully challenged Rome.

428
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,840
 So most probably,

429
00:20:54,840 --> 00:21:02,320
 the first seal, white horse, rider with a bow,

430
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,840
 will remind the first audience, the first century audience,

431
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,360
 the Roman audience, their greatest enemy,

432
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,640
 most likely, are the Parthians.

433
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,880
 Now, you will continue and ask and say,

434
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,880
 hey, I know a little bit about ancient history.

435
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:26,920
 The fall of Rome didn't happen until AD 400 something.

436
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,800
 Right, 476.

437
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:35,800
 And the fall of Rome was not caused by the eastern Parthians.

438
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,840
 It's actually caused by the northern barbarians.

439
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:45,160
 It was the barbarians' job, right?

440
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,600
 Brought down the Roman Empire.

441
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,080
 Does it mean Revelation is wrong?

442
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,600
 No, because the imagery is very flexible.

443
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:59,880
 The imagery is, don't even talk about taking over Rome, right?

444
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,800
 The imagery, the first seal,

445
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,480
 the white horse rider with a bow,

446
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,720
 it simply means military pressure or military threat.

447
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,280
 It's a common image that John used in the first century.

448
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,640
 They are scared by the Parthians,

449
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,400
 the Romans are scared by the Parthians.

450
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,600
 To use this image is to communicate a message,

451
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,920
 a message of judgment,

452
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:29,320
 a message to remind the Roman Empire,

453
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,040
 remind the first audience who are under persecution

454
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,800
 by the Roman Empire, that Roman,

455
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,000
 the Romans are not that powerful, right?

456
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,600
 That's the first seal, that's the message.

457
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,960
 It's the same thing that we use the image of

458
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,960
 Osama Bin Laden to challenge the American power, right?

459
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:55,280
 Now Osama Bin Laden is already gone, right?

460
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,360
 But the message is there, right?

461
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:02,360
 To remind us the weakness, the vulnerability of the empire.

462
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,200
 It's the same thing happening here in chapter six,

463
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,760
 first seal.

464
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,480
 So the message is, in God's eyes,

465
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:15,680
 the empire oppressing the church will fail.

466
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,600
 It will fall.

467
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,040
 It looks very powerful, but it's not.

468
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:25,600
 The first seal is talking about this.

469
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,120
 So it talks about the evil empire,

470
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,760
 the evil force will fall one day.

471
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:36,760
 Not because of the Parthians, but because of God himself.

472
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,200
 So as you read the book of Revelation,

473
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,560
 you will find out who is really the one

474
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:46,640
 who brings down the evil empire, 1115.

475
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,520
 Now it talks about, it already talk about the seven seals.

476
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,880
 Now it talks about the seven trumpets,

477
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,200
 and later on talk about seven bows, okay?

478
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:00,320
 Now we're right in the middle, seven trumpets.

479
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,840
 The seventh angel sang his trumpet,

480
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,120
 and there were loud voices in heaven which said,

481
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,960
 the kingdom of God has become the kingdom of our Lord

482
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,480
 and his Christ, and Christ will reign forever and ever.

483
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:20,480
 Christ is the one who finally, ultimately,

484
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,400
 will bring down all this evil forces,

485
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,680
 and behind all this forces is Satan himself.

486
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:29,760
 So as you can tell, the book of Revelation

487
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,680
 is not news report written ahead of time.

488
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:36,240
 Now don't go to the book of Revelation and say,

489
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,040
 this is newspaper, today's newspaper,

490
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,320
 written 2,000 years ago.

491
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,960
 No, that is wrong interpretation.

492
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,000
 That is a misunderstanding.

493
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 The book of Revelation also is not a weather forecast.

494
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,600
 It's not telling us, okay, tomorrow three o'clock p.m.

495
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,320
 it will rain, it will snow, or something like that.

496
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,320
 The book of Revelation does not intend to tell you

497
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:05,440
 when things happen, and how things happen exactly.

498
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,440
 It doesn't do that.

499
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,360
 Apocalyptic literature doesn't do this.

500
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,520
 It doesn't answer our questions.

501
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:16,320
 Our most interesting question is when and how, right?

502
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,920
 When does it happen?

503
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,720
 When will Christ come back?

504
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,080
 What will it look like, right?

505
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,640
 These are our questions, the when and how questions.

506
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,760
 The book of Revelation is answering some other question,

507
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,160
 some more important question, which is the who question.

508
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,200
 Who is in charge, and who is in control

509
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,400
 in the human history?

510
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,200
 When you see chaos out there,

511
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,160
 when you see everything is not right,

512
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:42,360
 who is the real Lord, who is in control?

513
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,040
 So it's not weather forecast,

514
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,840
 it's not newspaper within the head of time.

515
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,680
 No.

516
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:52,280
 Perhaps a better analogy is to think

517
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:55,160
 Revelation as a syllabus.

518
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,400
 You all go to school, right?

519
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,480
 You receive a syllabus on the first day, right?

520
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,920
 It tells you the professor's name,

521
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:09,800
 the course name, classroom, and then the schedule, right?

522
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:14,360
 Okay, it's Monday, Wednesday, Friday,

523
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:18,240
 which assignment will be due,

524
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,720
 and what lessons will be taught,

525
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,760
 and how you prepare for that, right?

526
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,640
 And then when's the midterm, when's the final exam, right?

527
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,760
 And then, let's say, for example,

528
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,640
 you walk into your classroom one day, right?

529
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,720
 It was the day of midterm.

530
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,800
 So you sit in the classroom,

531
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,560
 and then the professor came in,

532
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,920
 the teacher came in and gave you the midterm exam.

533
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,800
 Okay, you got your midterm exam,

534
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,960
 and say, "Wow, prophecy came true.

535
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,800
 "It's really the midterm."

536
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,480
 Would you say that?

537
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,160
 Of course not.

538
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,600
 Of course not, because as you understand,

539
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,400
 this is a syllabus, right?

540
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,720
 It told you ahead of time,

541
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,920
 not in the sense of prediction,

542
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,960
 but in the sense that it's a plan, right?

543
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,080
 The plan the professor has already given you

544
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,360
 in the first day, right?

545
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:10,240
 And it also tells you who is the agency

546
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,240
 behind the syllabus, who is making things happen,

547
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,480
 who is fulfilling or accomplishing

548
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:21,400
 all those things printed on the syllabus, right?

549
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,360
 Who is the planner, the teacher?

550
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:27,000
 Who is the executor, the teacher himself,

551
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,720
 the professor himself?

552
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,600
 So you walk in on the day of midterm,

553
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,560
 and say, "That's right.

554
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,240
 "That's how he planned.

555
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:42,040
 "We are working out and going along with his plan."

556
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,880
 And the teacher has the authority

557
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,360
 to execute exactly everything according to the syllabus.

558
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:55,200
 Human history is divine syllabus.

559
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,120
 What we see in human history,

560
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,560
 what we see happening in our world,

561
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,160
 is the syllabus of God himself,

562
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:07,720
 the heavenly Lord, the King of kings.

563
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,800
 He has written the syllabus.

564
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:14,320
 That is the message, that is the theology

565
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,520
 of the book of Revelation.

566
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:21,760
 God is in control of the syllabus.

567
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,440
 God is in control of human history.

568
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,200
 So no matter what happens in history,

569
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,680
 no matter what happens in your life and in my life,

570
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:36,600
 even though we see churches being persecuted in China,

571
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,760
 in some of the Muslim countries,

572
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,840
 churches, brothers and sisters being persecuted,

573
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:47,960
 you go back to history, you go back to syllabus,

574
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,880
 you know that behind it, there is someone in control,

575
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,560
 and God is still in control.

576
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,680
 Everything that we see in your life, in my life,

577
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:02,760
 is according to the entire syllabus

578
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,040
 set out by God himself.

579
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:09,600
 God will do all things according to his word,

580
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,920
 according to his syllabus.

581
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:14,360
 That's why we can trust him.

582
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,280
 That's why we should find hope in him.

583
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:19,040
 Now that's what Revelation

584
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,000
 or Apocalypse literature is trying to do,

585
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,960
 is to tell us we can find hope only in him.

586
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:29,840
 He is the one who is guarding and accomplishing,

587
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:34,560
 planning, executing the syllabus, right on his timing.

588
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:38,640
 Even though we have questions we cannot answer,

589
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,000
 even though we see crisis,

590
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,040
 we try to find out the reasons behind it,

591
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,000
 sometimes we don't.

592
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 But look, everything is according to the syllabus of God.

593
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,080
 Everything is according to his plan.

594
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,360
 So we can trust him.

595
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,720
 We find hope in God so that we can inform

596
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,200
 our own present living.

597
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:06,760
 We will not be hijacked by fear, right, and unbelief.

598
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:11,240
 Because we know everything will be according to his word.

599
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,800
 He is the faithful God who will execute everything.

600
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:18,160
 Even though we don't have all the detailed answers,

601
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,440
 but yes, we can trust in him.

602
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:25,200
 I'm sure in the past week or so,

603
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,040
 you got a lot of news stories

604
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,440
 about what is going on in our world.

605
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,120
 You probably heard a lot of news stories

606
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:37,320
 or some really sad reports from the Ukraine crisis.

607
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,400
 I received a lot too.

608
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,040
 I want to share one of those with you.

609
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:48,480
 The president of Ukrainian Baptist Theological Seminary.

610
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:55,240
 Crisis came and he said,

611
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:58,440
 "Now the church will go underground.

612
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,320
 "We had that under the Soviet Union

613
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,400
 "and the church did not forget,

614
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,520
 "should never forget what it means to be persecuted.

615
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:10,520
 "We, the church, will rearrange,

616
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,640
 "reorganize and do what we always do."

617
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,520
 Preach the gospel.

618
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,520
 Isn't that true?

619
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:23,080
 Isn't that true if we find our hope,

620
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,360
 our ultimate anchor,

621
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,240
 nothing in the world but Christ himself

622
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,200
 who is in control of human history.

623
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:36,200
 If he is in control, then this hope,

624
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:41,200
 this promise will inform how we react in times of crisis.

625
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,640
 We will reorganize.

626
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,040
 We will do what we always do

627
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,920
 or what we always called to do,

628
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,080
 to preach the gospel,

629
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:57,840
 to live a life of Christ follower.

630
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,480
 Nothing will change.

631
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,080
 Yes, there are times in darkness

632
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,920
 and sometimes we feel darkness is so overwhelming

633
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:10,920
 and the evil forces seem invincible, very powerful.

634
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,840
 But the book of Revelation is reminding us

635
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:19,240
 all these evil forces are not omnipotent.

636
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:22,480
 They are not all powerful.

637
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,320
 They are limited.

638
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,360
 God himself is omnipotent.

639
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,200
 God himself is all powerful.

640
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,800
 We still preach the gospel.

641
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,280
 We still live for the kingdom.

642
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:39,360
 Don't be hijacked by all this fear and uncertainties.

643
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,160
 Your history is the syllabus of God.

644
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:49,720
 Yes, we have a lot of questions without answers,

645
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,240
 but that's okay.

646
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,080
 Midterm will come.

647
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,360
 The final exam will come.

648
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:58,600
 God will do according to his word.

649
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:03,160
 Let me close with chapter five, verse five.

650
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:08,440
 Then one of the elders said to me,

651
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,120
 "Do not weep.

652
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:13,640
 "See the lion of the tribe of Judah,

653
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,320
 "the root of David, has triumphed.

654
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:22,400
 "He is able to open the scroll and the seven seals."

655
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,160
 Let us all pray.

656
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:29,080
 Father God, our Lord Jesus Christ,

657
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:32,600
 you are the one in control

658
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:38,120
 and you are the only king that is worthy of our praises.

659
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,240
 (pensive music)

660
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:45,400
 We face times of uncertainty and crisis

661
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,320
 and we're living in a time of chaos.

662
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,720
 No matter what we face,

663
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,160
 remind us once again with the heavenly vision

664
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:59,280
 that you are the one who is in control.

665
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:04,280
 That our own personal life, world history even,

666
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,720
 is in your syllabus, is in your plan.

667
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:13,360
 Yes, we see evil forces all around us.

668
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,960
 We see chaos and crisis.

669
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,920
 We even see some of the people

670
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:21,720
 who are living less fortunate than us.

671
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,920
 They are facing persecutions.

672
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:28,000
 Our dear brothers and sisters in other places,

673
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,640
 they are less fortunate than us.

674
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:35,600
 Yes, we see a lot of things that are not going right.

675
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:40,720
 And it seems to us the evil is having the upper hand.

676
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:46,480
 But remind us once again that Christ our Lord,

677
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,440
 the Lamb of God, who was slain on the cross

678
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,920
 and rose again from the tomb,

679
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:57,240
 you are the one who is in charge.

680
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,960
 And we pray that our own personal life

681
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,960
 will dedicate ourselves again to you.

682
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:06,600
 I pray that you will increase our trust and faith in you.

683
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,560
 You will increase our love for you.

684
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:13,440
 We still do what we are always called to do,

685
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,880
 is to live according to your will,

686
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,240
 to preach the gospel, to build up your church,

687
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,360
 to serve you with our gifts.

688
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:26,240
 And pray that you will continue to renew us,

689
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,560
 renew our perspective.

690
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:33,560
 To live faithfully in your sight,

691
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:38,600
 to live faithfully according to your word,

692
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:42,840
 to hear your word and to apply it into our lives.

693
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,960
 May our lives be pleasing to you.

694
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,960
 In Christ name we pray, amen.
