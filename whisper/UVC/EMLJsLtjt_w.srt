1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,080
 - Thank you, Pastor Mark.

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,420
 - Hey, how's it going guys?

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:08,040
 I know it has been a long weekend

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,440
 and this is a Labor Day weekend

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,100
 and a lot of us are out of town.

6
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:17,520
 And then for some of you,

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,100
 yesterday was a very, very long day, right?

8
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:27,600
 Well, one applause for all of you.

9
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:32,040
 Sometimes you have to say thank you to yourself.

10
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:38,320
 In any case, today we're going to talk about Psalm 19.

11
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:45,320
 Now you remember last week we went to the Botanical Garden

12
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,240
 and we had a very good time, right?

13
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:54,040
 So I kept on thinking about this psalm

14
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,040
 and it says, let me read maybe the first verse.

15
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,480
 "The heavens declare the glory of God

16
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,240
 and the skies proclaim the work of His hands."

17
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:11,800
 And then the creation is like a preacher.

18
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,760
 It's like someone who's preaching a sermon to you

19
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,240
 and proclaiming the greatness of God

20
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,480
 to all people everywhere, all the time.

21
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:25,760
 And like this psalm says,

22
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,880
 the heavens and the creation do not speak our language.

23
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,360
 There's no voice.

24
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,480
 Yet they speak a language

25
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,800
 that everyone of us can understand.

26
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,040
 That's amazing.

27
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,400
 Day after day, night after night,

28
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,680
 creation keeps on pointing us

29
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,440
 back to the glory of the creator.

30
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:52,360
 And as you can see,

31
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,960
 these new images came out 2022 by James Webb Telescope.

32
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,720
 And you know, 100 years ago,

33
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:06,880
 we, people thought that there was only one galaxy.

34
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,120
 But now with this pictures,

35
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,200
 with this all kinds of new images,

36
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:17,200
 there were countless of galaxies in space, in deep space.

37
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,160
 And some of the lights we see today

38
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,680
 has traveled like 13 billion years of time

39
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,520
 before reaching us now.

40
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:44,360
 Now this tells us, like the psalm says,

41
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,960
 you know, how small we are

42
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,040
 and how great our God, how vast the universe is.

43
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,160
 And the heavens stretch out beyond our imagination.

44
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,720
 And yet, this is only what we see today in nature.

45
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,720
 It's only a reflection of the majesty of our maker.

46
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:16,080
 Now the psalm, psalm 19,

47
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,360
 highlights one of the factors, the sun.

48
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,480
 Now you can ask the question, why the sun?

49
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,120
 Why focus on the sun?

50
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,600
 Because, you know, everyone see the sun.

51
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,480
 You saw the sun today, right?

52
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,920
 You came in and you saw the sun and you woke up.

53
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:35,440
 It's like a bridegroom coming out of his wedding canopy.

54
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,800
 You know, it's like a look of triumph,

55
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,240
 like a champion running with joy and with energy.

56
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,240
 That is the sun.

57
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,040
 The sun rises every day.

58
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,840
 It runs its courses across the sky with power.

59
00:03:52,840 --> 00:04:07,240
 And you can tell, even in Chicago,

60
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,520
 we don't have a lot of sun,

61
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:13,520
 but when the sun comes up, nothing escapes its heat.

62
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,520
 And the same way, the psalm's telling us,

63
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,640
 no one should escape,

64
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,520
 no one can escape the weakness of creation.

65
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,160
 And the glory of God is unmistakable.

66
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,160
 And we acknowledge the existence of the savior, our maker.

67
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,160
 And not only in the vastness of the space,

68
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,640
 but even in the smallest detail in creation,

69
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,320
 it tells us the existence of God.

70
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:54,360
 Now, some years ago,

71
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:00,440
 a photographer tried to magnify the snowflakes

72
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,400
 and under the camera and took a lot of pictures.

73
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,920
 And as you can see,

74
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:09,800
 every single snowflake look different, right?

75
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,800
 Everyone, every snowflake has a unique signature

76
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,080
 and they are all masterpiece.

77
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:29,040
 And this is how amazing God's creation is.

78
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,040
 And from the blazing sun, we all can see,

79
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,280
 to the delicate snowflake, right?

80
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,720
 Snowflake.

81
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,960
 In the smallest detail,

82
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,000
 the creation keeps telling us God is glorious.

83
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:56,760
 Now, this is what the theologians of the Bible tells us.

84
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,720
 This is general revelations,

85
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,440
 because God left his fingerprint,

86
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,960
 his signature everywhere,

87
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,120
 every single inch of the creation.

88
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,560
 And no one can say, "I never heard of the creation,

89
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,160
 never heard of the creator."

90
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,800
 Creation is always speaking.

91
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,800
 And the only thing is whether you would listen or not.

92
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:30,760
 And I remember some years ago,

93
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,720
 there was a debate going on

94
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,720
 between a British rabbi called Jonathan Sachs.

95
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:42,800
 And he was debating the most famous atheist,

96
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,800
 Richard Dawkins, over online.

97
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,760
 And this is one of the conversation

98
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,560
 they had between each other.

99
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,720
 And I can translate first.

100
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,560
 - Okay.

101
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,120
 - And Sachs, during the debate,

102
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,600
 he said to the atheist, Dawkins,

103
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,960
 he said, "Richard, religion is music,

104
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,360
 but you are tone deaf."

105
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,360
 And then Richard Dawkins, responding to the debate,

106
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,280
 says, "Yes, it's true.

107
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,840
 I'm tone deaf, but there's no music."

108
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,760
 (speaking in foreign language)

109
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:37,360
 - And Psalm 19 reminds us, there is music all the time.

110
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,200
 There's music.

111
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,960
 Can you listen to the music?

112
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,880
 It is playing.

113
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,160
 The music is playing all around us.

114
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,520
 And the music of creation declare the glory of God.

115
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,440
 (speaking in foreign language)

116
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:57,040
 (speaking in foreign language)

117
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,240
 - And that's the first point you have to listen.

118
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,560
 You have to try to listen to the music of creation,

119
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,080
 the voice of creator.

120
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,080
 And the second point here is listen

121
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,080
 to the voice of the creator.

122
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,720
 And God does not only speak through creation.

123
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,040
 He also speaks to us, every single one of us,

124
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,800
 directly through His word.

125
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,440
 And that's what the Psalm is trying to describe.

126
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,600
 It is the beauty and the power of the word of God.

127
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,520
 (speaking in foreign language)

128
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:38,680
 - And in verses seven, eight, and nine,

129
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,080
 it says that God's law is so perfect,

130
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,720
 and it revives our soul,

131
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,760
 and His testimony gives wisdom.

132
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,240
 His precept gives us direction for our lives,

133
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,880
 and His commands gives clarity into our lives,

134
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,920
 and His judgment are always true and righteous,

135
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,880
 and the fear of the Lord is pure and eternal.

136
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,800
 (speaking in foreign language)

137
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:17,800
 - And in short, God's word gives you wisdom,

138
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,960
 gives you life, gives you joy and light,

139
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,240
 and it is reliable, unchangeable,

140
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,640
 and unlike any of our words, our human words.

141
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,560
 (speaking in foreign language)

142
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:38,960
 - And the Psalms keeps on telling us

143
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:43,720
 that the word of God are more than precious,

144
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,640
 than gold, and much, than much pure gold,

145
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,160
 sweeter than honey, and than honey from the comb.

146
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:56,200
 (speaking in foreign language)

147
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:08,520
 - It is more precious than gold,

148
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:12,680
 and you know, you remember in the history

149
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,440
 of the United States, many, many years ago

150
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,440
 in the 19th century, 1850s, there was a gold rush, right?

151
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,680
 And all the people around the world

152
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,440
 fled to San Francisco, right?

153
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,440
 San Francisco, that's why we call San Francisco

154
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,040
 (speaking in foreign language)

155
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,600
 Okay, and they came for gold,

156
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,000
 and they tried to, you know, sift through the soil

157
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,480
 and to find a few flecks of gold.

158
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,400
 (speaking in foreign language)

159
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:56,000
 - And there was a story going around

160
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 about the gold rush, and the story goes,

161
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,800
 three men, they discover a gold mine,

162
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,280
 but they pledge to other people

163
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,560
 that we're not gonna tell anyone

164
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,800
 because it's absolutely secret, we wanna get the gold, right?

165
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,040
 So they promise each other never to tell anyone,

166
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,160
 but then when they walk into a bar, these three men,

167
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,720
 and then other people immediately come to them

168
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,440
 and telling them, "Oh, you guys must have found

169
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,760
 "the gold mine."

170
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,680
 (speaking in foreign language)

171
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:36,520
 - Now, the three men were shocked

172
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,800
 because they never tell anyone,

173
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:44,800
 and they ask, "How do you know that we found the gold mine?"

174
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,120
 And the people respond by saying,

175
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,680
 "It's all written over your face

176
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,480
 "because we see how you smile,

177
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,480
 "so you must have found the gold mine."

178
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,400
 (speaking in foreign language)

179
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:06,360
 - Now, this is what the word of God should do to us, right?

180
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,720
 We are filled with the word of God

181
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,760
 and then we can taste the sweetness

182
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,840
 and the treasure of all the treasures of the law of God.

183
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:17,320
 And people around us, you know, eventually should feel

184
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,640
 the power of the word of God, the joy of the Lord, right?

185
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,560
 Shining on our faces.

186
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,480
 (speaking in foreign language)

187
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,360
 - So this psalm's telling you to listen

188
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,000
 to the music of creation

189
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,760
 and to listen to the voice of the creator,

190
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,800
 the word of God.

191
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,720
 And thirdly, from 11 to 14,

192
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,600
 it tells us to respond to this God who loves us.

193
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,680
 And after creation speaks, after God's word speaks,

194
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,720
 and what we make is our response, right?

195
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,440
 And the psalm is telling us,

196
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,560
 to show us how we should answer to the word of God.

197
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,440
 (speaking in foreign language)

198
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,840
 And the psalm says,

199
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,840
 "By them your servant is warned,

200
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:14,840
 and in keeping the word of God, there is great reward."

201
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,840
 And he immediately responds saying,

202
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:22,840
 "Who can discern their own sins, their own errors,

203
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:27,840
 and ask God to forgive our hidden sin and faults."

204
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,760
 (speaking in foreign language)

205
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,920
 And ask God to forgive our hidden sin and faults.

206
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,920
 (speaking in foreign language)

207
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:49,080
 Now this is an honest confession.

208
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:54,520
 Seriously, sometimes we cannot see all of our sins.

209
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:59,240
 So we must ask God to forgive us, to protect us,

210
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,840
 and to free us from pride and rebellion from sin.

211
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:07,760
 (speaking in foreign language)

212
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:16,520
 And the psalm says,

213
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:20,080
 "Keep your servant also from willful sins.

214
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,840
 May they not rule over me, and I will be blameless.

215
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:28,160
 I will be clean and innocent of great transgression."

216
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,240
 And his desire, as you can see, is to be free from sin,

217
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,280
 not to be ruled by sin, but shaped by the word of God,

218
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,800
 the very word of God.

219
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,720
 (speaking in foreign language)

220
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,560
 Finally, the last line is the most precious response.

221
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,520
 It says, "May the word of my mouth,

222
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:06,800
 the meditation of my heart, be pleasing in your sight,

223
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,840
 Lord, my rock and my redeemer."

224
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,760
 (speaking in foreign language)

225
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:24,240
 Now the word pleasing here, acceptable,

226
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,000
 how this translation was used often in the Old Testament

227
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,040
 to describe a sacrifice, sacrifice we offer to God.

228
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,960
 You know, a sacrifice is only meaningful

229
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,320
 if only God accept it.

230
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,320
 And that is the word here.

231
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,640
 In the same way, true worship here is not about,

232
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:45,040
 you know, asking, okay, do I like it or not?

233
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,960
 Do I like the song?

234
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,800
 Do I like the sermon?

235
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,400
 Do I like, you know, here or whatever?

236
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,320
 It's not our preference.

237
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,080
 It's that whether God would accept my worship.

238
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:58,000
 (speaking in foreign language)

239
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:13,280
 And that's what meditation is all about, right?

240
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,720
 Your thought, you know, your thought life matters.

241
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,120
 You know, I wonder if you can,

242
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,760
 you would take time every day to meditate

243
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,880
 on the word of God, not rushing through the Bible,

244
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,520
 but, you know, let the word of God sink deep,

245
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,960
 deep into our hearts.

246
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,240
 And then our words and our thoughts and our lives

247
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,240
 will become offering that will give God glory.

248
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:43,440
 (speaking in foreign language)

249
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,520
 So here, Psalm 19 is like music itself.

250
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,200
 It has three movements, right?

251
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,240
 To listen to the voice, the music of creation,

252
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,880
 listen to the voice of God,

253
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,520
 and our response finally to God.

254
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,120
 So there are three movements here,

255
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,240
 from creation, the word, to response.

256
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,240
 And each of the parts calls to God.

257
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,760
 So the first part is the word of God.

258
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,200
 And the second part is the word of God.

259
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:16,200
 The parts calls to you and me to listen carefully

260
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,840
 and then to step out of faith.

261
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:22,760
 (speaking in foreign language)

262
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:33,320
 So here's my homework for you this week.

263
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,160
 You know, slow down and try to listen

264
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,920
 to the voice of creation.

265
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,880
 You know, look up the skies and look at the sun,

266
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,880
 not directly, right?

267
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,560
 Even the snowflakes, okay, not right now, I hope not.

268
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,880
 But the smallest details would declare the glory of God

269
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,960
 and the music of creation is always playing around us.

270
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,880
 (speaking in foreign language)

271
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:08,000
 And then secondly, is to listen to the voice

272
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,360
 of the creator, 7 to 10, verses 7 to 10.

273
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,200
 And God's word is more precious than gold,

274
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,560
 sweeter than honey.

275
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,880
 We need to taste it, we need to experience it.

276
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,840
 It's a treasure that is hidden,

277
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:26,360
 but it will fill you with joy and life.

278
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:30,280
 (speaking in foreign language)

279
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,680
 So this week, spend some time every day

280
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,760
 to listen to the voice of creation

281
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,720
 and listen to the voice of creator.

282
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,560
 And then with confession and prayer,

283
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:50,120
 making our lives pleasing in the sight of God.

284
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:54,040
 (speaking in foreign language)

285
00:18:54,040 --> 00:19:00,800
 So here it tells us creation points us to God.

286
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,320
 So let creation point us to God.

287
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,600
 And then the word of God will transform us.

288
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,880
 And our only fitting response is to bow down

289
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,280
 and worship in repentance and joyful obedience.

290
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,200
 (speaking in foreign language)

291
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:30,360
 Well, at this point, why don't we conclude with a prayer?

292
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,560
 And in this prayer, I want you to come

293
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:37,560
 into the presence of God and to pray to him.

294
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:41,520
 (speaking in foreign language)

295
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,280
 Let us pray.

296
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,520
 (speaking in foreign language)

297
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:51,520
 Lord, thank you for your creation that declares your glory.

298
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:56,000
 And we wanna thank you for your word that give us life.

299
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,920
 (speaking in foreign language)

300
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:05,000
 And forgive our hidden sins and keep us from rebellion

301
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,600
 and let our words and our meditation,

302
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,680
 our thought be pleasing to you

303
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:13,240
 because you are our rock and our redeemer.

304
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,160
 (speaking in foreign language)

305
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:26,320
 In Jesus' name we pray.

306
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,760
 (speaking in foreign language)

307
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,000
 Amen.

308
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,680
 So remember the homework this week.

309
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,480
 (speaking in foreign language)

310
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,520
 Go out to creation, not your screen,

311
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,880
 not your screen, not your phone.

312
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,160
 Go out to the creation and listen

313
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,400
 to the music of the creation.

314
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,720
 (speaking in foreign language)

315
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,920
 Okay, and then spend some time in the word of God

316
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,040
 that gets singed into your lives.

317
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,640
 (speaking in foreign language)

318
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,360
 Okay, and God bless you this week

319
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,320
 and hope to see you next Sunday.

320
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,000
 (speaking in foreign language)

321
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,640
 All right, yeah, put it in your heart, yes.

322
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,440
 Okay, go in peace, guys.

323
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,440
 (speaking in foreign language)

324
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,920
 (gentle music)

325
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:15,320
 (gentle music continues)

326
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:18,720

327

00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,720
 (gentle music continues)

332
