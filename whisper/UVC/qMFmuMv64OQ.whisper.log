[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.720]   guest speaker Tommy. Thank you very much. Very good job, very good job. Thank you
[00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.640]   very much. Hey let me ask you a quick question for those especially those
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.480]   actually doesn't apply to those who are online but more so in person. Who watches
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:20.640]   football here in this room? Oh am I am I on?
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.480]   Is it on?
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:37.000]   Good? All right perfect. Who watches football here in this room? All right not
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.600]   too much. All right but if you do come to the Super Bowl party all right I want to
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.680]   at least take one minute to give you some basic information so you can come
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.080]   and know what's going on. Here are the two teams that are playing today. The
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.960]   Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs. The two quarterbacks Jaylen Hurts
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.800]   on the Eagles very strong Christian believers. Patrick Mahomes Kansas City
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.640]   Chiefs very strong believers as well too. All right your three guys that you guys
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:17.200]   need to pay attention to. There is Chris Jones their defense he's the guy on my
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:23.480]   left. Patrick Mahomes on my right. The middle guy with the C is Travis Kelsey
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.440]   who is the tight end. He's your best receiver on there. The other guys don't
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.280]   really matter so just pay attention to those guys. The third Jaylen Hurts is
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.400]   right in the middle. Then you have AJ Brown and then from that point up Miles
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:46.120]   Sanders to my right. The coach on that team is Andy Reid who is currently the
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.400]   coach of the Kansas City Chiefs but he was the former coach of the Philadelphia
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.040]   Eagles so that's why they're calling it that Andy Reid Bowl. All right so at
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.240]   least some basic information that when you're sitting there and you're talking
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.360]   with someone you're not asking so what quarter are we on and how many baskets
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.640]   have they made. All right so and then also you you know this I mean a lot of
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.680]   times we're Super Bowl everyone pays attention to the commercials and all of
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.160]   that stuff so enjoy it's the last game of the season but it's a good time of
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.400]   fellowship as well too. Well this morning we're you know you guys are stuck with
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.800]   me it looks like you guys are stuck with me once a month here and so you get to
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.480]   hear my thoughts every single month and every single year I'm not sure if you
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.240]   get a chance to do this every year I like to pick a character or I like to
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:42.160]   pick a book in the Bible and for that entire year that's who I study. Now at
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.020]   the same time I totally understand a lot of times there's these Bible one-year
[00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.080]   plans and all that stuff and I appreciate that I like going deep into
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.540]   something and so whether it's me a lot of times at one year I studied the life
[00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.120]   of David then I spent some time studying Solomon I actually spent about a good
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.360]   nine months studying John chapter 1 all the way to John chapter 7 to really
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.520]   fully understand it. You saw that with Joseph all of that I want to do that
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.760]   with Elijah and if you ever get a chance just spend dive deep into and say Lord
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.560]   what is it that you're teaching me through this character or through this
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:26.760]   book and you're reading the same verses over and over and over again. Unlike Mark
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.160]   who has to prepare a sermon once a week I get a chance I have the luxury
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:37.400]   of preparing it once a month and so for the whole month that's what I study so
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:43.640]   for the last month I've just been studying 1st Kings 17 1 through 7 and
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.480]   I'm always asking Lord what is it that you're asking me what is it that you're
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.920]   saying to me I just keep rereading and rereading and rereading because there
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.120]   are days you sit there and you look at the same passage for the 50th time and
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.560]   it's something you realize wait a minute I never saw that before it makes
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.680]   scripture come alive what as you begin to understand it so hey today as we dive
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.440]   into 1st Kings chapter 17 and look at the lives of Elijah I do want to add in
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.240]   one bit background information that I think sometimes it's very good to
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:24.280]   understand is I think a lot of times in order to fully appreciate the life of
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.800]   Elijah you've got to understand the historical background of what was going
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:36.520]   on prior before Elijah came there was kind of a stability probably not perfect
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:43.240]   but for over a hundred years Israel was essentially led by three kings you had
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:49.640]   Saul who was your first king and he was probably stable he was the strongest of
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:55.400]   everyone he was the most athletic everyone on paper he fit what a king
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:01.680]   should be he was that warrior that the people chose but the problem with Saul
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.080]   is he had character flaws he had character issues that pretty soon
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.080]   started affecting his leadership to the point where he was disqualified from
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:16.280]   leadership and God had to find a new leader and we know the story he finds it
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.520]   in this young shepherd boy in David when Samuel the Prophet goes to Jesse he's
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.880]   in there bring all your sons I want anoint the next king and Jesse forgets
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:33.560]   David because he's out in the field tending his father's sheep story goes he
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.520]   defeats Goliath and later on he is chased after Saul who tries to murder
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:44.080]   him all of that and he ultimately becomes king he doesn't become just any
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:50.040]   king he becomes the greatest King Israel besides Jesus later on becomes the
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:57.680]   greatest king that Israel ever sees he builds the first temple everything but
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:03.280]   he makes one fatal flaw what happens with him in Bathsheba and eventually
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:09.160]   with Uriah the Hittite completely destroys his kingdom his leadership and
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:16.240]   he now even though he regrets it there is ultimatums there is all of the
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:21.520]   repercussions to the mistakes that he makes and pretty soon it goes to his
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:28.680]   other son Solomon well Solomon unlike David and also Saul was the smartest of
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.800]   all three of them he merely asked God for wisdom and God gave him wisdom and
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:42.960]   he was the wisest of all the Kings but lust and women got in the way and pretty
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:48.160]   soon he was deterred because his focus once on other things besides pleasing
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:56.080]   the Lord and here we are at the end of Solomon's rule a civil war breaks out
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:01.080]   the stability that they have faced even though it was run by weird leaders here
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:06.440]   and there a civil war breaks out and there the nation is divided into a
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:12.360]   northern kingdom which is referred to as Israel where the story of Elijah takes
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:18.840]   place the northern kingdom and a southern kingdom referred to as Judah in
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:26.200]   the northern kingdom they had 19 Kings during that span and all of them were
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:32.120]   wicked all of them were wicked according to scripture it's sort of like what
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.960]   what happened during Joshua during the days of judges when Joshua passed away
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:41.120]   these judges took over and a lot of times one of the phrases that you see in
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:46.720]   judges over and over again is that they did evil in the eyes of the Lord same
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:52.880]   thing is happening here in the southern kingdom they had 17 Kings now out of the
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:59.080]   17 eight of them followed the Lord but nine of them were wicked they were
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:04.240]   taken over later on by the Babylonians and it becomes the setting for Nehemiah
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:09.120]   and Ezra because the walls of Jerusalem are destroyed and you remember Nehemiah
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:16.480]   he is the cupbearer for the king he has a burden to rebuild those walls and now
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:24.440]   we dive into first Kings chapter 17 verses 1 to 7 I don't need those slides
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:31.440]   anymore if you guys mind taking that off as well - first Kings chapter 17 verses
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:43.200]   1 to 7 now Elijah the Tishbit of Tishbi in Gilead said to Ahab as the Lord the
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:50.200]   God of Israel lives before whom I stand there shall be neither dew nor rain
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:56.120]   these years except by my word let's break it down in terms of this passage
[00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:00.960]   it's first a little bit now Elijah a lot of times now for those who I got a
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:04.240]   chance to meet with a bunch of different Moody students and sometimes you want to
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:08.160]   look at the original languages I still remember taking my two semesters at
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.800]   Greek and you're always looking at the original Old Testament language that was
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:16.040]   written in Greek I don't always like going there but there is one point I do
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:21.760]   want to make about that Elijah in the original Hebrew language because the Old
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:30.080]   Testament was written in Greek in Hebrew Elijah is translated as literally my God
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:35.560]   is Jehovah you have the L you have the job with the I in the middle literally
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:44.520]   my God is Jehovah that is what Elijah's is translate name is translated to
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:53.520]   Elijah the Tishbit of Tishbi in Gilead now where in the world is that if you
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:59.040]   ask the folks who wrote the original passage they don't know if you ask the
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:05.080]   people now who are scholars where this was they don't know they know it's
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:10.880]   somewhere in Gilead but do they know where it is not really it's probably
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:17.960]   some rural area small little town that no has been to my brother actually have
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:23.960]   a twin brother he recently moved from Chicago and he lives in Payson Arizona
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:30.680]   has any of you guys ever been to Payson Arizona it is two and a half hours away
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:36.400]   from the nearest airport it is an hour away from the nearest Costco the
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:41.920]   internet over there is 3g I went there to visit I'm sure what in the world did
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:47.960]   I walk myself into it feels like you've gone 10 15 years back I was trying to
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:52.440]   get an uber and they said there's no over I said how do people get around they
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:56.120]   said well there's this phone call of this guy that you call and he could come
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:02.200]   and pick you up I said really and so here Elijah comes from this small little
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:09.160]   town that no one the Tishbit of Tishbi in Gilead and he says to Ahab is the
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:15.880]   Lord the God of Israel lives there shall be neither dew nor rain these years
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:23.240]   except by my word so somehow this guy my God is Jehovah translated that's what
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:29.560]   his name means who comes from this rural area it's a meeting with the king how he
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:33.160]   gets the meeting with the king I have no idea somehow he gets a meeting with the
[00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:38.600]   king so he stands there and he just says in one word because we didn't know
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:42.480]   anything about Elijah he just makes his first appearance in chapter 17 and he
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:48.520]   says to him Ahab there'll be neither dew nor rain these years except by my word
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:57.640]   okay he I get the feeling he's kind of rough around the edges he kind of says
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:03.280]   whatever is in his mind you recognize some of those guys right I mean we see
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:07.040]   that even in scriptures we see that with the prophets Jeremiah was kind of rough
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:10.800]   around the edges Paul definitely was rough around the edges Paul said
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:15.540]   whatever was I I think Paul lacked a lot of that social grace a lot of that so
[00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:19.800]   the social interaction John the Baptist was definitely like that as well too and
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:24.480]   here Elijah kind of just says whatever is on his mind and he directly says to
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:30.840]   him you're not gonna get dew nor rain these years except by my word now why
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:36.480]   was this so important why was holding off dew and rain so important to the
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:41.460]   story to understand that you don't need to turn to that let me turn it read to
[00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:51.600]   you first Kings chapter 16 verse 9 first Kings 16 in the 38th year of as Asa king
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:59.720]   of Judah southern kingdom now Ahab the son of Omri began to reign over Israel
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:05.160]   northern kingdom where the story takes place northern Sunder Kingdom and Ahab
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:15.120]   the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria for 22 years so in the northern
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:21.720]   kingdom Samaria is the capital now if you think through John chapter 4 Jesus
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:25.320]   and the Samaritan woman Jews don't go through Samaria you're beginning to
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:32.440]   understand why capital city is in Samaria and Ahab the son of Omri did
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:39.000]   evil in the sight of the Lord more than all who were before him so what you're
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.480]   saying there and remember we talked in background there was 19 kings in the
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:46.000]   northern kingdom all of them were bad there isn't a good one all of them were
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:52.360]   bad you're telling me Ahab was the worst of all of them he was the most evil of
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:57.280]   all of them that's it and as if it has been a light thing for him to walk in
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:03.360]   the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat he took for his wife Jezebel the daughter
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:09.820]   of Ethel king of the Sidonians wait Jezebel why is that important if you go
[00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:14.000]   and we do not have time to go through each of the kings in first Kings it
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:21.840]   always mentions the name of the king but never the wife never the Queen for the
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:26.540]   first time we hear Jezebel we see Jezebel the wife and the Queen is
[00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:31.360]   mentioned later on as we look throughout the stories Elijah in the next few months
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:36.800]   that we talk about this Jezebel plays a huge role because she's even more evil
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:41.080]   than Ahab I actually think she's the strings behind why Ahab's the person
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:46.460]   that he is Jezebel plays a key role here in this and so the author wants to tell
[00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:52.200]   us hey look Ahab was bad there is Jezebel lurking and she is pure evil and
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:57.440]   that's the story that we have and from that point on they went and served Baal and
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:04.440]   worshipped him he erected an altar for Baal in the house of Baal which he built
[00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:11.760]   in Samaria the capital all right why is that important what is Baal then? Baal is
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:18.560]   a god of lightning and storm and responsible for the fertility of the
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:25.520]   land they built Baal because they trusted and were gonna place their trust
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:30.360]   in Baal that he was gonna make their land fertile he was gonna bring rain he
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:35.720]   was gonna bring everything and they were all gonna benefit that and here Elijah
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:42.900]   comes and says really you're gonna put a god that you're gonna worship in the
[00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:48.120]   nation of Israel so that they could bring you fertility of land interesting
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:56.360]   I'm gonna bring my God and up you one and I am gonna withhold rain and dew
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:16:02.640]   until I say so let's see what your God does with that I think as Christ
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:08.920]   followers we tend to do the same thing don't we it's not like we have statues
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:14.160]   it's not like we built altars like the Asherah pole all that stuff I think
[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:19.760]   sometimes we do have these little gods that we have in our life things that we
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:24.880]   place our trust in that we think will bring our success and achieve our goals
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:29.440]   maybe that's in the form of relationships if I could get that one
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:34.280]   relationship that guy or that girl or if I could get that one job or their career
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:39.320]   path that job that opens the door and that would achieve all my goals all
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:45.200]   right if I can have this much money and we establish these little gods we're
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:52.040]   still following Christ we still believe in Christ but God Christ and God becomes
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:57.360]   a little God amongst all these other gods that we have and we pretty soon
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:02.600]   start putting our trust in multiple things now here's the one thing it
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:09.280]   doesn't happen overnight it's not like one day we wake up one day and say all
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:12.600]   right Lord I followed after you but you're not it and so I'm gonna follow
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:16.200]   everyone in people and then as a result here we go it doesn't happen like that
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:22.960]   it happens in little decisions that we make in the adventures of our life let
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:29.520]   me give you an example I had a pastor friend who I loved dearly I really
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:36.680]   really respected he was so influential influential on my life growing up as a
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:43.760]   pastor he soon started getting frustrated at church politics it started
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:47.680]   happening he says I don't like this church politics I'm sick and tired of it
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:52.520]   then from that point I started becoming money problems we don't have enough
[00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:58.920]   money as a pastor and with four or five kids growing if I had enough money life
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:05.200]   wouldn't be so hard eventually he left the pastorate and church and then want
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:10.360]   to become a pastor he got a secular job in the corporate world he got more money
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:17.480]   and he started enjoying that money and he started realizing wow this money
[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:23.880]   helps open doors for many different things and you begin to see pastorate
[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:29.040]   didn't have money got tired of church politics from that point on now he has
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:34.040]   money and he's beginning to put his trust in that money now that money opens
[00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:38.800]   doors for him to do traveling to go to nicer restaurants all of those things I
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:47.640]   like this pursuit this is pretty good it opens doors on Sundays it's okay if I
[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:54.600]   miss miss church service it's okay if I don't get fellowship and you start
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:19:00.480]   distancing away politics he soon gets frustrated with a lot of the right wing
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:05.680]   and all the other stuff so he gets frustrated and pretty soon he stops
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:10.640]   believing the Bible the Bible is no longer the central authority maybe the
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:16.040]   Bible was wrong maybe people aren't imperfect when he wrote the Bible and
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:23.680]   now he's completely gone I sat there with him not too long ago he says how do
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:31.560]   you still have hope because I lost hope a while ago it doesn't happen overnight
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:36.600]   we walk in there when we come to accept Christ with our focus we're gonna follow
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:41.840]   Christ we're gonna do all our but alongside of it different aspects in our
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:51.440]   life start getting in our way it starts affecting our life and so every single
[00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:57.480]   day right we have to and here's a good illustration we're so used to in this
[00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:01.800]   technology in Chrome and Google world and everything like that to enter our
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:06.840]   password login password and suddenly a notice pops up says would you like to
[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:10.360]   remember this password yes because I don't want to sit there manual entering
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:15.360]   my password every day but yet at the same time we log in and everything's
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:18.480]   there we get our Google Chrome we get our Google Drive we get Dropbox
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:25.960]   everything like that but every single day we have to log in again every day we
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:32.880]   have to manually log in and choose to follow Christ and commit to follow
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:41.880]   Christ each and every single day because when we do not we start establishing
[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:49.440]   these little gods and it begins to move us away from who our primary focus is
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:55.560]   life is not sitting there what these days I just realized chat GPT is not
[00:20:55.560 --> 00:21:00.240]   chat GPT where I sit there and say hey what's the sermon for first Kings 17 in
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:04.360]   two minutes it spits out my sermon it's not me sitting there and logging in my
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:08.520]   password and for the rest of my life it logs me in no every day it logs me off
[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:15.080]   and every day I got restart the process I got redo the process I got recommit
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:21.440]   every single day now look at here's the one thing I forgot or actually not
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:27.160]   forgot but here's the part that I glance over look at verse 1 right here's what he
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:32.560]   says you're gonna have neither do nor rain these years and he says as the Lord
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:39.160]   the God of Israel lives underline this portion this next phrase I'm gonna read
[00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:44.400]   underline it highlight it because it becomes the theme of this passage and
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:57.120]   all of Elijah's life before whom I stand that's his thing that's his motivation
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:06.280]   it is the Lord before whom I stand and that is why I'm confronting you a how
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:16.560]   that is why I'm doing what I'm doing before whom I stand motivation informs
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:22.880]   action the actions of a Christian is good you could go to church and do all
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:25.760]   these things you go small group all of these things great
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:33.680]   what's your motivation Elijah's motivation is before whom I stand your
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:39.600]   motivation informs your action your commitment before the Lord if you
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:44.760]   believe truly that you have the same vision that Elijah has that I stand for
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:49.640]   here because I follow the Lord before whom I stand it changes how you approach
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:55.120]   work it changes how you approach your life as a spouse how you treat your wife
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:23:00.320]   how you treat your husband it affects you and how you treat your family if
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:05.160]   facts you in terms of how you treat people you don't like your boss your
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:11.400]   co-workers you don't like you excel at doing work every day you excel and not
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:16.080]   being lazy at work you excel at school you don't cheat at school because all of
[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:23.600]   those things because my motivation is before whom I stand
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:29.840]   it's that your motivation is that my motivation or do we just go through the
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:38.880]   routines of action every single day Elijah my God is Jehovah comes out of
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:46.160]   nowhere from tish be the way knows where tish be is a tells a ham this is what's
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:53.560]   gonna happen why because my motivation is from the person before whom I stand
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:24:02.040]   keep going verse 2 and the word of the Lord came to him depart from me and turn
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:08.680]   eastward and hide yourself by the brook a chariot which is east of the Jordan
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:14.000]   you shall drink from the brook and I have commanded the Ravens to feed you
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:20.080]   there so he went and did according to the Lord the word of the Lord he went
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:24.600]   and lived by the brook chariot that is east of the Jordan and the Ravens
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:27.920]   brought him bread and meat in the morning and bread and meat in the
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:34.560]   evening and he drank from the brook and after a while the brook dried up because
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:40.020]   there was no rain in the land a couple things I want to say about this number
[00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:44.200]   one I was very intrigued by the Raven and I spent a lot of time trying to
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:47.960]   understand so how did the Raven bring him food did the Raven just sit there
[00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:51.800]   and just go on his shoulder and bring him food and all that so I had to
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:55.120]   understand that a little bit so pretty much I think one of the reasons why God
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:58.840]   was telling him about the Raven you know how Ravens bring food they sit there and
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:03.440]   they get wrapped the food and they fly to mountain cliffs and they put it in
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:09.200]   different holes and so I'm assuming that as different scholars are writing that
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:14.280]   Elijah just had to spot where the Ravens were coming every day what holes they
[00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:18.840]   were gonna put in and there his food was versus a Raven lands on his arm and
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:23.800]   brings the food and eats it and so there a lot of times that's how God is and
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:32.040]   also another thing that's important God opens and closes doors as he sees fit
[00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:42.160]   God opens and closes doors as he sees fit why in the world did he leave Elijah
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:49.800]   away was it because he wanted him to rest maybe did he want Elijah be
[00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:55.720]   protected because Ahab was gonna go after him maybe did he want Elijah to
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:59.840]   spend some time in solitude as he can do the work on his character his inner life
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:06.600]   maybe maybe have been combination of all three but God has a plan and God opens
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:12.680]   and chooses and closes door as he sees fit but yet at the same time God is in
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:19.240]   the midst of always working in your life God is always in the midst at pulling
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:23.280]   you at certain points in your life taking you away from things to continue
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:28.080]   to allow you to be in solitude to learn the inner workings the inner character
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:34.600]   the inner struggles your mental health your emotional health of your life he
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:40.560]   did that with Moses he did that with Joseph over in jail he did that with
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:45.040]   David when he was a little shepherd boy tending sheep fighting bears and lions
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:51.040]   he did that with Jesus for 40 days 40 nights he did that when Mary and Martha
[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:56.320]   Martha had to learn that because Martha was so busy preparing for the arrival of
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:27:06.360]   Jesus that she forgot what was important God begins to work in the quietness the
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:14.360]   solitude of his life and begins to transform you in the person that he
[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:24.240]   wants you to be take a quick look at the end of 17 the last verse we started the
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:32.920]   story by introducing you to Elijah the Tishbit of Tishbi from Gilead at the end
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:42.040]   of 17 the woman said to Elijah now I know that you are a man of God and that
[00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:50.040]   the word of the Lord in your mouth is truth he is no longer Elijah the Tishbit
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:59.720]   of Tishbi in Gilead but he is now a man of the Lord and all his word is truth
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:07.280]   from the Lord God begins to work in the transformation in all of our lives to
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:13.280]   shape us into the person he wants us to be but he leads us on that journey and
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:19.900]   too often is done in what he calls us to do but it is also done in solitude as he
[00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:24.960]   begins to work in all of our hearts to help you to become that person a couple
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:33.040]   applications as we wrap up number one God uses people we least expect to do
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:42.000]   his work God uses people we least expect to do his work we don't get a chance we
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.320]   don't get any understanding of who Elijah is he appears out of the blue and
[00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:52.960]   we immediately know that his name means my God is Jehovah we also know that he
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:58.200]   comes from a city or a town or rural area that we're not even familiar where
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:04.880]   he lives and he comes out of nowhere and God uses people we least expect to do
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:11.840]   his work and that means a lot of times never count yourself out never disregard
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:18.840]   yourself of how God can use you you may not be smart enough that's okay you may
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:23.880]   not be talented enough that's okay you may be shy you may be a little awkward
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:29.320]   socially awkward at times that's okay you may have baggage in your life all of
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:35.920]   those things that's okay never count yourself out never count yourself out
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:40.560]   because of your age definitely never count yourself out because of your sex
[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:44.760]   because men and women could do wonderful things never count yourself out because
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:53.200]   of your skin color never count yourself out because God uses and worse in the
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:59.400]   people we least expect it to number two God's methods are unique and different
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:06.120]   God has us on each a unique journey all of our journeys are different our life
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:09.840]   sometimes is a culmination of bad or good that God weaves in and now
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:14.320]   continue to mold you and shape you into the person that he wants you to be our
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:18.840]   interactions our relationship with our family our siblings our friends our
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:23.960]   experience within church all of that because of God's methods are unique and
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:28.920]   different he may call you here in Chinatown next week he may call you to
[00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:32.640]   Hong Kong he may call you in the full-time ministry pull you out full-time
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:37.080]   ministry all of those things his methods are unique and different sometimes we
[00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:41.040]   will never understand it sometimes it and most times it will not go according
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:47.640]   to plan because but at the same time number three God's direction include
[00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:53.680]   God's provision God's direction includes God's provision because as much as he
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:59.240]   calls you he will provide now not in the way you want him to provide probably not
[00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:05.720]   in a very smooth way not in an easy way but God's direction includes God's
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:11.880]   provision just like the Raven comes just like the Brooke comes God provides
[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:18.320]   probably not in the way we expect it to but he opens and closes doors as he sees
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:24.000]   fit and we have to be careful those doors be watching for those doors
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.440]   praying for those doors praying for open and praying for closed doors that he
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:32.960]   continues to make known those doors far for guide us in everything that we do
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:38.640]   and we look upon our entire journey we think that we're studying for one career
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:43.640]   well that door suddenly closed it moves to another career I have a friend whose
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:49.280]   house I was just at the other day I sat down with her and her husband after 25
[00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:55.080]   years in one company she was just informed this past week she's being laid
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:32:04.120]   off with no severance after 25 years it's the only thing she's done for 25
[00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:09.200]   years since graduating from college and she's wondering Lord what are you asking
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:16.200]   me to do because I am NOT trained in anything else and she's asking for the
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:20.960]   Lord to make it clear to her what she wants her to do you may be asking that
[00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:24.680]   same thing for those who are in college right now you're a senior in college and
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:28.320]   all your life you followed school a direct path and now you're about to
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:33.040]   graduate you don't know what that path is some of you are thinking about global
[00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:36.600]   missions or returning back home to your country or wherever you are or switching
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:41.400]   careers or even getting married you don't know you pray for open doors you
[00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:47.520]   pray for closed doors God uses people we least expect to do his work his methods
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:52.080]   are unique and different his direction includes God's provisions God's
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:33:01.160]   direction includes his provision for our motivation is before whom we stand that
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:07.960]   you and I are here because of one thing the Lord before whom we stand that is
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:14.240]   our motivation our motivation informs our actions it's why we do what we do
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:19.160]   it's why we treat people the way we treat people because of the motivation
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:24.360]   that we have for the Lord and you will see as we journey through Elijah will he
[00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:31.280]   be perfect no he will not be perfect but he will get to that point that he paves
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:36.440]   the way for John the Baptist who paves the way for Jesus Christ who paves the
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:40.920]   way for the gospel that you and I believe in and on that day later on when
[00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:46.680]   Jesus stands on the transfer on the mountain for his transfiguration there
[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:53.960]   stands Moses and there stands Elijah Elijah the tishbit of tishbi from
[00:33:53.960 --> 00:34:01.240]   Gilead is standing right there God opens and closes doors as he sees fit and uses
[00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:09.240]   us in ways we can never ever expect let's pray father thank you for the
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:15.240]   wonderful story of Elijah a guy who seemingly came out of nowhere who was
[00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:19.560]   kind of rough around the edges and kind of says whatever is on his mind but
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:25.120]   somehow you used him and you will continue to use them on this journey
[00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:32.200]   because he really believed that he stood before you the Lord before whom I stand
[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:37.800]   I hope that is a reminder for all of us that we have that same model in our life
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:43.280]   we have that same motivation in our life that motivation informs us in any
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:49.000]   everything that we do thank you for the life of Elisha thank you for the words
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:55.720]   of scripture for guiding us and every single day Lord challenge us to log off
[00:34:55.720 --> 00:35:02.200]   and log on and begin another day of following after you Christ would pray
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:06.360]   mark thank you
