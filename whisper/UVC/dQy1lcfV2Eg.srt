1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,120
 It is great to be here, to be with you guys, and I want to thank all of you last week for

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,320
 covering the operation here and we can continue to worship God.

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:17,320
 And thank God for a safe journey to serve the churches in Toronto.

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:25,040
 And I want to thank the team of people that came with me and they took care of a lot of

5
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:31,400
 things for me, setting up the booth for the Bible conference and that includes Andrea

6
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,880
 and Sam and Brenda and Amanda.

7
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:42,480
 So they came with me and took care of a lot of stuff.

8
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,200
 Originally I thought I could take care of it by myself but actually they helped me a

9
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,200
 lot.

10
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:56,760
 So it was a blessing to be able to serve other churches and other Christians in other areas.

11
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:05,760
 But again we come back and we have a very interesting development in the presidential

12
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,520
 election and everyone has their attention on this.

13
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,960
 And now that it doesn't settle, we have the President-elect Donald Trump.

14
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,680
 He's going to be in the White House in the next term.

15
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,400
 And it was a big question when I was in Canada.

16
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,040
 Everyone is asking me, "Hey, who's going to be elected?"

17
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:29,440
 And it's like I can foretell the future.

18
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:34,000
 But there's a lot of discussions about who's going to be in the White House.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:43,840
 But in any case, every four years we have this change of who is in power and which political

20
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,760
 party and political figures are going to be in the White House.

21
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:56,800
 That's why we have this mini-series I want to inject into our thinking and our reflection

22
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,680
 on the Bible.

23
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,200
 This series is called "Who is Your Lord?"

24
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,080
 And the Pagan Kings in the Bible.

25
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:09,640
 And I would like to take some of the samples from the Bible, especially from the Old Testament.

26
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:14,380
 As you can see from the biblical history, from the pages of the Bible, you have a lot

27
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:21,160
 of different kings and kingdoms and empires rise and fall in the entire biblical history.

28
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:26,800
 All the way from the left you get the Roman Empire, and then Greek, and then Hittite,

29
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:33,560
 and Assyrian Empire, Babylonian Empire, Persian Empire, and down in the south is the Egyptian

30
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,800
 Empire.

31
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,400
 And then in the middle of it, that is the center of the ancient world, the land bridge,

32
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,880
 the land of Israel and Palestine, you got different small kingdoms.

33
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:51,080
 The Arameans and the Philistines, and of course Israel and Judah right in the middle, in the

34
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,200
 shadow of all the empires.

35
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,200
 As you can tell from this map, and you can get the sense from the Bible, that kingdoms

36
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:03,960
 rise and fall, empires rise and fall, and kings do rise and fall.

37
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,760
 Because God is the Lord of history.

38
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,880
 So we want to do this.

39
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:14,360
 We want to go through some of the kings, secular kings, pagan kings in the Bible and see what

40
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,600
 the Bible has to say.

41
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,680
 So this is our procedure.

42
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:23,640
 Our procedure is first introduce the pagan king found in the Bible, recorded in the Bible,

43
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:28,520
 or even named in the Bible, and get their secular profile, you know, like documents

44
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:35,560
 outside of the Bible, what do they say about this and that pagan king, and then we go back

45
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,840
 to the Bible and see what we can reflect upon.

46
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,840
 So this is our procedure.

47
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,040
 We first get the secular profile of the pagan king in this series, and then we go into the

48
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,040
 Bible.

49
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,360
 And the first one I want to choose is, you see the picture there?

50
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,040
 Cyrus the Great.

51
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,360
 So ring any bell?

52
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:02,520
 You know, this king is named in the Bible, in the book of Isaiah, even before he existed.

53
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,400
 So Cyrus the Great.

54
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,760
 This timeline, let me go through this timeline for you.

55
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:12,000
 You see the purple center spectrum?

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,240
 All the way from the left to right is 700 BC, before Christ, 700 years before Christ,

57
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,940
 all the way to 500 BC.

58
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:26,980
 So this period of history, there were a lot happening, as you can tell.

59
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,120
 Let's go through one by one.

60
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,280
 First of all, it's the red one on top.

61
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,280
 You see that?

62
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,280
 What is that kingdom called?

63
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,280
 What is that empire called?

64
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,280
 Assyrian, right?

65
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:44,960
 From 911 BC to 605 BC, and then it declined.

66
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:53,680
 And what happened here during the Assyrian Empire was that the fall of the northern Israel

67
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,700
 kingdom Samaria, the fall of Samaria in 722.

68
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:08,260
 So Assyrians, they attacked the land of Israel and they defeated the northern kingdom Israel

69
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:14,500
 and the capital Samaria fell in 722 BCE.

70
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:21,940
 And all the way down to go south to the southern kingdom, Judah, it was year 701 BC.

71
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:28,140
 And that was when Hezekiah was reigning in Judah.

72
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:36,180
 And the Assyrians blocked all the exits and entrances to the capital Jerusalem, and they

73
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:41,080
 lay siege of the capital, but they failed and they returned.

74
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,780
 So that was 701 BC.

75
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:48,700
 So as I said, Assyrian Empire rise and fall.

76
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:57,820
 At the end of 7th century, about 600 something, it begins to weaken.

77
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:02,660
 And then there were two other superpowers in the Middle East that rise up.

78
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:06,900
 The first one is the blue one, the Median Kingdom, the Median Empire.

79
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:12,660
 And then south of the Median Empire is the Babylonian Empire.

80
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:17,380
 And what happened here is that Babylonians continued to attack and continue to expand

81
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:23,180
 and they came all the way to the southern small kingdom of Judah and they defeated Judah

82
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:29,980
 and fall of Jerusalem happened in 586 BC.

83
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:38,580
 That's when Assyrians fell and then Babylonians took over the entire world, almost the entire

84
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,500
 world of the Middle East.

85
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,860
 And then the Median Kingdom, there was something interesting happened.

86
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:48,340
 It fell to the Persian Empire.

87
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:54,620
 Now what happened to the Persian Empire when it rises was that it's because of Cyrus the

88
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,620
 Great.

89
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:02,340
 Cyrus the Great was a military leader of the Persian people and they rebelled against the

90
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:09,220
 Medes because they have been serving the Median Empire, the overlord for so many years and

91
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,340
 they are fed up.

92
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:18,180
 So they rebelled against it and Cyrus the Great let his people defeated the Medes.

93
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:24,500
 Well, first of all, they rebelled against the Medes in 553 and then within three years

94
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:31,260
 they actually defeat the entire empire of Median Kingdom and they swallow up the entire

95
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,340
 Middle East.

96
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:37,540
 So 539, that is a very important year in the biblical history.

97
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:44,620
 539 BC is Cyrus enters the capital of Babylonian Empire, the city of Babylon, the greatest

98
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,420
 city at that time.

99
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:51,460
 So he entered there peacefully and took over the entire world.

100
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:59,740
 And 539 is also important for the Jews because as you can tell from 586, the Jews were exiled

101
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:08,100
 to Babylon for about 70 years and then 539 when Persian Empire took over the world, they

102
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,860
 reversed the policy of the previous kingdom.

103
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,580
 They don't keep the people, they don't exile the people, they send the people back and

104
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:23,260
 send their temple vessels back to their homeland and Jews were one of them that got the benefit.

105
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:30,780
 So that's when we have the book of Ezra and Nehemiah when they return from Babylon to

106
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:34,840
 Jerusalem and we build a temple and we build the city.

107
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:39,620
 So that is what happened for Cyrus the Great.

108
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:50,660
 Now I want your attention to the last 10 years of the Babylonian Empire which is 555 to 539.

109
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:55,700
 That is the last 10 or so years at the end of Babylonian Empire.

110
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:04,740
 What happened here was that there were two kings, father and son, Nebunidas and Belshazzar.

111
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:10,180
 Father and son taking care of the last period of the Babylonian Empire.

112
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:16,340
 And what happened was that Nebunidas was a very funny king and he didn't worship the

113
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:22,020
 main god, the biggest god in Babylon, the biggest god being Marduk.

114
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:29,780
 And he forsake Marduk and he worship the other god of his own family which is the moon god

115
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:32,380
 called Sin.

116
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:39,780
 So that made a lot of people in Babylon, especially the capital, not very happy.

117
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:46,220
 There were a lot of social tension and a lot of discontent in the society of Babylon.

118
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:53,380
 Like us, some people are being fed up by what is going on in the society and what is going

119
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,820
 on in our nation.

120
00:09:54,820 --> 00:10:02,740
 So they wanted to turn around, they wanted to have someone else in power.

121
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:06,500
 So that is what happened in Babylon in the last 10 years.

122
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:13,540
 Now what happened was that sin is being elevated by Nebunidas.

123
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:18,020
 As you can tell from this stele, from this relief, that is the king Nebunidas on the

124
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:24,340
 right and he is having a staff in his left hand and he is raising his right hand, worshipping

125
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,340
 the three gods.

126
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:29,240
 You see the moon god, you see the moon right?

127
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:34,500
 And then you see the sun and then also the third symbol is Venus.

128
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:39,340
 So he is worshipping the moon and the sun and the stars instead of worshipping the guy

129
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:48,260
 on the left which is Marduk or Merodoth mentioned in the book of Jeremiah.

130
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:54,300
 Now there was tons of huge discontent among the Babylonians.

131
00:10:54,300 --> 00:11:01,320
 If you take the poll in the last 10 years of the Babylonian empire, the last 10 years,

132
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:08,060
 you will get the sense it is very low opinion for Nebunidas and his son Belshazzar who is

133
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,820
 also mentioned in the book of Daniel.

134
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:18,800
 And there was a political vacuum in the last 10 years of the Babylonian empire.

135
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:27,100
 And Cyrus took this opportunity to invade Babylon.

136
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:34,820
 Now you need to understand the ancient context when the king is privileging one god over

137
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:44,340
 the other, privileging sin over Marduk is a huge thing in the ancient world.

138
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:52,260
 In Babylon there is a yearly annual festival called Akitv.

139
00:11:52,260 --> 00:12:00,380
 Every spring around March to April they celebrate because that is when they harvest the wheat

140
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:07,260
 and barley and it is a huge festival and the king has to be there to host the festival

141
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:15,380
 and they will take Marduk the idol out of Marduk's temple and put it on a cart and

142
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:20,660
 then they will do a procession in the capital and it was a huge celebration and it would

143
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:25,460
 determine the destinies of everything for the next year.

144
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:31,260
 So Nebunidas did not do that and that made a lot of people upset.

145
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:38,020
 So Cyrus took this opportunity and he would battle against his overlord the Medes and

146
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:45,500
 then a significant number of military people from the Median empire actually switched sides

147
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:52,580
 to help Cyrus to help him to defeat the Median kingdom and also the Babylonian kingdom and

148
00:12:52,580 --> 00:13:02,140
 finally in 539 BC they defeated the biggest superpower in the world Babylonia.

149
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:07,620
 As you can see all these arrows 553 he would battle against the Medes and then 550 within

150
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:13,660
 3 years he defeated the entire northern Median kingdom and then all the way he invaded to

151
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:21,540
 the left to Lydia defeated the Lydia kingdom and then come back and defeated Elam and 539

152
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:25,980
 as I told you is a very important year in biblical history and world history is that

153
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:32,460
 Cyrus entered the capital of Babylonian empire Babylon.

154
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:38,020
 And we can find some documents outside of the bible that talks about Cyrus the great

155
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:45,260
 and one of the documents is called Cyrus the Cylinder and this round thing has a lot of

156
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:51,420
 inscriptions on it and if you translate it or take an excerpt out of it it talks about

157
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:55,500
 Cyrus what he did to Babylon.

158
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:01,940
 He said I am Cyrus king of the world king of four corners I enter Babylon in peace and

159
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:09,500
 Marduk I daily attend to his worship because Marduk exalted me and have all the kings kiss

160
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:16,020
 my feet and I return the images of the gods and I gather all their peoples and return

161
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,420
 them to their dwellings.

162
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:23,380
 Remember the Jewish people were one of the groups being returned.

163
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:28,120
 Now from this excerpt who is Cyrus?

164
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:34,180
 Is he a worshipper of Yahweh the true God?

165
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:37,180
 No he worshiped the false gods.

166
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:44,620
 He worshiped Marduk in fact as a Persian he not only worshipped Marduk the Babylonian

167
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:52,500
 god he worshipped his Persian god the great god of the Persian religion is called Ahura

168
00:14:52,500 --> 00:15:00,260
 Masta that was a Persian great god if you drive a master car you know what that means

169
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:03,660
 master in Persian means wisdom.

170
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:11,140
 So he is actually a polytheistic person and he worshipped different gods and as you can

171
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:21,540
 tell from the context Cyrus was a pragmatic politician he took the advantage of Babylonian

172
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:27,700
 vacuum political vacuum and he invaded Babylonian empire.

173
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:34,540
 Now he let the captives free he let some of the Jewish people go back to Jerusalem not

174
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:40,660
 because he is kind or not because he is compassionate.

175
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:46,580
 Is that he is pragmatic he wanted to reverse the policy from Babylonian empire and let

176
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:52,260
 these people go as long as they don't rebel against him and he will consolidate his power.

177
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:57,620
 So as you can tell he is a polytheistic worshipper he worshipped false gods and he is also a

178
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:06,300
 pragmatic politician much like today all politicians are pragmatic and you have to be pragmatic.

179
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,860
 Now with that context we can go to the Bible.

180
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,820
 What does the Bible say about Cyrus the great?

181
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:15,780
 We find his name being mentioned in Isaiah 44 and 45.

182
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:20,100
 Let me read this passage to you.

183
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:26,060
 And remember Isaiah has two parts the first part is chapter 1 to 39 that is what we call

184
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:31,380
 first Isaiah and then chapter 40 all the way to the end sometimes we call it second Isaiah

185
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,820
 the second part of Isaiah.

186
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:41,700
 The second part of Isaiah from 40 to all the way to 66 is a prophecy bunch of prophecies

187
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:49,140
 talking to the Jewish captives in Babylon and how God will have compassion on them and

188
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:52,300
 to lead them to return to give them hope.

189
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:59,260
 That is what Isaiah 40 all the way to 66 is giving them hope and telling them Yahweh

190
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:03,500
 the true God will be faithful to them even though they have sinned against him and he

191
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:07,620
 will forgive their sin and he will lead his people back to their homeland.

192
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:12,980
 So that is the context of 44 chapter 44.

193
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:18,780
 So God is telling his people Israel he said remember this things O Jacob for you are my

194
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:25,980
 servant O Israel I have made you you are my servant O Israel I will not forget you return

195
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:30,020
 to me for I have redeemed you.

196
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:37,460
 And God is the one who sets off Cyrus Cyrus the great the politician he is my shepherd

197
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:40,660
 and will accomplish all that I please.

198
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:45,660
 He will say of Jerusalem let it be rebuilt and to the temple let its foundation be laid

199
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:54,220
 and this passage continues to tell us something more about Cyrus in the sight of God.

200
00:17:54,220 --> 00:18:02,900
 God said what this is what the Lord Yahweh says to his anointed to Cyrus whose right

201
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:09,060
 hand I take hold of to subdue nations before him and to strip kings of their armor and

202
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:15,260
 open doors before him the doors of the empire doors of other people and nations including

203
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:21,140
 Babylon so that gates will not be shut will be open to Cyrus the great.

204
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:27,660
 Now what is amazing what is interesting here is that not only Cyrus name is being called

205
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:35,780
 out before he exists remember Isaiah prophesied this 100 years before Cyrus existed not only

206
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:44,900
 his name is being mentioned here but also he is being called his anointed his anointed.

207
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:53,340
 That's interesting because a pagan king is being called the anointed.

208
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,820
 That is pretty remarkable.

209
00:18:55,820 --> 00:19:03,680
 Now you go back to the timeline you see Isaiah there 740-700 that's when Isaiah was a prophet

210
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:10,840
 and he was serving the sovereign kingdom Judah in the midst of the crisis from Assyrian empire.

211
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:20,660
 So before Cyrus existed in Isaiah his name was mentioned and not only his name was mentioned

212
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:24,660
 he was being called God's anointed.

213
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:31,660
 Now immediately we thought ok anointed the Messiah so often we have this Jesus figure

214
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:37,780
 in our head right whenever Messiah is being mentioned in our songs or in the Bible so

215
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:43,580
 often we say ok he is the Messiah the capital M Messiah the savior of the world Jesus Christ

216
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,700
 himself there is only one Messiah.

217
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:53,620
 So we always have this sacred notion to the word Messiah but again you need to understand

218
00:19:53,620 --> 00:20:01,620
 these kind of sacred notion got picked up later in biblical history in the new testament

219
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:08,020
 but in the old testament whenever the word anointed or Messiah is being used it does

220
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:13,860
 not necessarily mean that someone is sacred or someone is pleasing to God.

221
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:19,340
 In fact so often someone who is being anointed is not pleasing to God.

222
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:26,620
 For example in 1 Samuel 10 verse 1 it speaks of the first king of Israel King Saul remember

223
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:30,620
 that guy King Saul and after King Saul is David right.

224
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:37,340
 King Saul is being said to be anointed the prophet Samuel took a flask of oil and poured

225
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:43,660
 it on the head of Saul and kissed him and said has not the Lord Yahweh anointed you

226
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,980
 leader over his inheritance his people.

227
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:55,340
 So Saul is being mentioned or being referred to as the Messiah same word anointed.

228
00:20:55,340 --> 00:21:03,260
 Now as you can remember was King Saul a king pleasing to God?

229
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:11,800
 No right he was actually rebellious to the kingship of God and that's why God raised

230
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,340
 up another king David to replace him.

231
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,340
 However Saul is being called the anointed.

232
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:24,420
 So as I said anointed does not mean that he is sacred and this is the same way for the

233
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:27,740
 pagan kings in the bible especially Cyrus the great.

234
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:35,380
 Even Cyrus the great was being named and is being called the anointed of Yahweh does not

235
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:39,340
 mean he is a true believer of Yahweh.

236
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:44,500
 In fact he is pagan as we can tell from other documents outside of the bible.

237
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:52,060
 You know in the bible the pagan king is used by God for God's glory.

238
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:55,980
 The pagan king is never put on a pedestal.

239
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:59,540
 He never gets the glory.

240
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,420
 God gets the glory.

241
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:08,540
 Whoever is in the white house, whoever is in power, whoever is serving the term in our

242
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:11,900
 world in the ancient world.

243
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:15,420
 God gets the glory because God is in charge.

244
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:22,860
 Isaiah 45 actually says this, it says the whole point of raising up Cyrus as the anointed

245
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:26,100
 one is to gain glory for himself.

246
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,700
 God says this.

247
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:34,340
 God gets the glory because he controls every move of the political figures and the kings

248
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:36,580
 and kingdoms and empires on earth.

249
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:43,820
 Isaiah 45 verse 5 it says I am the Lord Yahweh and there is no other apart from me there

250
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,220
 is no God.

251
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:50,700
 I form the light and create darkness.

252
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:54,180
 I bring prosperity and create disaster.

253
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:58,580
 I the Lord Yahweh do all these things.

254
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:03,780
 You can see from the translation here I give you in parenthesis the Hebrew words.

255
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:11,820
 Yasa being translated form, Bara often times being translated create and then Asab translated

256
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,300
 bringing or doing.

257
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:20,100
 Now these kind of words, these words are often used in Genesis 1.

258
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:23,980
 Now immediately we have some theological questions here.

259
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:27,460
 We ask the question of the problem of evil.

260
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:31,460
 How can God create darkness and disaster?

261
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:34,500
 Is he the origin or the author of evil?

262
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,620
 Is God the author of evil?

263
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:39,540
 No, no of course not.

264
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:45,260
 But we are troubled with these words because we as modern readers we always try to understand

265
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:49,140
 these words from a materialistic point of view.

266
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:55,480
 Like God in Genesis 1 created everything we just thought ok it has to be God creating

267
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,180
 something out of nothing.

268
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:04,460
 It's a material process, it's a material creation manufacturing process that we have in mind.

269
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:09,580
 But in the ancient world that is not what they meant.

270
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:15,860
 In the ancient world in Genesis 1 and in Isaiah 45 when they used these words they are not

271
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:19,660
 talking about material or creating something out of nothing.

272
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:24,900
 It's not talking about God creating disasters out of nothing.

273
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,700
 Calamity out of nothing.

274
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,700
 There is an evil out of nothing.

275
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,620
 It's not talking about that.

276
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:32,980
 These kind of words are talking about management.

277
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:36,980
 Talking about God is in control of everything.

278
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:43,460
 Good things and even bad things is still under the control in the hands of God.

279
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:47,300
 So God has good and evil in his hands.

280
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:51,980
 Never have anything that happened in our lives or in our world that would be outside of God's

281
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:52,980
 control.

282
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:53,980
 That's what they meant.

283
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:58,660
 That's what these Hebrew words are trying to mean.

284
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:02,000
 So God would allow evil to happen.

285
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,420
 Or even a pagan king like Cyrus the Great to control the world.

286
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:13,160
 That does not mean they are out of God's hands.

287
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:18,940
 God has everything, the good and the evil in his control.

288
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:24,180
 Just like today when your boss tells you, can you create a department or a team to take

289
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,300
 care of this task?

290
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,460
 You heard the word create.

291
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:34,620
 You would not think, ok, how can I create a team of people out of nothing?

292
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:38,820
 Because he is not talking about manufacturing material process.

293
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,420
 He is talking about management.

294
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:46,620
 You create a team, it means you have a team in charge to perform a task being assigned

295
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:47,620
 to you.

296
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:50,740
 It is the same way in the biblical words.

297
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,740
 Here it talks about reorganization.

298
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:56,460
 It talks about management.

299
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,980
 Do you play chess?

300
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,180
 Anyone here?

301
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:02,220
 Anyone who is good at playing chess?

302
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,220
 I am very bad.

303
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,220
 I am very bad.

304
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,100
 I am very bad.

305
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:13,580
 But if you play chess, if you observe the game of a great chess player and watch how

306
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:22,660
 he makes every move and defeats his opponent, sometimes the move he makes, I don't understand.

307
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:28,620
 Sometimes the moves that he makes or the strategies that he has in mind, I cannot comprehend.

308
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:35,060
 Until at the end of the game, that I saw something amazing happen.

309
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:43,220
 So the great chess player sometimes makes a move that is beyond my comprehension, where

310
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:46,940
 he plays up a pagan king.

311
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,420
 That is beyond my understanding.

312
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:53,300
 That is beyond my so-called plan.

313
00:26:53,300 --> 00:27:00,620
 But at the end of the game, you will see the wisdom of the great chess player.

314
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:06,380
 And at the end of the game, if you go to the game board, you would not praise the chess

315
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,380
 pieces.

316
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:12,400
 You would not pick up the chess pieces and say, "Wow, those pieces are very amazing.

317
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:19,560
 They can do amazing moves, unpredictable moves, and finally they win the game."

318
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,820
 You would not praise the chess pieces.

319
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:25,460
 The glory and victory go to the chess player.

320
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,480
 The one who is in control.

321
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,900
 The one who controls everything and every piece, every move on the game board.

322
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:36,620
 It is the same way Isaiah is talking about.

323
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:41,380
 He is saying that God's people need to know that we need to acknowledge the sovereignty

324
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:46,060
 of the one true king, Yahweh, Jesus Christ our Lord.

325
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:52,420
 And our allegiance and our faithfulness is always on the only one true God.

326
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,060
 The God of history.

327
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:56,220
 The God of our nation.

328
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:59,500
 The God that is to be worshipped.

329
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:07,460
 Whether the pagan king in the White House or the pagan king in power, whether he will

330
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:14,860
 implement policies that would seem favorable to us or not, there is only one true God and

331
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,580
 one true king.

332
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,900
 And he is in heaven.

333
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:25,940
 Isaiah 49 says, "God says, 'It is too small a thing for you to be my servant to restore

334
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:31,780
 the tribes of Jacob and bring back those of Israel I have kept.

335
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:39,620
 I will also not only return the people to their land and their exile, but I will also

336
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:42,260
 do one thing more amazing.

337
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:47,780
 Is that I will make you the people of God a light for the Gentiles, that you may bring

338
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:52,740
 my salvation to the ends of the earth.'"

339
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:55,100
 You see what is going on here.

340
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:59,140
 There is only one God, one true king in the universe.

341
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:02,940
 And he is above all political powers.

342
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,900
 Kingdoms rise and fall.

343
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:10,980
 However there is only one God who is eternally ruling, reigning over all of us.

344
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:14,300
 In our nation, in your personal life.

345
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:19,020
 And not only that, God says, "I will do something more.

346
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,020
 I will raise you up.

347
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:26,220
 I want to raise you up to be the light for the Gentiles, for the nations.

348
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:33,740
 And with you, you can bring salvation, the gospel to the ends of the earth."

349
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:38,940
 What a timely word and what timely reminder that we have.

350
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:47,300
 Because the Christian public witness in our nation is at all time low.

351
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,700
 People look at us.

352
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,660
 People go to church.

353
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:54,380
 People profess the name of Jesus Christ.

354
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:59,980
 They look at us like you guys are hypocrites.

355
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:05,980
 You belong to the religious establishment.

356
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,820
 It's a timely word for us.

357
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:13,340
 And the Christian public witness is at all time low.

358
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:15,380
 Especially in our nation.

359
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:21,140
 And sometimes it's tempting for us to put too much faith on human kings.

360
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:27,540
 I remember I was in seminary class and I heard the professor talking about Cyrus, Isaiah

361
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,540
 44 and 45.

362
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:35,620
 And he's trying to spin the story that Cyrus the Great was probably converted to be a believer,

363
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:37,700
 to be a believer of Yahweh.

364
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:41,820
 That's why he was favorable to the Jewish people and let them return.

365
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:50,020
 Now that was in the old days when we didn't have much extra biblical document.

366
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:55,940
 As you can tell from the documents that we read, Cyrus sitting there and all that, Cyrus

367
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:59,180
 remained a pagan king.

368
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:03,060
 There was not a shred of evidence that he was converted.

369
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,540
 However, this is our fantasy.

370
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:09,900
 We want someone in power to be converted to be a Christian.

371
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:16,660
 And we all want the kings to become like us, Christians or evangelicals.

372
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,620
 How nice, right?

373
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,900
 Of course we want that, we want to pray for that.

374
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:27,820
 We want those who are in charge and those who are with the political power, we want

375
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:31,180
 them to acknowledge the name of Jesus.

376
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:40,880
 Or sometimes we want or we wish a superstar, a celebrity would become a Christian and she

377
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,980
 or he will bear witness to the world how great Jesus is.

378
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,700
 And how nice is that?

379
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:57,020
 However, Isaiah reminds us, we cannot outsource the public witness to other people.

380
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:05,380
 We cannot outsource the public witness to those in power or in the entertainment business

381
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,340
 or some celebrities.

382
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,700
 We cannot outsource this.

383
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:13,860
 Isaiah is talking about to every single person of the people of God.

384
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:20,700
 You are my witness and God wants to make you the light for the Gentiles, for the nations.

385
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,580
 God wants to raise you up.

386
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:32,460
 You see, no matter which political party is in charge, no matter what policies they implement,

387
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:40,340
 whether it would be favorable to us or non-favorable to us, that is not the key.

388
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:51,020
 The key is that we respond to the calling of God to be the light for the nations.

389
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:54,140
 And we ask that the church will raise us up.

390
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:58,340
 We will stand up to be the true church.

391
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:02,820
 Think about the last past two decades.

392
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:03,820
 Two decades or so.

393
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:10,780
 There are so many mega churches that fail, crumble.

394
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,100
 I don't have to give you examples.

395
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:18,500
 I was in Toronto for the weekend and a lot of Canadian Christians told me what happened

396
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,820
 in the city of Toronto.

397
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:27,300
 In the metropolitan area, there are also many mega churches or mega pastors figures who

398
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:30,600
 fail because of scandals.

399
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,000
 You see what's going on?

400
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 We fail.

401
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,540
 It's not because the political order is in our favor.

402
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:40,220
 It really doesn't matter.

403
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,940
 We fail from within.

404
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:48,140
 It's not because the political order is favorable to us to question weakness or not.

405
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:53,540
 It is us that we need to be the light to the nations.

406
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,940
 And we bear the name of God.

407
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:59,420
 And we want to bear a positive witness to the world.

408
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:07,060
 A couple of weeks ago, we had a small group gathering for the husbands.

409
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:14,020
 For some of the husbands, we share our stories and our worries for our family, especially

410
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:16,700
 for the young kids.

411
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:22,380
 Growing up in a liberal environment and they got their value confused.

412
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:25,220
 And there are so many cultural wars out there.

413
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:30,500
 And we exchange a lot of stories about our worries about what is going on in the schools,

414
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,900
 what is going on in the curriculum.

415
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,700
 And we worry about that.

416
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:41,700
 But I was talking to the husbands, I said, "You know what, whatever, however the political

417
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:48,300
 order is favorable to us, there is a front line we cannot give up.

418
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:52,260
 And it is our own home.

419
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,320
 Our own family.

420
00:34:54,320 --> 00:35:03,180
 How can we live out the gospel, the beauty of truth, the beauty of truth, to let our

421
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:08,260
 kids and let our next generation to know that the truth is beautiful.

422
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:15,500
 You know, the next generation is tired of us telling them what is right and what is

423
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,500
 wrong.

424
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,620
 Of course there is truth and falsehood we have to discern.

425
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:20,620
 That is important.

426
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:24,940
 But the most important thing is that we as the people of God, we can show and demonstrate

427
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,480
 the beauty of truth.

428
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,160
 The beauty of marriage.

429
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,340
 The beauty of manhood and womanhood.

430
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:34,340
 The beauty of Christian life.

431
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,500
 That we live out the gospel.

432
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,300
 And that is what the world is dying for.

433
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:48,140
 They want to see the people of God being raised up to be the light for the Gentiles.

434
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:53,460
 And today Isaiah gives us this reminder and this calling.

435
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:59,580
 You go back to your role and your responsibility.

436
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:03,980
 Go back to your home to deal with your children.

437
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:06,180
 To handle relationships in your home.

438
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:09,460
 To handle relationships and ethics in your workplace.

439
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,820
 In the society.

440
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:14,960
 How can we speak with the gospel.

441
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,820
 Speak with compassion.

442
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:18,340
 Speak with peace.

443
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:23,340
 So that people can see the beauty of the gospel.

444
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,860
 Can we do that?

445
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:25,860
 Can we do that?

446
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:26,860
 Can we pray at least?

447
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:30,100
 Toward that direction.

448
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,100
 God help us.

449
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:35,300
 It's not about voting whoever is in the White House.

450
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:38,780
 Of course if it's favorable, praise God.

451
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:45,580
 But the front line that we all are on, we cannot give up.

452
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:50,060
 We are in the trenches to be the light for the Gentiles.

453
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:54,780
 To bring salvation to the ends of the earth.

454
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:57,340
 And that is you and me.

455
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:03,580
 That is all the churches, all the ordinary Christians we can do and we can pray for.

456
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:08,380
 Can we close in words of prayer?

457
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:13,940
 And just pray and come back to God and say God call us.

458
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:21,820
 And Father you do want to call us to be the light for the Gentiles, for the nations.

459
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:25,660
 And we come before you, we ask that you will forgive us.

460
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:31,140
 You forgive us sometimes we pay so much attention to okay who is in power but of course this

461
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,460
 is our public witness.

462
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:36,820
 This is what we can do for the coming grace for the society.

463
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:43,420
 However, what is most important is that you are in charge and you are calling us.

464
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:48,420
 Each and every one of us to be faithful people.

465
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:50,980
 To preach the gospel.

466
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:53,380
 To share the good news.

467
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:59,020
 In our conversation and in our interaction with other people that we can show them the

468
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:03,820
 beauty, the goodness of the gospel.

469
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:07,140
 So help us and forgive us.

470
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:09,460
 And please use us.

471
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:14,060
 And this is our prayer as your people.

472
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:17,420
 Humble us so that we worship you alone.

473
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:27,380
 Humble us so that we can display and demonstrate your goodness, your beauty.

474
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,980
 And may your name be glorified.

475
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:33,860
 This is our little prayers and you send us out this week.

476
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:41,700
 Go back to school, go back to our home, go back to our workplaces.

477
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:50,180
 Any place you send us and help us to bring the truth and the beauty of truth.

478
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:56,780
 And use us to show your glory in Christ in prayer.

479
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:59,700
 Well thank you very much for worshipping with us.

480
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:03,900
 And this series will continue next week and I hope to see you next week and we'll continue

481
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:04,900
 with Flat On.

482
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:08,740
 God's psalm over the nations, over us.

483
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:13,540
 So we have some refreshments out there and please stay for a little bit time of fellowship

484
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:16,940
 and get to know one another, to support one another.

485
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:19,740
 God bless you the rest of the week and see you next week.

486
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:29,740
