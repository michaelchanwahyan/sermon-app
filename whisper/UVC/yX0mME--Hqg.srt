1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 - Thank you for having me back here.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,060
 Thank you for having me back here.

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:09,260
 The last time I was here was back in May,

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,500
 so it's been a little while,

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,800
 but the fact that I'm back here means that

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,060
 it was okay last time, so thank you for having me.

7
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:17,900
 The last time I was here,

8
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,460
 I spoke on the topic of an emotive God,

9
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,900
 and it was about how God encourages us

10
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,120
 to express the full range of emotions

11
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,700
 that he also expresses, that he wants us to also express.

12
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,600
 And this time around, Pastor Mark was nice enough to,

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,500
 again, extend freedom for me to choose what to preach on.

14
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,060
 And usually I go through a process of prayer and meditation

15
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,360
 to figure out what it is God might be pressing

16
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,200
 on my heart to share,

17
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,660
 and I happened to be going through the book of Acts

18
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,100
 for my own devotion.

19
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,260
 And at the time when I received the invitation,

20
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,060
 I was going through the passages that actually

21
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,260
 were going through today,

22
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,600
 and I just felt really strongly that this was the message

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,920
 that the Lord wanted me to share today.

24
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,760
 So,

25
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,920
 if any of you have visited Thailand,

26
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,700
 you've probably done the very tourist thing

27
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,960
 of riding one of those elephants.

28
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,160
 I don't know, anybody ever gone to Thailand here?

29
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,000
 Yeah?

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 Okay.

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,300
 I did many years ago,

32
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,860
 and when we see these animals in pictures and videos,

33
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:22,260
 most of our lives, we don't really get the true sense

34
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,960
 of how just amazingly powerful and large they are.

35
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,120
 These elephants can lift logs with their trunks,

36
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,860
 they can crush cars with their feet,

37
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,420
 and yet somehow they submit

38
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:37,800
 to these very fragile human masters.

39
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,160
 I always wondered how such big animals can be so compliant,

40
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,260
 and I eventually learned years later

41
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,100
 how they actually train them.

42
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,220
 The way that they train them is that when they're very young,

43
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,700
 they chain them or they bind them,

44
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,120
 so when they even try to break free, it hurts them.

45
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,120
 They're in a lot of pain

46
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,060
 if they try to escape their constraints.

47
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,500
 And so, over the years, as they get older and older,

48
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,300
 these human masters start to take away these devices,

49
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,760
 but the elephants are so trained

50
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,300
 to think that they're trapped

51
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,800
 that they continue to think that they're bound,

52
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,060
 and so they operate in submission as a result.

53
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:18,700
 The elephant imagery resembles

54
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:22,300
 how sometimes we can be bound spiritually

55
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,660
 by our early and external influences.

56
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,300
 Whether it's from our culture, society,

57
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,060
 or our religious context,

58
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,900
 we get stuck and trapped in these artificial limitations

59
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,000
 that we put on ourselves

60
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,740
 that might not even be biblically prescribed.

61
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,460
 Today's message is actually about that.

62
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:43,060
 It's about reflecting on what maybe we have in our lives

63
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,500
 that are unnecessary spiritual restrictions

64
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,860
 that we place on ourselves.

65
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,300
 And today's, oh, sorry, I forgot.

66
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,300
 Yeah, so this was the Emotive God,

67
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,300
 and I was thankful to see

68
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,860
 that Pastor Mark actually reviewed it.

69
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,260
 I somehow was on UB's website in August,

70
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,560
 and I was like, oh, he found a better graphic than me.

71
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,820
 (audience laughs)

72
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:05,460
 And here's one of the elephants, right,

73
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:08,860
 that you would see in maybe Thailand or Burma.

74
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:13,460
 And today's passage is from Acts 15, one to 21.

75
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:17,500
 I will read it, but it's also on the screen.

76
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,220
 "Certain people came down from Judea to Antioch

77
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,740
 "and were teaching the believers.

78
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,340
 "Unless you are circumcised,

79
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,460
 "according to the custom taught by Moses,

80
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,140
 "you cannot be saved.

81
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,540
 "This brought Paul and Barnabas into sharp dispute

82
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,780
 "and debate with them.

83
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,580
 "So Paul and Barnabas were appointed,

84
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,140
 "along with some other believers,

85
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,780
 "to go up to Jerusalem to see the apostles and elders

86
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,580
 "about this question.

87
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,600
 "The church sent them on their way,

88
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,480
 "and as they traveled through Phoenicia and Samaria,

89
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,260
 "they told how the Gentiles had been converted.

90
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,420
 "This news made all the believers very glad.

91
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,000
 "When they came to Jerusalem,

92
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,220
 "they were welcomed by the church

93
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,820
 "and the apostles and elders,

94
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:58,080
 "to whom they reported everything God had done through them.

95
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,500
 "Then some of the believers who belonged

96
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,700
 "to the party of the Pharisees stood up and said,

97
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,780
 "The Gentiles must be circumcised

98
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:09,000
 "and required to keep the law of Moses.

99
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,060
 "The apostles and elders met to consider this question.

100
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:17,020
 "After much discussion, Peter got up and addressed them,

101
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:19,700
 "Brothers, you know that some time ago,

102
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,060
 "God made a choice among you

103
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,180
 "that the Gentiles might hear from my lips

104
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,060
 "the message of the gospel and believe.

105
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,700
 "God, who knows the heart,

106
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,120
 "showed that he accepted them

107
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,980
 "by giving the Holy Spirit to them,

108
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,880
 "just as he did to us.

109
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,580
 "He did not discriminate between us and them,

110
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,100
 "for he purified their hearts by faith.

111
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,800
 "Now then, why do you try to test God

112
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,500
 "by putting on the necks of Gentiles

113
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,100
 "a yoke that neither we nor our ancestors

114
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,640
 "have been able to bear?

115
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,300
 "No, we believe it is through the grace

116
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,740
 "of our Lord Jesus Christ

117
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,420
 "that we are saved, just as they are.

118
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:56,740
 "The whole assembly became silent

119
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,560
 "as they listened to Barnabas and Paul

120
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,540
 "telling about the signs and wonders

121
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,380
 "God had done among the Gentiles through them.

122
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,060
 "When they finished, James spoke up.

123
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,380
 "Brothers, he said, listen to me.

124
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,880
 "Simon has described to us how God first intervened

125
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,940
 "to choose a people for his name from the Gentiles.

126
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,020
 "The words of the prophets are in agreement

127
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:20,100
 "with this, as it is written.

128
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,360
 "After this, I will return and rebuild

129
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,840
 "David's fallen tent.

130
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,960
 "Its ruins I will rebuild, and I will restore it,

131
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,660
 "that the rest of mankind may seek the Lord,

132
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,900
 "even all the Gentiles who bear my name,

133
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,680
 "says the Lord who does these things,

134
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,680
 "things known from long ago.

135
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,700
 "It is my judgment, therefore,

136
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,100
 "that we should not make it difficult

137
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,620
 "for the Gentiles who are turning to God.

138
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,180
 "Instead, we should write to them,

139
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,200
 "telling them to abstain from food polluted by idols,

140
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,920
 "from sexual immorality,

141
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,100
 "from the meat of strangled animals, and from blood.

142
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,720
 "For the law of Moses has been preached in every city

143
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,980
 "from the earliest times,

144
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:59,580
 "and is read in the synagogues on every Sabbath."

145
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:05,680
 The passage begins on the backdrop

146
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,380
 of Paul and Barnabas' missionary journey in Acts 13 and 14.

147
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,780
 They travel from Antioch to Cyprus,

148
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,500
 making their way from the eastern coast of the island

149
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,020
 to the western coast,

150
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,620
 where they then travel to the mainland of modern-day Turkey.

151
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,120
 They mimic Jesus' strategy

152
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,620
 by first targeting the Jewish communities

153
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,980
 in these areas where they already have

154
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,840
 the religious background of the Old Testament.

155
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,780
 They actually mimic Jesus' strategy

156
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:34,180
 by first targeting the Jewish communities

157
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,640
 that already have the religious background

158
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,380
 of the Old Testament.

159
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,540
 They appeal to the Jews and the God-fearing Gentiles,

160
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:43,840
 and then connect Jesus as a promised Savior,

161
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,140
 referred to in the scriptures that they were all expecting.

162
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,300
 Paul and Barnabas head through a number of cities

163
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,980
 before backtracking, so you can see that they go inland,

164
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,940
 they go all the way to all these cities,

165
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,940
 and then they kind of do a U-turn back,

166
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:00,060
 and they backtrack to Antioch.

167
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,820
 And then Paul and Barnabas report

168
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,260
 all that God had done through them,

169
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,820
 and how he had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles

170
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,220
 when they returned.

171
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:15,500
 In verses 1 to 4, after returning to Antioch,

172
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,060
 some people came from Judea, where Jerusalem is,

173
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,460
 the religious heart of Judaism,

174
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,980
 and contended that in order for new Gentile believers

175
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,740
 to be fully saved and accepted into the community,

176
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,780
 they needed to be circumcised.

177
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,480
 Circumcision is a hallmark of Jewish believers.

178
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,740
 In Genesis 17, Abraham is called by God

179
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,500
 to undergo circumcision as a sign of the covenant.

180
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,480
 Paul and Barnabas argued against this,

181
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,280
 and then made their way to Jerusalem to clear things up.

182
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,340
 And then in verses 5 to 11,

183
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,300
 what follows is another discussion,

184
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,040
 but this time against the believing Pharisees.

185
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,100
 This is different from just some people,

186
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,380
 because here are the respected elders

187
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,660
 of the believing community,

188
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,560
 and it required a more delicate handling of the situation.

189
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:06,300
 And then in 12, verses 12 to 18,

190
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,060
 Barnabas and Paul countered the idea.

191
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,340
 They argued against the Pharisees

192
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,580
 with the explanation of the sign of acceptance

193
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,940
 of the believers to the provision

194
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,540
 of the Holy Spirit to Gentiles.

195
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,040
 They detailed the signs and wonders

196
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,540
 God had done among them.

197
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:23,900
 And the conversion story capturing Cornelius,

198
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,780
 the centurion and others among him,

199
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:28,180
 are one of the stories depicted earlier in Acts.

200
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:36,140
 In verse 10, in verse 10 of the passage,

201
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,180
 there's a mention of putting on a yoke

202
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,020
 that neither the Jewish disciples

203
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,020
 nor the ancestors have been able to bear.

204
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,460
 It refers to circumcision and the extensive set

205
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:48,220
 of Mosaic laws that the traditional Jewish community

206
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:51,540
 believe had to be followed to be part of God's community.

207
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:56,300
 Though we do not have these rules in modern Christianity,

208
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,220
 I'd say that we have our own versions

209
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,880
 of heavy yokes that we place on ourselves.

210
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,860
 This part of the passage I'm gonna cover

211
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,460
 later in the message,

212
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,380
 along with this.

213
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:12,540
 So this, this is a yoke.

214
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,540
 A yoke is a tool placed on oxen

215
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:18,240
 to pull a cart, a plow, or a wagon.

216
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,380
 And it's made of solid wood,

217
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:22,740
 and back in the old days, it was really, really heavy.

218
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,920
 Actually, if you look at my shirt here,

219
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,100
 this is actually called the yoke as well.

220
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,460
 It's actually what holds and hangs the shirt on our bodies.

221
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:34,860
 Think about what yokes you might have

222
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,140
 in your personal situations.

223
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,940
 This yoke can come internally from ourselves

224
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:43,220
 and/or externally from those influences around us.

225
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,300
 They come from areas like our families,

226
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,700
 our culture, and even our church traditions.

227
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,380
 Recognizing some of these self-imposed yokes

228
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,380
 can help lighten what actually might be barriers

229
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,400
 for us to enjoy more of God's grace.

230
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,340
 It's actually funny that Miroslav's sharing

231
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,320
 the passage on the yoke.

232
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,540
 I didn't pay her for that.

233
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,980
 It just happened to work out.

234
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,500
 And when we accept,

235
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,740
 recognizing some of these self-imposed yokes

236
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,300
 can help us lighten what might be barriers

237
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,580
 and enjoy more of God's grace.

238
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,220
 And when we accept Jesus into our lives,

239
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,220
 we go through a process of justification

240
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,460
 as we enter the family of God.

241
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,220
 But just because we enter the family

242
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,660
 doesn't mean that we feel like part of the family.

243
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,140
 There's a lifelong process of sanctification.

244
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,840
 It's like marriage.

245
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,940
 When you marry, you create a new family,

246
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,580
 and then you join your spousal's family.

247
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,340
 And there's a period of acclimation

248
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:41,540
 to adjust to the new dynamics and rituals that you have.

249
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,180
 Going through this kind of acclimation

250
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,520
 is like sanctification.

251
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,420
 And the Biblically guided process of sanctification

252
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,260
 is becoming more like Jesus.

253
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:53,580
 Though the Bible should be our guide,

254
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:57,280
 our societal, cultural, and familial influences

255
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,140
 inevitably affect how we think

256
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,960
 the spiritual growth process should develop.

257
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,900
 This is true even for those who grew up in the church.

258
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,860
 There are traditions that become embedded

259
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,900
 in what we believe we need to do

260
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,540
 that really are not Biblically prescribed.

261
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,860
 They are more our preferences,

262
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,600
 and they become heavy yokes that we end up carrying.

263
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:22,380
 These yokes can be individual,

264
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,940
 and they can be organizational.

265
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:27,020
 I was born into the Chinese church.

266
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,460
 My parents were young and were active

267
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:33,620
 in the Cantonese side of the church they were in.

268
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,180
 And I was part of that in my earlier years.

269
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,420
 Sunday services were very traditional.

270
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,460
 All the songs came from the hymn books.

271
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,300
 Everybody came in suits and dresses.

272
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,580
 It was very, very boring for me.

273
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,820
 Even though now that I'm older,

274
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,280
 admittedly, I find comfort in some of that.

275
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:52,260
 In any case, as I started entering middle school,

276
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,420
 I started to attend the English side.

277
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,260
 It was more of a Western disposition.

278
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,540
 It was more casual, it was more young.

279
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:02,020
 And attendees were mostly American-born

280
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,540
 or mostly raised in the United States.

281
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:08,480
 Now, my normal attire every day,

282
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,620
 going to school through the week,

283
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:12,660
 were sweatpants and flip-flops.

284
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,100
 And they were super comfortable,

285
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,900
 and every day, even into college,

286
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,100
 this was my daily uniform.

287
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,800
 But my mom absolutely hates me wearing flip-flops.

288
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:26,880
 And I see this as a generational phenomenon

289
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,820
 because I remember when I was dating Rebecca, my wife,

290
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,980
 and I would go and visit her grandmother,

291
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:32,980
 she would always warn me,

292
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,380
 "Do not show up in your flip-flops."

293
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:39,500
 Or else she would just get an earful afterwards.

294
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,620
 And even when I visited her parents,

295
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,380
 she'd be like, "Make sure you don't come

296
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,340
 "in your flip-flops."

297
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:47,020
 And sometimes, I would listen.

298
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:50,040
 But I think it's actually a generational thing.

299
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:54,940
 One thing my mom disliked me more than wearing flip-flops

300
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,300
 was wearing flip-flops to church.

301
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,180
 And I think there's this image for those

302
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,600
 that grew up in Hong Kong in the earlier years,

303
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,700
 and only young thugs ran around wearing flip-flops,

304
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,700
 (speaks in foreign language)

305
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:12,700
 And these were the so-called (speaks in foreign language)

306
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,660
 I would consistently argue with my mom on this topic

307
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:18,520
 whenever we would prepare to go to church on Sundays.

308
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,460
 And some of you know my mother,

309
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:22,180
 so you're probably laughing, imagining her.

310
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:26,180
 We'd go back and forth, and at the end of it,

311
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,140
 she would usually conclude that Jesus would disapprove.

312
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,780
 Like that would be her way of trying to get me

313
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,420
 to stop wearing my flip-flops.

314
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:36,620
 And being the young teen I was,

315
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,940
 I would then reply that Jesus can't disapprove

316
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,840
 because he only wore sandals, right?

317
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,680
 (audience laughs)

318
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,160
 In fact, I visited my mom's church a couple of weeks ago,

319
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,020
 and I wore flip-flops to church,

320
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,860
 and I was attending the Chinese service with her.

321
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,740
 And at the end of it, she's like,

322
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,780
 (speaks in foreign language)

323
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:01,060
 And then, of course, I was like,

324
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,300
 I'm actually being more like Jesus

325
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,660
 because I'm wearing flip-flops.

326
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,940
 So she didn't take that very well,

327
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:09,420
 but this is a funny example of how we sometimes

328
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:12,460
 might add extra add-ons to what is required

329
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,780
 to be Christ-like.

330
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:16,860
 And this example might be funny and not harmful,

331
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,660
 but substitute the flip-flops for something else.

332
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,660
 Jesus would not approve of blank.

333
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:25,820
 Or you need to do more of blank to be more like Jesus.

334
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:31,060
 A more serious subject could actually be

335
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:34,340
 where you should and should not go as a believer.

336
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,120
 You shouldn't go to the bars anymore.

337
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,320
 You can't stay out late on Saturdays anymore.

338
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,740
 You should only go to church on Fridays.

339
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,660
 That's the only place you can go to.

340
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,920
 Or maybe it's the people that you associate with.

341
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,820
 You should only hang out with Christians.

342
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,280
 Or you should disconnect yourself from your friends

343
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,940
 who are not believers, even though you might be

344
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:54,420
 the only connection to Jesus that they have in their lives.

345
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,420
 Or it's related to your spiritual practice.

346
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:59,420
 Maybe it's you have to pray a certain way

347
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,140
 for a minimum amount of time,

348
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,340
 or you have to pray in tongues

349
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,300
 for your prayers to be effective.

350
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,780
 You have to read the Bible through so many times in a year,

351
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:10,780
 or you have to go to church so many times each week,

352
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:13,260
 or you have to serve in so many different roles.

353
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:16,260
 These can all be our modern yokes of circumcision.

354
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:20,600
 They can be extra practices that we add that accumulate,

355
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,720
 and they become more and more burdensome,

356
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,520
 and we can suffocate under the weight of them.

357
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,820
 We become very performance-oriented

358
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,040
 versus being very grace-driven.

359
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,080
 And we should ask ourselves,

360
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,800
 are there certain practices that we have

361
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,320
 that might be individual yokes in our own lives?

362
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:42,400
 Praying is good, church is good, serving is good,

363
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,880
 but are we doing them from a sincere posture of faith,

364
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,380
 or are we doing them just to say that we did them?

365
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:54,600
 So these yokes can also be organizational.

366
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,960
 We assimilate a lot of our own cultural traditions

367
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,180
 in how we do church.

368
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:01,140
 They might seem natural and preferential

369
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,200
 because they're grounded

370
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,380
 in our very familiar cultural practices,

371
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:09,700
 but they should not be classed as biblically required.

372
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,480
 These demands can actually overemphasize

373
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,760
 what is actually critical for a church,

374
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,720
 and can create organizational drag

375
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,860
 that prevents effective ministry, leadership, and fellowship.

376
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:24,360
 In the Chinese church, these can be even more pronounced

377
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,400
 when we operate within the greater American environment,

378
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,860
 because the difference is so stark.

379
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,920
 And I think one strong Asian influence

380
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,460
 that really pervades our perspective of how we do church

381
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,520
 is our very Asian emphasis on education.

382
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,560
 It's a very notable virtue,

383
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,780
 but it can also dangerously border on idolatrous behavior.

384
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,660
 Having lived in Hong Kong,

385
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,700
 I saw firsthand the intense pressure there is

386
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:52,100
 with education, and it starts at the earliest levels,

387
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,620
 preschool or maybe even when you're born.

388
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,540
 It got to very absurd levels.

389
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,700
 The competition is so fierce,

390
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,140
 and people have to apply their kids

391
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,580
 to try to get into school,

392
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,340
 to even apply for school as soon as they're born.

393
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:07,820
 You can't apply a child for school unless they exist,

394
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,660
 and they do so right after they're born,

395
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,860
 because the lines are so long and it's so competitive.

396
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,980
 They start doing interviews with three-year-olds

397
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,740
 to see if they're gifted,

398
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,220
 and I don't know what they can test

399
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,780
 with giftedness at that age,

400
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,400
 other than can they sit down and listen

401
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,360
 for hours to a teacher teach.

402
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,480
 I'm sure many of you have your own stories,

403
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,300
 and you've seen this or you've experienced it.

404
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,960
 A more extreme example that I have

405
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,980
 is a number of years ago,

406
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,820
 my friend was teaching in one of these

407
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,900
 international private schools in Hong Kong,

408
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,620
 and they do these tours.

409
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,900
 Parents can come and they can check out the school,

410
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,820
 and one of these parents,

411
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,540
 or who they thought was a parent,

412
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:48,060
 was this lady coming on her own,

413
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,140
 and she was part of the tour,

414
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,300
 and it was found out later on

415
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,660
 that not only did she not have a child yet,

416
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,680
 she wasn't even married.

417
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,420
 She was preparing that far in advance

418
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:01,980
 because it was so stressful to think about this topic,

419
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,860
 and they had to plan ahead because it's so competitive.

420
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:08,980
 And educational craze and demand in Hong Kong

421
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:11,540
 has fueled an extremely lucrative industry

422
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,980
 in tutoring centers in Hong Kong.

423
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:15,300
 We actually have some of these in Bridgeport.

424
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,220
 Some of you might have your kids there.

425
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,980
 I'm not gonna blame you.

426
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,560
 But I don't know any other place other than Hong Kong

427
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,540
 where we have these tutor gods, these bozafsan.

428
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:28,060
 They are individuals who have supposedly mastered

429
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:32,060
 the art of passing high school and college entrance exams,

430
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,500
 and they make millions of dollars.

431
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,380
 They're celebrities.

432
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,900
 Their faces are all over billboards and on buses,

433
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:41,060
 and they're on TV, and it's crazy.

434
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,740
 But I believe this actually is grounded

435
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:45,060
 in our Confucian culture,

436
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:48,260
 the Confucian-based imperial civil exams.

437
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:52,100
 There's this long tradition from the 600s to the 1900s

438
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:56,420
 where anybody in society, if they could pass this test,

439
00:18:56,420 --> 00:19:00,900
 they can jump through the ladder in society

440
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,900
 and do very, very well.

441
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,140
 And I've seen this historical influence

442
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,500
 in a lot of these Asian churches,

443
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,700
 in Singaporean churches, in Korean churches,

444
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,260
 in Chinese churches.

445
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:13,780
 And it bleeds into what we require educationally

446
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:16,500
 for candidates that can serve in our churches.

447
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,660
 I've seen some job postings for youth pastors

448
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:21,780
 where you shouldn't apply unless you have,

449
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,540
 unless you're pursuing a master's in divinity, right?

450
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,900
 Or you can only apply to be a pastor or senior pastor

451
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,060
 if you have your PhD or if you're getting your DEM in,

452
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:31,900
 right?

453
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,860
 Knowledge is a priority.

454
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:37,500
 But being empathetic, pastoral in nature,

455
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,780
 a good leader, or even caring about people,

456
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,500
 that might not even be listed, right?

457
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,420
 Like that, there's a disconnect there.

458
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:47,860
 These restrictive educational requirements that we have

459
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:50,900
 can be our organizational yokes.

460
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:54,020
 And I wonder if Jesus applied to some of these jobs today,

461
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:57,340
 if he would be considered as the carpenter's son, right,

462
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,940
 as his main vocation.

463
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:03,420
 We're also a culture of very industrious people, right,

464
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:06,380
 as immigrants or children of immigrants.

465
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:11,380
 And this infiltrates how we do church sometimes.

466
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:13,900
 Like there's a busyness that gets translated

467
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,660
 into how we do church.

468
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,100
 And we have program after program,

469
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:21,180
 study after study, event after event.

470
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,860
 It's like we're working our way towards salvation.

471
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:27,340
 And Sunday Sabbath can actually feel not restful.

472
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,900
 And that just isn't right, nor is it biblical.

473
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,060
 I value education.

474
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,140
 I value strong work ethic.

475
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,820
 And these are attributes that I want my own children

476
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,100
 to learn.

477
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:44,100
 Wisdom and hard work are praised virtues in the Bible.

478
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:48,460
 Blessed is the one whose delight is in the law of the Lord

479
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,900
 and meditates on his law day and night.

480
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:55,140
 Good planning and hard work lead to prosperity.

481
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,140
 But hasty shortcuts lead to poverty.

482
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,340
 We need to ensure that these virtues don't become

483
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:05,460
 organizational limiters, organizational yokes for us.

484
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:08,540
 That we don't see them as a means and the measurement

485
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,380
 of what a greater church is built on.

486
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:13,900
 Putting on these yokes causes us to lose focus

487
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:17,180
 and lose dependency on God's grace and mercy.

488
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,460
 Substituting it with a sense of control

489
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,740
 that we can have ourselves.

490
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:23,300
 Our motivation needs to be grounded in the community

491
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:26,820
 of faith and love that is authentic and intentional,

492
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,220
 the same way that Jesus is.

493
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:32,220
 Are we caring for the brothers and sisters around us?

494
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,340
 Are we caring for the community,

495
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:36,580
 for the people in our community?

496
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:39,340
 Or are we creating a safe bubble for us to just be in?

497
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:44,860
 I know I'm ruffling some feathers here.

498
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,820
 I'm causing discomfort for some folks,

499
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,620
 maybe most folks here.

500
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,860
 And I would probably too if I was in the audience

501
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:51,980
 and I ended here.

502
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:54,660
 'Cause it sounds like, hey, it sounds like Brian

503
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:58,660
 is saying we should have no yokes, no rules.

504
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,540
 I'm not saying that at all.

505
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:02,860
 I'm not advocating for liberation from any constraints.

506
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,980
 Far from it, we need yokes.

507
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:08,140
 Without rules and structure, there would be chaos.

508
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:11,260
 And we as Asians, of course, like rules.

509
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,420
 It's why I think distribution-wise,

510
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:16,980
 we tend to have more people in the areas of engineering

511
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,540
 or the sciences or accounting,

512
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,940
 because they're grounded in very clear rules.

513
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:25,420
 But we need to remember that our strengths

514
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,300
 often have a mirror side to them.

515
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,780
 They're usually our weakness as well,

516
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,860
 and we shouldn't be blindsided by them.

517
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:34,140
 Sometimes adhering to the rules can be to a fault,

518
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,260
 where we stop questioning why they exist.

519
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:40,100
 What I want to emphasize is that we need to know

520
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,500
 what the true rules are,

521
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,700
 instead of adding in our own salt and vinegar,

522
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:49,780
 adding our gacho, right, into what we expect

523
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:52,580
 church needs to be like and how we operate within them.

524
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,740
 (silence)

525
00:22:54,740 --> 00:23:01,180
 We should see ourselves with a lightened yoke.

526
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:04,980
 So, not with no rules, but with the lightened yoke.

527
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:10,460
 The end of our passage ends with James, Jesus' brother,

528
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:13,260
 the leader of the Jerusalem church,

529
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,860
 that says that things shouldn't be made difficult

530
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,740
 for the Gentiles coming to Christ,

531
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:21,100
 but they should still be instructed to abstain from food

532
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,220
 polluted by idols, from sexual immorality,

533
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,020
 and from the meat of strangled animals,

534
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,660
 from blood, and from blood.

535
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:30,860
 After everything I said before,

536
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:31,820
 some of you reading this will say,

537
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,420
 "Hey, this sure sounds like

538
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,980
 "we should still be doing a lot of stuff."

539
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:39,700
 And in the legal field, there is what's considered

540
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,860
 the letter of the law and the spirit of the law.

541
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:45,300
 The letter of the law is kind of our direct,

542
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,540
 very superficial, quick reading of the law.

543
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,780
 It's very literal.

544
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,860
 But the spirit of the law is actually what the heart

545
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,620
 of the law is meant to promote.

546
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:57,500
 Using maybe the speed limit, for example,

547
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,580
 we can see that when you learn to drive,

548
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,980
 you're taught that you should not exceed the speed limit.

549
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:05,900
 But as you actually start to drive yourself,

550
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:09,060
 there's this idea of what's called the flow of traffic.

551
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,500
 You follow the flow of traffic,

552
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,140
 and that flow of traffic might be faster

553
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,620
 than the speed limit, or it could be significantly slower

554
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,460
 than the speed limit, but you follow the flow of traffic

555
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:20,980
 because the heart of the law is actually to maintain safety

556
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:23,020
 for yourself and for everyone around you.

557
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:27,740
 The biblical law is meant to serve as a guide

558
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:30,900
 for us to understand what it takes to be holy,

559
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:34,300
 and to understand we are unable to fulfill it ourselves.

560
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,700
 Jesus said that he did not come to abolish the law

561
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,020
 or the prophets, he came to fulfill them.

562
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:44,140
 God sent Jesus because we can't do it ourselves.

563
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:47,260
 He came as a perfect being to follow the law,

564
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:50,460
 perfectly, and to highlight that it is by God's grace

565
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:53,460
 through Jesus that we can become saved

566
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,140
 and strive to be holy.

567
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,180
 Following him is the way to go.

568
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:01,060
 The end of the passage here in Acts is really prescribing us

569
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:05,060
 to operate with a mind to be holy,

570
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:08,820
 holiness that is spiritual, holiness that is sexual,

571
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:11,300
 holiness that is nutritional or bodily.

572
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:14,220
 The instructions are still to maintain

573
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:17,180
 basic standards of holiness, but not to the degree

574
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:20,340
 where it becomes a checklist to save ourselves.

575
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:23,140
 And you know what?

576
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:26,340
 Like, these are practices that non-believers can identify

577
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,420
 as distinguishing marks of the believing community,

578
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:31,740
 and why James still prescribes these rules

579
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,900
 for those to follow, because he mentions that

580
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,060
 it's been told for a long time

581
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,340
 that this is what the Jewish community does.

582
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:41,940
 The Christian faith is an invitation from Jesus

583
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,180
 to become part of God's family.

584
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:47,620
 It's also a lifelong journey to become more like him,

585
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:50,340
 to be set apart, to be holy.

586
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,100
 The process is not meant to cause us

587
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,540
 to feel like we're drowning in rules,

588
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,660
 where in our individual and church lives,

589
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:59,260
 the rules have become our masters,

590
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,420
 and like the trained elephants,

591
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:03,340
 we're afraid to step out of bounds.

592
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:06,340
 The rules themselves are guardrails for us,

593
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,660
 so that we don't recklessly charge ahead

594
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,460
 to our own harm or to others' harm.

595
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:15,380
 Jesus provides us a lightened yoke, an easier path.

596
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:20,100
 It is a path ahead that is full of forgiveness and grace,

597
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,740
 for he has bore the burden of the law.

598
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,780
 We have to just open our eyes

599
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,860
 and see what the new reality actually is.

600
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:32,340
 Again, I said, no, I didn't pay Mirs

601
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,820
 to say the verse that she did,

602
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:37,300
 but it's actually in my slide as well.

603
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,420
 And Jesus says, "Come to me,

604
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:40,420
 "all you who are weary and burdened,

605
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,060
 "and I will give you rest.

606
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,620
 "Take my yoke upon you and learn from me,

607
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:47,180
 "for I am gentle and humble in heart,

608
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,260
 "and you will find rest for your souls.

609
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:52,420
 "For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light."

610
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:56,340
 Jesus does the heavy lifting so we don't have to.

611
00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:00,220
 Make sure to put on the lighter yoke,

612
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:03,220
 and maybe feel free to wear some flip-flops at church as well.

613
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,460
 (audience laughing)

614
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,460
 Thank you.

615
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,300
 Let me just end in prayer really quickly.

616
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:10,180
 Heavenly Father, we just thank you

617
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:13,420
 for Jesus, we thank you that he came to this world

618
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,740
 so that we can have a lighter yoke,

619
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:18,260
 that we will not feel crushed by the rules

620
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:21,140
 that we feel we need to follow to become saved,

621
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:24,420
 and that you extend that freely through your grace,

622
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:26,340
 through Christ's sacrifice.

623
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,900
 Bless us as we leave here,

624
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:30,140
 and help us to reflect on what might be

625
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,540
 our individual yokes,

626
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,900
 and what might be our organizational yokes.

627
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,220
 And let us feel freedom,

628
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,460
 freedom in your grace and your mercy.

629
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,340
 In your son's name we pray, amen.
