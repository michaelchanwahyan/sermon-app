[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040]   Well, thanks Kelly. And we do have some staff transition this month and this year
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.520]   uh, Reverend Ng, our senior adult minister is going to retire by the end of this month and
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.400]   actually some of the senior adults are having a
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.120]   farewell with him today
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:23.040]   So we're going to pray for him because he's getting weak and he cannot serve us
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.040]   Any anymore because he's physically and mentally being challenged
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.800]   um, so continue to pray for Reverend Ng and he's going to retire and the staff will
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.400]   um
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.880]   Be making some transition in our staffing and in our ministries as well
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.800]   Uh, so more details to you and Kelly. Thanks for announcing the general assembly and please
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.200]   Make time to be here
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.600]   because we're going to go through our finance and our needs in the church and
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.040]   We invite you to participate and to contribute
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.520]   and once again, uh, Chi is going to be our assistant pastor and
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.000]   We can only afford him for part-time position
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.720]   Um, so, uh, please continue to give and please continue to support the church ministry so that we can grow together. All right
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.280]   um, so, um
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:20.880]   Do come to the general assembly and we'll tell you all the details and uh things that we forecast and we do need
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.000]   every sister and brother in Christ to
[00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.060]   Participate and to build this church together because this church is the body of Christ. It's our body is our family
[00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.620]   So we are all part of it and we are all members and we need to
[00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.500]   Work together and build this church. All right
[00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.300]   Um today I would like to start a mini
[00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.940]   sermon series on worship
[00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.100]   uh worship
[00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.060]   Uh, you probably come to church for some time
[00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.020]   Uh, probably you're the first time here. But in any case sometimes we gather
[00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.580]   uh together to sing
[00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.660]   to pray
[00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:03.340]   and to read scripture and reflect on the word of God and we're going to
[00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.580]   Care for one another and this is what worship service
[00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.740]   Uh looks like
[00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.740]   and I think years of
[00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.360]   COVID and pandemics have deteriorated
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.380]   our sense of worship
[00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.900]   Don't you agree?
[00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:26.220]   Right. I mean remember those three plus years we had the online and live streaming, right?
[00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.620]   Where were you right? You were probably on your bed, right?
[00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.860]   You're sleeping in and then oh, it's about time to uh, join the online worship service and you turn on your phone, right?
[00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.380]   And then you kind of like you didn't brush your teeth and you know, you just watch your phone and oh I worship
[00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.700]   You know, you know, we are deteriorate into that kind of uh,
[00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.420]   You know low state of worship. So, uh, we have to pick it up
[00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.380]   We have to understand what worship is all about and we have to understand why we are here
[00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:03.020]   Right, we are here not only because of some of the benefits that we get, you know people and friends and uh,
[00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:09.580]   You know food and all that stuff, but we need to understand why we are here to worship and the word worship
[00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:15.260]   Is actually coming from uh an old anglish word of worship, right?
[00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.820]   uh, what is what what it does, uh mean is that um
[00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.620]   something of value
[00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.700]   and something of honor
[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.780]   Either a person or an object that we assign or we ascribe to someone or something, right?
[00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.700]   Someone or something
[00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.020]   Um, you go buy a car, right?
[00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.220]   These days cars are very very expensive, right?
[00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.700]   Uh, someone just bought a new car
[00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.380]   uh lately
[00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.140]   Uh, and she paid for over 40k
[00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.940]   For japanese car, right? Of course. It's a great car, right?
[00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.740]   But is it worth right?
[00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.540]   That's the word is all about
[00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.900]   you
[00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:05.820]   Think of value and honor of a person on object and you ask the question whether he or she or it worth
[00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:12.620]   The uh the value that we assign or we ascribe to it and in some sense worship is all about value
[00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.100]   And honor we ascribe to god
[00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:21.980]   God is great and god is to be honored and he deserves the honor and that's what worship is all about
[00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.220]   And you flip the pages of scripture
[00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.220]   from the book of psalms from the old testament from the new testament and
[00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.180]   It talks about the
[00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.480]   worthiness of god
[00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:39.580]   Worth our time and our effort to bring him the glory and to praise him
[00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.200]   sample here
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.780]   Revelation chapter 4 11 you are worthy
[00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.060]   Oh lord our god to receive
[00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.620]   glory honor and power
[00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.020]   both revelation talking about having you
[00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.080]   Worship what we do eternally
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:02.860]   It's all about worship. It's all about the worth of god that we bring to him and we praise it
[00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.580]   And that's what worship is all about. We have to see
[00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.060]   the value of god
[00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.660]   in your life
[00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.940]   That god is worthy of your everything
[00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.460]   Your praises and your prayers and your worship
[00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.580]   So we're going to turn to psalm 8
[00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:26.620]   And to think about this topic of worship and you have your bible, please open it up to psalm 8
[00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.340]   It says it's a very very short, uh, nine verses long psalm
[00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.900]   That talks about worship and there are three points I want to go through with you
[00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.100]   First two verses it talks about the worth of god
[00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:46.860]   And then the second part the middle part talking about our worth as human beings as creatures of god
[00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.660]   And then the last part talking about our mission our work
[00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.120]   Uh, we can
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:59.120]   Collaborate or we can serve god and work with god together in this world of creation
[00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:06.160]   So let's go through this psalm together psalm 8 a psalm of david. So it's written by david the psalmist
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.020]   It says oh lord our lord
[00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:15.900]   How majestic is your name in all the earth you have set your glory above the heavens
[00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.700]   You have set your glory and honor
[00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.420]   above heavens
[00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:23.900]   So you can see what david is trying to do
[00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.620]   He observes the heavens the sky
[00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:32.460]   And then the earth the creation the cosmos the vast universe
[00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:36.140]   And then he exclaimed that god is to be worshipped
[00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:41.660]   How majestic your name in all the earth I can see your name. I can see your power
[00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:47.980]   I can see your authority over everything that you have created and that's what david is doing
[00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.860]   He looks at the universe and then he bursts out with
[00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:54.220]   Uh
[00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.220]   awe and wonder
[00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.540]   Now I think I think if we have to rebuild our life of worship
[00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:05.100]   If we need to know how meaningful it is to gather as church
[00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:12.060]   No matter how many people we have to worship god together. We have to recover a sense of awe and wonder
[00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:14.460]   Don't you agree?
[00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.220]   the awe and wonder
[00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:20.460]   when we observe the vast universe how amazing it is
[00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:26.140]   And then we think of the the designer or the the god who created everything
[00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:28.700]   And we think of him as someone
[00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.660]   and that
[00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:38.620]   We cover that sense of uh, uh, awe and wonder and we praise him and we worship him. That's what david is doing here
[00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:41.500]   Now last week millions of people
[00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:47.660]   Woke up early or even be there, you know a day or two before and they went to
[00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:50.700]   Uh the the path of totality, right?
[00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.920]   and to see the
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.300]   100
[00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:56.060]   solar eclipse
[00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.060]   How many of you did see it?
[00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:59.580]   Did you see it?
[00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:04.540]   No. Yeah, right. So you went out to the street and it's all there, right?
[00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:09.980]   And you look up into the sky and then you see the wonder of creation
[00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:14.860]   Many of us or I should say well, probably many of us
[00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:16.620]   We went
[00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:18.620]   uh monday morning
[00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.940]   and drove many hours
[00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:28.940]   To reach that path of totality and in order to observe the the amazing universe
[00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:34.220]   right the vast, uh, uh universe the uh,
[00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:36.860]   awe and wonder
[00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.100]   Some people even tear up when they see
[00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:43.660]   The solar eclipse right? Isn't that amazing? I saw it too, right?
[00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:48.060]   And you know according to some survey there were about four millions of people
[00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:50.780]   four million people
[00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.120]   They don't live along the path of totality
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.580]   but they
[00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:57.420]   They they drove there
[00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:02.380]   Right, they they they drive there or they fly there in order to see that right?
[00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:04.540]   um
[00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:06.540]   It's just amazing number, right?
[00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:11.900]   And I did a short video and um, I I thought of uh this book
[00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:15.340]   called uh, the privilege planet
[00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:18.300]   Uh, it was written some years ago by two
[00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.140]   scientists
[00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:21.180]   and
[00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:26.220]   What they are trying to bring is the idea this the concept of you know, our earth
[00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:31.500]   Our planet earth is a privileged position to do all of this
[00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.640]   um
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.340]   observation
[00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:36.700]   and we
[00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.700]   they argue
[00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:42.380]   On this planet earth. We are in this swiss spot, you know
[00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:46.320]   the optimized place in the entire universe
[00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:54.160]   So that we can discover the laws of physics so that we can do a lot of different scientific discoveries
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:57.500]   And because we are being put in this
[00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:04.940]   Situation right the atmosphere is protecting us and we're not too far from the sun. We're not too close to the sun
[00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:11.020]   and then the moon and the stars and everything is being designed in such a way that
[00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:13.920]   makes scientific discoveries possible
[00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:21.580]   And I think that's a very very interesting idea. I know some people would disagree with it. But um
[00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:26.220]   If you look at psalm 8, that's what david is trying to say
[00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:34.140]   We are in the swiss spot on this planet earth and we can observe the wonder of creation the greatness of creation
[00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:37.820]   So we can appreciate how great our god is, right?
[00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:40.620]   verse 2
[00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:42.700]   from the lips of children and infants
[00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:49.900]   You have ordained praise because of your enemies to silence the foe and the avenger
[00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:53.100]   Now, what is what is he talking about? This is
[00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:55.900]   kind of a difficult verse
[00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:58.060]   And there are different translations
[00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:02.460]   Of this verse but the idea you can grab is pretty clear
[00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:05.340]   Uh, first of all is it talks about children
[00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:07.580]   and infants
[00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:08.700]   the babies
[00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:10.700]   Right the babies, you know our church has
[00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:17.900]   Many many babies, right? We have uh, some twins, you know, we have many cute babies
[00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:19.740]   you know
[00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:26.220]   We modern people we hold a baby in our arm, right hold an infant. Um, what what is your what's your feeling?
[00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:28.860]   Right
[00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:30.460]   It's awesome, right?
[00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:32.220]   It's cute baby
[00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:35.580]   Right. This is how modern people see babies
[00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:38.780]   But I probably explained this to you before
[00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:41.340]   for the ancient people in
[00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:42.780]   biblical culture
[00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:47.900]   Babies are not cute, right? Even we understand it, right? Well, I have two
[00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:50.460]   children, right?
[00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:52.460]   Uh, they are not cute anymore
[00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:56.780]   Um, they are older now and I continue to spend money on them, right?
[00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:59.180]   And they give me suffering
[00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:03.020]   So we don't we don't optimally think of they are cute, right?
[00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:08.000]   Now the ancient people they understood this because it's liability
[00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:10.940]   And babies are powerless people
[00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:18.940]   We understand it and they understood it because you know, we look at babies, uh, you know, we we have to feed them
[00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:21.580]   We have to change diapers for them
[00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:23.820]   And we have to protect them, right?
[00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:25.580]   my wife
[00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:27.740]   wakes up every saturday morning
[00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:35.260]   And she always has the habit to catch a tv show and the tv show is it's all about nature
[00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:42.860]   We're talking about some environmentalist going out to the nature and try to protect some of the extinct animals and all that stuff
[00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:45.180]   and she's always
[00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:47.180]   um, you know
[00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:49.900]   uh amazed by you know, how how
[00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:57.580]   How how interesting the universe is how interesting the creation is and you know, if you observe the creatures
[00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:59.980]   the animals
[00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:01.900]   most most of the animals
[00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:03.020]   when they
[00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:05.020]   give birth to
[00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:09.980]   The babies so-called the babies usually the babies can take care of themselves, right?
[00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.700]   either deer or birds
[00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:14.040]   uh
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:17.740]   Eagles, right? Usually they can take care of themselves, right?
[00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:24.620]   And the effort to feed them the effort to protect them are usually uh, pretty minimal
[00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:27.180]   but for humans
[00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:29.340]   We are not
[00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:34.220]   We're not you you think about it when we when we were born
[00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:37.100]   We were helpless
[00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:40.620]   We were powerless and when it's someone our parents
[00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:43.660]   you know to
[00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:46.700]   Love us to protect us to feed us
[00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:49.980]   And this is what verse two is all about
[00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:52.780]   It says god
[00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:54.540]   has ordained
[00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:56.540]   praise
[00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:58.540]   In the babies
[00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:06.380]   Right, I think a better translation is not the niv translation here. I think better translation is the word praise is actually strength
[00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:11.420]   Fortress or protection that means god is to protect
[00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:14.060]   the helpless babies
[00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:16.620]   Those people who find them helpless
[00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:22.220]   Those people who find them powerless and weak and they humble themselves before god
[00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:27.500]   And they're not proud before god. They will receive the protection and strength from god
[00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:30.780]   That's that's what psalm 8 is all about
[00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:35.180]   David looked at the sky and the universe and he
[00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:41.820]   Recovered the sense of wonder god is so great because the creation is so so great and we are so helpless
[00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:48.080]   And we are so powerless and we have to look up to god for help and strength and protection
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:51.020]   That's what psalm 8 2 is all about
[00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:56.620]   Now, um, we have to understand the psalm we have to understand the
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:00.620]   Design of the psalms, you know, the book of psalm has 150
[00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:03.880]   Psalms in it, right?
[00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:06.840]   And uh here I list out the first 14
[00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:11.800]   14 psalms and we know the the entire book of psalms the psalter
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.400]   has
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:17.020]   Two two psalms in the beginning psalm one and two as introduction
[00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:21.960]   Is a dual introduction to the entire book of worship book of psalms
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:29.560]   And then there's a group of psalms psalm three to seven we call them psalms of david is written by david
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:35.480]   um, and all of this psalms from three to seven has has one
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:38.100]   single central theme
[00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:40.360]   Is that david?
[00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:41.960]   was helpless
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.960]   he was being anointed king, but
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:49.240]   Uh, he was pursued by his enemies and he was hopeless to defend himself
[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:53.740]   And he prayed to god and he's trusting god and god becomes his protection
[00:15:53.740 --> 00:16:01.400]   And he puts his faith in god and god defends him god defends the humble and overcome his enemies
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:05.880]   That's what psalm three to seven is all about and then there's another group of psalms
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:08.440]   nine to fourteen
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:11.080]   Uh runs along the same idea
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:14.280]   They are the individual laments
[00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:17.640]   the psalmist is crying out to god because he
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:23.020]   Is powerless against his enemies all these persecutions and all these sufferings
[00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:28.600]   Uh difficulties in life and he look up to god psalm nine to fourteen
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:31.800]   It's all about humble people finding protection in god
[00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:34.440]   And psalm eight is right
[00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:39.240]   Between right at the center and it celebrates the power of god
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:42.120]   power of god over those
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:43.800]   Who are like babies?
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.480]   Who are defenseless?
[00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:47.480]   Who are powerless?
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:54.120]   Now should we get that feeling when we read the psalm along with the psalmist david
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:58.520]   And we are all struck by the power of god in creation
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:04.520]   And at the same time the power of creation the power of god humbles us
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:08.760]   And in light of god's greatness, we are like babies
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:13.240]   We exist we have our beings all depend on
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:15.800]   the god
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:21.000]   Who create everything who created you and who created me who sustained you?
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.720]   And who also sustained me?
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:27.240]   Without god we cannot
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:29.400]   be
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:31.400]   We cannot exist
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:35.400]   A couple weeks ago. Um, I have some serious, uh lower back pain
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:41.160]   You know, I haven't had back pain for a long time, but in a couple weeks ago, I just had this, you know
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:49.160]   Very quite serious, uh lower back pain and uh, I use a lot of uh, salonpas, you know, I put some all around me
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:54.760]   All around me, but you know, it didn't really help right and then my my skin got rashes in
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:57.240]   It's just terrible right?
[00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:01.880]   And I and I don't know what to do and I didn't get hurt, you know, I didn't do anything to get hurt
[00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:06.360]   And um, I don't know. Yeah, i'm over 50 years old, right?
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:08.280]   You look at me
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:10.280]   I'm in pretty good shape, right?
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.160]   Compared to other over 50 years old man, right?
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:19.880]   If you grade a man who were 50 years old, you know, great a b c d f right? I'm probably on the uh,
[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:22.680]   You know the top level, right?
[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:30.920]   But you know, I just find it difficult to to recognize that I I have this back pain, you know for days
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:36.280]   And the only conclusion I had is that i'm getting old
[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:39.080]   I'm getting old
[00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:41.080]   And don't we all get get old, right?
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:46.920]   um, we we we get weak and we realize that only god
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:54.840]   Is our strength and that's why god is worthy of our praise when we see and sense his power in the creation
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:59.560]   Uh, psalm 8 continues to to tell us our worth
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:06.840]   Right. So david look at the universe and he think of how majestic the power of god is and he also
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:10.760]   Like looking in into the mirror
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:15.320]   He understand his own position in the universe
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:20.600]   Verse three he says when I consider your heavens the work of your fingers
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:24.360]   The moon and the stars which you have set in place
[00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:29.320]   What is man that you are mindful of him the son of man that you care for him?
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:32.120]   So he exclaims
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:38.520]   When I consider the heavens when I see that how big the universe is it tells us
[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:41.400]   Hey, we are not worthless
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.400]   Even though we are so small
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.560]   And we are so insignificant
[00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:49.960]   But god cares for you and for me
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:55.320]   Sometimes don't we feel that way, you know go for our daily life, you know, we we
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:59.480]   We have to tackle different challenges and you know life is tough, right?
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:05.240]   And sometimes we do feel that way. We are insignificant. Nobody cares about us, right?
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:11.480]   Psalmic says no you are worthy in god's sight
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:18.280]   Yes, we are not worthy of the grace of god, right no one can earn the grace of god no one can
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:21.800]   Right. We're all sinners. We're all broken. However
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:24.440]   in the other hand
[00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:26.840]   The bible reminds us and psalm 8 reminds us
[00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:29.160]   We are worthy
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:31.160]   of god's sight
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:34.200]   And that's why some people read the psalm
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.120]   as
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:38.120]   Telling us the paradox
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:40.120]   of human being
[00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:42.120]   You know what paradox is
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:45.260]   It's not quite contradiction. It's not logical contradiction
[00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:49.560]   Paradox, it's like it's like two sides of the same coin
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:52.440]   Right, it tells different
[00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:54.920]   Aspect of the same entity
[00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:57.560]   Right, but it's a different angle
[00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:04.520]   Here psalm tells us the paradox of human being and we find both sides of being human
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:07.000]   Yes on the one hand
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.420]   In the vast universe. We are just like a speck of dust. We're so insignificant
[00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:14.600]   Yet on the other hand
[00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:16.920]   In god's sight you are worthy
[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:20.360]   It says what is man?
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:23.560]   man in hebrew is
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:30.440]   And knows it's it's a it's a common word in hebrew to describe mankind. I think the nlt gets it
[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:35.820]   Right nlt new living translation gets it right it translated as mere mortals
[00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:40.040]   Mere mortals and we are all mere mortals, right?
[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:43.560]   And we'll die someday. We'll pass away someday, right?
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:47.240]   The song leader the worship leader reminds us right?
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:50.600]   Our life is broken, right? We are fragile
[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:55.640]   We pass away quickly, right time flies. I was talking to one of the brothers
[00:21:55.640 --> 00:22:01.560]   Uh, you know, he said oh my kid is eight years old ten years old now, right? I said time flies
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:06.920]   Right, we pass away. I pass away quickly and we're mortals
[00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:09.880]   and then
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:13.720]   The son of man. What is the son of man that you care for him?
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:16.120]   right
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:19.000]   Here the original language is son of adam
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:24.680]   Where we get the english name adam, right? So we all know some hebrew, right?
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:26.680]   adam
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:28.600]   son of adam
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:34.440]   And what does it mean son of adam, you know hebrew hebrew is a pretty interesting, uh language sometimes
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:42.520]   Two words sound alike and the meaning are related, you know and adam or adam is one of the words
[00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:45.480]   Adam means you know man
[00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:50.760]   Person or a human being right and then in hebrew
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:53.320]   ground
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:54.680]   the earth
[00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:56.360]   You know the dust
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:59.100]   The earth what we're stepping on is adamah
[00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:02.360]   Right. So adam and adamah
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:05.560]   They're related right with dust
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:13.320]   We're turning to dust right? We are so close to the ground, right? So when when you die, you know six feet under right?
[00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:16.920]   We are mere mortals
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:20.680]   And the psalmist david is using those terms to remind us
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:25.500]   That we are limited. We are powerless and we are insignificant
[00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:29.340]   So yeah, there you go. If you feel that you are insignificant
[00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:32.600]   Nobody care about you and you sometimes feel
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:37.720]   That you are not good enough or you don't measure up when you compare to other people
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:41.000]   You're exactly right
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:46.680]   You should feel that way I should feel that way but the song reminds us the other side of the same coin
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:52.680]   That we marvel how valuable we are in the sight of god
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:56.200]   Again, two terms tell you
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:24:00.280]   How much worth you have in the sight of god?
[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:05.080]   That you are mindful of him. What is meant that you are mindful of him?
[00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:10.200]   Mindful of him can be translated. God remembers you right?
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:12.680]   Uh when you're happy
[00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:20.280]   God remembers you when you are crying when you are weeping when you're sad when you're depressed god think about you
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:22.680]   think of you
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:24.600]   That's what mindful means
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:25.720]   and then
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:29.560]   What is the son of man that you god you care for him?
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:32.040]   and the word care
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:35.400]   Uh, it's a very interesting term again in hebrew. It can
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:38.040]   It basically means
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:45.640]   Role calling role calling, you know when we go to primary school when you go to high school the teacher walks into the classroom
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:48.120]   and she does
[00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:49.060]   the
[00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:51.060]   Attendance sheet, right?
[00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:53.240]   And then we'll call every single one of you
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:55.880]   Call you by name. Are you here?
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:58.520]   Call you by name. Are you here?
[00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:01.000]   That's what care for means
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.080]   You are on the list of god's
[00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:08.280]   attendance
[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:12.040]   You are here and god is mindful of you that god cares for you
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:15.160]   So
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:19.720]   Here it reminds us that we are valuable in the sight of god
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:25.160]   and then at the same time he continues in verses five to nine to tell us how
[00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:30.440]   You know how how um, how glorious we are
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:36.440]   Versus five and following god you made him man
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:41.880]   Every one of us a little lower than the heavenly beings or angels
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:45.720]   And crown him with glory and honor
[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:48.840]   You see that in the sight of god
[00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:50.520]   We are crowned
[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:52.520]   with glory and honor
[00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:59.480]   We are so much better. We we this phrase is with glory and honor crown with crown him with glory and honor
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:04.840]   Basically means you have the highest honor in the entire universe
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:08.520]   No, you're different from all the other creatures
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:16.040]   Because we human beings are being created in the image of god and we have so much worth in the sight of god
[00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:18.920]   Yes, we are limited
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:20.920]   but we are
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:23.940]   Valuable in the sight of god
[00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:26.280]   Let me continue verse
[00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:28.440]   verse six and following
[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:34.200]   You made him ruler over the works of your hand and you put everything under his feet
[00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:37.560]   all flocks and herds and beasts of the field
[00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:43.880]   The birds of the air the fish of the sea all that swim the paths of the seas
[00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:46.740]   Everything is under
[00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:48.920]   the feet of men
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:52.220]   Under the feet of humankind
[00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:56.920]   Um god made us god made human beings
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:03.180]   This is not an accident this is not an afterthought
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:09.000]   The psalmist is reminding you that god made you
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:17.400]   God made you however insignificant you feel god made you god created you
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:26.040]   Now you remember some some years ago. I talked about this picture pale blue dot remember this picture
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:31.560]   Um, it's it's taken by uh, nasa's uh voyage one
[00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:35.980]   Uh many many years ago. It was taken in the year of 1990
[00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:39.880]   February 14 valentine's day
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:44.360]   um, it's the voyage one is is a is a
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:46.440]   photographing
[00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:50.520]   Machine and just being launched by nasa into the deep space
[00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:53.380]   and on that day
[00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:55.480]   1990 february 14
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:28:00.300]   The cameras switched back before, you know, uh, the earth disappeared
[00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:02.460]   And
[00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:06.700]   It took the picture and you can find the very very small dot
[00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:09.900]   the pale blue dot so-called
[00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:14.700]   still visible in the milky way
[00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:18.620]   Now that picture reminds us
[00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:25.260]   That we are a speck of dust in the universe. We're right there, right? Can you see that?
[00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:28.780]   We're right there
[00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:31.340]   and sometimes our secular culture
[00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:34.300]   Will have us believe that we are
[00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:37.100]   Not significant
[00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:43.980]   Or we have no meaning in our existence, right matters are eternal, right? All that matter
[00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:47.020]   Is the matter right?
[00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:52.300]   We're just a bunch of people, you know with our chemical makeup or physical makeup, right? And that's it
[00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:54.780]   Where is the?
[00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:57.900]   Where where is the intrinsic value of human being?
[00:28:58.460 --> 00:28:59.960]   We have no
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:02.620]   Intrinsic value. We're just accidents
[00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:05.740]   Um and nature just take its course
[00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:10.160]   And there's no inherent value or dignity in our existence
[00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:17.660]   Um, that's what the uh secular culture or naturalistic culture is trying to have us believe
[00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:21.980]   In the same way in the biblical culture
[00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:25.260]   in bible bible time
[00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:28.060]   You know all these neighbors of israel
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:30.680]   babylon egypt
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:36.620]   Or or whatever cultures are surrounding israel. They believe in some of the myths
[00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:43.660]   And some of the myths were saying that humans were being made to be slaves to other gods
[00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:49.820]   Humans exist because humans are to be slaves
[00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:56.780]   to the gods the lesser gods or the uh, the higher gods and all the gods are in in
[00:29:57.340 --> 00:29:59.340]   up there having vacation
[00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:06.300]   And you know from time to time we have to you know, bring in uh our offerings to please the gods, right?
[00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:08.860]   So the gods can have a good time up there
[00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:12.620]   And that is the cultural myth of the day
[00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:16.720]   if you if you if you hear the uh similarities
[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:20.540]   The ancient stories
[00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:24.140]   the ancient myth of humans being slaves to the gods
[00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:27.820]   Right no values and then our western
[00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:30.140]   secular culture
[00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:32.140]   They're actually pretty similar
[00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:34.300]   We are here with no reason
[00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:36.300]   but the bible
[00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:42.060]   Says something totally different the bible says we human beings are no accident
[00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:44.860]   And you are not
[00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:46.860]   an afterthought to god
[00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:49.260]   The psalmist says god made us
[00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:52.140]   a little lower than the angels
[00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:58.700]   The highest honor we can have in the entire universe and secondly, it says god made human beings
[00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:02.460]   Rulers
[00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:06.140]   So human beings are unique. We have a royal
[00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:09.020]   status
[00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:11.020]   We're like kings and queens
[00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:14.540]   Only human beings are made in the image of god
[00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:17.900]   You know you we call genesis 1
[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:21.660]   In fact, psalm 8 is a summary of genesis 1
[00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:29.180]   And it tells us god set us apart from all other things in the universe and all other creatures in the universe
[00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:31.920]   Because we are the image of god and we are the representatives
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:35.260]   Of god the king god the creator on earth
[00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:39.500]   So you read psalm 8 only nine verses
[00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:47.500]   Is actually a brief summary a condensed summary of genesis 1 god made everything in the universe for humans to flourish
[00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:52.300]   God made you and you are unique. There's no one like you
[00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:55.820]   There's no one like me and god gives
[00:31:55.820 --> 00:32:01.420]   Each and every one of us the honor to rule with him to govern
[00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:02.860]   to
[00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:04.460]   operate
[00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:05.340]   to
[00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:06.460]   take care of
[00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:07.180]   uh
[00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:12.300]   The creation and we have this honor to be part of the work of god. All right
[00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:16.940]   As we close
[00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:18.940]   I want you to take three things home
[00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:21.020]   first
[00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:23.020]   You're worthy of god's care
[00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:26.300]   Your life your existence
[00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:28.540]   It's not talking about your work
[00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:31.740]   It's not talking about your your achievement
[00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:33.740]   you
[00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:35.580]   as a human being
[00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:37.420]   Man or woman
[00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:40.780]   You are worthy of the care of the creator god
[00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:42.780]   right
[00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:44.780]   Your existence your being
[00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:53.420]   It's not talking about your work right the asian culture. We are all performance based right? Oh, we got a four point also, you know
[00:32:53.420 --> 00:33:00.940]   My parents would praise me right so I get more values or how much I earn how many figures on my paycheck
[00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:04.860]   Right. Those are our achievement that bring us values
[00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:09.980]   But some is telling you your being your existence alone
[00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:11.500]   is
[00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:12.700]   worthy
[00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:14.300]   of god's care
[00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:20.060]   And then secondly we are being called to care for the kingdom of god the creation work of god
[00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:22.940]   You go back tomorrow monday
[00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:25.660]   your accountant your teacher your
[00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:28.140]   Whatever industry you are in
[00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:33.660]   God see values in your work because you are making the you uh, the the creation
[00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:35.560]   working
[00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:36.860]   operating
[00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:39.820]   God can use the angels to do all your works
[00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:43.100]   Right to make the society running
[00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:47.580]   God can use other means but he has chosen you
[00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:51.100]   To be one of the workers to work alongside with him
[00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:58.060]   And that is the value of psalm 8. It's telling you god may you and me ruler
[00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:02.140]   We can take care of god's creation together
[00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:05.820]   And that's why we are different. That's why we're unique
[00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:07.660]   number three
[00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:10.300]   God is worthy of our worship
[00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:13.820]   God is worthy of our worship
[00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:21.920]   Uh, we have to recover the sense of wonder when we see the universe when we see the god behind the universe
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:25.340]   When we sing songs to god
[00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:31.900]   When we sing praises to god we just wonder man god is so great
[00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:39.020]   And yet he takes care of me, right? He can have relationship with me. He's like friend to me
[00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:42.700]   and I can have a personal relationship with
[00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:45.260]   with this creator
[00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:49.020]   Um god is worthy of our worship and we have to recover that sense
[00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:54.220]   You know, it's a sense of wonder all the time when we walk into the church when we worship together
[00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:57.420]   You know, I did not go to
[00:34:57.420 --> 00:35:04.780]   Uh the path of totality to see the full 100 solar eclipse. I should have gone. I should have gone now
[00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:06.540]   I regret it
[00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:12.780]   I should have gone. However, you know, my son went, you know, my son and his friends, you know about 10 of them
[00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:15.180]   uh, they drove a couple of cars and uh
[00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:22.800]   You know, my son nathan is in uh, uh champagne, right? He's in june. It's junior in in champagne
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:26.140]   So, uh, he he told us
[00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:30.380]   Hey dad, we we want to go to see uh, the uh, the solar eclipse
[00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:35.340]   I mean it would take us two hours of driving from champagne to somewhere called paris
[00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:37.260]   illinois
[00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:39.760]   Paris, you know not not france paris, illinois
[00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:43.420]   So, uh, so he told me about it, but we have to skip class
[00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:48.220]   I said sure. Yeah, right. Well you skip class anyway, so
[00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:54.860]   uh, so they drove they drove two hours to paris in the open field and then they
[00:35:54.860 --> 00:36:02.540]   They bring the cameras and they they bring the devices and uh, they do the time lapse and stuff and it's just amazing
[00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:05.500]   And he sent back some of the video files to me
[00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:12.620]   and um, I I watched those videos and there's nothing to to really see except the the eclipse because the
[00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:17.420]   The camera is is facing upward right? You can only see the sun, but I can hear what they
[00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:19.420]   say
[00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:24.940]   In the entire time the full 100 solar eclipse takes about 3.5 minutes
[00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:28.140]   And I watched those videos looking at the sun
[00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:35.420]   And hearing what they say, you know three and a half four minutes long video
[00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:39.260]   And all I hear is wow
[00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:42.700]   Whoa
[00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:43.820]   Ah
[00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:47.980]   And all that's it's meaningless, you know words, right?
[00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:51.980]   But it's their the expression of sense of wonder
[00:36:51.980 --> 00:37:00.220]   When you see the eclipse and you understand how vast the universe is and how how wonderful the universe you are all struck
[00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:02.220]   right
[00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:07.580]   And all they said in the in the entire four minutes is just that right? Wow
[00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:11.260]   This is great, this is wild
[00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:18.780]   Psalm 8 reminds us when we worship god we should have that sense of wow
[00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:22.220]   God is so great and yet he loves us
[00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:26.300]   Right you think about salvation we have in jesus christ
[00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:30.780]   God came to the speck of dust
[00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:33.420]   In this vast universe
[00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:36.220]   Jesus came and saved us
[00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:41.500]   Jesus came and died on the cross so that we can restore our relationship with him
[00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:45.180]   Wow
[00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:47.660]   We should be all struck
[00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:52.220]   By the greatness of god and by the love of god, right? Amen
[00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:56.140]   Let's all do that every single week
[00:37:57.980 --> 00:37:59.660]   When we come here
[00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:01.660]   Now we have to come on time. Okay
[00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:07.900]   But come on time because it's just like solar eclipse, right? You missed out you missed out, right?
[00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:15.740]   The entire worship service is the offering to god and to see that god is worthy of our praise
[00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:19.500]   Let's all pray together
[00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:23.420]   Father we give you thanks because
[00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:25.420]   You are a great god
[00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:28.220]   And you are great and awesome
[00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:36.700]   And god we see this universe we see this creation that you have made and we see how wonderful it is
[00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:44.320]   How great this universe is and yet we sense that we are so insignificant
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:47.660]   We're so small
[00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:49.900]   We're so tiny
[00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:52.780]   But you are mindful of each and every one of us
[00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:56.140]   So we thank you for your love
[00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:58.460]   Thank you for your grace
[00:38:58.460 --> 00:39:07.100]   And only in jesus christ we can be your people and we can be called your children
[00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:12.780]   So we come before you we just want to recover the sense of wonder
[00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:17.980]   To worship you to praise you and to see how great you are
[00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:21.420]   And how worthy we are in your sight

[00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:37.660]   And show them your glory your reality
[00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:44.140]   So we pray that you will continue to grow us into this spiritual awe and wonder
[00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:46.860]   That we can truly worship you
