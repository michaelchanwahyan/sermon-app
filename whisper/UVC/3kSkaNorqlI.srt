1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,980
 >> Thanks, it's always good to see you.

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:09,400
 Why don't we say hi to your neighbors?

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:14,360
 Say hi and give them a fist bump or something.

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,360
 Greet them in the Lord.

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,880
 It's always good to worship together as a church.

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,160
 This is what we are being called to.

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:28,520
 One thing is very important that Muir announced is that the new devotion series on Apostles

8
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,520
 Creek.

9
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:35,000
 All right, so if you don't know anything about Apostles Creek, I hope you will enjoy the

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,960
 devotional.

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,680
 Every single day we're going to send it out to your chat group, to your social media group.

12
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:51,020
 So please read that because in the following weeks I'm going to go through sermon series

13
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,000
 on the Apostles Creek, which is very, very important.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,400
 Apostles Creek is a summary of our faith.

15
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,720
 How many of you have read through the Bible, the whole Bible?

16
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:05,000
 From cover to cover, from Genesis to, wow, that's great, that's great.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Two, all right, three, four, all right, are you sure?

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 Four, five, okay, more hands, okay, six.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,240
 All right, how many of you have read through the entire Bible but you don't understand

20
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,240
 much of it?

21
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,520
 Yeah, I mean, right?

22
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,680
 We all struggle to get to know the Word.

23
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,760
 We believe that the Bible is written for us.

24
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:33,800
 It's for all generations of Christians, all right, even though it's not directly to us,

25
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,400
 but it's for us, it's written for us.

26
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:41,640
 However, when you read the Bible, there are tons of things that we may find confusing

27
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,760
 or we just don't have enough background information to know about it.

28
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:53,440
 However, the Apostles Creek is a summary to help us, it's like a big scale map to understand

29
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,520
 what the Christian faith is all about, all right?

30
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,280
 So it's very important, so make sure you go through the daily devotional on Apostles Creek,

31
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,280
 all right?

32
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:11,400
 So today, we're going to continue our series on the last days, the eschaton, what we call

33
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,880
 eschatology, right?

34
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:19,280
 So we're going to read the passage from 1 Thessalonians 4, but before we read that,

35
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,960
 let's look at this chart.

36
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:26,680
 This is a very popular understanding of what is going on in the last days, what is going

37
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:33,240
 on before, right before the yellow arrow, the second coming of Christ.

38
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:39,840
 This is very popular in our American culture especially, even in Chinese churches, even

39
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,320
 in our culture.

40
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:49,600
 There are many, many people who promote this kind of understanding.

41
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:56,640
 Now as you can see, the kind of the light blue line is the timeline from left to right.

42
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:03,560
 So we're going ahead into this timeline, going into some sort of future, right?

43
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,000
 And the church is right there, we are right in between.

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,280
 I have talked about the already and not yet concept.

45
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,640
 Christ has already come.

46
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,200
 He died on the cross and he rose again.

47
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,300
 And then there are generations of churches, right?

48
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:24,880
 And before that yellow arrow, the really glorious second coming of Christ, most people will

49
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:31,760
 find that this kind of popular understanding is what you hear a lot of time.

50
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,000
 Is that before the second coming of Christ, before the yellow arrow, before the glorious

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,760
 second coming of Christ, there will be seven years of tribulation.

52
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,280
 There will be unprecedented suffering on earth.

53
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,040
 And then, right before the seven years of tribulations, there will be something called

54
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,040
 rapture.

55
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,100
 Something called secret rapture.

56
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:56,520
 So Christ is coming in this scheme, in this kind of understanding, Christ is going to

57
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,320
 come two times.

58
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,480
 The first time is in secret, alright?

59
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,900
 Suddenly in secret, nobody knows.

60
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:10,240
 And then rapture the believers, rapture the church, disappear out of the world, okay?

61
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:14,360
 Out of the world and taken us to heaven, alright?

62
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,560
 And then the seven years of tribulation will kick in on earth.

63
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:25,920
 And there will be wars and there will be tons of, you know, crises happening on earth for

64
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,520
 seven years.

65
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:33,960
 And then after the seven years, after this crisis, Christ will come again.

66
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,840
 That's the yellow arrow.

67
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:44,600
 And then the new heaven and new earth will be launched, will be escort on earth.

68
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:52,400
 Now this is, as I said, a very popular understanding of what is going on in our days, alright?

69
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,320
 Especially in American culture.

70
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,720
 There are many people who talk about rapture.

71
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,640
 You can see on the upper left is the left behind series.

72
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:13,880
 This is a very popular novel series trying to put together a story of some kind to talk

73
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:19,000
 about the secret rapture and then seven years of tribulations.

74
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,680
 Very popular and millions and millions of copies are being sold.

75
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:29,040
 And even being translated into different languages, including Korean, including Chinese, and all

76
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,080
 sorts of Asian languages.

77
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,480
 Very popular.

78
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:41,680
 And also there are on the lower left is some sort of bumper stickers.

79
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,400
 You can buy and talk about rapture.

80
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,240
 In case of rapture, can you see that, the white one?

81
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:55,760
 This car will be unmanned because you will disappear according to the scheme.

82
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:04,440
 And then at the lower center, warning in case of rapture, this Facebook page will no longer

83
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,440
 be updated because you will disappear, right?

84
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,680
 As the church, as believers, you will disappear.

85
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,960
 And then on the right, on the background, there is a rapture ready index webpage.

86
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,640
 You can go check it out.

87
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:26,000
 But I advise you not to because this is a popular cultural understanding of second coming.

88
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,160
 It may not be the right, correct understanding because when we read the Bible, we need to

89
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:39,240
 understand there is a background to every single passage, including the passages we

90
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,280
 are going to read, the so-called rapture passage.

91
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:49,800
 So we're going to read this passage line by line together and see how it applies to us.

92
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,640
 So I'm going to set it right out front.

93
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,680
 I'm going to debunk this popular understanding.

94
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,320
 There's no secret rapture of this kind.

95
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,120
 So what this passage is all about.

96
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,200
 Let's do this.

97
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,040
 First Thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13.

98
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,880
 We're going to start from there.

99
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:18,960
 "Brothers, we do not want you to be ignorant about those who fall asleep or to grieve like

100
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,960
 the rest of men who have no hope."

101
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,720
 Now you need to understand when we read the letters to the churches, Paul's letters to

102
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:35,960
 churches or other letters to the church in the New Testament is always a reply email.

103
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,640
 What do I mean by that?

104
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,800
 You do all, you all do emails, right?

105
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,600
 Let's say you get the reply emails only.

106
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,440
 You don't get the original email.

107
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:51,640
 But from the reply email, you kind of figure out what the original email is all about,

108
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,640
 right?

109
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,640
 You know what I'm saying?

110
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,140
 That's how you read the letters.

111
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,520
 That's how you read First Thessalonians.

112
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,680
 Paul wrote this stuff to the church in Thessalonica.

113
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,200
 It's because he is trying to answer some of the questions that they have asked.

114
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,800
 So the churches in Thessalonica, they have some problems.

115
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,440
 They have some issues.

116
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,200
 So they wrote to Paul or they have a messenger sent to Paul.

117
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:23,240
 And Paul is writing First Thessalonians chapter 4, this passage as a reply to tell them what

118
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,060
 the answers are to address their questions.

119
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:32,640
 So what he's saying is that there seems to be some vital concern for the early Christians

120
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,360
 in Thessalonica.

121
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:41,200
 The early Christian church, they, of course, they had hope for the future coming of Christ,

122
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,900
 the future resurrection, right?

123
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,880
 Because Christ has already rose from the dead, right?

124
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,520
 Someday he will come according to his word.

125
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:56,400
 And the return of Christ in glory, everyone in the early church, in all churches would

126
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,240
 believe that.

127
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:06,080
 So before these things happen, some of the people in the Thessalonian church have passed

128
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,080
 away.

129
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:12,800
 Some of those in Christ, brothers and sisters in Christ, they have passed away or some of

130
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,640
 those even martyr, died for their faith.

131
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,580
 A few of them.

132
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:26,260
 So obviously the Christians in Thessalonica were doubting because they have no hope.

133
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,140
 What about these people?

134
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:33,680
 Would they miss, would they miss out the glorious coming of Christ?

135
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,920
 If he comes anytime, right?

136
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:42,240
 If human history will conclude with the end, the eschaton, right?

137
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,900
 God, God's son will come in glory.

138
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,320
 Those of us who receive Christ, right?

139
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,400
 Will welcome Christ in glory.

140
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:58,480
 What about those who have passed away in Jesus?

141
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,880
 What about those Christians, brothers and sisters who have passed away?

142
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,120
 Will they miss the glorious coming of Christ promised to us?

143
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,520
 Will they?

144
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:11,680
 And Paul is saying, absolutely no way.

145
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:18,320
 Paul is saying, we do not want you to be ignorant about those who fall asleep.

146
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,680
 Those who have passed away.

147
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:26,400
 Now falling asleep is a metaphor, meaning dying in Christ.

148
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,240
 So Paul is saying, absolutely no way.

149
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,520
 Let's see how he answer the questions.

150
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:37,700
 Verse 14, we believe that Jesus died and rose again.

151
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:43,760
 So we believe that God will bring with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in him.

152
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:52,560
 According to the Lord's own word, we tell you that we who are still alive, who are left

153
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:59,760
 to the coming of the Lord, will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep.

154
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,560
 Now what is he talking about?

155
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:07,720
 He said those who have fallen asleep, again it's a metaphor for dying in Christ.

156
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:12,040
 They will not miss out the glorious second coming of Christ.

157
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:18,360
 They will actually be the first in line to welcome Christ, to see Christ, to see his

158
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,600
 glory.

159
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:29,440
 So the apostle is saying, the dead in Christ, they will rise from the dead first, followed

160
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,000
 by us, right?

161
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,780
 They will rise first.

162
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:37,040
 They will be taken up into the air.

163
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:45,240
 And we who are alive as coming, will also be taken up in the air to join the Lord, so

164
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:52,920
 called to meet the Lord in the air as Jesus is coming down in trumpet sound and glory.

165
00:11:52,920 --> 00:12:00,560
 Verse 16, for the Lord himself, he's talking about second coming, will come down from heaven

166
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:07,280
 with a loud command, with the voice of archangel, with the trumpet call of God, the dead in

167
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,520
 Christ will rise first.

168
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:20,040
 After that, we who are still alive and the left, will be caught up together with them

169
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:25,080
 in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.

170
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:31,400
 So you got a picture, at the end of human history, when Christ comes again, it will

171
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:38,640
 be the appearance of a public appearance, a loud command, the voice of archangels, the

172
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:43,600
 trumpet call of God, the dead in Christ will rise first.

173
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,920
 They will welcome Christ first.

174
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:53,680
 Now it's not that Christ will come so far in the mid air, and then some of those will

175
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:59,080
 rise from the dead and meet him in the air, and then we turn back to heaven.

176
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:04,640
 No as you see the context here, Christ is on the way from heaven to earth.

177
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,880
 It's a one way street.

178
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:12,560
 He is on the way coming, and then those who are on earth, those who are dead in Christ,

179
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,760
 they will rise first and will meet him in the air as he coming down.

180
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:25,200
 So it's kind of being sent to rise and then to meet Christ in the air and then come back

181
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,420
 to earth.

182
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:36,640
 So the imagery is this, we who are still alive, when the second coming happens, we will be

183
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:41,200
 with those who have died in the Lord.

184
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:50,280
 We will be meeting the coming Christ, descending Christ as he is returning in glory.

185
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:59,920
 Actually this is the technical term here, to meet the Lord in the air, to meet, to meet.

186
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,240
 What does it mean?

187
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:08,680
 It is a technical term frequently used in the Roman Empire.

188
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:19,040
 For a city, they will have a welcome committee, get ready and prepare to welcome a governor

189
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:27,580
 or a victorious general or the Caesar, the king, the emperor to come to town.

190
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:34,520
 When emperor comes to town, when an important government official comes to town, the city

191
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:38,480
 will organize a welcoming party, a welcoming team.

192
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:46,440
 They will go out in the midway to meet the emperor first, okay, to worship him, to meet

193
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:52,760
 him and then escort him back to the city, back to the town.

194
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:58,380
 That is what it means to meet the Lord in the air.

195
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:06,680
 So Paul is using a first century political scene to talk about the coming of the true

196
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,660
 king.

197
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:12,780
 The true king is Jesus, is Christ himself.

198
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:19,360
 Now when the Roman armies come back from a campaign, when the Roman armies go out to

199
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:25,400
 the east or west or north or south, when they conquer their enemies, they have taken some

200
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:30,640
 captives and they will return to the city of Rome and before they will enter the city

201
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:37,320
 of Rome, they will camp outside of the city, about a mile or so away.

202
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:45,340
 And then they will send a messenger into the city and talk to the senate of Rome to announce

203
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:54,920
 the immediate arrival of the victorious king, of the general, of the victorious army.

204
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,040
 Then they will give the city some time.

205
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:05,040
 The city planners will put together some sort of people to decorate the city and to prepare

206
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:12,240
 for a parade for the conquering king, the hero for homecoming.

207
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:17,360
 So this is the sort of the political scene that often happens in the city of Rome and

208
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,240
 many different cities in the Roman Empire.

209
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:27,900
 And then after the planning, there will be a trumpet blast being made.

210
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:38,520
 And then the signal will be for the armies to march in triumphant into the city.

211
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:45,520
 That's the meeting committee, the welcoming committee, to welcome the king into the city.

212
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:52,080
 So the citizens of Rome sometimes are being invited to join the welcoming committee, to

213
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:57,480
 be invited to go outside of the city, outside of the city wall, to join the parade and march

214
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:05,160
 back through the arch of triumph with the victorious army.

215
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:11,680
 Some of the officials, some of the high status citizens will participate in this kind of

216
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:15,320
 victory march.

217
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:20,960
 Now this sort of things actually also happen in our days.

218
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:26,160
 When I first came to Chicago, it was about 20 some years ago, some of the locals who

219
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:31,400
 know all the local history here, they told me some interesting stories.

220
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:38,840
 And I remember this part, we were driving in South Loop.

221
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:42,200
 He told me this story, a local friend.

222
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:48,120
 He said in the mid '90s, in the mid '90s, those of you who are old enough to remember

223
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:58,880
 this, right, in Chicago, mid '90s, when President, ex-President Clinton came to Chicago, he landed

224
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:05,440
 in Grand Park with a military helicopter in the mid '90s.

225
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,360
 And then there were a party of people welcoming him.

226
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:15,200
 In order to prepare for his arrival, the city of Chicago actually renovate part of Roosevelt

227
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,200
 Road.

228
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,600
 Have you been there?

229
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:24,920
 There was a stretch of Roosevelt Road nicer than the rest of it.

230
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,920
 You know why?

231
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:31,320
 My local friend told me it was because the city, in order to prepare for the arrival

232
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:38,600
 of the ex-President, arrival of Clinton, they renovate this entire stretch of Roosevelt

233
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:44,880
 Road so that when he comes for the National Convention, there will be honor, there will

234
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,200
 be a glory, right?

235
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,200
 It's kind of a celebration.

236
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,200
 Do you know that?

237
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,880
 You didn't know that, right?

238
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,880
 You pay for it.

239
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:59,360
 (Laughter) Now this is a sort of the political scene

240
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,480
 Paul was using.

241
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:07,180
 And he was obviously using the first century political scene from the Roman Empire and

242
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:15,240
 trying to tell you who is the true king and how we should prepare ourselves for his second

243
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,240
 coming.

244
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:24,640
 Now you can see throughout Paul's writings that he often borrows or subverts the Roman

245
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:32,680
 political images and apply them, subvert them, apply them to Christ.

246
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:36,880
 Because Christ is the only true king, not Caesar.

247
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:44,440
 Now you can imagine Paul is trying to use that scene to talk about the arrival, second

248
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,640
 coming of Christ in a horizontal way.

249
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:58,320
 Like Christ is like the victorious general, the victorious king marching toward the city.

250
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:04,720
 And then we as a city, we will prepare ourselves for the arrival of the true king.

251
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,640
 We will go out midway to meet him, right?

252
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:16,120
 And then the first in line to meet him would be those who are already dead in Christ.

253
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:23,840
 Now in the ancient days, when you die, your tomb is often outside the city wall.

254
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,840
 You got it?

255
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,840
 Because it's unclean, right?

256
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,840
 It's unclean.

257
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,140
 It's always outside the city wall.

258
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:36,840
 So you go out of the city, out of the city gate, you look around, there are tombs, right?

259
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,400
 That is the picture in Jerusalem, there is a picture in Rome, there is a picture in a

260
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,360
 lot of ancient Mediterranean cities.

261
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,160
 The tombs are outside the city wall.

262
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,480
 So you can see what Paul is doing.

263
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:55,800
 When the king is coming toward the town, the first to meet the victorious king of course

264
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,220
 are those who are dead already.

265
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,000
 They will rise first.

266
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,280
 They will be the first in line to meet the true king.

267
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:11,840
 And then we who are still alive within the city, we will join the welcoming committee.

268
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,920
 And we go out midway to meet Christ.

269
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,920
 Now that's the horizontal picture.

270
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:23,960
 Now I want you to turn it 90 degree, vertical.

271
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,280
 That is the picture of the second coming of Christ.

272
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:31,240
 Of course Christ is not coming horizontally.

273
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,240
 Christ is coming vertically.

274
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,240
 He is from heaven.

275
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,240
 He is from above.

276
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:42,280
 So when Christ comes in the time of second coming, midway, those who are dead in Christ,

277
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:48,200
 they will rise first, be the first to meet Him in midair.

278
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,200
 Not to go away and disappear.

279
00:21:51,200 --> 00:22:01,520
 But as He is descending, as He is coming on earth with glory, we rise with those who are

280
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:09,800
 dead in Christ, will come in midway to meet Him and come down.

281
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,160
 You see what I'm saying, right?

282
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:18,200
 We will be joining the welcoming committee to welcome the true king.

283
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,880
 Now as you can imagine, Christ coming in glory from heaven.

284
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:26,960
 Those who die in the Lord will go up and meet Him in the air.

285
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:32,880
 That is the second coming Paul is talking about.

286
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,600
 Now why does he talk about these things?

287
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:41,400
 As I told you again and again, in this series when we talk about the book of Revelation

288
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:51,560
 or the second coming of Christ, eschatology, eschaton, the end of time, the last days.

289
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:56,200
 You need to understand in the New Testament when it talks about the second coming of Christ,

290
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,760
 it's not some abstract idea.

291
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:06,000
 It's not for us to, okay let's figure out, are there any things happening, what kind

292
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,520
 of terrible things will happen, is it a weather forecast or something like that.

293
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,600
 It's not abstract idea.

294
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:17,280
 It is not newspaper written ahead of time.

295
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,120
 It's actually a very practical teaching.

296
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,480
 Eschatology is always practical.

297
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,800
 You know the end is always practical.

298
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,600
 Now why do I say that?

299
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:36,720
 418, remember Paul is trying to answer a question from the Thessalonians questions.

300
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,060
 What kind of questions did they have?

301
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,060
 Some of them are martyrs.

302
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,080
 They passed away in the Lord, right?

303
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,480
 And they're really really sad.

304
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,800
 They're really heartbroken.

305
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:54,840
 Now Paul is trying to say to them, they will not miss out the glorious coming of Christ.

306
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,880
 In fact they will be the first.

307
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,000
 They will be the first to see the glorious kingdom, right?

308
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,960
 Those who are dead in Christ, they will rise first.

309
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,000
 They will welcome Him first and followed by us.

310
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:14,240
 418, he says, "Therefore, encourage each other with these words."

311
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,400
 How can these words, the things that we talk about, the second coming of Christ, the coming

312
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,240
 to meet error and welcome Him back.

313
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:26,280
 How can we encourage one another with these words?

314
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:33,160
 You remember at the beginning he says, "We grieve for those who passed away in the Lord."

315
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,160
 We grieve.

316
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:41,120
 Our brothers and sisters, our family members, those who are in Christ, those who are Christians.

317
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,440
 They passed away before we do.

318
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,840
 Of course we will grieve, right?

319
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:52,880
 Tomorrow I'm going to a funeral, a Christian funeral.

320
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,560
 Of course we will grieve.

321
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,200
 We will weep.

322
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,680
 Because such a loss to all of us, right?

323
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:04,880
 The death of your loved one is the death of part of you.

324
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,680
 It's taking away part of you, a big part of you.

325
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,680
 We will grieve.

326
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:17,160
 But Paul is saying, as we grieve, we don't grieve with those who are without hope.

327
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:21,320
 We have a hope that transcends death.

328
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,740
 That transcends all of our tears.

329
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:29,040
 Because someday Christ will come and make things right.

330
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:36,680
 When the new heaven and new earth come down from heaven, Revelation, the last two chapters,

331
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:40,440
 there will be no pain and no death and no tears.

332
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,360
 There will be no evil.

333
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:51,040
 That is the hope that transcends everything else, even our final enemy, death itself.

334
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:59,040
 I always say when I officiate a funeral, I always say in a Christian funeral, we don't

335
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:03,520
 say goodbye to our loved one.

336
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,880
 What do we say?

337
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,600
 We say, "See you later."

338
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,560
 We say, "See you later."

339
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,680
 That is the glorious hope we have in Christ.

340
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,280
 So don't forget that.

341
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,480
 Don't forget that.

342
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:28,120
 Secondly, eschatology is practical because it help us to put things in perspective.

343
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:37,040
 Put our lives and our lifestyle, today's work, today's how you live, put things in

344
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,040
 perspective.

345
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,240
 Why?

346
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,400
 Because we know there's a final destination we're going to.

347
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,040
 And Christ will come again.

348
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:53,080
 The new heaven and new earth, the new kingdom, the future kingdom, is the country that we

349
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:56,240
 are going to.

350
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:02,640
 I always tell Christians, we have two passports.

351
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:08,720
 The first passport is our earthly passport.

352
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:14,240
 Maybe China, maybe UK, maybe American passport.

353
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,440
 That is one of our passports.

354
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:23,960
 The other passport is the kingdom of God passport.

355
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:31,880
 Now if you compare it side by side, the earthly passport will expire.

356
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,880
 You have to renew it.

357
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,120
 And sometimes you cannot renew it.

358
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,360
 You got to change it.

359
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:41,080
 That is your first passport.

360
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,520
 Your national identity.

361
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,920
 Where you belong on earth.

362
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,920
 It will expire.

363
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,920
 It has expiration date.

364
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,920
 Did you check that?

365
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,920
 Your passport?

366
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:54,760
 It has expiration date.

367
00:27:54,760 --> 00:28:00,200
 Your early citizenship will expire.

368
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:04,240
 But our kingdom of God passport will not expire.

369
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,960
 It's eternal.

370
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,580
 Okay, you don't have to check it.

371
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:15,960
 But what you do need to check is that where you are living up to, that passport, that

372
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,960
 identity.

373
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:22,280
 We are not so much living for our earthly identity.

374
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:28,440
 No matter what nationality you belong to, it will pass away.

375
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,440
 You know that?

376
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,440
 It will pass away.

377
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:36,120
 It really doesn't matter at the time of funeral.

378
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:42,360
 What will last forever is your heavenly citizenship.

379
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,360
 That you belong to God.

380
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:48,120
 You belong to true king, Jesus himself.

381
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:52,560
 So it's practical in that sense we need to remind ourselves.

382
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:57,920
 Are we really the heavenly citizen?

383
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:03,760
 So as you can tell, there were a lot of passages we have worked through in the past many sermons

384
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,080
 of this series.

385
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:10,320
 Be it book of Revelation or book of Matthew or other passages.

386
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,200
 When Jesus talks about the last days, when Paul talks about the last days, he always

387
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,760
 talks about how we live today.

388
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,080
 How we live in light of the future.

389
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:24,720
 How we live in light of the coming kingdom.

390
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,680
 How we live in light of that future.

391
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,480
 Remember the gospel of Matthew?

392
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,000
 He talks about, Jesus talks about his coming.

393
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,080
 It's a list of signs, right?

394
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:42,160
 There are many things that will tell you his coming is imminent.

395
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,800
 His coming anytime.

396
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:49,040
 And that's always followed by some sort of practical teaching.

397
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,560
 The parables.

398
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:54,280
 Remember the parables of ten bridesmaids, right?

399
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,280
 Five of them prepared the oil.

400
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:59,160
 Five of them did not prepare for the oil.

401
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:04,640
 So when the groom comes, finally they have to go, again the same picture.

402
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,960
 They go halfway out to meet the groom, right?

403
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,640
 To join him and escort him back to the banquet.

404
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:15,160
 Five of those who are prepared, they can enter the banquet.

405
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:19,700
 The five of those who thought they have prepared, but they did not.

406
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,720
 So they could not go into the banquet.

407
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,560
 The master said, "I don't even know you."

408
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,560
 That's the first parable.

409
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,880
 The second parable is the talent parable.

410
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:36,200
 With the master going away, and give his talents to his three servants.

411
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:40,600
 Five thousand, two thousand, and one thousand.

412
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:46,360
 Those who have five thousand and two thousand, they took the risk and invest and increase

413
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,160
 the asset of their master.

414
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:55,480
 And they are prepared when after a long time, after a time of delay, finally the master

415
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,040
 comes back.

416
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:02,240
 Those who had, he who had the five thousand and he who had the two thousand, they are

417
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,640
 prepared to give an account.

418
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:09,040
 Because they did serve the master, increase his asset.

419
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:16,000
 The last one, with the one thousand, didn't even bother to take the smallest risk to increase

420
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,480
 the master's asset.

421
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:26,040
 So always, when Jesus talks about the last days, always reminding us how you should live

422
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,320
 today.

423
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:31,520
 Are you living in light of that future?

424
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:39,240
 Are you living worthy as a citizen of heavenly kingdom?

425
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:48,200
 You know, whatever the kingdom characterize should be our characteristics.

426
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:54,680
 If the future kingdom is full of love, then our life should live in light of that, right?

427
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,680
 We will practice love.

428
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:05,840
 If the future kingdom is nothing but justice, but righteousness, then our lives, our decisions,

429
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:11,160
 our choices should reflect that set of values.

430
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,960
 Right?

431
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:18,080
 Live according to the future.

432
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,200
 Some people said, and I'll close it with this thought.

433
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,760
 Some people said questions are actually aliens, right?

434
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,840
 Aliens, not the monsters, okay?

435
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,160
 Foreigners, okay?

436
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,040
 Where are we from?

437
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:37,920
 We are from the future.

438
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:41,040
 Because we are heading to the future, we belong to the future.

439
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:45,840
 And we bring stuff from the future to the present.

440
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,240
 We are aliens in that sense.

441
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,240
 We live differently.

442
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,240
 Why?

443
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:56,800
 When people look at your lifestyle, look at your marriage, look at your family, look

444
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:01,560
 at how you work, look at how you make decisions, they will wonder why you are different.

445
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:06,720
 Well, you are different because you belong to the future kingdom.

446
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,280
 You don't belong to the earthly kingdom.

447
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,040
 You make decisions differently.

448
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,240
 You set a priority differently.

449
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,240
 Why you come to worship today?

450
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:22,000
 Instead of, you know, just get a couple more hours of sleep, right?

451
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:30,160
 Because your decisions is affected by your hope, by your future.

452
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:33,040
 Let's do that.

453
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,880
 Share the gospel.

454
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,540
 You see the gospel is a huge thing.

455
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:44,960
 Because it talks about, it affects your eternal destiny.

456
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,560
 Live according to the future kingdom.

457
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,120
 Prepare yourselves to meet the Lord.

458
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:55,440
 Alright, one question, final question you need to ask yourself.

459
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:03,600
 If Jesus comes today, or if you are being called back home to see, one cosmic question

460
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:13,840
 you need to ask yourself is that will God see you and you can give an account?

461
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:20,120
 And Jesus will say, "You are my faithful and wise servant.

462
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,800
 You can enter the kingdom."

463
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:26,000
 Right, that is a cosmic question for you this week.

464
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,160
 Live according to the future.

465
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,280
 Let's all pray together.

466
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:38,960
 Father, we give you thanks because of your grace you have called us into your kingdom.

467
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:44,000
 It is your grace we have been called your children.

468
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:51,200
 And I pray that each and every one of us will prepare ourselves knowing that our identity

469
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,120
 belongs to the future kingdom.

470
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:59,720
 That we need to prepare ourselves to give an account to you, Master.

471
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:07,040
 To serve you, to increase the value of the kingdom, to build up your church, to build

472
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,200
 our lives so that you get to grow.

473
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:18,040
 And I pray that when you come, you ask us whether we are being faithful to what you

474
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,800
 have entrusted to us.

475
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:24,360
 And we'll say, "Yes, we have been faithful, Master."

476
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:30,880
 So pray that we'll grow spiritually in this way, to live according to our future hope.

477
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,920
 To live according to the future eschaton.

478
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:41,080
 Help us to live as your citizens, as your heavenly citizens.

479
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:45,400
 That when Christ comes back, we'll be able to give an account.

480
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,280
 We praise you week after week.

481
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:54,880
 We strive to be a better citizen of your heavenly kingdom.

482
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,600
 And pray that you will continue to transform us with your grace.

483
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,120
 That we'll be more like your son.

484
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,680
 In Christ's name we pray.

485
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,080
 Well, thank you.
