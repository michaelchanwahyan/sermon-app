1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
 to join us and we're going to have some fun time together.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,300
 Exploring the land, we're going to, I guess,

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,120
 finish our series on this city called Jericho.

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,620
 So today we're going to talk about Jericho

5
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:18,320
 and I have two main points.

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,320
 One main point is I'm going to explain to you

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,020
 what Jericho is all about.

8
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,860
 It's a little town, not Bethlehem,

9
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:27,120
 but little town of Jericho.

10
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:32,900
 And then the importance of little things, all right?

11
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,360
 And I'll get to that.

12
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,700
 So first of all about Jericho.

13
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,540
 Jericho is a very well-known city,

14
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,080
 well-known story in the Bible,

15
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:47,240
 and who would you associate with when I talk about Jericho?

16
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:51,820
 Who is the guy who conquered Jericho?

17
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,620
 Who is the military general?

18
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,660
 Joshua, oh yeah, right, there you go, Joshua, right?

19
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,560
 Joshua led the Israelites to conquer the very first city

20
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,700
 as they entered the land of Canaan,

21
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,560
 and the land of the life of God, right,

22
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,900
 in the presence of God.

23
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:12,140
 So the first city that they conquered or took over

24
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:15,980
 was Jericho, and it's a very famous city.

25
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:19,520
 Not only is this a very well-known story in the Bible,

26
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,860
 the kids know it and the adults know it,

27
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:28,920
 but not only that, it is actually in human history,

28
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,160
 in the secular world history,

29
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:35,660
 Jericho is one of the most famous towns in the world

30
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:39,840
 because it is being known as the oldest city in the world.

31
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,840
 Oldest city.

32
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,020
 Now what I meant was humans, before they settle down

33
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:52,880
 and build their own city, for years, for centuries,

34
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,180
 there have been hunters and gatherers,

35
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,820
 and they go from oasis to oasis,

36
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,760
 from water source to another water source or food source,

37
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,020
 and they don't have their own home,

38
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:06,160
 until they somehow, they got together

39
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,460
 and organized themselves and built their own city.

40
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,700
 And the first city that they built

41
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,740
 by ancient people was Jericho.

42
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:19,040
 You're going back to 10,000 BC.

43
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,340
 That's kind of crazy, right?

44
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,340
 Those who went to a few museums,

45
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:26,080
 you read some signs and you find some display

46
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,520
 that are so old, right?

47
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,120
 Very, very old.

48
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,400
 So Jericho was the oldest city in the world.

49
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,560
 And then you have to understand why they gathered together

50
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,540
 to organize the first urban society in Jericho,

51
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,400
 because Jericho had a spring.

52
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,140
 And the spring, later tradition associated with Elijah.

53
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,940
 It's called Elijah's spring,

54
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:58,620
 because there was a story in later scripture,

55
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,020
 talks about the prophet Elijah,

56
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:05,720
 he did a miracle to heal the water of the spring.

57
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,920
 So that's why later traditions associate Elijah,

58
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,600
 the prophet, with the spring in Jericho.

59
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,060
 In any case, that is the oldest city in the world,

60
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,760
 and also because there's Elijah's spring.

61
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,400
 And the spring is still working, it's still operating today.

62
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,080
 So this is Jericho, and think about Jericho,

63
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,980
 especially for those who grew up in the church.

64
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,620
 You pick up the children Bible,

65
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,820
 and sometimes you find some pictures in the Bible,

66
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,820
 talks about Joshua and the Israelites conquering,

67
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:44,220
 taking over the city of Jericho.

68
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,620
 You will find some pictures like this.

69
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,200
 Big city wall fell down, right?

70
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:55,360
 As they shout out, cry out the victory,

71
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,500
 they are blowing the trumpet,

72
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,340
 and then the huge wall of Jericho,

73
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,180
 all of a sudden they fell,

74
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,080
 and then they took over the city.

75
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:13,260
 It's a dramatic, wonderful story to remember, right?

76
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,940
 It tells you the power of faith.

77
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:20,400
 If you really believe in God,

78
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,500
 if you really believe in the promises of God,

79
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,080
 and you act by faith, then the biggest city,

80
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:32,140
 the biggest wall, the tallest wall,

81
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,780
 will fall down in front of you.

82
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,620
 Now, but as I emphasize one thing,

83
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:42,420
 we have to read the Bible story in its own context first.

84
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:46,160
 All right, if you go back to the time of Joshua,

85
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,400
 it was about 1200, 1300 BC.

86
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,740
 What kind of city was Jericho?

87
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:57,300
 It was actually a very, very small town.

88
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,940
 This is the aerial picture of Jericho.

89
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:03,340
 You see the curvy road on the lower left?

90
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:07,020
 Above that curvy, modern road,

91
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:11,320
 is Jericho.

92
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,860
 Ancient town, the oldest town of Jericho.

93
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,700
 And it's not that big.

94
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:22,500
 It was, according to the most accurate estimation,

95
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,240
 it was just one acre.

96
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,580
 How big is one acre?

97
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,280
 How big is one acre?

98
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,080
 Any good student here?

99
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,920
 One acre.

100
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,520
 How big is one acre?

101
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,020
 It's smaller than a city block in Chicago.

102
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:44,560
 Smaller than one city block, right?

103
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,960
 It's a very small town.

104
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,620
 It's about 200 feet by 200-some feet, right?

105
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:55,600
 It's actually smaller than Chinatown.

106
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,660
 That is Jericho.

107
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,500
 It's actually a small town, right?

108
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:04,580
 So by some, most of the most reliable calculation,

109
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,380
 in the time of Joshua, Jericho had about

110
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:13,980
 probably 200 to 300 people, and that's it.

111
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:18,880
 It's a little town, but a strategic place.

112
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,720
 You know why?

113
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,420
 Because if you check the Bible map,

114
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:27,260
 you understand it is guarding the eastern entrance

115
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,760
 of the land of Kingdom.

116
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,500
 That is Jericho.

117
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,260
 And Jericho is a strategic place,

118
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:35,100
 although it's a small, small town.

119
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,540
 Now that may be surprising to all of us,

120
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,460
 because I grew up in the church,

121
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,700
 and I read Children's Bible,

122
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,200
 and Jericho was being imagined

123
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,920
 as some sort of very, very big city,

124
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:54,120
 and the wall is like the Great Wall of China.

125
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,920
 And then the Israelites circle around the city,

126
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,920
 and then every single day,

127
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,420
 and then the last day they circle around it for seven times.

128
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:06,120
 And then finally the wall just fell down, right?

129
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,420
 It's a very dramatic story,

130
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:11,260
 and we exaggerate the scene by later tradition,

131
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:15,460
 by later imagination.

132
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,740
 You go back to the Bible,

133
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:21,040
 the Bible is quite careful in describing

134
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,540
 some of the cities of those days.

135
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:28,040
 For example, after they took over Jericho,

136
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:32,680
 the next city to be taken over was Ai, Ai.

137
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:33,780
 Ai, Ai.

138
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:37,880
 And you see the description in 7.3.

139
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,820
 When the Israelites returned,

140
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:44,060
 the spies returned and informed Joshua,

141
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,220
 they said, "There's no need for all of us

142
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,520
 "to go up and attack Ai.

143
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,100
 "It won't take more than 2,000 to 3,000 men to attack Ai,

144
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,940
 "since there were so few of them in the city of Ai.

145
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:00,200
 "Don't make all of our people struggle to go up there."

146
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,900
 All right, so take it easy, guys,

147
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,580
 because Ai is such a small town, right?

148
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,580
 It will only take 2,000 to 3,000 people.

149
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,740
 And by the way, the word "thousand"

150
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,080
 should be translated as "military unit."

151
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,620
 So the people are saying to Joshua,

152
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,860
 "Well, we checked out Ai already.

153
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,660
 "If you want to take it over, you just need, what?

154
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,660
 "Two to three football teams, right?

155
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,960
 "And that's all you need.

156
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,400
 "You will take over Ai."

157
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,900
 But of course, they fail at the end.

158
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,680
 However, you see the description.

159
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,900
 The Bible actually is very careful

160
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,780
 to describe some of the targets,

161
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,140
 Joshua and the Israelites,

162
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,280
 as they conquer the land of Canaan.

163
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,680
 The second town is Hathor.

164
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,280
 Hathor, 1110 in Joshua,

165
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:52,920
 it talks about Hathor killing the king and captured the city.

166
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,360
 Hathor had one time been the capital

167
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:01,260
 and the head of all these kingdoms in the land of Canaan.

168
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,300
 So Hathor is a big, big city.

169
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,400
 That's what the Bible is telling you.

170
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,040
 It is the head of all the kingdoms,

171
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,740
 head of all the cities,

172
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:16,040
 one of the most, the biggest city in the land of Canaan.

173
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:20,380
 In fact, history tells us this is Hathor, the aerial picture.

174
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,920
 You see the upper city

175
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,820
 with some buildings on it and trees on it,

176
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,580
 and then the upper right,

177
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,280
 the flat land with some farms,

178
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,460
 that is the lower city of Hathor.

179
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:35,100
 Altogether, the size of Hathor is 200 acres.

180
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,760
 How big was Jericho?

181
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,940
 How big was Jericho?

182
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,100
 How many acre?

183
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,900
 Jericho.

184
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,160
 One, yes, one acre.

185
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,660
 Hathor is 200 acres, 200 times of Jericho.

186
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:55,060
 So chapter 11 talking about the taking over Hathor.

187
00:09:55,060 --> 00:10:00,260
 In fact, Hathor is the biggest site in Israel today.

188
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:06,300
 It's a huge city in times of Joshua.

189
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:10,940
 Now, as I said, the Bible is very careful

190
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,420
 to describe the cities.

191
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,660
 And it's a small city, Ai, it tells you,

192
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,240
 there are only a few people there.

193
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,400
 And Hathor, it tells you it is the head of the kingdom.

194
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:26,240
 However, with that information in mind,

195
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,140
 you understand when the book of Joshua talks about

196
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:33,720
 the Israelites taking over different cities,

197
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,240
 it's very interesting.

198
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,080
 For Hathor, the biggest city in time of Joshua,

199
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:46,440
 the book of Joshua only uses 50 acres.

200
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,720
 15 verses to describe the battle.

201
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:55,460
 They did take over Hathor, but the Bible only spent

202
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:59,640
 about 15 verses to talk about the battle of Hathor.

203
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:05,740
 However, Jericho, the Bible used entire chapter,

204
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:11,440
 chapter six, to describe the first battle of Jericho.

205
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:17,320
 If you talk about the previous context, chapter six, right?

206
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:21,000
 The previous context would be chapter one to five.

207
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,340
 All talking about preparation of taking over Jericho.

208
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:28,000
 So the Bible at least used six chapters,

209
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,940
 six chapter long content to talk about

210
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,840
 the first battle of Jericho.

211
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,520
 The two spies went in there and they met someone

212
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,720
 called Rahab, the prostitute, right?

213
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,200
 And the prostitute Rahab changed side.

214
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,240
 And she sided with, she abandoned the kingdom of God

215
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,580
 and went with Yahweh, the God of Israel.

216
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:56,680
 Spent six long chapters to talk about

217
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,440
 one battle, the first battle.

218
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,060
 We're gonna read some of the verses

219
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:05,240
 and let me pick chapter six, the first five verses.

220
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,480
 Let's take a look.

221
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,800
 Why does the Bible spend so much time

222
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,240
 and so much content on describing the battle of Jericho?

223
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,120
 Such a small town, one acre.

224
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,620
 Now, the gates of Jericho were tightly shut

225
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:25,840
 because the people were afraid of the Israelites.

226
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,020
 No one was allowed to go out or in.

227
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,380
 But the Lord said to Joshua, "I have given you Jericho.

228
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:33,120
 "It's king, all his strong warriors.

229
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,720
 "You and your fighting men should march around town

230
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,760
 "once a day for six days.

231
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,080
 "Seven priests will walk ahead of the Ark of the Covenant,

232
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,020
 "each carrying a ram's horn.

233
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,660
 "On the seventh day, you are to march around the town

234
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:51,820
 "seven times with the priest blowing the shofar, the horns.

235
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:55,560
 "When you hear the priest give one long blast

236
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,320
 "of the ram's horns, have all the people shout

237
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,800
 "as loud as they can.

238
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,120
 "Then the walls of the town will collapse

239
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,280
 "and the people will charge straight into, up to the town."

240
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,600
 Now, this is the first description

241
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,680
 of the battle of Jericho.

242
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:22,060
 If you check out the entire chapter six of Joshua,

243
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:25,360
 there are only three parts.

244
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,980
 The first part is God's instruction

245
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,760
 to the Israelites, to Joshua.

246
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,340
 That is what we have just read.

247
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:38,080
 And the second part is the men of Israel

248
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,080
 executing the plan.

249
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,320
 And then the third part is kind of a conclusion,

250
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,480
 talking about the victory and the salvation of Rahab,

251
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,280
 the king and the knight in the town.

252
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:53,120
 Now, we're not going to talk about the details here.

253
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,500
 You can go home and read about the battle of Jericho.

254
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,520
 What I want to say is this is the first battle,

255
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,940
 first battle of a small town, right?

256
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,960
 And it's very interesting when you check out

257
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,940
 the book of Joshua, what we expect the book of Joshua

258
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:12,600
 to emphasize is strategy, military resources,

259
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,300
 how they prepare military strategy-wise,

260
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:23,160
 tactic, how to take over the first town, Jericho.

261
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:27,640
 Last night I was with my family.

262
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:33,920
 We went to this restaurant to have dinner together

263
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,840
 because my wife, it was her birthday yesterday.

264
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,960
 Anyway, so we went out last night,

265
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,640
 and she's not here, that's okay.

266
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:48,260
 So we were waiting for the table, right?

267
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,520
 And there were so many people in the restaurant.

268
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,940
 So we went down a couple blocks

269
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:56,860
 and went into a used bookstore, used bookstore.

270
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:00,440
 So we went into the bookstore, and there were so many books

271
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,600
 there, and I went past the section on military history.

272
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,120
 There were so many different books

273
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,780
 talking about military history.

274
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:13,520
 World War I, World War II, and then the Civil War,

275
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:17,680
 Vietnam War, and all this kind of famous battles in history.

276
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,440
 So out of curiosity, I picked one of those,

277
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,940
 and then I just skimmed through it.

278
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,080
 And then it talks about who are the heroes,

279
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:31,000
 and most of the heroes are the military generals.

280
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,160
 And most of the military history genre

281
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:39,180
 would emphasize on military tactics, right?

282
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:42,320
 How they move around and maneuver all these resources

283
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,440
 and take over some of the targets.

284
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,600
 These are what we expect from the military history genre.

285
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,760
 You take a look at the Book of Joshua.

286
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,680
 It really doesn't do that.

287
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,040
 It's very strange.

288
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,540
 It's a strange book, right?

289
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:05,160
 Some people would expect the Book of Joshua

290
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:09,040
 because it talks about battles and military stuff.

291
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,960
 It has to be a man's book, right?

292
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,900
 The men like to do that, right?

293
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:17,220
 Men like military stuff, don't you?

294
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,820
 Right, all the men here?

295
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,320
 You love fighting.

296
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,160
 You love wars and battles, right?

297
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,880
 The dramatic battles, right?

298
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,120
 The important battles.

299
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,200
 Not so much for women, maybe it's just overgeneralization,

300
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,280
 but that's the way it is.

301
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:37,120
 You take a look at the Book of Joshua.

302
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,460
 It's very disappointing.

303
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,560
 It doesn't really talk about military tactic

304
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:45,140
 and all this geography and all this military strategy

305
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,360
 and all this stuff.

306
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,900
 They don't.

307
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,620
 It's a very strange book.

308
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:52,460
 Now let me tell you some of the data.

309
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:56,620
 When the Book of Joshua talks about taking over Jericho,

310
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:00,840
 it uses 102 words only.

311
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:04,960
 102 words.

312
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:09,980
 For such an important city, the first city, 102 words.

313
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:14,840
 However, in the previous chapter, chapter two,

314
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:18,180
 talking about Rahab, how she changed side

315
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:24,440
 from the Canaanite gods to Yahweh, the true God of Israel,

316
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:29,260
 chapter two uses 86 words to talk about a woman

317
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:33,820
 turning to the side of Israel,

318
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:37,880
 believing in God, right?

319
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,620
 And then make a big statement about the God of Israel

320
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,320
 being the true God.

321
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,140
 86 words.

322
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:49,160
 So it's about the same portion, same amount of words

323
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:53,800
 talking about Rahab's story, same amount of words

324
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,800
 talking about the battle of Jericho.

325
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:01,940
 And in fact, in the portion that talks about Rahab,

326
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:07,700
 the prostitute, chapter two uses five verses,

327
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:13,700
 five long verses giving Rahab some of the most important

328
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:17,560
 lines in the Old Testament.

329
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:21,140
 Some of the direct speech that Rahab said

330
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:25,300
 to the spies of Israel was actually statements of faith.

331
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:30,520
 A theologically sound, solidly scriptural words

332
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:36,840
 that she talks about how the Lord is the true God,

333
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:41,940
 the Exodus, how the Lord has given the land to Israel

334
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,780
 and the Lord is the true God.

335
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,960
 And all that stuff, five verses,

336
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,880
 is a public theological declaration

337
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:56,060
 spoken by Rahab, the prostitute, the Canaanite prostitute.

338
00:18:56,060 --> 00:19:02,360
 You skim through the book of Joshua,

339
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,600
 it's very disappointing from a military,

340
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,520
 typical military genre perspective.

341
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:12,320
 The heroes, the heroes,

342
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:16,140
 the heroes are not what we expected,

343
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:22,440
 not Joshua, not this fighting man of Israel,

344
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:26,120
 but a woman, prostitute, Rahab.

345
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:32,700
 That is what the Bible says.

346
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:36,860
 And try to emphasize the importance of small characters

347
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:43,060
 and the importance of small deeds done by them.

348
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,320
 They matter to God.

349
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,560
 And in fact, they are more important

350
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:52,920
 than the military fighting and dramatic content.

351
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,460
 The Bible put our focus on something

352
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:59,960
 that is more important in the sight of God.

353
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,880
 The small characters, Rahab, all these unknown,

354
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,060
 unnamed people,

355
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:11,520
 they believe in God, they act in faith.

356
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,180
 That matters to God.

357
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:17,880
 So there's, this is the importance of small deeds,

358
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,860
 that's my second point.

359
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:24,020
 In the book of Joshua, the small characters matter to God,

360
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:27,200
 matter to the biblical history,

361
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,980
 matter to what God is doing on earth.

362
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:33,320
 You and me, we are the small characters.

363
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:37,660
 We are not the famous people, right?

364
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:44,220
 We don't have a lot of followers on our IG, right?

365
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,680
 On your TikTok, right?

366
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,760
 Nobody take notes of you.

367
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,740
 But you matter to God.

368
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:56,920
 The small characters doing small deeds of faith.

369
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:01,340
 Couple months ago, in June,

370
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:04,140
 we took a family trip to New York.

371
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,600
 So we went to this military museum

372
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,140
 called Intrepid Museum in New York.

373
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,180
 It's a fascinating museum.

374
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,920
 So we went into a retired submarine,

375
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:17,400
 and then we went to a retired aircraft carrier,

376
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,500
 and it's just amazing, there's so much to see.

377
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:24,040
 There's so much more to see than a film museum.

378
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,760
 So I really enjoyed that day,

379
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,680
 and then I went into this gallery of aircrafts,

380
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:34,620
 and it has a one-to-one model of space shuttle.

381
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:39,180
 It's fascinating, right?

382
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:42,580
 We don't use space shuttles anymore, right?

383
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:45,280
 It's a retired program.

384
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,900
 So I was kind of taking pictures and reading

385
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,340
 all this information about the space shuttle program

386
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:54,080
 and all that, and then it just dawned on me

387
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,240
 there were two space shuttle disasters that happened

388
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,120
 in the history of the program,

389
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,460
 both related to space shuttle accidents.

390
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:11,640
 Now, back in 1986, those who are older like me,

391
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,100
 would remember back in 1986,

392
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,960
 NASA space shuttle Challenger

393
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,800
 exploded seconds after launching,

394
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:28,920
 only 73 seconds after lifting off.

395
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,380
 And the disasters claimed the lives

396
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:34,380
 of all seven people in the aircraft.

397
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:39,220
 All people on board died, including a teacher,

398
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:43,460
 the first civilian in the space program.

399
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:47,220
 And after the disaster, investigation revealed

400
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:50,460
 what was wrong.

401
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:53,640
 It was actually a small, old rain seal

402
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:58,140
 that got brittle because of the low quality

403
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,900
 of the old rain seal.

404
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:03,240
 It becomes brittle in cold temperatures.

405
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:07,460
 And that small, old rain fail,

406
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:13,500
 and then the entire aircraft, flames broke out,

407
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:18,120
 and then the spacecraft just explode in the air,

408
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,560
 right in front of the eyes.

409
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,320
 Exploded, and then disintegrated.

410
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,440
 That was back in 1986.

411
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,140
 The other big disaster was 2003.

412
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:35,540
 Columbia, and other space shuttle.

413
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,380
 Now, this time, the accident did not happen

414
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,880
 when it takes off.

415
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,920
 It actually took off, and then went into space,

416
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:48,460
 and did its thing, and then on the way back

417
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,320
 to the atmosphere.

418
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,480
 We entered the atmosphere, the space shuttle

419
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:57,640
 disintegrated into pieces in the sky of northern Texas.

420
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:03,000
 Again, killing all seven crew members.

421
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,560
 Investigation revealed what's wrong.

422
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:13,240
 It's actually a small piece of foam insulation,

423
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:18,540
 fell off, and then it damaged the left wing,

424
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,480
 and then, as the spacecraft continued to go

425
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,640
 in supersonic speed, it disintegrated into pieces.

426
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,400
 All people died.

427
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:37,580
 Now, the long investigation of the entire

428
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:41,960
 space shuttle program tells us there was something wrong

429
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,880
 actually from early on.

430
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:47,520
 It's that the crew members or the engineers

431
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,160
 trying to put together the aircraft,

432
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,760
 and program it, and all that,

433
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:56,260
 they actually made a lot of small mistakes,

434
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,600
 or small getaway.

435
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:03,120
 Some of the lower quality stuff that they used,

436
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,060
 or they didn't pay attention too much.

437
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:10,820
 And the engineers thought, "Oh, we could get away."

438
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,460
 And they did.

439
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:15,480
 And time after time, they got away,

440
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,400
 but at the end, disasters happened.

441
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,240
 They called the entire process of,

442
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,500
 "It's okay, we can get by."

443
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:29,080
 That sort of mentality, that sort of stuff that they did.

444
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:33,260
 The entire process they called normalization of deviance.

445
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:38,400
 Deviance is deviating from the standard practice, right?

446
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,560
 It's only a small deviation from the standard practice.

447
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:48,360
 Not quite up to par, but a little bit less deviance,

448
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:51,160
 but they normalize it.

449
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,000
 It's okay.

450
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,160
 We make excuse.

451
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,560
 All the small things,

452
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:02,360
 and the entire aircraft disintegrated.

453
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:08,100
 I think this is a perfect example for all of us,

454
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,100
 because if you think about it, life,

455
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:15,060
 it consists of many mundane things,

456
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,980
 many routine things.

457
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:23,080
 Sometimes we speak of spiritual discipline,

458
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,180
 spiritual habit, right?

459
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:28,480
 All of those things are really, really small.

460
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,460
 All of these changes that God expects us to do

461
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:35,500
 are actually very, very minor, right?

462
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,020
 In the big scheme of things, right?

463
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:41,440
 In this generation, there's a phrase called

464
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,780
 to be voked, W-O-K-E, right?

465
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,140
 To be voked, what does it mean?

466
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:50,040
 To be voked means to be aware of

467
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,800
 important issues in the world.

468
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,540
 Racial justice, social justice,

469
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:59,480
 those are the big things that we need to pay attention to.

470
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,680
 To be voked, that is what it means, right?

471
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,880
 There's nothing wrong with that.

472
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,360
 We should concern about justice issues.

473
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,520
 We should, the big issues.

474
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,340
 But you know, think about it.

475
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,940
 Life often operates

476
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,360
 on small details.

477
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:22,500
 The small and mundane things,

478
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,420
 they all matter to God.

479
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:28,580
 You think about your character growth,

480
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:32,780
 your spiritual attitude toward other people,

481
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:36,520
 your attitude toward things entrusted to you.

482
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:41,420
 Don't we all find small excuses?

483
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,500
 We all do, right?

484
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,500
 I do, right?

485
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:49,780
 And we always say to ourselves,

486
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,580
 what's the big deal, right?

487
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:55,240
 If I miss this, if I don't do that, right?

488
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,940
 If I'm less than faithful,

489
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:00,760
 I kind of deviated from the standard,

490
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,320
 that's all right, right?

491
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,420
 We're still alive, right?

492
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,700
 What's the big deal, God?

493
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,180
 What is the big deal?

494
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,680
 I can do it later.

495
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,640
 I can procrastinate, right?

496
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,780
 Because there's no big deal.

497
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:15,620
 The story of Jericho tells you,

498
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,960
 it's a big deal.

499
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,320
 The small deeds are big deals.

500
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,980
 Church life, the standard practice

501
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:28,200
 of a normal Christian life,

502
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,480
 how we relate to other people.

503
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:35,400
 When we are on the wrong, we apologize.

504
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,100
 We ask for forgiveness.

505
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,780
 Those are really small things, right?

506
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,900
 It's not dramatic.

507
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:45,100
 It's not something that will change the world,

508
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,020
 but they matter to God.

509
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:52,580
 The story of Jericho tells you life,

510
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:55,260
 it's like a cathedral.

511
00:28:55,260 --> 00:29:00,060
 A cathedral is built by stone after stone

512
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,420
 and stone after stone.

513
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:03,800
 All these pieces have to fit together

514
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,780
 in order to build a big building.

515
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,220
 Your life is like that.

516
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,980
 If you're missing one of those,

517
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,680
 someday it will collapse.

518
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,840
 Someday it will crumble.

519
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,500
 The growth of your spiritual life is the same way.

520
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,240
 It's the small habit add on small habit

521
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,180
 add on small habit.

522
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:24,540
 And the habit will shape you,

523
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:27,900
 will mold you into the image of God.

524
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:32,080
 Without those habits, without those small deeds,

525
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,580
 your life cannot be built, right?

526
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,080
 Let's be reminded.

527
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:41,400
 In the sight of God, small deeds matter.

528
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:49,180
 The greatness or the maturity of your spiritual life

529
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:51,420
 or your character as a whole

530
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:54,580
 is measured by many, many small deeds.

531
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:58,700
 And what God expects us to do

532
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:02,380
 is to be faithful with all the small deeds.

533
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,380
 And it will add up.

534
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:07,720
 It will pave you a path to be successful

535
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,900
 in the sense that to be spiritual,

536
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,660
 to be God-pleasing, to be Godly

537
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,740
 in your character growth.

538
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:21,180
 Let us all remind ourselves and take a look at yourself.

539
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:26,260
 What kind of small things am I giving excuses to lately?

540
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:33,340
 That I tell myself, what is the big deal?

541
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,540
 Chill out, God.

542
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,300
 Can you chill out for a little bit?

543
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:39,460
 I just don't want to do that, right?

544
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,580
 Those are really, really important

545
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,380
 even though they are small.

546
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,700
 Just like Jericho.

547
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,460
 What is your Jericho?

548
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:51,100
 What is your Jericho?

549
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,100
 Let's all pray together.

550
00:30:53,100 --> 00:31:02,100
 Father, we come before you and

551
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,180
 we know that all the details of our lives

552
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:07,060
 are important to you.

553
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:10,500
 And sometimes they are even more important.

554
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,460
 They're not as big issues.

555
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:17,540
 We just pray that your spirit will remind us all.

556
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:22,400
 Help us to see that we need to be faithful

557
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:26,580
 not only with the big stuff,

558
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:29,540
 but the small details.

559
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:33,660
 (piano music)

560
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:37,820
 Remind us and help us to do some self-examination.

561
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:41,260
 To look into our lives.

562
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:45,180
 Are there any habits that we have forgotten?

563
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:49,060
 Are there any small deeds that we have

564
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:51,020
 given excuses to?

565
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,780
 Procrastinate, delay?

566
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:57,540
 Help us to be pleasing to you.

567
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,980
 Thank you for being our God.

568
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:06,220
 Help us to grow in such a way

569
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:08,540
 that will build up our character.

570
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:12,140
 That our being will be shaped by your grace.

571
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:17,580
 And help us do all the small deeds faithfully.

572
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:23,020
 So that our life can be built up one stone at a time.

573
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,700
 One layer at a time.

574
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:29,340
 Help us to grow into the image of your son.

575
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:33,700
 Remind us how we speak.

576
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:36,220
 Every single word is important.

577
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:39,980
 Remind us all of our meditation,

578
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:43,620
 our thought life,

579
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:46,120
 all the details are important.

580
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:49,660
 How we meditate on your word,

581
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:52,740
 how we reflect on spiritual insights.

582
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:57,620
 Help us build up our habits,

583
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:01,300
 our lives so that we can be pleasing to you.

584
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:04,360
 In Christ we pray.
