[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.780]   - All right, thanks Kelly.
[00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:03.560]   I know some of you cannot be here
[00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.760]   and some of you are online being with us
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.520]   because they got sick and we wanna pray for them.
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.040]   And some of those in our community also out of town,
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.840]   they went back home and visit their own country
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.420]   and they will be back, all right?
[00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.700]   So let's pray.
[00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.360]   Father, give thanks for giving us this community,
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.280]   this spiritual family.
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.600]   We can study your word and we can worship you together.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.320]   And we pray for those who are not with us today.
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.400]   Maybe they are sick,
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.400]   maybe they're going to their home country for visitation
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.120]   and I pray for safety, I pray for healing.
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.160]   And especially those of us who are struggling
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.480]   with our own personal challenges,
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.880]   remind us God, remind us that you are our great God
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.640]   and you are greater than all the issues
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.360]   and all the problems and challenges that we are facing.
[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.800]   So we come before you and to get to know you,
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.200]   come before you to worship you and exalt your name
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.520]   because we know that you are a great God
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.280]   and we can trust in you.
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.600]   And increase our faith, increase our love for the community
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.800]   that we can grow your church together.
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.440]   We can glorify your name together in Christ name pray.
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.920]   Well, as you can see on the screen,
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.080]   I'm going to start a new sermon series.
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.000]   This series is on the TV series,
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.960]   very successful, very popular these days.
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.400]   It's been popular for a while, "The Chosen."
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.600]   How many of you have been watching "Chosen"?
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.320]   None of you?
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.920]   Only two, oh my God.
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.600]   Well, you have to watch it because for a long while,
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.000]   I resist to watch it because I just didn't have time, right?
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   But in the past few weeks,
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   my daughter finally convinced me to watch episode two.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.760]   And I was kind of trying to entertain her desire
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.560]   and sit down and watch with her.
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.560]   And watching like a few episodes and I just love it
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.320]   because the scenes that they take
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.400]   and the storylines that they create,
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.240]   although it's not straightly biblical storyline,
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.720]   but of course they add some poetic license
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.640]   and some creativity there and here.
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.640]   But I'm just amazed how well it is done.
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.800]   And I have watched quite a few episodes already.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.680]   And as you know, this is a historical drama
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.320]   based on the true story of Jesus.
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.320]   And we know that we are followers of Jesus Christ
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.840]   and Jesus is a historical figure.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.200]   Now you can find the record of Jesus' life
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.880]   in sources outside of the Bible.
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.640]   There are some Roman sources, there's some Jewish sources.
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.680]   We can find a little bit the story of Jesus,
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.600]   but mostly we find in the gospels, in the New Testament.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.320]   And as you know, the first four books of the New Testament,
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.520]   Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, the gospels,
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.280]   the four gospels have recorded quite a bit details
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.380]   about the life of Jesus.
[00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.380]   And I know the church is always composed of people
[00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.840]   of different walks of life.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.840]   Some of you may be just beginning in your faith journey
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.040]   trying to know Jesus,
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.080]   trying to understand who this guy is, right?
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.880]   And some of us have been a Christians for a long, long time
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.680]   and your experience for church
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.160]   and your experience of what the Bible says.
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.440]   I think as we watch this series,
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.460]   and I do encourage you to watch episode two,
[00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.680]   this series will help you picture
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.520]   the first century life of Jesus.
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.400]   It will help you to understand
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.600]   what the Bible is talking about.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.080]   And for seekers, it is helpful.
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.760]   For new Christians, it is helpful.
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.800]   Then for experienced long-time Christians,
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.720]   it is also helpful.
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.080]   Even I find it helpful.
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:21.080]   And I'm going to do the series by referring to the episode,
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:25.320]   and then I'll come back to the Bible and say something
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.980]   and pinpoint something
[00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.800]   that is highlighted in different episodes.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:35.340]   I hope you understand, this is not the Bible,
[00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.640]   but it's a recreation of the biblical stories about Jesus.
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.440]   So do watch "The Chosen."
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.240]   I don't get commission, right?
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.160]   We don't get commission.
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.500]   I don't get any money,
[00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.760]   but do watch it because it is so well done.
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.380]   And watch "The Chosen" and think the Bible and your faith.
[00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.800]   That would be the slogan here, all right?
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.900]   As I told you, the gospels, we call it the life of Jesus,
[00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.880]   and Jesus is a historical figure.
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.920]   And you can find sources outside of the Bible.
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.440]   You find something about Jesus and his context
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.800]   and his background.
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.320]   Now, Jesus was a Jew living in Israel, Palestine.
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:19.120]   And back in Jesus' day, the Jews, or the Jewish people,
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.020]   were under the military occupation of the Roman Empire.
[00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.360]   They had a pretty tough life.
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.600]   And they were under heavy weight of taxes,
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.540]   all kinds of taxes, income taxes, property taxes,
[00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:40.140]   all kinds of taxes pressing on the Jewish people.
[00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:44.700]   And as we all know, we also have our tax day, right?
[00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.160]   And we don't like the IRS, right?
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.100]   We don't like them.
[00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.060]   I'm sorry if you work for IRS, good job.
[00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:56.060]   But we generally refuse to think about taxes, right?
[00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:01.980]   And you can just imagine what life would have been
[00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:05.300]   for the Jewish people under the Roman occupation.
[00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.180]   They had a very, very tough life.
[00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.020]   And because the Jewish people had a long traditions
[00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.260]   for yearning for freedom, yearning for liberty,
[00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.960]   yearning for having their own nation,
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.320]   and every single year in the Passover meal,
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.060]   they will recite one story,
[00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.980]   and the foundational story in the Old Testament.
[00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.600]   And what was that?
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.120]   The Passover, right?
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.140]   The Passover.
[00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:36.140]   Moses came and liberate them from the land of slavery,
[00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:40.260]   defeat the oppressor, the Pharaoh, the king of Egypt,
[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:41.700]   and then free the people up,
[00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:46.420]   and then they can really be the people of God, right?
[00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:47.940]   So they were yearning for freedom,
[00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.420]   they were yearning for liberty,
[00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.260]   and that's why in the Jewish tradition,
[00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:56.060]   there's always been people who was trying to fight back,
[00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:57.100]   right?
[00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.460]   That is the entire Old Testament,
[00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:04.140]   trying, saying something about the hope
[00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:08.380]   that God will reestablish his long lost kingdom on earth.
[00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.300]   Now the Jewish people were under Rome.
[00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:13.580]   And that is the context of the life of Jesus
[00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.740]   and the first four books of the New Testament,
[00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:18.820]   Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.
[00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:22.540]   Now if you compare the Gospels, the four Gospels,
[00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:29.140]   and other ancient biographies of the day,
[00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:32.780]   you'll find that there were similarities
[00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:37.460]   because the ancient biographies,
[00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:40.260]   they were not interested in the personal life
[00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:41.660]   of the public figure.
[00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:46.860]   You know, we, modern people, we are really interested
[00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:51.180]   in the private life of the public figure, right?
[00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:53.860]   You know, the autobiography of Obama, right?
[00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:57.180]   Trump, Hillary Clinton, right?
[00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:58.660]   You check all those books, you know,
[00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:01.020]   they're trying to dig out, you know,
[00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.980]   their romances, right?
[00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:06.260]   Their history of personal life, right?
[00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.220]   Did they ace the test?
[00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:11.300]   And did they fight with their classmates, right?
[00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.220]   What happened when they grow up?
[00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:14.860]   And all that stuff.
[00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:17.220]   This is modern biographies.
[00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:20.460]   We're interested in the private life of the individuals.
[00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:23.140]   But ancient biographies, like the Gospels,
[00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:26.340]   they're not interested in the private life
[00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:27.740]   of the individuals.
[00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:32.860]   They are interested only in the public record
[00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:34.380]   of the individual.
[00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:38.260]   Something you can find in the official archive,
[00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.300]   you know, from the database.
[00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:42.700]   Everybody knows about it, right?
[00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:47.700]   And then they write autobiographies of the famous people.
[00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:53.300]   People like Plato, Aristotle, philosophers,
[00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:57.700]   Augustus, Roman Empire, Pilate,
[00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:00.580]   the Roman governor of Palestine at the time.
[00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:03.340]   They are only interested in their public life.
[00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:08.420]   That is ancient biographies, and that is Gospels.
[00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:12.060]   So you flip the pages of the first four of Gospels,
[00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.580]   Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,
[00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:16.300]   it doesn't talk about, you know, Jesus.
[00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:20.820]   Any girl had a crush on Jesus when he was in high school.
[00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.700]   Nobody cares, right?
[00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:26.700]   They only care about his public ministry, public life.
[00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:31.260]   So let's say we are in the fellowship,
[00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.380]   the Paneo fellowship, we are doing Bible study,
[00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:38.340]   and on chapter one, Gospel of Mark,
[00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:40.220]   all of a sudden Jesus came, right?
[00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:43.740]   And he started preaching the message of the kingdom.
[00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:45.260]   The kingdom is here, right?
[00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.900]   So you repent, and we turn back to God.
[00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:52.180]   Jesus was already an adult.
[00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:55.180]   So they only are interested
[00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:58.780]   in the public life of the individual.
[00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:03.660]   So we have to keep that in mind when we read the Gospels,
[00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:05.380]   Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.
[00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:10.380]   So here we compare the Gospels and the Chosen, all right?
[00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:14.140]   So this is episode one, all right?
[00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:18.260]   So go back home, and I think it's on Netflix, right?
[00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:22.140]   It's on Netflix, or Amazon Prime, or even on the website.
[00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:24.660]   You can watch the Chosen.
[00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:26.860]   Let me highlight episode one here.
[00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:30.180]   Of course, it's based on the true stories of Gospel,
[00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:35.180]   and the movie makers make their own creativity
[00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:38.020]   and add their poetic license in there.
[00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:40.420]   This is one of the screen cap in the beginning.
[00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:43.620]   But episode one, let me summarize it,
[00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:47.220]   and I translate for those who are reading Chinese.
[00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:50.900]   But on the left column, episode one is called
[00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:53.260]   I Have Called You By Name.
[00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:57.820]   Now, let me give you a summary, only four points.
[00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:01.540]   Now, the story start with 2 BC, all right?
[00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:03.860]   Two years before the common era.
[00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:06.540]   There was Mary Madeline.
[00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:10.580]   She was a little girl, and she was with her father,
[00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:12.860]   and she wakes up all the time in the middle of the night,
[00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:16.260]   and don't know why, she was scared of something.
[00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:20.420]   And her father reminds her, Isaiah 43, one.
[00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:23.060]   And that is a scripture we're gonna read later.
[00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:27.500]   But she was afraid, but because of this word of God in her,
[00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:31.780]   and she could go through all these dark times.
[00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:35.580]   And then, the second point, the story is fast forward,
[00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:40.580]   28 years later, now Mary Madeline was an adult.
[00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:44.740]   And she goes by the name Lilith.
[00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:49.300]   Lilith, because she was possessed by demons, many demons.
[00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:51.740]   And she was suffering so much.
[00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:56.740]   Perhaps in the video, in the movie,
[00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:59.740]   she is involved in prostitution,
[00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:01.820]   or she was attacked by people,
[00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:05.740]   but she fought back and she hurt someone,
[00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:08.660]   and so the community were very, very concerned
[00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:13.660]   about her being heavily possessed by the demons.
[00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:16.660]   Then number four, no, number three.
[00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:19.860]   There was a rabbi, well respected in Jerusalem,
[00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:23.860]   and also in Galilee, but his name is Nicodemus.
[00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:29.100]   He travels to Capernaum, which is a fishing port
[00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:34.100]   by the Sea of Galilee, and some fishermen were catching fish
[00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:39.320]   on the Shabbat, which was illegal.
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.900]   And they did so because they wanna avoid taxes,
[00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:46.100]   the Roman taxes, 'cause whatever you catch on the Shabbat,
[00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:49.620]   it's not counted as your income, I guess.
[00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:53.540]   So they were violating the law of Shabbat,
[00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:58.340]   and they don't wanna pay extra income tax.
[00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:02.380]   But the Romans asked Nicodemus,
[00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:04.900]   the well-respected leader, the rabbi,
[00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:09.900]   to help catch or arrest some of the Jewish fishermen.
[00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:15.940]   And then later on, Nicodemus found himself
[00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:20.740]   facing the demon-possessed Mary Magdalene, or Lilith,
[00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:26.780]   trying to cast the demons out of her, but he failed.
[00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:29.740]   He failed miserably, and finally,
[00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:32.420]   Jesus comes on scene, unexpectedly,
[00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:36.940]   and he cast out the demons and free Mary
[00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:38.900]   from demon possession.
[00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:44.940]   So Jesus call her not Lilith,
[00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:48.100]   call her by name, Mary.
[00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:50.100]   So that's episode one.
[00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:54.540]   We do some biblical reflection here.
[00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:57.300]   Another main storyline in episode one
[00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.460]   is definitely Mary Magdalene.
[00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:03.500]   She goes by the name Lilith.
[00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:05.420]   Now, you have to understand why Lilith,
[00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:07.060]   why people call her Lilith,
[00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:10.980]   because when she was possessed by demons.
[00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:13.380]   Because in later Jewish traditions,
[00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:16.780]   or later legends in Jewish mythology,
[00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:21.740]   Lilith was the name for the female demon.
[00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:25.940]   So the entire community, according to this episode,
[00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:30.500]   call her Lilith, because she was heavily possessed
[00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:33.860]   by demons, and she suffered quite a bit.
[00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:36.140]   And Jesus came to redeem her.
[00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:38.460]   And you have to understand,
[00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:42.500]   this is actually mentioned in the gospels.
[00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:47.140]   Let me turn to the gospel of Luke, chapter eight.
[00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:51.060]   In chapter eight, we find the name Mary Magdalene.
[00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:53.780]   In fact, we find a list of names,
[00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:58.780]   people, male, and especially female, following Jesus.
[00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:02.500]   Here Luke says in chapter eight, verse one,
[00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:05.700]   "Soon after, Jesus began a tour
[00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:08.840]   "of the nearby towns and villages in Galilee,
[00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.540]   "preaching and announcing the good news
[00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:11.980]   "of the kingdom of God.
[00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:16.260]   "He took with him 12 disciples," the 12, right?
[00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.780]   "And along with some women,
[00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:21.820]   "who had been killed of evil spirits and diseases.
[00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:26.140]   "Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary Magdalene,
[00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:30.500]   "from whom Jesus had cast out seven demons."
[00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:33.500]   So again, is it really seven?
[00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:35.740]   Count one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:37.380]   Or maybe this is a complete number.
[00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:41.500]   That means she was being possessed by many demons,
[00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.860]   completely controlled by the demon.
[00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:49.740]   Mary Magdalene, and then Joanna, and Susanna,
[00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:51.940]   and some other women, they were following Jesus,
[00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:55.940]   contribute to his ministry and support Jesus
[00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:59.700]   and his disciples with their own financial resources.
[00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:01.900]   And that is the first time Mary Magdalene
[00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:03.860]   show up in the Bible.
[00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:08.140]   If you chase this name, this character in the New Testament,
[00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:10.940]   you find an amazing character being transformed
[00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:14.220]   by the grace of God, Mary Magdalene.
[00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:17.100]   So here I summarize Mary Magdalene in the Bible.
[00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:20.820]   Now she's called Mary Magdalene
[00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:25.820]   because Magdalene means the person from Matalah.
[00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:31.780]   And Matalah is a fishing port just south of Capernaum.
[00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:37.100]   Now some people would follow me to tour Israel
[00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:38.100]   from time to time, right?
[00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:42.660]   I lead a tourist group to Israel almost every single year.
[00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:49.100]   You'll find if you drive today, if you drive,
[00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:54.100]   usually we drive, I drive from Capernaum to Matalah,
[00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:58.300]   it only take about 15 minutes, right?
[00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:01.300]   If I drive faster, probably 10 minutes, I'll be there.
[00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:04.620]   Right, so it's very close by fishing ports.
[00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:08.540]   And both these fishing ports are on the main
[00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:11.940]   international highway of the ancient day.
[00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:15.500]   So they're small towns, but they're very, very important
[00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:18.620]   because they are by the seashore of the Sea of Galilee,
[00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:21.300]   and they're selling fish and catching fish.
[00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:26.300]   And Jesus began his public ministry in Capernaum.
[00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:34.500]   That is the reason, because he could preach the good news
[00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:37.900]   of the kingdom of God on the international highway, right?
[00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:40.900]   On the 1994, right, Kennedy Highway, right?
[00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:43.380]   And who would not catch that, right?
[00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:46.100]   And he was announcing and preaching the good news
[00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:47.100]   in Capernaum.
[00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:51.580]   And just some of it is this fishing town,
[00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:53.700]   fishing port called Matalah.
[00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:58.540]   So Mary Madeline simply means Mary from Matalah.
[00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:03.960]   And then you chase the story, we read Luke 8 too.
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:08.460]   She was one of the female followers of Jesus.
[00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:14.020]   Now in this list, what is surprising is, Luke 8,
[00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:17.080]   we just read there are many names of women.
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:19.580]   What is surprising, and you have to understand the Bible
[00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:21.580]   in its own context.
[00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:25.460]   Because in Jesus' day, Jewish rabbis, there were many
[00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:30.460]   of them, they usually will find, will have male students.
[00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:37.420]   You know, male disciples would follow a certain famous
[00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:38.420]   rabbi, right?
[00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:41.500]   Just like us, we wanna, when we go to university,
[00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:43.780]   we wanna go to the best university, right?
[00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:45.260]   We wanna go to Hartford, right?
[00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:46.180]   Go to Stanford.
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:50.840]   In those days, you know, male students, you know,
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:54.280]   like the 12, they really, really wanna get into
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:57.360]   the best school of their day, right?
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:01.280]   And Jesus was one of the rabbis.
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:05.240]   And of course, male students would want to follow him.
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:08.480]   But here's the day, this is the norm of the day.
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:13.480]   Rabbis only have male students, male disciples.
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:17.540]   Hardly you find any rabbi would have females following him.
[00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:21.020]   And Jesus broke the norm.
[00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:27.260]   He was calling and allowing females to follow him
[00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:31.140]   from town to town, village to village, city to city,
[00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:34.620]   to do the ministry and to preach the gospel.
[00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:36.660]   And Mary Madeline was one of them.
[00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:40.940]   And how did the Bible introduce Mary Madeline?
[00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:43.260]   Not in a very good way, right?
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:48.440]   Because she had been cast out, seven demons out of her.
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:53.440]   She was heavily suffering, oppressed by the demons.
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:59.180]   But you can see how the Bible introduced her.
[00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:01.300]   Her life has been changed.
[00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:05.680]   Her life has been changed by Jesus.
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:10.360]   Now, you know a thing or two about life change.
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:13.160]   When we make the commitment to Jesus Christ,
[00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:19.140]   our lives should have been changed, at least fundamentally.
[00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:23.000]   Now, it doesn't convert me from a sinner to a saint.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.800]   It doesn't do that.
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:27.780]   Because no matter how many years I'm in Christ,
[00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:31.560]   I'm still 100% a sinner, right?
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:35.740]   I've known Jesus for, for how many years?
[00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:39.700]   Oh boy, 30 some years.
[00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:41.460]   Yeah, 30 some years, right?
[00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:42.660]   Since I was a youth.
[00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:47.360]   No, my life has been fundamentally changed.
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:52.080]   You know, my value system, my perspective on the world,
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:54.780]   my perspective on myself, my self image,
[00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:57.320]   how I understand other people.
[00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:00.020]   These are all changed because of Jesus,
[00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:02.520]   because of the gospel.
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:05.780]   How I see, you know, how the world
[00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:07.540]   has been changing around me.
[00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:09.500]   And how do I see that from the kingdom of God
[00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:11.060]   perspective?
[00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:14.700]   Those are the things that should happen in your life
[00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:17.660]   when you make a commitment to make Jesus Christ
[00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:18.660]   your Lord and Savior.
[00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:22.580]   That is the life change that should be a reality
[00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:24.700]   for all Jesus followers.
[00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:28.660]   And that was the reality for Mary, Marylyn.
[00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:31.700]   Now, I think the best analogy for talking about life change
[00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:34.500]   is immigration, immigration.
[00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:37.580]   Now, some of you, some of you know what immigration
[00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:39.020]   is all about, right?
[00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:41.340]   Because you know it firsthand.
[00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:44.620]   Immigration means you leave your own country, right?
[00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:46.300]   And you come to a new country,
[00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:48.300]   and you try to settle down here.
[00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:50.700]   When you come to this new country,
[00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:54.820]   you learn new culture, right?
[00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:58.660]   New customs, other language.
[00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:01.260]   And you still remember your old ways of life, right?
[00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:07.660]   As an immigrant, you still remember your old ways of life,
[00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:10.980]   but now you're in a new land, right?
[00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:15.260]   You probably still value your cultural root, right?
[00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:17.220]   Like Chinese New Year, right?
[00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:18.980]   I mean, who cares?
[00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:21.220]   Oh, you care, right?
[00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:23.180]   I've been to America for many, many years,
[00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:25.580]   and I lost track, right?
[00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:27.340]   I don't do all of this.
[00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:29.860]   I don't give money to my kids.
[00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:32.940]   My kids are born here.
[00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:36.060]   And once they find out, oh, they have the Chinese heritage,
[00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:38.180]   sometimes when they were still younger,
[00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:40.800]   they were still hopeful that I'll give them money
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:42.720]   in Chinese New Year.
[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:44.780]   I said, no, this is America.
[00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:45.700]   We don't do that.
[00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:49.960]   Now they don't have that hope anymore, right?
[00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:52.660]   Because we are in a new land, new custom, right?
[00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:56.500]   And you understand you still value your cultural tradition,
[00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:57.960]   but there's a huge difference.
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:02.960]   The huge difference for you is the previous kingdom,
[00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:07.820]   the previous authority, the political power,
[00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:12.100]   or rules no longer have any holds on you, right?
[00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:17.740]   You drive here, it's not the same way you drive
[00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:20.020]   in Hong Kong or in China, right?
[00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:20.860]   Or in Japan.
[00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:23.740]   You drive differently in America.
[00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:26.300]   In Chicago, you drive differently, right?
[00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:27.800]   You drive totally different,
[00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:31.760]   because you belong to the new country, not the old one.
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:34.760]   Yes, you still have some memories,
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:37.140]   but now you're in the new land.
[00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:39.980]   You're under a different kingdom, right?
[00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:45.020]   The previous political power had no holds on you.
[00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:46.940]   And the Bible tells us the same sense.
[00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:50.260]   We were under the kingdom of Satan,
[00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:54.760]   darkness and sin and shame before Christ.
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:57.380]   And now we came to Christ, we came to know Jesus.
[00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:01.740]   The power of sin and shame will still have influence on us,
[00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:04.260]   but it shouldn't have any authority over you.
[00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:07.360]   It may influence you.
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:11.100]   It may affect you, still, it may.
[00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:13.900]   But you don't answer to those authorities.
[00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:15.700]   You don't answer to sin.
[00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:17.820]   You don't answer to darkness.
[00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:20.060]   You don't answer to Satan.
[00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:22.420]   You only answer to the new authority,
[00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:24.480]   which is the kingdom of God.
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:29.480]   God is the only king in this new order of things, right?
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:32.560]   You answer to Jesus only.
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:36.800]   Whenever you make decisions, especially important decisions,
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:41.800]   you should think in terms of what the true king,
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:44.420]   what the true king desires.
[00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:48.740]   You should always orient your life
[00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:51.200]   according to this new kingdom of God.
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.760]   And that is the life change that should be happening
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:55.680]   in all the followers of Jesus.
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:58.600]   And that is what happened to Mary Magdalene.
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:01.540]   Her life was changed.
[00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:05.560]   And that's why in this episode, when Jesus came,
[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:07.040]   cast out all the demons,
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:13.540]   the demons had no holds on Mary Magdalene.
[00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:16.800]   And that's the same story for all of us.
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:19.880]   Jesus came to redeem us, to save us
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.480]   from the old order of things,
[00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:24.520]   and brought us into a new order, a new kingdom,
[00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:25.640]   the kingdom of God.
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:30.640]   And one of the passages that captures this message
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:33.800]   is found in episode one of "The Chosen."
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:37.160]   And that is Isaiah 43.
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:41.360]   Isaiah 43, verses one and two.
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:46.000]   It says, "But now, O Jacob,"
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.220]   and Jacob is the nickname for the people of God,
[00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:50.380]   the nation of Israel.
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:55.920]   "Now, O Jacob, listen to the Lord who created you.
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:58.920]   O Israel, the one who formed you says,
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:03.160]   do not be afraid, for I have ransomed you.
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:07.920]   I have called you by name, and you are mine."
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:08.900]   Isaiah 43.
[00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:11.840]   Now, one more thing you need to understand,
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:16.840]   because when the Bible quotes a verse
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:18.920]   from the Old Testament,
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:22.760]   people don't take verse out of context.
[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:27.080]   They quote the entire chunk, the entire block of materials.
[00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:30.000]   And that material is the book of Isaiah, right?
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.120]   Have you read the book of Isaiah before?
[00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:34.240]   It's a huge, long book, right?
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:38.760]   So whenever the Bible refers to this verse, 43, one,
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:41.400]   it's actually referring to the huge chunk of materials
[00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:42.840]   found in the book of Isaiah.
[00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:44.760]   And you need to understand why the book of Isaiah
[00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:46.320]   was written.
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:49.440]   It was written for those who were under oppression.
[00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:53.800]   The Jewish people at that time, in Isaiah's time,
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:58.800]   100 years before Jesus, were under the Babylonian Empire.
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:03.260]   They were under the military oppression of Babylon.
[00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:05.960]   And these chapters, including 43,
[00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:10.960]   summarizing all the Jewish hopes that we have in God.
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:13.400]   The people of God were waiting.
[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:17.000]   They were yearning for a new king to set them free,
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.480]   to rule over them.
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:21.400]   The new order of things they were yearning for.
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:25.400]   A new son of David, a new descendant of David,
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:29.200]   like Solomon, who established the first kingdom.
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.120]   Someone like the son of David will come
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:35.880]   and restore us back to God, from oppression to liberty,
[00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:37.240]   from oppression to freedom.
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:41.040]   And God will give us power to witness His greatness
[00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:42.040]   to the ends of the earth.
[00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:43.640]   That's what Isaiah's all about.
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:45.680]   I just summarized the whole book for you
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:47.440]   in the last 30 seconds, all right?
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:49.400]   And God tells the people,
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:51.560]   no matter how difficult your situation is,
[00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:55.240]   fear, unknowns, or challenges, I am with you.
[00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:58.520]   Because I have called you by name.
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:27:59.880]   I have called you by name.
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:03.860]   In the biblical culture,
[00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:05.960]   whenever you say, "I call you by name,"
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:08.560]   whenever they talk about naming,
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:11.760]   naming someone, or renaming someone,
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:14.840]   like Abram to Abraham, right?
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:17.120]   Sarai to Sarah.
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:19.600]   Whenever you have name changing,
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:21.240]   you know, naming in the biblical culture
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:23.800]   is not simply a label.
[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:25.160]   It's not like among the crowd,
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:27.000]   "Hey, Mark, can you stand up?"
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.520]   That's just a label, right?
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:32.440]   That's how we modern people understand naming.
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:33.360]   But in biblical culture,
[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:36.060]   naming is a totally different booking.
[00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:38.100]   Because naming in the ancient culture
[00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:41.240]   has to do with authority and belonging.
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:45.840]   You are being named because you belong to someone
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:47.560]   who named you, right?
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:52.160]   You remember there's a,
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:56.160]   you understand there's a very, very important ritual
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:58.160]   in the Christian journey,
[00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:59.840]   which is baptism, right?
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:03.740]   Baptism, you dunk someone in the water,
[00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:06.600]   and then you lift him or lift her back up, right,
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:08.120]   out of the water.
[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:11.220]   And what did we say when we do that?
[00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:13.680]   We say we baptize you in the name of the Father,
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:16.480]   the Son, and the Holy Spirit, right?
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:18.160]   And what does it mean?
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:19.920]   Does it mean getting a license?
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:21.840]   Do pastors get a license to do that,
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:23.880]   to dunk people in the water?
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:25.600]   No, the formula says,
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:27.680]   in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:29.200]   I baptize you.
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:33.360]   That means you have the name of the triune God.
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:35.200]   You have the name of God of Trinity.
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:38.280]   The name, singular,
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:40.280]   the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,
[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:44.200]   and that means you belong to God himself.
[00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:50.720]   When you get baptized, God's name is on your life,
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:54.200]   and he has authority because he is the new king.
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:58.000]   And according to him, there will be life change,
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.840]   and new order of things.
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:01.920]   So call you by name, it says Isaiah.
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:03.560]   Do not be afraid, I have ransom you.
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:08.040]   I have called you by name, and you are mine.
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:09.140]   You belong to me.
[00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:12.420]   No longer you belong to the oppressor,
[00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:15.740]   or your previous political power,
[00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:17.900]   or anyone that has a hold on you,
[00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:21.280]   or anything that has hold on you.
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:25.540]   Whether it's the shame, guilt, depression,
[00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:30.580]   all those things no longer have any hold on you
[00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:33.220]   because you don't belong to them.
[00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:36.900]   You belong to the God who ransomed you, who saved you.
[00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:40.140]   God knows you by name and call you by name
[00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:43.380]   because you are his.
[00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:44.980]   And he said, "You are mine."
[00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:49.380]   God know us, thank God, right?
[00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:51.940]   We belong to the new king, Jesus Christ,
[00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:54.180]   who died on the cross for our sin,
[00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:58.380]   to set us free from any oppressive powers,
[00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:01.820]   ultimately sin and darkness and death.
[00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:06.620]   And Jesus free us and give us this new life, right?
[00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:08.420]   And Mary Magdalene experienced it,
[00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:11.700]   and we should too, we should too.
[00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:15.300]   Now, before we close in prayer,
[00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:19.420]   we would close today's service with a communion.
[00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:23.220]   I think we have the communion elements ready.
[00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:26.860]   And by doing that,
[00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:31.220]   we proclaim to the world,
[00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:33.740]   as we protect the bread and the cup.
[00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:38.140]   Remember, this is the Passover meal
[00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:43.140]   Jesus set up for generations of Christians, right?
[00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:47.420]   The Passover story, find fulfillment in Jesus
[00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:49.340]   because Jesus is the lamb of God.
[00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:52.300]   He set us free, right?
[00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:54.980]   He set us free and we belong to him.
[00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:58.540]   And by protecting the cup and the bread,
[00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:01.820]   we know we belong to Jesus and to him alone.
[00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:05.620]   Let's do that because of grace of God,
[00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:09.100]   then we can be called the children
[00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:11.260]   of the kingdom of the light.
[00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:12.100]   Let's all pray.
[00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:20.940]   Father, as we bow our heads to pray to you,
[00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:25.340]   we know we belong to you.
[00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:29.980]   And thank you for being our king,
[00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:33.780]   being our Lord.
[00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:39.500]   You have called us by name and we are yours.
[00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:45.500]   Thank you for loving us so amazingly and so unconditionally.
[00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:48.620]   As we see the cross,
[00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:54.260]   as we see Jesus hung on the cross because of our sin,
[00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:57.300]   in order to love us and to redeem us and ransom us
[00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:00.460]   from all kinds of powers on the earth,
[00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:02.180]   sin and darkness and death,
[00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:06.380]   they no longer have any holes in our lives.
[00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:11.020]   Thank you for the change that you brought about
[00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:12.100]   in your grace.
[00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:15.500]   It's not because of what we have done,
[00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:20.420]   but because of what your son has done for all of us.
[00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:23.660]   So as we observe the communion together,
[00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:25.460]   taking the bread and the cup,
[00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:27.140]   bring us back to your table.
[00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:30.500]   Bring us back to your table of grace,
[00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:35.060]   knowing that we can partake in eternity
[00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:38.100]   because of your sheer grace.
[00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:40.980]   Thank you, Jesus.
[00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:42.260]   In Christ's name, we pray.
