1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
 - Good to see you all, and as Kelly mentioned,

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,960
 many of us are sick, especially with little children.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,680
 It's been a very tough season, it's a flu season.

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,440
 And this flu season is more severe than what we had,

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,820
 what I had before.

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,560
 And even I got sick for quite a few days.

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,680
 As you know, I went to New York for five days

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,760
 of family vacation, and then I got sick.

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,200
 I went in the Christmas break,

10
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,360
 so there were tons of people there on the street,

11
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,760
 and I could hardly move in Manhattan,

12
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,260
 and that's what I expected.

13
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,920
 I would get sick, and I did, I did get sick.

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,640
 So I came back and been sick for five days,

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,960
 and my son and my daughter, they're all sick.

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,040
 I think my wife got sick too.

17
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,440
 I think she got sick before we got sick.

18
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,280
 Anyways, yeah, so we all got sick,

19
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,020
 and we just get in line to get sick.

20
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,200
 And some of our families are also not here

21
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,800
 because their children are sick,

22
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,520
 and Jinfan and Paul are not here

23
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,320
 because they are still, little Isaac,

24
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,000
 yeah, little Isaac is out of NICU,

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,800
 and thank you for your prayer.

26
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,960
 And they need time to adjust,

27
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,800
 to get into a new routine.

28
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:16,080
 And you can imagine how difficult it is,

29
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,720
 and it's quite challenging, and keep them in prayer.

30
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,640
 And as Kelly told us,

31
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,440
 remember the people in Los Angeles,

32
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,240
 how many of you have friends and coworkers

33
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,320
 or relatives living in Los Angeles?

34
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,160
 How many of you?

35
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,000
 Oh, you do, okay, all right, yeah.

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,520
 Make sure you call them and pray for them, yeah.

37
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:39,200
 I have some friends who live in Los Angeles,

38
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,920
 and they got evacuated, yeah, and it's very difficult, yeah.

39
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,600
 And you see news stories reporting,

40
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,880
 you know, the whole town got wiped out.

41
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,400
 It's just horrible, it's horrible.

42
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,560
 May God have mercy on them.

43
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,920
 So good to see you all, good to see you, good to see you.

44
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,600
 (laughs)

45
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,520
 Anyways, we continue to worship God,

46
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,240
 and with the number of people,

47
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,880
 we should get in circle, actually.

48
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,480
 So that's what I've been thinking.

49
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,880
 Maybe we should get into circle,

50
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,040
 and we can do a Bible study or something.

51
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,240
 But, you know, not today, okay?

52
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,520
 In the future, all right, yeah.

53
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:19,520
 And we are on this mini series on the 10 commandments,

54
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,320
 and we said these commandments are called 10 words.

55
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,240
 They are not being described as commandment

56
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,320
 in the Old Testament.

57
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:33,040
 In the Hebrew Bible, never use the word commandment,

58
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,520
 something that you have to do or you shall not do

59
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,040
 to summarize.

60
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,880
 There's 10 things, actually,

61
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:46,880
 the word used by the Old Testament is actually words.

62
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,800
 10 words.

63
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,240
 So these are the 10 words, the 10 commandments,

64
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,840
 what we call, that God gave to the people of Israel

65
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,840
 when they are being constituted to be a new people of God,

66
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,080
 being saved out of Egypt by grace,

67
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,760
 and now they have a new identity.

68
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,760
 Being the people of God,

69
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,960
 they are given new principles to live by,

70
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,320
 a new lifestyle that says to God,

71
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,200
 "Thank you for saving me, God."

72
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,760
 And now we have a new lifestyle,

73
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,960
 we embrace a new set of identity,

74
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,920
 a new set of value system,

75
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,080
 and these value systems are being summarized

76
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,120
 by these 10 words.

77
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,360
 So we went through the first three commandments,

78
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,360
 and now we come to the so-called commandment

79
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,920
 or word number four, the fourth principle.

80
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,880
 And here it says, "Remember the Sabbath day

81
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,600
 "by keeping it holy six days,

82
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,840
 "you shall labor and do all your work,

83
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,140
 "but the seventh day is the Sabbath to the Lord your God.

84
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,560
 "On this day, the seventh day,

85
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,040
 "you shall not do any work,

86
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,800
 "neither you nor your son, nor your daughter,

87
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,680
 "nor your manservant, nor maidservant, nor your animals,

88
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,760
 "nor the aliens, the foreigners within your gates.

89
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:09,760
 "For in six days, the Lord made the heavens and the earth,

90
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,240
 "the sea and all that is in them,

91
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,120
 "but he rested, God rested on the seventh day.

92
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,840
 "Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day

93
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,120
 "and made it holy."

94
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,280
 Now, you have to remember the first audience

95
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,280
 who heard this word, this principle, were Israelites,

96
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,720
 and they have been living in Egypt for hundreds of years,

97
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,320
 for some generations.

98
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,440
 So when the Israelites are being saved by God out of Egypt,

99
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,240
 all of them are actually 100% Egyptians.

100
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,320
 You get my point, right?

101
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,480
 You get my point.

102
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,400
 All of their clothing, all of the stuff

103
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:54,400
 that carry with them when they left Egypt in haste,

104
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,120
 everything is made in Egypt.

105
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,400
 So actually the identity of Israelites

106
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,320
 was not very clear at this point

107
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,400
 because they just got out of Egypt

108
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,040
 and every one of them lived like Egyptian

109
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,960
 and think like Egyptian and lived like Egyptian before.

110
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,400
 And what we know today is in ancient Egypt,

111
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:22,400
 slaves have a 10-day work week.

112
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,440
 So you work 10 days and then you get one day off.

113
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,000
 And then you work another 10 days

114
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,920
 and then one day off, perhaps, or sometimes not.

115
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,000
 And then 10 days and then one day off, right?

116
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 So this is a typical ancient Egyptian slave work schedule,

117
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,700
 10 days and then one day off.

118
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,440
 The Sabbath lifestyle says something different.

119
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,080
 Six days you shall work

120
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,800
 and then one day you shall take a break.

121
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,880
 And you take a break by keeping it holy

122
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,580
 to worship God, to serve God.

123
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:02,360
 And you have to imagine, if you're the first audience

124
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,080
 out of Egypt, Israelite, you have been in Egypt

125
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,920
 working 10-day week for generations.

126
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,120
 And then you come to the foot of Mount Sinai

127
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,720
 and Moses said, "This is what the Lord God has given us,

128
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,680
 "a new principle."

129
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,120
 Principle number four is six days you shall work.

130
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,720
 And then one day you shall take a break to keep it holy.

131
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,360
 And you're kind of like, "Wow, this is actually humane."

132
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,200
 Right?

133
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,220
 This is actually respecting human rights

134
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:37,220
 to take a break and to rest, not a workaholic.

135
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:41,720
 So you notice the scope of the principle

136
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:46,520
 is actually, it's encompassing the entire cosmos,

137
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,680
 the entire human society.

138
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,320
 Look with me, who shall not work?

139
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,220
 You shall not work.

140
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,960
 Your son shall not work.

141
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,320
 And in the original language, your daughter shall not work.

142
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,600
 Your man servant, male servant, and the female servant,

143
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,360
 your female servant in the original language,

144
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,080
 and then your animals, the cattle, the sheep

145
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,920
 that work the ground.

146
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:18,960
 And then lastly, the alien, the foreigners

147
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,080
 within your gaze.

148
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,120
 So seven categories encompassing the entire

149
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:29,200
 Israelite community, entire Israelite society.

150
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,280
 And the principle reveals the character of God.

151
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,280
 Who is God that would give this kind of principle?

152
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,840
 Because God is full of compassion.

153
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,840
 God is full of compassion.

154
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,480
 God is compassionate about especially slaves,

155
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,480
 those who have no power.

156
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,120
 Those who have no power to control the schedule.

157
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,640
 They're working under the Lord, the master,

158
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,160
 and they have to work.

159
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,680
 And God, by giving this principle,

160
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,240
 shows that his heart is full of compassion and love

161
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,360
 for those people who rest.

162
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,240
 And this commandment also explains

163
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,240
 why you have to keep six days to work,

164
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,680
 and then one day wholly to take a break

165
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,680
 and keep it holy, keep it sacred.

166
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:19,680
 For in six days, that's how the Lord God did his work.

167
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,840
 Remember Genesis 1, there was six-day creation.

168
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,560
 Definitely not a scientific report,

169
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,160
 but it's an artistic representation of how God work.

170
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,840
 God worked six days.

171
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,160
 He set up the entire cosmos.

172
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:38,160
 And then on the seventh day, Genesis 2, he rested.

173
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,800
 He rested on this seventh day and blessed.

174
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,600
 And because God worked this way,

175
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,320
 we, as the people of God, also need to work this way.

176
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,120
 It's interesting when we read

177
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,560
 from the very beginning of this document,

178
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,080
 10 words, 10 commandments,

179
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,840
 from commandment one to three and now to four,

180
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,280
 this is the first commandment that has to do with time.

181
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,120
 And schedule.

182
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,680
 Time and schedule.

183
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,160
 You know, how many of you still use the paper calendar?

184
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,800
 In the beginning of the year,

185
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,560
 you have to buy a new calendar.

186
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,520
 Only my wife.

187
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,720
 Yeah, right?

188
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,400
 So you guys use electronic?

189
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,840
 Google Calendar, something like that?

190
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,520
 Yeah, that's what I do, yeah.

191
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,120
 But you know, my wife is very old school,

192
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,720
 and we have to buy paper calendar every,

193
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,560
 by the end of the year, we buy a new calendar.

194
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,600
 So what I do is, every single year,

195
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,280
 it's one of my routine.

196
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,560
 Toward the end of year, I will go to Amazon

197
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:44,000
 or the bookstore to buy those monthly calendar.

198
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 You know, you have to flip,

199
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,600
 and then there's a beautiful picture on top,

200
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,480
 and probably a quote here and there.

201
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,000
 And then you have these boxes, right?

202
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,880
 And toward the end of year, I always buy a new one.

203
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,240
 And I always buy a Jewish calendar,

204
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,360
 because it has the lunar calendar in there.

205
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,120
 So the lunar calendar kind of falls

206
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:07,240
 in line with the Chinese or the Asian lunar calendar.

207
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,080
 So like the end of this year,

208
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:14,080
 end of this month is the new year for the lunar calendar.

209
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,800
 So I look at the calendar,

210
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,280
 and I know what day it is in the Western calendar,

211
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,960
 and then in the lunar calendar.

212
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,840
 So that's what we do.

213
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,680
 You know, it has to do with schedule.

214
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,920
 And I want to ask you a question.

215
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:31,440
 You know, when you became a Christian,

216
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,720
 when you accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior,

217
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,120
 it has to do with, first of all, your time.

218
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,960
 You know, Jesus kind of,

219
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:46,080
 kind of restructure and reconfigure your schedule.

220
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:51,520
 Before you came to Christ, you know,

221
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,280
 every single moment, every day,

222
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,600
 you are the boss, you are in charge.

223
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,000
 But you came to Christ,

224
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,720
 it has to do with some schedule change, right?

225
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,480
 God modify our week schedule.

226
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,160
 So six days, of course, we need to work.

227
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:13,240
 But in general, in the general pattern,

228
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,080
 we take one day off to serve God, right?

229
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,800
 And that's why we gather.

230
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,360
 That's why we keep on gathering.

231
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,680
 Yeah, I know it's snowing today, right?

232
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,600
 The weather is not very nice,

233
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,360
 but we still keep it holy,

234
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,640
 because this is one of the commandments from God.

235
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,920
 And this is one of the application we should have

236
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,560
 the beginning of the year,

237
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,640
 maybe it's our new year resolution.

238
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,800
 You know, we keep it holy,

239
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,680
 set it aside and put it in our calendar,

240
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,760
 put it in our schedule,

241
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,160
 that we are to keep it holy the Sabbath day,

242
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,320
 because God bless this time.

243
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,520
 So we worship together.

244
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:58,000
 Now, commandment number five, principle five,

245
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,360
 is honor your father and your mother

246
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,080
 so that you may live long in the land

247
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,720
 the Lord your God is giving you.

248
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,560
 Now, today, when we imagine family

249
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,600
 in the Westernized society,

250
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,720
 now the son or the daughter,

251
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,600
 they get married and they probably move out

252
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,320
 and build their own family, right?

253
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,480
 Buy their own houses and live somewhere else

254
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,440
 or move out of town into somewhere else,

255
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,560
 because of job, because of different reality.

256
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,520
 But in the near East, in the ancient time,

257
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,800
 in the Bible time,

258
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,520
 most of the families are multi-generational.

259
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,880
 Multi-generational.

260
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,840
 Now, how many of you still live in your family

261
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,880
 multi-generationally?

262
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,240
 With your grandpa and grandma?

263
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,080
 How many of you?

264
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,560
 No, right?

265
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,680
 Most of the people don't live together

266
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,080
 with different generations.

267
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,880
 But in ancient Israel, it has always been the case.

268
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,880
 You live with your parents and your grandparents,

269
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,520
 and then probably three generations

270
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:07,160
 or even fourth generation living under one roof.

271
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,800
 And here it says, honor your father and your mother.

272
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,960
 You know, in Hebrew,

273
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,360
 Hebrew is a very interesting language.

274
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,360
 It says honor, in English translation,

275
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,080
 it has the connotation of something that is heavy.

276
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,400
 You know, when something that is valuable,

277
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,480
 when something that has dignity,

278
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,040
 that has value, that has importance,

279
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,200
 you kind of see it as something weighty.

280
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,680
 You know, it's like a dumbbell.

281
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,560
 It's something that is heavy.

282
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,000
 So glory and honor are something that is with weight,

283
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,760
 just like your backpack or your luggage or a suitcase.

284
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,240
 You have to carry it around.

285
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,920
 So in order to weight, to give weight to others,

286
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,400
 someone has to have the resources to do so,

287
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,960
 especially financial resources.

288
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,120
 In the ancient time, of course,

289
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,460
 they don't use electronic money.

290
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:08,460
 They use coins or silver or gold bar to do business.

291
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:14,920
 So something that has value has weight, right?

292
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,080
 You carry your silver around in the marketplace

293
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,120
 to buy stuff, and that's the sense here.

294
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,020
 Honor your father and mother is to give them the weight,

295
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:30,520
 give them the heaviness, because they need to be honored.

296
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:34,280
 They need to have the resource.

297
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,320
 In the ancient society, there was no hospice,

298
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,320
 there was no assisted living or something like that.

299
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,360
 Everyone lives in the house, right?

300
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,360
 Your home is the hospice.

301
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,720
 Your home is the hospital.

302
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,600
 And that's why life and death, especially death,

303
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,600
 it's not something foreign to the people in those times.

304
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,960
 They always see life and death in their houses.

305
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,000
 Baby being born, and then the elderly got sick

306
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,480
 and passed away.

307
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,000
 It's right in front of them.

308
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,280
 So here the commandment speaks of a resourceful

309
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,680
 person, a proper, you know,

310
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:24,600
 narrowly defined, is a resourceful male.

311
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,400
 He has to honor, give honor to his parents.

312
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,800
 And you think about it, the essence of the principle

313
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,260
 has to do with your heart orientation.

314
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:40,040
 This new principle, this new value says

315
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,500
 that one should not be self-centered.

316
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:48,500
 But looking after other people, especially parents.

317
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,300
 Because the parents have legitimate needs.

318
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:56,140
 And one has to give resources, offer resources

319
00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:00,140
 to fulfill it, to honor, to make it heavy,

320
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:03,620
 to make it honorable, so that you will live long

321
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,900
 in the land.

322
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:08,060
 Now you is not singular, you is plural.

323
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:13,020
 It's talking about a nation, talking about a people,

324
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,860
 a community as a whole.

325
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:18,980
 So you can live long, you can continue longer

326
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,920
 from generation to generation in the land,

327
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,580
 so that you, your community, in this case,

328
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:28,300
 the Israelite community, their society,

329
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,980
 if they look after one another,

330
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,540
 if they take care of one another,

331
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,380
 they are not self-centered community,

332
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,580
 they always look after one another,

333
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,860
 care for one another.

334
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,780
 Their community will continue.

335
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:44,100
 Their community life will continue, enjoy longevity.

336
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:48,260
 That is the essence of the principle.

337
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:52,280
 Number six, you shall not murder.

338
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,000
 You shall not murder.

339
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,600
 Now this is a great translation, you shall not murder,

340
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,920
 because the older translation in English

341
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,560
 is thou shall not kill.

342
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:06,840
 Right, the Hebrew word here translated murder correctly,

343
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,500
 means taking innocent life.

344
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,540
 Thou shall not take innocent life.

345
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:15,260
 So that's why modern translation try to correct that,

346
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:19,780
 or try to connote that kind of sense.

347
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:22,460
 You know, it has to do with murder.

348
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:26,620
 Because the big deal about murder is that,

349
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:31,620
 because the action will destroy an image of God.

350
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:35,060
 Because every man and woman is created

351
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,480
 in the very image of God.

352
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,580
 If you take an innocent life, shed innocent blood,

353
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:45,580
 means that you assault God's image and God himself.

354
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:48,480
 As Pastor Chi has already preaching,

355
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,260
 or going through the Sermon on the Mount,

356
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,320
 I'm sure you know what that means.

357
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,160
 It's not about outward behavior.

358
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,960
 In fact, the entire document of Ten Commandments

359
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,960
 has to do less with outward behavior.

360
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,140
 It has to do with our inner heart,

361
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,400
 our motive, our heart orientation.

362
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,540
 So to hate a person is the root of murder.

363
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,240
 That's why that is the essence

364
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,780
 that the principle is trying to lay out.

365
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:22,620
 The ten words have the inner, your heart orientation in mind.

366
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,000
 They address our motive, our heart.

367
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,380
 So we're called in this principle

368
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:31,640
 to treat other people with compassion, instead of hatred.

369
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:37,980
 Principle number seven, thou shall not commit adultery.

370
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:41,420
 Now in ancient Egypt, polygamy and adultery

371
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:45,380
 were very common and it's very much so

372
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:48,060
 in the patriarchal society,

373
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:53,060
 because the men would treat women as property and objects.

374
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,900
 Here you shall not commit adultery.

375
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,940
 Again, the heart orientation,

376
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:02,220
 it's not so much like I don't do certain things.

377
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,860
 So I keep the commandment.

378
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:08,860
 The essence has to do with our orientation to do something,

379
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:13,300
 do our best to protect the family of other people,

380
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:17,300
 to protect the dignity of other people, including women.

381
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,820
 Again, in the Sermon on the Mount,

382
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:24,540
 Jesus also talks about the spirit of the law,

383
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:29,300
 the commandment, has to do with ungodly, lustful desires

384
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,280
 that try to objectify other people

385
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,460
 and use other people to satisfy our own desire.

386
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:37,940
 So that is the essence of this principle.

387
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:40,980
 Again, again and again, we see that the heart orientation

388
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,540
 is to protect other people.

389
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,420
 We are out here to protect other people,

390
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:47,180
 to care for other people, to protect their right

391
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,660
 and protect their dignity and honor.

392
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:54,560
 Number eight, you shall not steal.

393
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:59,560
 Now this principle assumes the right to own something,

394
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,460
 your property, your asset, your money,

395
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:07,180
 but it also sets a boundary for our possessions,

396
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:10,980
 for our desire to acquire things.

397
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:15,300
 Yes, we can own stuff, we can own asset,

398
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,420
 we can have our own property,

399
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:20,940
 but ultimately God is the owner of all.

400
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:25,940
 And we are simply stewards, managers.

401
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,040
 We're just managers.

402
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,700
 God bless us with different resources,

403
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,460
 financial resources and properties and all that,

404
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:37,300
 but God wants us to be honest with our relationship with him

405
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,960
 and our relationship with our things.

406
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,200
 And there is a boundary there.

407
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,540
 Now if you want to shed some light

408
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:47,020
 on how to apply this principle,

409
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:50,160
 we can always look for other scriptures

410
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,380
 as what we did for other principles,

411
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,460
 like thou shall not murder

412
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,260
 or thou shall not commit adultery.

413
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,340
 You look for New Testament,

414
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,140
 look for other Old Testament passages,

415
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:01,840
 how they apply it so that you know how to live it.

416
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,340
 One of the passages in the Old Testament,

417
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:09,180
 actually it's the last book of the Old Testament,

418
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,300
 the book of Malachi,

419
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:16,260
 actually the prophet is teaching the people of God

420
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:23,160
 and say, there was a debate here, 3/8,

421
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:27,160
 where a man robbed God, yet you robbed me.

422
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,320
 Now who said that?

423
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,760
 God said this.

424
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,800
 God said to his people, will someone rob God?

425
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,520
 Yet you guys, pointing to the Israelite people,

426
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,760
 you robbed me.

427
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:42,760
 But then you ask, there's a debate,

428
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:47,760
 and the people, we but by saying, how do we rob you, God?

429
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,800
 We never robbed you, this is our stuff.

430
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,680
 And God answer through the prophet Malachi

431
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,000
 in tithes and offerings.

432
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,720
 In your offerings, you keep it only to yourself

433
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,720
 because there is a portion of it that belong to God.

434
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,680
 If you do that, it is robbery, it is stealing.

435
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:11,160
 Again, it sets a healthy boundary for our possessions

436
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:16,160
 so that we are not so absorbed by our materials.

437
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,740
 Materialism is not divine principle,

438
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:24,700
 but faithful stewardship is.

439
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:28,660
 And that's what this principle is all about, principle eight.

440
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:33,120
 Principle nine, you shall not give false testimony

441
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,540
 against your neighbor.

442
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:39,560
 Now so often we read the service meaning of this verse,

443
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,160
 this principle, principle number nine,

444
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:45,040
 and it often has to do with, okay, don't lie, okay?

445
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,460
 You gotta tell the truth.

446
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:51,000
 But you have to pick on the terms here.

447
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 It has to do with the context of legal testimony

448
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,900
 in the court.

449
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:00,400
 And in the ancient society, only the men

450
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,360
 have the social status and social power

451
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:07,000
 to be called upon by the court to give a legal testimony

452
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,360
 when a case is being processed, right?

453
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,580
 When someone is being prosecuted.

454
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:15,260
 And in Israel, a man may be called to give evidence

455
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,780
 in a legal proceeding.

456
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:21,120
 So the principle says that you have to tell nothing

457
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:21,960
 but the truth.

458
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:26,840
 A false testimony, therefore, is an abuse of your power.

459
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:32,440
 If you tell or you give a false testimony,

460
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:36,480
 you are engaging in character assassination.

461
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,060
 You are trying to assassinate someone,

462
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:42,960
 someone who may not be guilty.

463
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,960
 And here, the essence, it has to do with the use of power,

464
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:52,080
 use of our social status and our social means.

465
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,920
 And the essence is to protect and defend

466
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,260
 your neighbor's character.

467
00:23:56,260 --> 00:24:00,020
 You shall not give a false testimony.

468
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:04,100
 You should protect the other person's integrity.

469
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:09,940
 Now, all of these principles, we come to number nine,

470
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:14,940
 all of them has a nature of revealing God's character.

471
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:18,780
 So you take this principle and you read it,

472
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,740
 and you have to think about why this principle

473
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:24,780
 matter to God, because that has to do

474
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,220
 with the character of God.

475
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:29,480
 And here, number nine reveals the character of God

476
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,020
 being truthful.

477
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:33,860
 God is a God of truth.

478
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,540
 God is a God of justice.

479
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:41,900
 So it matters to him when your neighbor is being accused

480
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:45,260
 without someone who defend for him, right?

481
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,780
 So thou shall not give a false testimony

482
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:52,020
 against your neighbor in a court.

483
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,900
 You don't abuse your power.

484
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,300
 You use your power, however, to protect

485
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,420
 and defend other people.

486
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:01,700
 Again, from principle number one to nine,

487
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:06,700
 the orientation has to do with serving other people.

488
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,940
 Protecting other people, uplifting other people.

489
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:14,700
 So you protect me and I protect you, right?

490
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,980
 We keep one another accountable,

491
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:21,060
 and we love one another in the covenant.

492
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:25,320
 Number 10, that's the last one.

493
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,460
 Now, this is interesting one.

494
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:31,300
 It says you shall not covet your neighbor's house.

495
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,680
 You shall not covet your neighbor's wife,

496
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:37,720
 men's servant, male servant, ox, donkey, the property,

497
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,360
 the stuff that your neighbor has,

498
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:43,940
 anything that belongs to your neighbor.

499
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,540
 Now again, in ancient Israel,

500
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:48,660
 when someone cannot pay a loan

501
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:53,140
 or because of disaster or because of sickness,

502
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:56,100
 he cannot pay a debt,

503
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:59,020
 the landlord has the power to take away

504
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,180
 pretty much everything.

505
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:04,000
 So the rich will become richer,

506
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,440
 and the poor can easily become poorer.

507
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:13,480
 And this principle has to do with drawing boundaries.

508
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,720
 Thou shall not covet.

509
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,940
 Those things do not belong to you,

510
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:21,160
 and you shall not touch it.

511
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:26,520
 So this commandment is kind of unique

512
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:30,720
 because it has nothing to do with our behavior, right?

513
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,500
 How can you enforce this?

514
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,860
 There's no way you can enforce this, right?

515
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:39,000
 Because your heart is coveting something.

516
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 It's right here inside.

517
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,980
 Nobody can seize it, right?

518
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:45,700
 Nobody can see it, and nobody can detect it

519
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:49,400
 until you do something, make your action reality.

520
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,400
 Coveting is your heart condition.

521
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,280
 This commandment is unique.

522
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,360
 You cannot enforce it.

523
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:03,360
 It go right into, straight to the heart of the matter.

524
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,280
 It has to do with our greed.

525
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:12,460
 Set boundary for our desire, our desire to possess,

526
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,180
 our desires to have more.

527
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:18,560
 Now, the heart of the commandment, number 10,

528
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:22,600
 is contentment, right?

529
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,200
 You should be content with what you have.

530
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,720
 You should be thankful for what you have

531
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,960
 instead of all day long you trying to seek to

532
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:36,600
 increase your wealth, even at the expense of other people.

533
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,200
 Now, as you can see, all 10 commandments,

534
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,760
 all 10 principles are not some kind of

535
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,060
 self-improvement moral code.

536
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:50,800
 It is, however, a moral vision, right?

537
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:56,800
 You see, if every Israelite will take these principle

538
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:01,020
 and apply them in their daily life,

539
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:07,480
 what kind of society will it become?

540
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,320
 It will become a society that would love God.

541
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,720
 It will be a community that would take care of one another.

542
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:18,500
 Everyone is not taking care of themselves, not selfish.

543
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,960
 It's not self-centered, but other-centered.

544
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,040
 You come to the community,

545
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,040
 come to the community of people of God.

546
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:28,060
 We seek to love God, right?

547
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:31,240
 Protect God's right to be worshiped.

548
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:35,320
 And then love other people with all our hearts

549
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,860
 and love our neighbors as ourselves.

550
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:42,240
 The 10 words actually challenge the people

551
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:47,240
 to use their power and we orient their resources

552
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,320
 toward other people, to serve other people.

553
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:57,500
 The direct audience of the 10 words are actually male,

554
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:02,760
 father, because they have sons and daughters.

555
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,460
 They are married.

556
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:08,960
 You shall not commit adultery.

557
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,820
 They are pretty well-off because they are resourceful.

558
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:14,800
 Their parents are aging.

559
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,640
 In this document, 10 commandments,

560
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,480
 if you read it carefully and critically,

561
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,080
 the direct audience, of course it applies

562
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,340
 to every person of God,

563
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:32,340
 every people of God, and every Israelite is applicable.

564
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:35,200
 However, the direct audience,

565
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,360
 the first audience of the 10 words, the 10 commandments,

566
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:43,200
 are actually males, fathers, married people,

567
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,800
 and pretty well-off.

568
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:48,320
 In today's term, probably middle-aged men,

569
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:54,020
 middle-aged men and being kind of successful,

570
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:59,340
 stable in our career, in our family life,

571
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:03,560
 in terms of our property,

572
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,760
 in terms of our social status,

573
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,540
 everything is pretty stable.

574
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:12,000
 These 10 words are actually addressing

575
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,700
 directly to these people.

576
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:17,280
 In a way, it's addressing to all of us.

577
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:21,060
 We are all resourceful in our own ways.

578
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:27,360
 And we are blessed by God.

579
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,120
 And the 10 principles are a reorientation

580
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,340
 of our value system.

581
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:36,040
 When we come to God, when we come to know Him

582
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:39,760
 and follow Jesus, everything in our life,

583
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,580
 our time, our schedule, our resources,

584
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:47,500
 everything will be reconfigured, reconfigured.

585
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:50,240
 I would like to use the analogy

586
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,920
 of what it means to come to Christ.

587
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,420
 The analogy is kind of like, when you come to Christ,

588
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:01,420
 your operation system is different.

589
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:05,440
 Your operation system is totally different.

590
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,520
 The value system is different.

591
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,460
 The orientation is totally different.

592
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:15,560
 You cannot use the old operation system to run your life.

593
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,760
 You use the new one.

594
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,080
 And here, the 10 words are the new kind of

595
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,040
 operation system for our lives.

596
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,560
 We protect God's right to be worshiped.

597
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,880
 Only one God, no idol.

598
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,280
 Sabbath, keep it holy.

599
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,920
 We are called to reorient our heart

600
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:37,800
 to protect other people and to lift up other people

601
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,600
 with compassion and with care.

602
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,640
 It is no wonder in the Israelite society,

603
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:47,040
 if you flip the pages of the Old Testament,

604
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,440
 especially the first five books of Moses,

605
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,360
 the what we call the Torah,

606
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:56,360
 you don't find police in the Torah.

607
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,800
 You have priests, you have prophets,

608
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:02,680
 you have teachers, you have farmers.

609
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,920
 You have totally different, many different roles

610
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:09,200
 in the moral world of the Torah.

611
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,120
 But you do not find

612
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:18,120
 Israelite police department in the Torah.

613
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,520
 You know why?

614
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:23,760
 Because if everyone observe and take to heart

615
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:28,160
 these principles, there's no need for law enforcement, right?

616
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,240
 In such kind of communities, such kind of society,

617
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,200
 everyone is out to protect other people.

618
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,240
 Everyone is out there to care for other people.

619
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,920
 And actually, this is what Jesus said, right?

620
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:44,040
 If you sum up the entire Torah, he gave two statements.

621
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,640
 Love God with all your heart and all your mind

622
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,740
 and all your strength.

623
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:53,160
 And second of all, is love your neighbors as yourself.

624
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:58,320
 Now, if we as a church,

625
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:02,200
 if we will take it to our heart,

626
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,200
 what kind of community, what kind of fellowship can we build?

627
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:10,380
 It's not just we come here and consume something.

628
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:14,000
 We take something and we leave.

629
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,040
 If we come here and to contribute,

630
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:20,760
 to pray for other people, to care for other people,

631
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,880
 to love your neighbors, love your brothers and sisters

632
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,800
 as yourself and love God with all your heart

633
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,600
 and all your strength, what kind of fellowship?

634
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:34,160
 It will be a community pleasing to God, right?

635
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,680
 It will be a community totally different

636
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,640
 from all other communities and clubs out there,

637
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,160
 all other social associations out there

638
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:44,120
 because they're always born by their own common interest

639
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:48,120
 or by their own common benefit.

640
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:53,000
 But the church, the people of God are called to be different.

641
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,520
 Other-centered, love others,

642
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,360
 pray for others and care for others.

643
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:05,440
 And that's why in our weekly update,

644
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,760
 I have been doing something new starting this year.

645
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:13,280
 I wanna do some weekly update in video format

646
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,680
 and send it out to the social media group.

647
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,880
 And I'll do one in Chinese, in Cantonese,

648
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,120
 and one in English.

649
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:25,120
 And I always wanna encourage people to not only get up today

650
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:28,000
 what's going on in our church, but to pray for.

651
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,120
 Our church, to care for other people, right?

652
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:36,720
 We come to church and ask not just how are you,

653
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:41,040
 not how are you doing, yeah, how can I pray for you?

654
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,480
 How can I care for you?

655
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,920
 How can I give so that I can make your life more abundant

656
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,920
 to bless you, right?

657
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:51,080
 So we can bless each other.

658
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,120
 Let's all do that, right?

659
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:59,600
 In this coming week, take one of this principles,

660
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:05,040
 one of this 10 principles and apply it in your home

661
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:10,200
 and now church, whatever that is, try to apply it.

662
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,600
 Take it to heart.

663
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,200
 Remember to love God with all your heart and all your soul

664
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,520
 and all your might and love neighbors,

665
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,160
 your neighbors as yourself.

666
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,080
 Let's all pray.

667
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,040
 Father, you call us to be a different people

668
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:29,280
 because you are such a great and unique God

669
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:35,200
 and you save us by grace out of land of slavery,

670
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,200
 out of sin and out of death.

671
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:45,160
 And now we are being called to take up this new identity,

672
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:51,000
 to have the honor to be called the people of God,

673
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,800
 your church, your followers.

674
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,560
 Help us, God.

675
00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:01,600
 Help us to have this principle transform us from inside out.

676
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:07,240
 Address our, we all ran our heart desires

677
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:10,120
 so that we are not just self-seeking.

678
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:14,800
 And you call us to seek you

679
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,920
 and to love other people as ourselves.

680
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,360
 Build our church in love.

681
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:26,000
 Build up our community so that we can fellowship together,

682
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,320
 care for one another and pray for one another.

683
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,640
 In this coming week, as we take some of these principles

684
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:35,480
 to apply in our home, in our church, in our lives,

685
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,360
 I pray that you grant us grace

686
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,480
 so that we will live as your people

687
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,800
 to honor your name in Christ name pray.

688
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:48,440
 Well, thank you very much for coming in the snow

689
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:52,040
 and there was a refreshment prepared by Kelly.

690
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:57,040
 Again, she's out here to serve us and we should appreciate.

691
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:01,320
 And please stay for a little bit for a time of fellowship

692
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:05,880
 and to enjoy the refreshment together.

693
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,320
 All right, see you next week.
