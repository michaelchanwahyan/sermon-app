[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   - Thank you for having me back here.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.060]   Thank you for having me back here.
[00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.260]   The last time I was here was back in May,
[00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:10.500]   so it's been a little while,
[00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.800]   but the fact that I'm back here means that
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.060]   it was okay last time, so thank you for having me.
[00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.900]   The last time I was here,
[00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.460]   I spoke on the topic of an emotive God,
[00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.900]   and it was about how God encourages us
[00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.120]   to express the full range of emotions
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.700]   that he also expresses, that he wants us to also express.
[00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.600]   And this time around, Pastor Mark was nice enough to,
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.500]   again, extend freedom for me to choose what to preach on.
[00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.060]   And usually I go through a process of prayer and meditation
[00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.360]   to figure out what it is God might be pressing
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.200]   on my heart to share,
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.660]   and I happened to be going through the book of Acts
[00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.100]   for my own devotion.
[00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.260]   And at the time when I received the invitation,
[00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.060]   I was going through the passages that actually
[00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.260]   were going through today,
[00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.600]   and I just felt really strongly that this was the message
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.920]   that the Lord wanted me to share today.
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:00.760]   So,
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.920]   if any of you have visited Thailand,
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.700]   you've probably done the very tourist thing
[00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.960]   of riding one of those elephants.
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.160]   I don't know, anybody ever gone to Thailand here?
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.000]   Yeah?
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   Okay.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.300]   I did many years ago,
[00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.860]   and when we see these animals in pictures and videos,
[00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.260]   most of our lives, we don't really get the true sense
[00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.960]   of how just amazingly powerful and large they are.
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.120]   These elephants can lift logs with their trunks,
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.860]   they can crush cars with their feet,
[00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.420]   and yet somehow they submit
[00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.800]   to these very fragile human masters.
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.160]   I always wondered how such big animals can be so compliant,
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.260]   and I eventually learned years later
[00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.100]   how they actually train them.
[00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.220]   The way that they train them is that when they're very young,
[00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.700]   they chain them or they bind them,
[00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.120]   so when they even try to break free, it hurts them.
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.120]   They're in a lot of pain
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.060]   if they try to escape their constraints.
[00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.500]   And so, over the years, as they get older and older,
[00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.300]   these human masters start to take away these devices,
[00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.760]   but the elephants are so trained
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.300]   to think that they're trapped
[00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.800]   that they continue to think that they're bound,
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.060]   and so they operate in submission as a result.
[00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.700]   The elephant imagery resembles
[00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.300]   how sometimes we can be bound spiritually
[00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.660]   by our early and external influences.
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.300]   Whether it's from our culture, society,
[00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.060]   or our religious context,
[00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.900]   we get stuck and trapped in these artificial limitations
[00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.000]   that we put on ourselves
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.740]   that might not even be biblically prescribed.
[00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.460]   Today's message is actually about that.
[00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.060]   It's about reflecting on what maybe we have in our lives
[00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.500]   that are unnecessary spiritual restrictions
[00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.860]   that we place on ourselves.
[00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.300]   And today's, oh, sorry, I forgot.
[00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.300]   Yeah, so this was the Emotive God,
[00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.300]   and I was thankful to see
[00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.860]   that Pastor Mark actually reviewed it.
[00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.260]   I somehow was on UB's website in August,
[00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.560]   and I was like, oh, he found a better graphic than me.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.820]   (audience laughs)
[00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.460]   And here's one of the elephants, right,
[00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.860]   that you would see in maybe Thailand or Burma.
[00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.460]   And today's passage is from Acts 15, one to 21.
[00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.500]   I will read it, but it's also on the screen.
[00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.220]   "Certain people came down from Judea to Antioch
[00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.740]   "and were teaching the believers.
[00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.340]   "Unless you are circumcised,
[00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.460]   "according to the custom taught by Moses,
[00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.140]   "you cannot be saved.
[00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.540]   "This brought Paul and Barnabas into sharp dispute
[00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.780]   "and debate with them.
[00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.580]   "So Paul and Barnabas were appointed,
[00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.140]   "along with some other believers,
[00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.780]   "to go up to Jerusalem to see the apostles and elders
[00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.580]   "about this question.
[00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.600]   "The church sent them on their way,
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.480]   "and as they traveled through Phoenicia and Samaria,
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.260]   "they told how the Gentiles had been converted.
[00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.420]   "This news made all the believers very glad.
[00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.000]   "When they came to Jerusalem,
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.220]   "they were welcomed by the church
[00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.820]   "and the apostles and elders,
[00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.080]   "to whom they reported everything God had done through them.
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.500]   "Then some of the believers who belonged
[00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.700]   "to the party of the Pharisees stood up and said,
[00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.780]   "The Gentiles must be circumcised
[00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.000]   "and required to keep the law of Moses.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.060]   "The apostles and elders met to consider this question.
[00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.020]   "After much discussion, Peter got up and addressed them,
[00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:19.700]   "Brothers, you know that some time ago,
[00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.060]   "God made a choice among you
[00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.180]   "that the Gentiles might hear from my lips
[00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.060]   "the message of the gospel and believe.
[00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.700]   "God, who knows the heart,
[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.120]   "showed that he accepted them
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.980]   "by giving the Holy Spirit to them,
[00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.880]   "just as he did to us.
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.580]   "He did not discriminate between us and them,
[00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.100]   "for he purified their hearts by faith.
[00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.800]   "Now then, why do you try to test God
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.500]   "by putting on the necks of Gentiles
[00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.100]   "a yoke that neither we nor our ancestors
[00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.640]   "have been able to bear?
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.300]   "No, we believe it is through the grace
[00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.740]   "of our Lord Jesus Christ
[00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.420]   "that we are saved, just as they are.
[00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.740]   "The whole assembly became silent
[00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.560]   "as they listened to Barnabas and Paul
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.540]   "telling about the signs and wonders
[00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.380]   "God had done among the Gentiles through them.
[00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.060]   "When they finished, James spoke up.
[00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.380]   "Brothers, he said, listen to me.
[00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.880]   "Simon has described to us how God first intervened
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.940]   "to choose a people for his name from the Gentiles.
[00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.020]   "The words of the prophets are in agreement
[00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.100]   "with this, as it is written.
[00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.360]   "After this, I will return and rebuild
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.840]   "David's fallen tent.
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.960]   "Its ruins I will rebuild, and I will restore it,
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.660]   "that the rest of mankind may seek the Lord,
[00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.900]   "even all the Gentiles who bear my name,
[00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.680]   "says the Lord who does these things,
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.680]   "things known from long ago.
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.700]   "It is my judgment, therefore,
[00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.100]   "that we should not make it difficult
[00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.620]   "for the Gentiles who are turning to God.
[00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.180]   "Instead, we should write to them,
[00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.200]   "telling them to abstain from food polluted by idols,
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.920]   "from sexual immorality,
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.100]   "from the meat of strangled animals, and from blood.
[00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.720]   "For the law of Moses has been preached in every city
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.980]   "from the earliest times,
[00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.580]   "and is read in the synagogues on every Sabbath."
[00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:05.680]   The passage begins on the backdrop
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.380]   of Paul and Barnabas' missionary journey in Acts 13 and 14.
[00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.780]   They travel from Antioch to Cyprus,
[00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.500]   making their way from the eastern coast of the island
[00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.020]   to the western coast,
[00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.620]   where they then travel to the mainland of modern-day Turkey.
[00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.120]   They mimic Jesus' strategy
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.620]   by first targeting the Jewish communities
[00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:26.980]   in these areas where they already have
[00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.840]   the religious background of the Old Testament.
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.780]   They actually mimic Jesus' strategy
[00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.180]   by first targeting the Jewish communities
[00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:35.640]   that already have the religious background
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.380]   of the Old Testament.
[00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:40.540]   They appeal to the Jews and the God-fearing Gentiles,
[00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:43.840]   and then connect Jesus as a promised Savior,
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:47.140]   referred to in the scriptures that they were all expecting.
[00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:49.300]   Paul and Barnabas head through a number of cities
[00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.980]   before backtracking, so you can see that they go inland,
[00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.940]   they go all the way to all these cities,
[00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.940]   and then they kind of do a U-turn back,
[00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.060]   and they backtrack to Antioch.
[00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.820]   And then Paul and Barnabas report
[00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.260]   all that God had done through them,
[00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.820]   and how he had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles
[00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:09.220]   when they returned.
[00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:15.500]   In verses 1 to 4, after returning to Antioch,
[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.060]   some people came from Judea, where Jerusalem is,
[00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.460]   the religious heart of Judaism,
[00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.980]   and contended that in order for new Gentile believers
[00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:25.740]   to be fully saved and accepted into the community,
[00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.780]   they needed to be circumcised.
[00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:31.480]   Circumcision is a hallmark of Jewish believers.
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.740]   In Genesis 17, Abraham is called by God
[00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:38.500]   to undergo circumcision as a sign of the covenant.
[00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.480]   Paul and Barnabas argued against this,
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.280]   and then made their way to Jerusalem to clear things up.
[00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:47.340]   And then in verses 5 to 11,
[00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:49.300]   what follows is another discussion,
[00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:52.040]   but this time against the believing Pharisees.
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:54.100]   This is different from just some people,
[00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.380]   because here are the respected elders
[00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:57.660]   of the believing community,
[00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:00.560]   and it required a more delicate handling of the situation.
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:06.300]   And then in 12, verses 12 to 18,
[00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:09.060]   Barnabas and Paul countered the idea.
[00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:10.340]   They argued against the Pharisees
[00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:12.580]   with the explanation of the sign of acceptance
[00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:13.940]   of the believers to the provision
[00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.540]   of the Holy Spirit to Gentiles.
[00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:18.040]   They detailed the signs and wonders
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.540]   God had done among them.
[00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:23.900]   And the conversion story capturing Cornelius,
[00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:25.780]   the centurion and others among him,
[00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:28.180]   are one of the stories depicted earlier in Acts.
[00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:36.140]   In verse 10, in verse 10 of the passage,
[00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.180]   there's a mention of putting on a yoke
[00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:40.020]   that neither the Jewish disciples
[00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:43.020]   nor the ancestors have been able to bear.
[00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:45.460]   It refers to circumcision and the extensive set
[00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:48.220]   of Mosaic laws that the traditional Jewish community
[00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:51.540]   believe had to be followed to be part of God's community.
[00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:56.300]   Though we do not have these rules in modern Christianity,
[00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.220]   I'd say that we have our own versions
[00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:00.880]   of heavy yokes that we place on ourselves.
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:04.860]   This part of the passage I'm gonna cover
[00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:06.460]   later in the message,
[00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:09.380]   along with this.
[00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:12.540]   So this, this is a yoke.
[00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:14.540]   A yoke is a tool placed on oxen
[00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:18.240]   to pull a cart, a plow, or a wagon.
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.380]   And it's made of solid wood,
[00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:22.740]   and back in the old days, it was really, really heavy.
[00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:25.920]   Actually, if you look at my shirt here,
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.100]   this is actually called the yoke as well.
[00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:31.460]   It's actually what holds and hangs the shirt on our bodies.
[00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:34.860]   Think about what yokes you might have
[00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:37.140]   in your personal situations.
[00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:39.940]   This yoke can come internally from ourselves
[00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:43.220]   and/or externally from those influences around us.
[00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:45.300]   They come from areas like our families,
[00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:48.700]   our culture, and even our church traditions.
[00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:51.380]   Recognizing some of these self-imposed yokes
[00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:54.380]   can help lighten what actually might be barriers
[00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:56.400]   for us to enjoy more of God's grace.
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.340]   It's actually funny that Miroslav's sharing
[00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:01.320]   the passage on the yoke.
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.540]   I didn't pay her for that.
[00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:03.980]   It just happened to work out.
[00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:07.500]   And when we accept,
[00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:10.740]   recognizing some of these self-imposed yokes
[00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:12.300]   can help us lighten what might be barriers
[00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:14.580]   and enjoy more of God's grace.
[00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:17.220]   And when we accept Jesus into our lives,
[00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:20.220]   we go through a process of justification
[00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:22.460]   as we enter the family of God.
[00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:24.220]   But just because we enter the family
[00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:26.660]   doesn't mean that we feel like part of the family.
[00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:29.140]   There's a lifelong process of sanctification.
[00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:30.840]   It's like marriage.
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.940]   When you marry, you create a new family,
[00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:35.580]   and then you join your spousal's family.
[00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:37.340]   And there's a period of acclimation
[00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:41.540]   to adjust to the new dynamics and rituals that you have.
[00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:43.180]   Going through this kind of acclimation
[00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:45.520]   is like sanctification.
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.420]   And the Biblically guided process of sanctification
[00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:50.260]   is becoming more like Jesus.
[00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.580]   Though the Bible should be our guide,
[00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:57.280]   our societal, cultural, and familial influences
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:59.140]   inevitably affect how we think
[00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:01.960]   the spiritual growth process should develop.
[00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:05.900]   This is true even for those who grew up in the church.
[00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:07.860]   There are traditions that become embedded
[00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:09.900]   in what we believe we need to do
[00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:12.540]   that really are not Biblically prescribed.
[00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:13.860]   They are more our preferences,
[00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:16.600]   and they become heavy yokes that we end up carrying.
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:22.380]   These yokes can be individual,
[00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:23.940]   and they can be organizational.
[00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:27.020]   I was born into the Chinese church.
[00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.460]   My parents were young and were active
[00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:33.620]   in the Cantonese side of the church they were in.
[00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:36.180]   And I was part of that in my earlier years.
[00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:38.420]   Sunday services were very traditional.
[00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:40.460]   All the songs came from the hymn books.
[00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:42.300]   Everybody came in suits and dresses.
[00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:44.580]   It was very, very boring for me.
[00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:45.820]   Even though now that I'm older,
[00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:48.280]   admittedly, I find comfort in some of that.
[00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:52.260]   In any case, as I started entering middle school,
[00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.420]   I started to attend the English side.
[00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:56.260]   It was more of a Western disposition.
[00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.540]   It was more casual, it was more young.
[00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:02.020]   And attendees were mostly American-born
[00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:04.540]   or mostly raised in the United States.
[00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:08.480]   Now, my normal attire every day,
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.620]   going to school through the week,
[00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:12.660]   were sweatpants and flip-flops.
[00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:14.100]   And they were super comfortable,
[00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:15.900]   and every day, even into college,
[00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:18.100]   this was my daily uniform.
[00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:21.800]   But my mom absolutely hates me wearing flip-flops.
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:26.880]   And I see this as a generational phenomenon
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:29.820]   because I remember when I was dating Rebecca, my wife,
[00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:31.980]   and I would go and visit her grandmother,
[00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:32.980]   she would always warn me,
[00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:35.380]   "Do not show up in your flip-flops."
[00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:39.500]   Or else she would just get an earful afterwards.
[00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.620]   And even when I visited her parents,
[00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:43.380]   she'd be like, "Make sure you don't come
[00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:44.340]   "in your flip-flops."
[00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:47.020]   And sometimes, I would listen.
[00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:50.040]   But I think it's actually a generational thing.
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:54.940]   One thing my mom disliked me more than wearing flip-flops
[00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:57.300]   was wearing flip-flops to church.
[00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:00.180]   And I think there's this image for those
[00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:02.600]   that grew up in Hong Kong in the earlier years,
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:06.700]   and only young thugs ran around wearing flip-flops,
[00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:07.700]   (speaks in foreign language)
[00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:12.700]   And these were the so-called (speaks in foreign language)
[00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:15.660]   I would consistently argue with my mom on this topic
[00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:18.520]   whenever we would prepare to go to church on Sundays.
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:19.460]   And some of you know my mother,
[00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:22.180]   so you're probably laughing, imagining her.
[00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:26.180]   We'd go back and forth, and at the end of it,
[00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:29.140]   she would usually conclude that Jesus would disapprove.
[00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:31.780]   Like that would be her way of trying to get me
[00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:33.420]   to stop wearing my flip-flops.
[00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:36.620]   And being the young teen I was,
[00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:38.940]   I would then reply that Jesus can't disapprove
[00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:40.840]   because he only wore sandals, right?
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:43.680]   (audience laughs)
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:48.160]   In fact, I visited my mom's church a couple of weeks ago,
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.020]   and I wore flip-flops to church,
[00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:52.860]   and I was attending the Chinese service with her.
[00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:54.740]   And at the end of it, she's like,
[00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:57.780]   (speaks in foreign language)
[00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:01.060]   And then, of course, I was like,
[00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:02.300]   I'm actually being more like Jesus
[00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.660]   because I'm wearing flip-flops.
[00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:05.940]   So she didn't take that very well,
[00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:09.420]   but this is a funny example of how we sometimes
[00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:12.460]   might add extra add-ons to what is required
[00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:13.780]   to be Christ-like.
[00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:16.860]   And this example might be funny and not harmful,
[00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:19.660]   but substitute the flip-flops for something else.
[00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:21.660]   Jesus would not approve of blank.
[00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:25.820]   Or you need to do more of blank to be more like Jesus.
[00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:31.060]   A more serious subject could actually be
[00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:34.340]   where you should and should not go as a believer.
[00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:36.120]   You shouldn't go to the bars anymore.
[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:38.320]   You can't stay out late on Saturdays anymore.
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.740]   You should only go to church on Fridays.
[00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:42.660]   That's the only place you can go to.
[00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:44.920]   Or maybe it's the people that you associate with.
[00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.820]   You should only hang out with Christians.
[00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:49.280]   Or you should disconnect yourself from your friends
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:50.940]   who are not believers, even though you might be
[00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:54.420]   the only connection to Jesus that they have in their lives.
[00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:56.420]   Or it's related to your spiritual practice.
[00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:59.420]   Maybe it's you have to pray a certain way
[00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:01.140]   for a minimum amount of time,
[00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:02.340]   or you have to pray in tongues
[00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:04.300]   for your prayers to be effective.
[00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:07.780]   You have to read the Bible through so many times in a year,
[00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:10.780]   or you have to go to church so many times each week,
[00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:13.260]   or you have to serve in so many different roles.
[00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.260]   These can all be our modern yokes of circumcision.
[00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:20.600]   They can be extra practices that we add that accumulate,
[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.720]   and they become more and more burdensome,
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:25.520]   and we can suffocate under the weight of them.
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.820]   We become very performance-oriented
[00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:30.040]   versus being very grace-driven.
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.080]   And we should ask ourselves,
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.800]   are there certain practices that we have
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.320]   that might be individual yokes in our own lives?
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:42.400]   Praying is good, church is good, serving is good,
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:45.880]   but are we doing them from a sincere posture of faith,
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:48.380]   or are we doing them just to say that we did them?
[00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:54.600]   So these yokes can also be organizational.
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.960]   We assimilate a lot of our own cultural traditions
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.180]   in how we do church.
[00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:01.140]   They might seem natural and preferential
[00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:02.200]   because they're grounded
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:05.380]   in our very familiar cultural practices,
[00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:09.700]   but they should not be classed as biblically required.
[00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:11.480]   These demands can actually overemphasize
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.760]   what is actually critical for a church,
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:16.720]   and can create organizational drag
[00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:20.860]   that prevents effective ministry, leadership, and fellowship.
[00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:24.360]   In the Chinese church, these can be even more pronounced
[00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:26.400]   when we operate within the greater American environment,
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.860]   because the difference is so stark.
[00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:30.920]   And I think one strong Asian influence
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:34.460]   that really pervades our perspective of how we do church
[00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:37.520]   is our very Asian emphasis on education.
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:39.560]   It's a very notable virtue,
[00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:42.780]   but it can also dangerously border on idolatrous behavior.
[00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:45.660]   Having lived in Hong Kong,
[00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:48.700]   I saw firsthand the intense pressure there is
[00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:52.100]   with education, and it starts at the earliest levels,
[00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:54.620]   preschool or maybe even when you're born.
[00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:56.540]   It got to very absurd levels.
[00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:58.700]   The competition is so fierce,
[00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:01.140]   and people have to apply their kids
[00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:02.580]   to try to get into school,
[00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:04.340]   to even apply for school as soon as they're born.
[00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:07.820]   You can't apply a child for school unless they exist,
[00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:09.660]   and they do so right after they're born,
[00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:12.860]   because the lines are so long and it's so competitive.
[00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:14.980]   They start doing interviews with three-year-olds
[00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:16.740]   to see if they're gifted,
[00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:18.220]   and I don't know what they can test
[00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:19.780]   with giftedness at that age,
[00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:21.400]   other than can they sit down and listen
[00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:23.360]   for hours to a teacher teach.
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:26.480]   I'm sure many of you have your own stories,
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:29.300]   and you've seen this or you've experienced it.
[00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:32.960]   A more extreme example that I have
[00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:33.980]   is a number of years ago,
[00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:35.820]   my friend was teaching in one of these
[00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:37.900]   international private schools in Hong Kong,
[00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:39.620]   and they do these tours.
[00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:41.900]   Parents can come and they can check out the school,
[00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:43.820]   and one of these parents,
[00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:45.540]   or who they thought was a parent,
[00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:48.060]   was this lady coming on her own,
[00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:50.140]   and she was part of the tour,
[00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:51.300]   and it was found out later on
[00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:54.660]   that not only did she not have a child yet,
[00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:56.680]   she wasn't even married.
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:58.420]   She was preparing that far in advance
[00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:01.980]   because it was so stressful to think about this topic,
[00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:04.860]   and they had to plan ahead because it's so competitive.
[00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:08.980]   And educational craze and demand in Hong Kong
[00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:11.540]   has fueled an extremely lucrative industry
[00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:12.980]   in tutoring centers in Hong Kong.
[00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:15.300]   We actually have some of these in Bridgeport.
[00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:17.220]   Some of you might have your kids there.
[00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:18.980]   I'm not gonna blame you.
[00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:21.560]   But I don't know any other place other than Hong Kong
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:24.540]   where we have these tutor gods, these bozafsan.
[00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:28.060]   They are individuals who have supposedly mastered
[00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:32.060]   the art of passing high school and college entrance exams,
[00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:33.500]   and they make millions of dollars.
[00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:34.380]   They're celebrities.
[00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:37.900]   Their faces are all over billboards and on buses,
[00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:41.060]   and they're on TV, and it's crazy.
[00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:42.740]   But I believe this actually is grounded
[00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:45.060]   in our Confucian culture,
[00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:48.260]   the Confucian-based imperial civil exams.
[00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:52.100]   There's this long tradition from the 600s to the 1900s
[00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:56.420]   where anybody in society, if they could pass this test,
[00:18:56.420 --> 00:19:00.900]   they can jump through the ladder in society
[00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:02.900]   and do very, very well.
[00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:05.140]   And I've seen this historical influence
[00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:06.500]   in a lot of these Asian churches,
[00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:08.700]   in Singaporean churches, in Korean churches,
[00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:10.260]   in Chinese churches.
[00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:13.780]   And it bleeds into what we require educationally
[00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:16.500]   for candidates that can serve in our churches.
[00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:18.660]   I've seen some job postings for youth pastors
[00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:21.780]   where you shouldn't apply unless you have,
[00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:24.540]   unless you're pursuing a master's in divinity, right?
[00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:27.900]   Or you can only apply to be a pastor or senior pastor
[00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:31.060]   if you have your PhD or if you're getting your DEM in,
[00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:31.900]   right?
[00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:33.860]   Knowledge is a priority.
[00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:37.500]   But being empathetic, pastoral in nature,
[00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:39.780]   a good leader, or even caring about people,
[00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:41.500]   that might not even be listed, right?
[00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:43.420]   Like that, there's a disconnect there.
[00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:47.860]   These restrictive educational requirements that we have
[00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:50.900]   can be our organizational yokes.
[00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:54.020]   And I wonder if Jesus applied to some of these jobs today,
[00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:57.340]   if he would be considered as the carpenter's son, right,
[00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:58.940]   as his main vocation.
[00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:03.420]   We're also a culture of very industrious people, right,
[00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:06.380]   as immigrants or children of immigrants.
[00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:11.380]   And this infiltrates how we do church sometimes.
[00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:13.900]   Like there's a busyness that gets translated
[00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:15.660]   into how we do church.
[00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:18.100]   And we have program after program,
[00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:21.180]   study after study, event after event.
[00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:23.860]   It's like we're working our way towards salvation.
[00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:27.340]   And Sunday Sabbath can actually feel not restful.
[00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:29.900]   And that just isn't right, nor is it biblical.
[00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:34.060]   I value education.
[00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:36.140]   I value strong work ethic.
[00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:37.820]   And these are attributes that I want my own children
[00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:39.100]   to learn.
[00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:44.100]   Wisdom and hard work are praised virtues in the Bible.
[00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:48.460]   Blessed is the one whose delight is in the law of the Lord
[00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:50.900]   and meditates on his law day and night.
[00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:55.140]   Good planning and hard work lead to prosperity.
[00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:57.140]   But hasty shortcuts lead to poverty.
[00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:02.340]   We need to ensure that these virtues don't become
[00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:05.460]   organizational limiters, organizational yokes for us.
[00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:08.540]   That we don't see them as a means and the measurement
[00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:10.380]   of what a greater church is built on.
[00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:13.900]   Putting on these yokes causes us to lose focus
[00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:17.180]   and lose dependency on God's grace and mercy.
[00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:18.460]   Substituting it with a sense of control
[00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:20.740]   that we can have ourselves.
[00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:23.300]   Our motivation needs to be grounded in the community
[00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:26.820]   of faith and love that is authentic and intentional,
[00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:28.220]   the same way that Jesus is.
[00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:32.220]   Are we caring for the brothers and sisters around us?
[00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:34.340]   Are we caring for the community,
[00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:36.580]   for the people in our community?
[00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:39.340]   Or are we creating a safe bubble for us to just be in?
[00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:44.860]   I know I'm ruffling some feathers here.
[00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:46.820]   I'm causing discomfort for some folks,
[00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:48.620]   maybe most folks here.
[00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:50.860]   And I would probably too if I was in the audience
[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:51.980]   and I ended here.
[00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:54.660]   'Cause it sounds like, hey, it sounds like Brian
[00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:58.660]   is saying we should have no yokes, no rules.
[00:21:58.660 --> 00:21:59.540]   I'm not saying that at all.
[00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:02.860]   I'm not advocating for liberation from any constraints.
[00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:04.980]   Far from it, we need yokes.
[00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:08.140]   Without rules and structure, there would be chaos.
[00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:11.260]   And we as Asians, of course, like rules.
[00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:13.420]   It's why I think distribution-wise,
[00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:16.980]   we tend to have more people in the areas of engineering
[00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:19.540]   or the sciences or accounting,
[00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:21.940]   because they're grounded in very clear rules.
[00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:25.420]   But we need to remember that our strengths
[00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:27.300]   often have a mirror side to them.
[00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:28.780]   They're usually our weakness as well,
[00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:30.860]   and we shouldn't be blindsided by them.
[00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:34.140]   Sometimes adhering to the rules can be to a fault,
[00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:36.260]   where we stop questioning why they exist.
[00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:40.100]   What I want to emphasize is that we need to know
[00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:42.500]   what the true rules are,
[00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:45.700]   instead of adding in our own salt and vinegar,
[00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:49.780]   adding our gacho, right, into what we expect
[00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:52.580]   church needs to be like and how we operate within them.
[00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:54.740]   (silence)
[00:22:54.740 --> 00:23:01.180]   We should see ourselves with a lightened yoke.
[00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:04.980]   So, not with no rules, but with the lightened yoke.
[00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:10.460]   The end of our passage ends with James, Jesus' brother,
[00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:13.260]   the leader of the Jerusalem church,
[00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:15.860]   that says that things shouldn't be made difficult
[00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:17.740]   for the Gentiles coming to Christ,
[00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:21.100]   but they should still be instructed to abstain from food
[00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:24.220]   polluted by idols, from sexual immorality,
[00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:26.020]   and from the meat of strangled animals,
[00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:27.660]   from blood, and from blood.
[00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:30.860]   After everything I said before,
[00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:31.820]   some of you reading this will say,
[00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:33.420]   "Hey, this sure sounds like
[00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:35.980]   "we should still be doing a lot of stuff."
[00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:39.700]   And in the legal field, there is what's considered
[00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:42.860]   the letter of the law and the spirit of the law.
[00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:45.300]   The letter of the law is kind of our direct,
[00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:48.540]   very superficial, quick reading of the law.
[00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:49.780]   It's very literal.
[00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:51.860]   But the spirit of the law is actually what the heart
[00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:53.620]   of the law is meant to promote.
[00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:57.500]   Using maybe the speed limit, for example,
[00:23:57.500 --> 00:23:59.580]   we can see that when you learn to drive,
[00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:02.980]   you're taught that you should not exceed the speed limit.
[00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:05.900]   But as you actually start to drive yourself,
[00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:09.060]   there's this idea of what's called the flow of traffic.
[00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:10.500]   You follow the flow of traffic,
[00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:12.140]   and that flow of traffic might be faster
[00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:14.620]   than the speed limit, or it could be significantly slower
[00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:17.460]   than the speed limit, but you follow the flow of traffic
[00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:20.980]   because the heart of the law is actually to maintain safety
[00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:23.020]   for yourself and for everyone around you.
[00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:27.740]   The biblical law is meant to serve as a guide
[00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:30.900]   for us to understand what it takes to be holy,
[00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:34.300]   and to understand we are unable to fulfill it ourselves.
[00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:36.700]   Jesus said that he did not come to abolish the law
[00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:39.020]   or the prophets, he came to fulfill them.
[00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:44.140]   God sent Jesus because we can't do it ourselves.
[00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:47.260]   He came as a perfect being to follow the law,
[00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:50.460]   perfectly, and to highlight that it is by God's grace
[00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:53.460]   through Jesus that we can become saved
[00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:55.140]   and strive to be holy.
[00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:57.180]   Following him is the way to go.
[00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:01.060]   The end of the passage here in Acts is really prescribing us
[00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:05.060]   to operate with a mind to be holy,
[00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:08.820]   holiness that is spiritual, holiness that is sexual,
[00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:11.300]   holiness that is nutritional or bodily.
[00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:14.220]   The instructions are still to maintain
[00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:17.180]   basic standards of holiness, but not to the degree
[00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:20.340]   where it becomes a checklist to save ourselves.
[00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:23.140]   And you know what?
[00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:26.340]   Like, these are practices that non-believers can identify
[00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:28.420]   as distinguishing marks of the believing community,
[00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:31.740]   and why James still prescribes these rules
[00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:33.900]   for those to follow, because he mentions that
[00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:36.060]   it's been told for a long time
[00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:38.340]   that this is what the Jewish community does.
[00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:41.940]   The Christian faith is an invitation from Jesus
[00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:44.180]   to become part of God's family.
[00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:47.620]   It's also a lifelong journey to become more like him,
[00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:50.340]   to be set apart, to be holy.
[00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:52.100]   The process is not meant to cause us
[00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:54.540]   to feel like we're drowning in rules,
[00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:56.660]   where in our individual and church lives,
[00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:59.260]   the rules have become our masters,
[00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:00.420]   and like the trained elephants,
[00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:03.340]   we're afraid to step out of bounds.
[00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:06.340]   The rules themselves are guardrails for us,
[00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:08.660]   so that we don't recklessly charge ahead
[00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:10.460]   to our own harm or to others' harm.
[00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:15.380]   Jesus provides us a lightened yoke, an easier path.
[00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:20.100]   It is a path ahead that is full of forgiveness and grace,
[00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:22.740]   for he has bore the burden of the law.
[00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:24.780]   We have to just open our eyes
[00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:26.860]   and see what the new reality actually is.
[00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:32.340]   Again, I said, no, I didn't pay Mirs
[00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:33.820]   to say the verse that she did,
[00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:37.300]   but it's actually in my slide as well.
[00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:38.420]   And Jesus says, "Come to me,
[00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:40.420]   "all you who are weary and burdened,
[00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:42.060]   "and I will give you rest.
[00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:44.620]   "Take my yoke upon you and learn from me,
[00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:47.180]   "for I am gentle and humble in heart,
[00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:49.260]   "and you will find rest for your souls.
[00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:52.420]   "For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light."
[00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:56.340]   Jesus does the heavy lifting so we don't have to.
[00:26:56.340 --> 00:27:00.220]   Make sure to put on the lighter yoke,
[00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:03.220]   and maybe feel free to wear some flip-flops at church as well.
[00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:04.460]   (audience laughing)
[00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:05.460]   Thank you.
[00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:07.300]   Let me just end in prayer really quickly.
[00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:10.180]   Heavenly Father, we just thank you
[00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:13.420]   for Jesus, we thank you that he came to this world
[00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:15.740]   so that we can have a lighter yoke,
[00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:18.260]   that we will not feel crushed by the rules
[00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:21.140]   that we feel we need to follow to become saved,
[00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:24.420]   and that you extend that freely through your grace,
[00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:26.340]   through Christ's sacrifice.
[00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:27.900]   Bless us as we leave here,
[00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:30.140]   and help us to reflect on what might be
[00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:31.540]   our individual yokes,
[00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:33.900]   and what might be our organizational yokes.
[00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:35.220]   And let us feel freedom,
[00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:37.460]   freedom in your grace and your mercy.
[00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:39.340]   In your son's name we pray, amen.
