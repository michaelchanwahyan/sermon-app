[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:08.680]   - Thank you so much for having me back.
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.840]   It's good to see everybody.
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.260]   And actually the group is larger
[00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:13.860]   than the last time I was here.
[00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.120]   I didn't look back behind me.
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.500]   We know when I was sitting in the front row
[00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.000]   to see what was happening behind me.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.280]   But one thing I noticed that's kind of interesting
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.280]   about churches is that the most desirable seat in a church
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.040]   is usually in the back row.
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.160]   I don't know why that is.
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.600]   And the reason I think I was thinking about that is,
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.360]   you know, this morning when I saw Rachel,
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.720]   she was wearing this Cornelius Street shirt
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.040]   and I don't know anything about Cornelius Street.
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.040]   She shared the reference with me about Taylor Swift.
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.400]   And the sermon's not about her, so don't worry.
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.720]   But I thought about, you know, when I was younger,
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.320]   I used to go to a lot of rock concerts too.
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.940]   And I know it's still the case
[00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.940]   that the most desirable seat, the most expensive seat,
[00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:06.280]   the best seat in the house is in the front row, right?
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.560]   You wanna be as close to the action as possible.
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.000]   You don't wanna have to look at
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.640]   what's happening through binoculars.
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.320]   I did that once at a theater, at a live theater,
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.920]   and I was like, this is the worst experience ever.
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.380]   You know, I'll never do this again.
[00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.680]   If I can't get a good seat,
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.560]   I'm not gonna go to the theater.
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.840]   So I would encourage you,
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.280]   if you're used to being in the last row,
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.320]   check out the action in the front row, okay?
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.300]   At least try it, okay?
[00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.120]   So let's go to God's word first.
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.800]   And the passage we're looking at
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.920]   is a very familiar passage.
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.000]   And it's in Matthew 6, chapter 33 to 34.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.960]   And this is what it says.
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.600]   But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.760]   and all these things will be given to you as well.
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.100]   Therefore, do not worry about tomorrow,
[00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.980]   for tomorrow will worry about itself.
[00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.740]   Each day has enough trouble of its own.
[00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:12.320]   So I wanna thank you for coming together as the UV family.
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.700]   You know, there's a lot of things
[00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.640]   you could probably be doing this afternoon,
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.160]   but you are here.
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.520]   And I believe that you are at the right place
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.560]   at the right time, and that God has brought you here
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.860]   because not only is the Lord here
[00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.040]   to receive worship from you,
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.460]   but he has something he wants to give you.
[00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.880]   He has something he wants to give you.
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.880]   And so I hope we'll approach our hour or so together
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.720]   with this attitude of seeking Lord,
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.460]   what is it you have for me today?
[00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.660]   So let's pray.
[00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.340]   So we do ask you, Lord, what is it you have for us today?
[00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.020]   We have tried to bring you our worship,
[00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.460]   bring you our very best, even in our tithes and offerings,
[00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.060]   in the way that we serve one another
[00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.700]   and serve our community, we do it for you.
[00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.100]   We are bringing our best to you.
[00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.300]   But Lord, thank you that you are a God
[00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.940]   who is open-handed, that you're not stingy,
[00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.520]   but you are generous.
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:27.860]   In fact, we say you show us amazing grace
[00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.000]   because you give us better than we deserve.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.980]   And so we ask you, what do you have for us today, Lord?
[00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.300]   Not only are we your servants, but we are your children
[00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.940]   before a wonderful heavenly father.
[00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.780]   And we are ready to receive from you.
[00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.140]   Open our ears, our hearts are open too.
[00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.620]   And we pray that you will give to us
[00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.180]   so that we can bring you even more glory.
[00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.900]   We pray in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.220]   So you know, friends, it's no secret,
[00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.220]   we've been living in a age, a time, a season of life
[00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.220]   that is so filled with problems, so many stresses,
[00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.340]   so many troubles, worries, so many things
[00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.020]   that can cause fear.
[00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:24.060]   And you know, I'm not gonna tire you with the list
[00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.340]   of all the things that we're sharing together.
[00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:33.700]   And as much as the season has all these problems
[00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.900]   and troubles, all these things that might cause us
[00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.900]   to worry and be afraid, that doesn't even count.
[00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.780]   Like, what are you experiencing?
[00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.400]   What are your unique sets of problems?
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.560]   Problems, needs, desires?
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.080]   What's stressing you out?
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.160]   What's causing you to lose sleep?
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.480]   What's causing you to wring your hands
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.120]   and wonder what's next?
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:07.800]   And I wanna tell you, Jesus has an answer for you.
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.840]   It's in verse 34.
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.360]   And it says, Jesus said,
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.920]   "Therefore do not worry about tomorrow,
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.200]   "for tomorrow will worry about itself.
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.680]   "Each day has trouble of its own."
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.400]   Doesn't that bless you?
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.840]   That's enough, right?
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.920]   We can just pack it up and go home now.
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.620]   'Cause Jesus said, "Don't worry."
[00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:35.400]   You know, by itself, this verse actually sounds pretty cold,
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.900]   brutally cold.
[00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.660]   Like, Jesus is, it sounds like he's saying, like,
[00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.440]   "Come on, just get over it.
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.720]   "Don't worry."
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   But see, it's not a verse that just stands by itself
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.160]   or a sentence that stands by itself.
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.240]   It is in the context of something bigger.
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.760]   And like any good Bible student,
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.240]   we should be concerned about context, right?
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.200]   We already know how dangerous it is
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.640]   to hear a piece of news out of context
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.600]   and think, "Oh, I understand what's going on."
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.320]   But we may have no idea what's actually going on,
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.160]   what the person actually meant when they said it, right?
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.840]   But in context, we get the picture
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.320]   of what is the person saying?
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.960]   So we don't wanna just go with a soundbite from Jesus.
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.120]   We wanna hear what is his message for us today?
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.800]   So we gotta look at the verse before.
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:40.980]   And it says, "But seek first the kingdom of God,
[00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.920]   "or seek first his kingdom and his righteousness
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.280]   "and all these things will be given to you as well."
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.520]   So let's kind of unpack this going backwards
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.760]   as we've already done, starting with verse 34,
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.240]   and then go to verse 33,
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.720]   which is really gonna be our key text today.
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.960]   With all that we're experiencing,
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:06.400]   verse 33, Jesus tries to center us.
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.160]   He tries to prioritize us.
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.860]   And even though he starts by saying,
[00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:14.840]   "Seek first his kingdom and his righteousness,
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.080]   "I know everybody's attention went to,
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.600]   "and all these things will be added to you," right?
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.620]   So let's get that out of the way
[00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.760]   so that you're not distracted by the whole time
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.280]   wondering what are all these things
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.000]   that he's gonna give me, right?
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.400]   So let's go through it.
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.880]   And again, in context,
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:39.480]   we are in the midst of Jesus' Sermon on the Mount.
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.780]   It began in chapter five.
[00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:45.260]   And in the beginning of chapter five,
[00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.460]   it starts with Jesus promising
[00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:51.540]   that God our Father has a response.
[00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:53.940]   He's not sitting idly and quietly
[00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:55.380]   and hiding in the shadows,
[00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:59.140]   but he has a response for those who are poor,
[00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:02.180]   those who mourn, those who are gentle,
[00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:04.780]   who seek righteousness or justice,
[00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:08.280]   who need mercy, who desire to be pure in heart,
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.540]   who desire peace, who are persecuted.
[00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:13.480]   God has a response.
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:16.620]   God has something for us.
[00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:19.260]   We find that in the Beatitudes, as we call them.
[00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.520]   And then there's this big section
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:25.860]   that covers from chapter five through chapter six,
[00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:28.120]   and it has to do with our spirituality,
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.840]   our relationship with God.
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:33.780]   And so he covers the law,
[00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:36.460]   spiritual disciplines like piety,
[00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:39.140]   generosity, fasting, and prayer.
[00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:43.700]   He talks about how should our attitude be about wealth.
[00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:44.980]   So spiritual disciplines.
[00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:49.580]   And then finally, he covers basic necessities.
[00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:53.040]   Basic necessities.
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:57.020]   Concerns about food, water, clothing,
[00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:00.060]   survival, a longer life.
[00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:03.340]   And are any of these of concern for you?
[00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:08.060]   Are any of these things that keep you up at night?
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:12.820]   You know, most of us in America,
[00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:15.020]   you know, we don't miss any meals.
[00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:18.860]   We're not, unless, I guess, unless we're on a diet
[00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:20.540]   and we choose to miss a meal.
[00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:24.380]   Nobody is really going thirsty.
[00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:27.980]   You know, water is so readily available, fresh, clean water.
[00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:33.060]   And then nobody's walking around naked
[00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:35.380]   unless they decide to do that, right?
[00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:38.780]   It's not for lack of clothing.
[00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:42.020]   And yet there are people all over the world
[00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:46.620]   who are struggling with these concerns every day.
[00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:49.100]   And not to mention all the other ones,
[00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:51.300]   starting from the beginning of chapter five.
[00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:55.140]   And I just did a quick Google search
[00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:56.740]   and I just asked the question,
[00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:04.820]   is food insecurity better or worse?
[00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:08.000]   Is it getting better or worse today?
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.980]   And I was surprised with all the attention to ending hunger,
[00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:15.860]   that according to Google,
[00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:19.540]   food insecurity is getting worse in the world.
[00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:24.940]   And then I thought, you know, I'll ask one more question.
[00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:28.900]   Is abject poverty, that's extreme poverty,
[00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:32.260]   is it getting better or worse in the world?
[00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:33.780]   And I was surprised again.
[00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:36.620]   It's getting worse.
[00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:42.780]   Approximately 10% of the world is hungry.
[00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:47.820]   About 10% of the world is facing abject poverty.
[00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:53.500]   Wow, this is a word from Jesus.
[00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.980]   And I think this speaks not only to us
[00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:58.860]   and all the needs and worries we have, but to the world.
[00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:02.240]   So let's be ready to receive this.
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:08.240]   So Jesus says in chapter six, verse 25 to 32,
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:11.720]   he says, don't worry about your life.
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:14.480]   You know, I should ask, how many people remember the last,
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.240]   who was here the last time I came to visit?
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:18.200]   Any hands?
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:19.680]   Only Pastor Mark, everybody else?
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:20.600]   Okay, just a few people.
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.320]   So I wanna ask our worship leader,
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.680]   do you remember what I preached on last time?
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.280]   Okay, I'm just kidding.
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:29.680]   I had to look it up
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:31.320]   'cause I couldn't remember what I preached on.
[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.040]   I just, I look it up because I wanna make sure
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.280]   I don't preach the same message again
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.640]   and just because that sometimes happens, right?
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:42.880]   But I preached on a text that was earlier,
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.320]   right before this text.
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:50.120]   And I didn't intentionally choose this text today,
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:51.280]   thinking, oh, you know,
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:54.040]   because I preached on the section before,
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.320]   it'd be natural to preach on.
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:57.440]   It just, this is something that the Lord
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.960]   has just laid on my heart.
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.960]   And, but the last time I preached,
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.880]   I talked about how our heavenly Father
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:08.600]   knows our needs before we even ask.
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:12.720]   That was basically the gist of the message.
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:15.040]   And that Jesus is saying,
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:17.440]   don't worry about your life and what you need.
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.800]   Don't be like the Gentiles who are fixated
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.920]   and consumed with the pursuit of these things.
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:25.720]   All these things that cause this universal worry
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:29.960]   and stress on our lives.
[00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:35.280]   Jesus was speaking to a largely Jewish audience.
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:36.640]   So it would have been,
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.720]   he's saying, don't be like the Gentiles,
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:41.000]   like the rest of the nations or the pagans,
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.360]   the idol worshipers.
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.600]   Don't be like them who worship dead gods.
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.280]   Today, if he was saying it,
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:48.720]   it might sound more like,
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:52.680]   you are worshipers of a living God.
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:57.760]   So behave like people who have a living God,
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:03.560]   who actually hears what you need,
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:06.840]   but also already knows what you need.
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:10.040]   And because he loves you and he is gracious,
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.640]   he's already at work.
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:15.520]   He's already on the job,
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:18.320]   taking care of what we need.
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:22.160]   God's got this.
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.600]   Know with certainty,
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:28.400]   God loves you and he's taking care of you.
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:31.960]   So don't be distracted by these things.
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:35.960]   Don't be distracted by concerns for things
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:40.040]   that our loving and capable father
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.320]   can already take care of.
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:47.080]   Instead, seek first the kingdom of God.
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:50.640]   Seek first his kingdom and his righteousness
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:53.360]   and all these other things will be taken care of,
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:55.400]   will be provided for you.
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.400]   So what does it mean then to seek something first?
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.800]   I mean, this might seem really like kind of pedantic,
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.600]   you're like, why say it?
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.040]   But I think it needs to be said
[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:05.640]   'cause it's in the text, right?
[00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:07.640]   What does it mean to seek something first?
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:09.920]   It has to do with, it speaks with,
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:13.280]   what is your greatest passion and desire,
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:17.800]   your most important, highest priority pursuits?
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:23.880]   What are you intentionally chasing after
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:27.440]   with the most determination and fixation?
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:30.720]   Think about that.
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:34.560]   What are you chasing after?
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:37.360]   With everything you've got,
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:39.280]   in your heart you've said to yourself,
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:43.060]   I must do this, I must have this,
[00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:46.280]   this is worthy of whatever it takes.
[00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:48.320]   What is that thing?
[00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:53.240]   And so many of us, especially we got a young audience here,
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:57.200]   we're thinking about our education and our careers,
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.120]   finding the love of our lives,
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:02.360]   building a family, paying the bills.
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:05.440]   Maybe it goes a little farther
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:10.440]   and you're consumed with, I must be wealthy one day.
[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:16.140]   I must have this kind of house or this kind of watch.
[00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:17.760]   I must have these things.
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:22.640]   Is that what consumes your whatever it takes?
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:24.880]   I must have this, I must do this.
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:34.000]   Jesus says, seek first his kingdom and his righteousness
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.360]   so that everything else will be provided for you.
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:43.280]   And so what is the kingdom?
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:49.280]   The Bible and the New Testament talks about the kingdom
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:52.880]   in so many ways, Jesus talks about it often in parables.
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:55.280]   And he says, the kingdom is like yeast.
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:59.240]   It permeates and it penetrates.
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.280]   And it's not something you can simply point at
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:02.760]   and say like, there it is.
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:06.300]   Or look, here it is.
[00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:10.440]   Because the kingdom of God is also in our midst.
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:12.140]   It's like the air that we breathe.
[00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:15.640]   It's present even when we don't recognize it,
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:19.200]   it's present even when we refuse to see it or acknowledge it
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:24.120]   even when we insist on denying it,
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.640]   the kingdom of God is there.
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:30.000]   We behold the miracles of God and the kingdom is there.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.880]   The kingdom of God grows and bears fruit
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:40.480]   and the kingdom bears the fruit with or without us.
[00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:44.360]   With or without us.
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:48.480]   The kingdom might seem small to some
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:51.760]   and so hard to notice,
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:54.480]   but the kingdom of God is also so big,
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:57.920]   so much bigger than anything we could imagine.
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:02.400]   You know that we're told the kingdom of God
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:08.040]   is evidenced by the side effects.
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:11.600]   When we see certain characteristics,
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:13.920]   we know that the kingdom of God is there,
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.960]   just like when we see the wind blow,
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:17.280]   we know the wind is there.
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:19.840]   Or when we see the leaves move, we know the wind is there.
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:22.280]   Or when we see certain signs in the weather,
[00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:25.160]   we know that seasons are changing.
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:31.480]   And then we're also told we have to receive it like a child
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.280]   and unless someone is born again,
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:36.520]   they cannot see the kingdom of God.
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:39.000]   Jesus, John the Baptist and the apostles
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.560]   spent a lot of time talking about the kingdom of God.
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:46.240]   So what is the kingdom of God?
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:51.920]   I like easy.
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:54.160]   So I'm gonna boil it down,
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:57.560]   maybe as much as that you can possibly boil something down.
[00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:59.760]   Somebody once said, this isn't mine,
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:02.720]   but when I heard it, I said, I'm gonna use that
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.080]   because that makes sense to me
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:07.360]   'cause I'm not smart, that's easy.
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:08.720]   You know what it is?
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:13.600]   They said, whenever you see God get his way,
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.200]   you're seeing the kingdom of God.
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:19.400]   Did you get that?
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.080]   Whenever God gets his way,
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:23.200]   it's the kingdom of God you're seeing.
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:26.520]   So when you make a decision, I'm not gonna do it my way,
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:28.440]   but I'm gonna do it God's way,
[00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.040]   that's the kingdom of God at work.
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:35.640]   When you see somebody choose God and not something else,
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.720]   we're seeing the kingdom of God at play.
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:46.680]   When the king gets his way, we see his kingdom.
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:55.320]   There are literally thousands, no, millions
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:59.080]   of books, articles, sermons, lessons
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:01.880]   that have been taught on this and written on this,
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:07.520]   but it's when God gets his way.
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:14.000]   Are you seeking first that God would get his way
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.400]   in your life?
[00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:16.920]   'Cause that's where it starts.
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:22.880]   God, I am surrendering right now.
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:24.360]   I'm not gonna hang on to anything,
[00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:29.360]   I'm letting it all go and saying, have your way in me.
[00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:33.360]   That's hard.
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:36.280]   It's hard to let it all go and say,
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:39.160]   I'm gonna seek your kingdom first.
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:45.480]   And then, are you praying that people around you,
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:50.480]   your friends, your family, your boss, your neighbors,
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.200]   are you praying that the people around you,
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:57.200]   your church, would have God's way,
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:59.520]   that they would choose God?
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:03.520]   I mean, isn't that what we're praying
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:06.520]   when we're praying for our brother
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:09.200]   who doesn't know Jesus yet?
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:11.280]   God, would you save him?
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:12.720]   And what is that?
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:15.040]   Have your way, God, with my brother.
[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:18.080]   And then how about the rest of the world?
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:20.280]   When we see wars and rumors of war
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:23.200]   and we're praying for what's happening here or there,
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:26.480]   when we're hearing about people who are hungry
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:31.320]   or naked or who are exposed and vulnerable
[00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:33.200]   and we're praying for all the things
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.240]   that are going on in the world,
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:35.600]   is that not God?
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.400]   Would you please have your way?
[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:40.760]   Do what only you can do.
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:44.720]   That's the kingdom of God.
[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:49.480]   So seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness.
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:54.320]   And for most of chapter five, Jesus talks about the law.
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:58.080]   The law, the rules which make up
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:01.080]   the measuring stick of righteousness.
[00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:04.000]   And the rules which govern people's lives
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.640]   and their relationship and their standing with God.
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:12.800]   So you know the Jews, they lived and breathed the law.
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:16.280]   They lived and breathed the law.
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:22.160]   They were fixated on it, they were just engrossed in it.
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:25.360]   They were obsessed with the law of God.
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:28.040]   613 of them in the Old Testament.
[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:35.440]   Doing everything possible to not violate any laws,
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:38.080]   to obey and observe the laws.
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:45.280]   And the law was also a heavy burden
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:48.880]   because it affected everything in their lives.
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:53.440]   It had something to say about every aspect of their lives.
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:57.200]   And so I don't know about you, when you think of the law,
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:00.800]   even the law as you understand it in the Bible,
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:03.360]   do you feel like, man, you know,
[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.360]   I'm pretty good at this obedience thing.
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:08.800]   Tap yourself in the back.
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:10.760]   Good job, John.
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:14.680]   Or maybe you're the kind of beats yourself up every day.
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:19.240]   And you're counting all the ways that you've failed,
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:21.080]   all the ways you've disappointed God,
[00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:22.440]   you've broken the law.
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:32.000]   Jesus has a bomb to drop on us.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   I wanna say it's like a cluster bomb.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.520]   'Cause there's at least three things,
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:41.320]   three explosions that are gonna go off in our heads,
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:42.720]   in our hearts.
[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:44.320]   And the first one is this.
[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:48.240]   That when it concerns the law, Jesus says,
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:50.560]   "Do not presume," and he says this back
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:52.300]   in chapter five, verse 17,
[00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:56.160]   "Do not presume I came to abolish the law and the prophets."
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:01.600]   So it's a heavy burden.
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:03.400]   Jesus came to save us.
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:06.720]   Take off our heaviest burden, Lord.
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:10.000]   Take the law, would you just eradicate the law?
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.120]   If we don't have the law,
[00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:13.360]   then man, I wouldn't feel guilty anymore.
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:16.200]   I wouldn't have to constantly be measuring myself.
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:18.600]   But guess what?
[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:21.720]   Jesus says, "I didn't come to get rid of the law.
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:25.560]   "I came, didn't come to abolish the law."
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:28.240]   Then he gives us bomb number two.
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.880]   And he says, "I came to fulfill the law.
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:36.700]   "There is no one else who has made such an audacious claim.
[00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:42.480]   "I am here to completely fulfill this law.
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:46.320]   "Obey it perfectly, observe it perfectly."
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:53.600]   So don't even try to mess with the law.
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.600]   This law, which is the air and the atmosphere
[00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:59.080]   of the Jewish experience, the religious leaders,
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:00.520]   the teachers of the law,
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:03.240]   they led and they maintained the standard.
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:06.260]   They knew God was holy.
[00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:09.060]   And they also knew, they did know
[00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:12.880]   that the law was virtually impossible to keep.
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:17.440]   So you could say they would even mess with God's law
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:20.760]   by creating more rules and laws around the law.
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:22.320]   So kind of figuring, you know,
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:25.640]   if mom says, "Don't touch this little screen here,"
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:26.480]   then what do you do?
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:27.660]   You put a fence around it.
[00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:31.080]   So there's no way you can reach that.
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:34.420]   There's no way you could violate that rule.
[00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:38.400]   So they'd create these fences, these hedges around the law.
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:44.300]   The religious leaders interpreted the law for everybody.
[00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:48.860]   The teachers drew the boundaries around it.
[00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:51.600]   The judges determined how to interpret it.
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:54.960]   The priests set the bar, the standard of obedience
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.720]   and what righteousness looks like.
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:59.720]   And even though we tend to remember them
[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:03.160]   for their hypocrisy, I submit to you
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:06.040]   that better than anybody else,
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:08.640]   they tried to obey the law.
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:12.420]   They were the best law keepers.
[00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:16.100]   That is until Jesus came.
[00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:19.960]   As far as human effort goes,
[00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:22.560]   nobody was more successful when it came to the law.
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:28.480]   But here is the biggest bomb of all.
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:31.200]   Because we do look up to certain people, right?
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:33.000]   Like, do you look up to Pastor Mark?
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.600]   And, you know, when it comes to,
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:36.560]   maybe you're like, you know,
[00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:39.980]   I don't wanna be wealthy like Pastor Mark,
[00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:43.560]   but I do wanna be spiritual and godly like Pastor Mark.
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:46.580]   Maybe that's, you know, how you look at it.
[00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:49.700]   I wish I dressed better like Pastor Mark does.
[00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:55.500]   See, we hold people up as like,
[00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:57.160]   gosh, that's something to aim for.
[00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:58.820]   I wanna be like that.
[00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:04.320]   And the Jewish people basically held up the priests,
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:07.300]   the teachers of the law, the Pharisees and the Sadducees
[00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:10.560]   as these are the people we're gonna emulate.
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:13.980]   And what does Jesus say?
[00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:16.860]   In verse 20 of chapter five,
[00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:21.860]   "For I say to you, unless your righteousness surpasses
[00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:24.500]   "that of the scribes and Pharisees,
[00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:26.420]   "the experts in the law,
[00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:29.080]   "you will not enter the kingdom of heaven."
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:32.740]   Did you hear that?
[00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:36.220]   Unless you are more righteous than Mark Chan,
[00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:38.740]   you will not enter the kingdom of God.
[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:44.060]   Unless you are more righteous than Billy Graham,
[00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:46.500]   you will not enter the kingdom of God.
[00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:48.180]   You can put anybody's name on that list,
[00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:52.300]   any great Pharisee, any great teacher of the law,
[00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:56.620]   and if your righteousness doesn't surpass that, you've failed.
[00:26:56.620 --> 00:27:01.120]   Not that if you will just meet it,
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:04.120]   but even if you can't exceed it,
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:06.320]   if you can't surpass them.
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:10.380]   So, you know, one of the most righteous Jews
[00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:14.820]   in the New Testament is the Pharisee, Saul.
[00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:19.820]   Later, after an encounter with Jesus,
[00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:21.740]   his name changed to Paul,
[00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:25.340]   and again, one of the most righteous men on the planet
[00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:27.560]   says this about his former self.
[00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:29.980]   And it's in Philippians chapter four.
[00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:31.100]   I don't know if you wanna turn there,
[00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:31.940]   but I'll read it to you,
[00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:34.620]   and you know, maybe that'll make it easier to even listen.
[00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:35.620]   He says in verse four,
[00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:37.460]   "If someone else thinks they have reasons
[00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:39.360]   "to put confidence in the flesh,
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:42.120]   "that's human ability for righteousness,
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:43.300]   "I have more."
[00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:45.340]   I have more confidence.
[00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:48.480]   "I'm circumcised on the eighth day of the people of Israel,
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:51.060]   "of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews,
[00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:52.560]   "and so far,"
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:54.380]   do you notice everything on that list
[00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:56.820]   is nothing that he had any control over?
[00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:59.560]   Did you notice that?
[00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:01.780]   Circumcised on the eighth day.
[00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:04.620]   So, I mean, like no baby says,
[00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:07.820]   "Dad, we got an appointment, eight days,
[00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:09.340]   "time for circumcision."
[00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:13.020]   And he had no choice.
[00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:17.140]   There was nobody who said,
[00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:17.980]   "You know what?
[00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:21.520]   "Let's make sure that Saul is born to Israel."
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:24.380]   He didn't control that either.
[00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:28.300]   That he's born in the tribe of Benjamin.
[00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:30.740]   He didn't choose that.
[00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:35.680]   Hebrew of Hebrews, he didn't choose that.
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:38.560]   But then in regards to the law, he says,
[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:40.500]   "I'm a Pharisee."
[00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:42.980]   As for zeal, that means passion.
[00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:46.980]   I persecuted the church.
[00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:51.980]   As for righteousness, based on the law, I am faultless.
[00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:56.800]   That's what Saul, Paul says about his former self.
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:00.680]   And yet, what does he conclude about this old self
[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:04.140]   that looked so enviable to everybody else around him?
[00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:06.740]   Like, "I wanna be Saul."
[00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:08.520]   He says, "But whatever were gains to me,
[00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:11.680]   "I now consider them loss for the sake of Christ.
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:13.820]   "What is more, I consider everything a loss
[00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:15.860]   "because of the surpassing worth
[00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:18.420]   "of knowing Christ, Jesus my Lord,
[00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:20.660]   "for whose sake I have lost all things.
[00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:23.740]   "I consider them garbage,
[00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:25.720]   "that I may gain Christ and be found in him,
[00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:27.680]   "not having a righteousness of my own
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:29.700]   "that comes from the law,
[00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:32.920]   "but that which is through faith in Jesus Christ."
[00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:36.560]   Not the law, but a righteousness that comes
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:38.200]   through faith in Jesus Christ.
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:41.160]   The righteousness that comes from Jesus Christ,
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:42.760]   the righteousness that comes from God
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:44.280]   on the basis of faith.
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:46.040]   I want to know Christ, yes,
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:48.400]   to know the power of his resurrection
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:50.560]   and participation in his sufferings,
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:52.080]   becoming like him in his death,
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:55.340]   and so somehow, attaining to the resurrection from the dead.
[00:29:55.340 --> 00:30:00.340]   Paul says, "I'm not gonna pursue the righteousness
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:03.780]   "of even the holiest of men."
[00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:10.340]   I'm not gonna accept that as the standard.
[00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:12.160]   Why?
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:13.700]   Because that is not God's standard.
[00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:17.620]   I will pursue God's standard of righteousness.
[00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:24.620]   And the standard of God's righteousness is Jesus himself.
[00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:30.820]   He says, "I'm not gonna put my faith and trust in garbage,
[00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:33.160]   "even though it's shiny and pretty.
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:36.640]   "I'm gonna choose Jesus."
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:45.600]   Seek first his kingdom and his righteousness.
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:47.300]   Some of us might be thinking,
[00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:50.960]   man, you know, poke your elbow at the person next to you
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:53.060]   and say, "I'm better than you.
[00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:54.840]   "I'm more righteous than you."
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:56.180]   That's not good enough.
[00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:59.860]   You're selling yourself short.
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:03.460]   The righteousness you've set for yourself,
[00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:08.000]   whatever standard that is, if it's not Christ, it's garbage.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.920]   Simple as that, it's garbage.
[00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:19.060]   So get ready for a little heresy, okay?
[00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:23.100]   So if you've got stones, please try not to throw them.
[00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:27.480]   And let me just say, I don't, this is not heresy,
[00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:31.620]   but you might think it is until you let me finish, okay?
[00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:33.080]   So please let me finish.
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:34.780]   So you know, if you've been going to church
[00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:37.540]   any number of times, if this is the second time
[00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:39.980]   you've attended Urban Voice Church,
[00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:43.740]   then you will have already heard
[00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:46.760]   what is the only way to eternal life?
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:49.460]   What is the only way for salvation?
[00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:52.220]   What is the only way to God?
[00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:56.660]   Anyone?
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:58.960]   (audience laughing)
[00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:03.960]   I hope you're just being shy, but it's faith in Jesus Christ
[00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:06.240]   that's as simple as it gets, right?
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:12.100]   It's trusting Jesus, believing Him.
[00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:13.940]   John 3:16, "For God so loved the world
[00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:15.180]   "that He gave His only Son,
[00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:17.960]   "that whosoever shall believe in Him
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:18.960]   "will have eternal life."
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:21.520]   Well, they will not perish, but have eternal life, right?
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:26.520]   So I'm gonna submit to you that there's one way
[00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:30.220]   one other way, one other way.
[00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:38.780]   I mean, I affirm Jesus is the way to the Heavenly Father,
[00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:40.820]   but I'm gonna say there's one other way.
[00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:43.300]   And guess who tells us what the other way is?
[00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:45.740]   Jesus.
[00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:49.380]   So Matthew 19, verse 16 through 22,
[00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:52.020]   you might wanna turn there just to say like,
[00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:54.900]   man, I'm gonna prove John wrong today.
[00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:57.180]   There is no other way but Jesus.
[00:32:57.180 --> 00:32:59.380]   And then someone, you might know this story, it says,
[00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:01.140]   "And someone came to Him and said,
[00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:03.740]   "Teacher, what good thing shall I do
[00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:06.300]   "that I may obtain eternal life?"
[00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:09.860]   I.e., or in other words, salvation.
[00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:14.220]   That I may have heaven.
[00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:16.220]   And He said to him, that's Jesus said to him,
[00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:18.060]   "Why are you asking me about what is good?
[00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:19.340]   "There's only one who is good,
[00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:24.340]   "but if you wanna enter life, keep the commandments."
[00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:27.220]   That would have been the perfect time for Jesus
[00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:29.100]   to put another exclamation point
[00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:32.460]   on salvation by faith alone through Christ alone, right?
[00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:38.660]   He could have said, "Trust me, believe me,
[00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:40.820]   "put your faith in me."
[00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:42.580]   But He doesn't say that.
[00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:45.020]   He says, "Obey all the commandments."
[00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:49.720]   Now, what a normal person would have said,
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:52.460]   well, then, I've already violated,
[00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:54.620]   even before this conversation, I've already violated
[00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:55.700]   all the commandments.
[00:33:55.700 --> 00:34:01.300]   And what we should say is, okay, is there another way?
[00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:05.180]   That's what should have happened, but in this story,
[00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:07.340]   the man who's asking the question,
[00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:10.500]   when told just obey all the commandments, what does he say?
[00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:11.580]   Okay, I did that.
[00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:14.940]   I've obeyed them all since I was a kid.
[00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:19.700]   And you can imagine anybody who's standing around listening,
[00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:23.380]   they're like, "Oh my gosh, this guy is so unaware of himself
[00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:26.400]   "has no idea.
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:29.060]   "He is living in a fantasy world, he's delusional."
[00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:32.300]   But it says, "Jesus loved him, though."
[00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:33.680]   And then he said, "You got one more thing
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:34.680]   "that you're lacking.
[00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:37.840]   "So sell everything you have and give it to the poor
[00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:39.000]   "and then follow me."
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.260]   And there was the answer right there, right?
[00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:45.780]   Basically, it should have begged the question,
[00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:48.820]   Jesus, what other way is there?
[00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:51.220]   Because this is an impossible way,
[00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:53.520]   the law is an impossible way.
[00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:58.220]   And then Jesus would have just said, "Then follow me."
[00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:01.220]   And that's what he says to us.
[00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:05.500]   There is another way, but it leads to death
[00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:08.460]   because the law won't save you there,
[00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:10.780]   will only accuse you, will only confirm
[00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:15.700]   you're a sinner, that you deserve the judgment
[00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:19.540]   and wrath of God, but instead choose me.
[00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:23.980]   Hang on my coattails and faith
[00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:27.300]   and let's walk into glory together.
[00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:38.620]   So Paul, again, arguably the most righteous man
[00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:42.800]   walking on the face of the earth, chooses Jesus.
[00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:47.740]   Arguably the most successful law keeper,
[00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:49.740]   perhaps in the history of the world,
[00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:52.900]   says, "I will not choose that garbage.
[00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:56.020]   "I will not choose what looks like my success story.
[00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:57.620]   "I'm gonna choose Jesus."
[00:35:57.620 --> 00:36:03.820]   And brothers and sisters,
[00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:10.580]   Jesus says, "Seek first the kingdom,
[00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:12.900]   "his kingdom and his righteousness.
[00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:15.540]   "Choose him, choose Jesus,
[00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:17.340]   "God's standard of righteousness."
[00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:29.420]   And then we can say, "Therefore," in verse 34,
[00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:33.820]   "all these things that consume our thoughts,
[00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:36.220]   "that distract us from pursuing
[00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:40.380]   "and keeping the main thing, the main thing,"
[00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:41.940]   Jesus says, "Don't worry.
[00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:44.080]   "Don't worry about tomorrow,
[00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:47.180]   "for tomorrow will worry about itself.
[00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:50.380]   "Each day has enough trouble of its own."
[00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:52.780]   You don't need to worry about those things
[00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:56.260]   because you're seeking first his kingdom
[00:36:56.260 --> 00:37:00.180]   and his righteousness and all these other things
[00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:04.900]   that try to distract us, that try to consume our thoughts.
[00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:08.220]   "I've got it, I'll take care of it.
[00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:10.060]   "Don't worry."
[00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:15.660]   So friends, let's put our confidence
[00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:20.100]   in Christ and his kingdom.
[00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:26.860]   Let's seize the righteousness that Jesus is,
[00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:31.300]   the righteousness that God offers to us as a gift.
[00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:35.380]   Let's receive him in faith.
[00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:39.060]   And if you have chosen any other way
[00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:43.740]   to gain the approval of God, to win your ticket to heaven,
[00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:47.660]   then let's throw that in the garbage can where it belongs.
[00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:49.980]   Paul did.
[00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:52.920]   And let's choose Jesus.
[00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:55.900]   Let's bow our heads.
[00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:59.820]   I'm gonna give you a moment to respond to the Lord.
[00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:04.660]   I'll start with that first question.
[00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:10.940]   What is it that we pursue with all we have?
[00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:17.500]   What is our highest priority desire?
[00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:25.520]   Let's just confess it to the Lord.
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:28.440]   (soft piano music)
[00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:42.400]   And put that, and maybe there's more than one,
[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:44.800]   maybe there's dozens of things.
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:47.840]   And put that in one hand, and then in the other hand,
[00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:51.260]   the kingdom of God and his righteousness.
[00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:56.440]   (soft piano music)
[00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:59.200]   I'm just asking you, in your own heart,
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:00.960]   just weigh those two things out.
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:07.720]   Jesus said, "What does it profit a man
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:12.720]   "to gain the whole world and yet lose his soul?"
[00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:23.160]   (soft piano music)
[00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:26.840]   And as the Lord leads you,
[00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:30.880]   would you empty one of those hands?
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:39.080]   Lay it at his feet.
[00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:47.360]   And tell him what you're gonna do.
[00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:51.240]   (soft piano music)
[00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:17.520]   And you can pray alongside me,
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:22.080]   or you can just keep praying in your own words.
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:30.520]   Father, we acknowledge right now that you are a holy God
[00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:35.000]   who has an impossible standard of what is holy
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.400]   and what is righteous.
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:44.120]   And first, we just ask you to forgive us
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:50.000]   as we confess that we have missed the mark.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.800]   We have not lived up to your standard.
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:55.360]   And even those days that we may have fooled ourselves
[00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:57.840]   into thinking that we are holy enough,
[00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:02.040]   good enough, righteous enough, Lord, it was a lie.
[00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:09.480]   Forgive us for trying to earn our way,
[00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:14.000]   earn our way to your approval.
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:17.880]   (soft piano music)
[00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:24.680]   Forgive us that we have sought our kingdom and not yours.
[00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:36.240]   We have chosen my way, not the Father's way.
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:45.560]   And forgive us that we have not trusted you,
[00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:47.320]   we have not believed you,
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:50.840]   that we have not embraced your son, Jesus,
[00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:55.840]   that we have not clung to him desperately.
[00:41:55.840 --> 00:42:07.720]   But today we put all of our desires,
[00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:11.560]   all of our pursuits, our worries, our fears, our concerns,
[00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:13.560]   and we drop them at your feet,
[00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:15.080]   the feet of Jesus who says,
[00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:19.800]   "Come, all who are weary and heavy laden,
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:21.480]   "and I will give you rest."
[00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:26.400]   The one who invites us to take the heavy burden
[00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:30.760]   off our shoulders and that you promise to trade with us
[00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:36.680]   a light yoke, a light burden, an easy burden.
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:40.280]   Lord, we receive that.
[00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:45.360]   Thank you for taking the load off of our shoulders.
[00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:52.320]   And now as we live our lives,
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:55.400]   seeking that you get your way,
[00:42:55.400 --> 00:43:07.240]   and trusting in your son, Jesus, the righteousness of God,
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:11.240]   (gentle music)
[00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:16.080]   Lord, let us experience the joy of following you,
[00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:21.080]   the joy of seeing you provide everything that we need,
[00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:28.160]   coming to you with open hands,
[00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:30.080]   holding nothing back from you,
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:34.760]   as you pour out on us the blessings of heaven.
[00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:38.120]   We trust your promises.
[00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:39.640]   We trust your word.
[00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:41.520]   We trust your son.
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:45.120]   Have your way with us.
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:52.920]   God, would you help us?
[00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:57.280]   We already know we're not able.
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:01.200]   We cannot obey your law.
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:06.640]   No matter how hard we try, we keep failing.
[00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:08.040]   Lord, would you help us?
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:14.640]   And would you put our sights on Jesus
[00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:19.640]   who has already fulfilled your law perfectly?
[00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:25.720]   And we're not gonna try to win our own salvation
[00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:27.560]   'cause Jesus has already done it.
[00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:32.560]   Thank you, Lord Jesus, that you went to the cross
[00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:36.920]   perfect, spotless, sinless,
[00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:46.280]   and you became sin for us and crucified our sin,
[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:55.640]   paid the debt that we owed for our own sin.
[00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:59.760]   We love you and we are so thankful to you.
[00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:01.600]   Lord, as we go from this place,
[00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:04.040]   I pray you put a bounce in everybody's step,
[00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:07.960]   knowing that there's a lighter load on their shoulders,
[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:11.720]   that they are not walking hopelessly,
[00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:14.840]   but now we are walking with so much hope,
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:16.480]   so much promise,
[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:21.360]   Lord, we are walking in the goodness and grace of God.
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:26.520]   Thank you so much, we pray in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:29.360]   and I hope.
