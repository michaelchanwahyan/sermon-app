1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
 Hey, thanks Kelly.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,840
 Let me get my PowerPoint ready, alright.

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,240
 Why don't we pray together?

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:16,840
 Father, we want to pray to you because you are the King, you are the Lord.

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:21,680
 Even though sometimes we cannot see your hands, we know that you are still in control.

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,760
 You are still the Lord of history, Lord of our lives.

7
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,200
 That's why we come before you to worship you.

8
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,960
 That's why no matter if it is sunshine or it is raining, we come to acknowledge your

9
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,960
 Lordship.

10
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:39,160
 And we pray that you will help us to put our trust in you, to believe in you.

11
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,280
 I pray for each and every one of us.

12
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,640
 Perhaps we are facing some life challenges or crisis.

13
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:54,760
 I pray that you will grant us the grace to see your authority, your power.

14
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:00,160
 You are bigger than all the problems and challenges that we have.

15
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:09,480
 So pray that we will put our faith in you, wholeheartedly trust you with our full heart,

16
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:15,000
 no reserve, because you are the Lord, you are God.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,280
 And pray that you will speak to us, pray that you will awaken our soul, our spirit, we will

18
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,960
 draw closer to you in your presence, in Christ and pray.

19
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:34,880
 Well we are talking about Apostles Creed and this is a very, very ancient Creed, uh, lasts

20
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,320
 for over 1,800 years.

21
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:44,640
 I mean, can you think of any movement in human history that will last so long, right?

22
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:52,240
 That will last so long, that would last for all the rise and fall of empires on the earth.

23
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,920
 But Christianity, the Jesus movement, lasts for so long, right?

24
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,080
 And this Apostles Creed we're going to go through together, uh, we started last week,

25
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:06,520
 uh, lasts for almost 2,000 years, right?

26
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:16,960
 The Roman Empire, who used to persecute the early churches, they fell in the 5th century.

27
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:23,720
 But the churches are continuing their movement and they still exist until today.

28
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:28,220
 And that's why this is so valuable as we look at, uh, the Apostles Creed, uh, going back

29
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,260
 to almost 2,000 years.

30
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:37,880
 And we said that, uh, the Apostles Creed believes in statements, uh, it begins with statements

31
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,080
 with "I believe this" and "I believe that."

32
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:48,080
 And we said that "I believe" does not mean intellectually agreeing upon some proposition.

33
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,960
 In the Bible, "I believe" means "I am believing into God."

34
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,440
 That is to say, I commit myself to God.

35
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:02,360
 I'm not just putting checks on check boxes and say, "Okay, I believe in this and I believe

36
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,360
 in that."

37
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,140
 It's not an intellectual proposition only.

38
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:10,200
 It is "I am committing myself to the relationship with God."

39
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:20,280
 And last week, well, we said, um, "I believe in, uh, God, the Father Almighty, Creator

40
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,560
 of heaven and earth."

41
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,760
 And we clarify one thing in the Bible, faith is not making something true.

42
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,960
 Faith is affirming something that is already true.

43
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,920
 Okay, can you repeat after me?

44
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,100
 Faith is not making something true.

45
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:43,080
 Faith is affirming something that is already true.

46
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,360
 I believe.

47
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,140
 I affirm something that is already true.

48
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:51,060
 So that's why you don't find any passages in the Bible trying to prove to you the existence

49
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,060
 of God.

50
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,060
 The Bible don't do that.

51
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,940
 Instead, in the Bible, you find a God who exists.

52
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:04,460
 You never find the Bible, never find the Bible or in Christian faith that "I believe in the

53
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,860
 existence of God."

54
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,220
 No, we don't affirm that.

55
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:12,700
 Instead, we affirm, "I believe the God who exists."

56
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:16,500
 Can you repeat after me?

57
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,460
 We don't affirm the existence of God.

58
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,460
 You say, "What?

59
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,460
 That's a church."

60
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,460
 Right?

61
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,460
 No, we don't.

62
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:27,020
 We don't affirm the existence of God.

63
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,460
 We believe in the God who exists.

64
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,300
 That's a totally different thing.

65
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:37,100
 The first statement, "I believe in the existence of God," is just an intellectual thing.

66
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:42,980
 But if I believe or I'm believing into the God who exists, who relates to you, who loves

67
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:46,740
 you, who redeems you, that's a totally different ballgame, right?

68
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,260
 So that is what faith is all about.

69
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:57,220
 And today, I would like to unpack the first statement here and using Psalm 119.

70
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,220
 Sorry, Psalm 19.

71
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,140
 Psalm 19.

72
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,700
 Let me read the first six verses.

73
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:08,260
 The heavens declare the glory of God.

74
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:12,340
 The skies, the heavens, proclaim the work of His hands.

75
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,340
 Day after day, they pour forth speech.

76
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:19,060
 Night after night, they display knowledge.

77
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:23,460
 There's no speech or language where their voice is not heard.

78
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:30,020
 Their voice goes out into all the earth, worse to the ends of the earth.

79
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:33,780
 In the heavens, He has pitched a tent for the sun.

80
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:34,780
 God has done that.

81
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:39,300
 God has pitched a tent for the sun, which is like a bridegroom coming forth from his

82
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:45,300
 pavilion, like a champion rejoicing to run his course.

83
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:52,820
 It rises, talking about the sun, at one end of heavens and make a circuit to the other.

84
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:57,260
 Nothing is hidden from the heat of the sun.

85
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,060
 Now Psalm 19.

86
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,820
 This is only the first third of it.

87
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:08,100
 Psalm 19 is a creative rendition of Genesis 1, the seven days of creation.

88
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:15,660
 And here the Psalm says, the creation of God, the entire cosmos, the entire universe is

89
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:20,940
 like a choir, like a symphony, like an orchestra.

90
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:25,300
 Have you ever been to a symphony theater?

91
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:29,340
 Have you ever done that?

92
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:35,180
 It's like a symphony, singing day after day and night after night.

93
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:40,340
 And this is some spiritual music playing, mysterious music playing, and you have to

94
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:44,020
 listen to it with years of faith.

95
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:49,900
 This is not normal speech, not normal verbal language.

96
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,300
 But there it is.

97
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:55,460
 The creation is proclaiming something.

98
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,080
 It's declaring something.

99
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,620
 It's singing about God who exists.

100
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,200
 God who is behind everything.

101
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:10,500
 Some years ago, I was listening to a debate.

102
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,740
 It happened in Great Britain, in UK.

103
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,740
 So it was some years ago.

104
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:23,740
 I was listening to a debate online between a Jewish Rabbi called Jonathan Sarick.

105
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:32,020
 And then he was debating with the very famous, very well-known atheist, Richard Dawkins.

106
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:43,020
 Both of them are UK people, so they did kind of a radio debate, online debate.

107
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:48,660
 So I was listening to this, and it was a really, really heated debate.

108
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:53,560
 And of course, the Jewish Rabbi, Jonathan Sarick, he was very famous.

109
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,600
 He passed away not too long ago.

110
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:00,120
 He was the chief Rabbi of Judaism in Great Britain.

111
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,320
 And he was debating Dawkins.

112
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:10,880
 And Dawkins was also a British scientist, and he is known for his atheist standpoint,

113
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,880
 right?

114
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:16,020
 That there's no God and everything is just matters, right?

115
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:20,920
 And everything is just coming together randomly, and that's why we have life.

116
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:29,400
 And then, Sax was debating with him, and it was kind of a very heated, engaging conversation.

117
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:35,920
 I remember one thing Jonathan said with Dawkins.

118
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:44,040
 The Jewish Rabbi said, said to Richard, "Richard, religion is music, and you are tone deaf."

119
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,080
 And Dawkins said, "Yes, it is true.

120
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,720
 I am tone deaf, but there's no music."

121
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:57,720
 I tried to sink in what the Rabbi is trying to say.

122
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:05,080
 Faith is music, but if you're tone deaf, you cannot hear the music.

123
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,560
 That's what Psalm 19 is trying to say.

124
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:16,040
 The heaven is proclaiming, proclaiming the God who exists, the God who loves you, the

125
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,920
 God who made all of this, who is behind everything.

126
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:25,560
 Faith is the ability to hear the music beneath the noise.

127
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:33,800
 There are a lot of noises we hear today from our culture, from our social media.

128
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:40,760
 It's a great thing we have great technology, but also create a lot of noises in our life,

129
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,760
 right?

130
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:51,320
 In order to hear God, you need to understand faith is the ability to hear, to penetrate,

131
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:56,160
 to hear the music beneath all this noises.

132
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,640
 The Psalm says there is spiritual music of creation.

133
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:06,280
 The sun rises in the east every morning and travels to the, to the west.

134
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:12,760
 Okay, this is a normal, typical, ordinary language.

135
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16,080
 The Psalm is not teaching cosmology.

136
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:21,280
 The Psalm is teaching us theology, talking about God.

137
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:29,760
 In 1905, looking at the sun traveling from the east to the west, it's like a bridegroom

138
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:38,600
 coming forth from his tent or pavilion, like a champion rejoicing, running his course.

139
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:44,280
 The pavilion behind it, it was the Hebrew word, hopa.

140
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,880
 All right, can you repeat after me?

141
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,880
 Hopa.

142
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,200
 Now, what is that?

143
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,320
 I always find it funny the Chinese would translate like that, all right?

144
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,000
 If you know Chinese, you know what I'm saying.

145
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,680
 I don't know why, yeah.

146
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,000
 But behind it, it was the Hebrew word, hopa.

147
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 And what is it?

148
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:09,440
 Now, if you Google that, if you know a little bit about Jewish wedding custom, even today,

149
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:15,240
 the Jewish couple would come under a tent with four corners, with the rabbi, with the

150
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,240
 officiant of the wedding.

151
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:25,600
 So in the entire wedding ceremony, okay, the Jewish couple will come under that tent with

152
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:32,560
 the rabbi, with the officiant, and they will go through the entire ceremony under the tent.

153
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,480
 The tent is called hopa.

154
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:43,160
 All right, so they will officiate the wedding, the Jewish wedding, under that hopa.

155
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:51,680
 And then when the ceremony concludes, the bridegroom with the bride will go out of the

156
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,920
 hopa.

157
00:11:53,920 --> 00:12:00,560
 And in Jewish tradition, it means a new creation, a new family is being created, right?

158
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:07,520
 A new relationship, new marriage has been launched.

159
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:16,060
 So when they come out of the chamber or the pavilion, the hopa is a new creation.

160
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:21,240
 So with that picture in mind, Psalm 19 is trying to say, every single morning when you

161
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:26,680
 wake up today, when you wake up this morning, the sun rises and will follow this course

162
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,240
 across the sky to the west.

163
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,780
 And every day is a new creation of God.

164
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,840
 Every day the sun comes out of the east.

165
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,960
 It's like the bridegroom coming out of the hopa.

166
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,940
 It is a new song for God.

167
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:44,100
 It is a new song for his love, for his power.

168
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,760
 So every day is a new day.

169
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:52,920
 And then Psalm 19, not only use that kind of imagery, you know, in the ancient days,

170
00:12:52,920 --> 00:13:01,220
 in the ancient Jewish society, or even today if we go to Israel, going to some traditional

171
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:07,060
 Palestinian villages, they will have weddings.

172
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:14,620
 And like in the ancient days, all weddings happening in the village is a public event.

173
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,640
 It's an open event.

174
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,740
 Everybody in the village is invited.

175
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,740
 Now it's totally different from today, right?

176
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:25,800
 Today if you are getting married or your friends are getting married, usually the people are

177
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,100
 being invited are very selective, right?

178
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,220
 Right?

179
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,780
 You have your list of guests.

180
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:37,960
 You're trying to invite, you know, not as many as possible, right?

181
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,380
 It's always a private, selective event.

182
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:45,920
 But in the ancient days, wedding is always a public event.

183
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,920
 Everybody knows who is getting married next week.

184
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,140
 Everyone is invited to the banquet.

185
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,700
 And everyone is a witness.

186
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,780
 Because nobody would be so stupid and say, "Who's getting married today?"

187
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:01,420
 It's a totally public event, right?

188
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:09,140
 Psalm 19 is saying, "The music the creation is playing is a public event."

189
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,260
 There's no way you can miss it.

190
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,840
 There's no way you cannot listen to the music.

191
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:24,700
 If you put on hearing ears of faith, then you will pick up the spiritual music.

192
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:32,500
 There's a guy in United States, very famous, very important person, Francis Collins.

193
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:40,580
 He is the head of the NIH, National Institutes of Health, for some years.

194
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:46,060
 And then he was also the head of the genetic research in the United States, the human general

195
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:48,140
 research.

196
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:56,820
 In 2020, when the pandemic just started, in 2020, Francis Collins was awarded with the

197
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,180
 Templeton Prize.

198
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:06,740
 Now the Templeton Prize was an award given to intellectuals who have made significant

199
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:10,220
 contributions to science and faith.

200
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:15,980
 In that sense, these intellectuals who have received the prize every single year, in 2020,

201
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,300
 it was awarded to Collins.

202
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:26,820
 He has made a lot of contribution to integrate science and faith, technology and faith.

203
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:35,820
 And by the way, Jonathan Sachs, the UK Jewish Rabbi, he received the same prize in 2016.

204
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:41,660
 So when Collins received that prize, he talked about how he came to faith.

205
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:47,060
 Some years ago, he was a medical doctor and he visited one of his patients who was an

206
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:51,940
 old Christian lady on sickbed.

207
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:57,700
 The lady was suffering enormously because of her conditions and she was dying.

208
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:05,020
 And one day when Collins, as a medical doctor, he went into the room to talk to this lady.

209
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:09,900
 This old lady asked Dr. Collins.

210
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,980
 He asked him, "Doctor, I know I'm dying.

211
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,500
 I'm going somewhere else.

212
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,940
 I know where I'm going.

213
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,340
 I know what I believe.

214
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:25,100
 But doctor, what do you believe in?"

215
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:34,300
 And it just dawned on him, as a medical doctor, this cosmic question confronted him and he

216
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:37,180
 didn't know how to answer.

217
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:43,380
 And after that conversation, he took some time to really dig into what this faith is

218
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:48,540
 all about and why this lady who's dying should have no hope at all, right?

219
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,140
 Should have no hope at all.

220
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:54,340
 But she is full of hope, right?

221
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:57,980
 And he, as a medical doctor, he couldn't do anything about it.

222
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:02,660
 And he see this lady with hope beyond death.

223
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:07,980
 And he asked himself, "What do I believe in?

224
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,980
 What is my belief?

225
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:12,580
 How do I answer that cosmic question, right?

226
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,900
 The life and death question.

227
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,900
 What do you believe in?"

228
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,820
 I will ask you, "What do you believe in?"

229
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:18,820
 Right?

230
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,040
 You've been to church.

231
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:25,220
 You probably grew up in a Christian family.

232
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:27,100
 Good Christian family or bad Christian family.

233
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,340
 It really doesn't matter.

234
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:33,620
 You've probably been to church, good church or a bad church.

235
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,500
 It really doesn't matter.

236
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,140
 What do you believe in?

237
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:45,140
 And then Dr. Collins spent some, just a little bit, maybe a few years, and then he read C.S.

238
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:51,060
 Lewis' Mere Christianity and find the faith.

239
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,060
 So he came to Christ.

240
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,700
 He came to believe in Jesus.

241
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,620
 And he's still very vocal about what he believes.

242
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,620
 He's an evangelical.

243
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,620
 He's a believer.

244
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,620
 Very good guy.

245
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,620
 Very good guy.

246
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:10,900
 In one of his books, The Language of God, you see the DNA there, double helix.

247
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,420
 He wrote this book.

248
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:16,240
 And there's one paragraph I want to share with you.

249
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:23,500
 He said, "While the long history of religious oppression and hypocrisy is profoundly sobering,

250
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:29,140
 the earnest seeker of truth, if you're earnest seeker of truth, must look beyond the behavior

251
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:34,780
 of flawed humans in order to find the truth.

252
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:41,340
 Would you condemn an oak tree because its timber had been used to build battle ramps,

253
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,180
 weapons to kill other people?

254
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:46,620
 Would you condemn the tree?

255
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:51,220
 Would you blame the air for allowing lies to be transmitted through it?

256
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:58,220
 Would you judge Mozart's Magic Flute on the basis of poorly rehearsed performance by fifth

257
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,220
 graders?"

258
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,700
 Have you ever been one of those?

259
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,460
 The fifth graders?

260
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:11,580
 "If you had never seen a real sunset over the Pacific, would you allow a tourist brochure

261
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,660
 as a substitute?

262
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:19,140
 Would you evaluate the power of romantic love solely in light of an abusive marriage next

263
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,140
 door?"

264
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,140
 No.

265
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,260
 No, you don't.

266
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:33,060
 A real evaluation of truth of faith depends upon looking at clean, pure water, not at

267
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:38,340
 the rusty containers.

268
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:41,540
 What do you believe in?

269
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:47,500
 Now I picked this paragraph because I really echo with some of the things that he said.

270
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:59,140
 It's indeed really sad to see churches, some human institutes, corrupt by power, corrupt

271
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,660
 by sin.

272
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,460
 They rise and they fall.

273
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:10,700
 Sometimes when you hear news like that, you're just shaking your head, right?

274
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,380
 SMH, shaking your head.

275
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,020
 You just cannot live with that.

276
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,260
 You just cannot live with that, right?

277
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,540
 How could people do that, right?

278
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,260
 How could people do that?

279
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:25,260
 But it really strikes me.

280
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:37,260
 He said about oppression, about hypocrisy, but he also invite us, if you're really earnest

281
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:43,020
 seekers of truth, you need to look beyond that, right?

282
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:47,940
 Sometimes we put our faith in human institutions.

283
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:55,500
 Sometimes we put our faith in flawed humans, including your pastor, including your leader,

284
00:20:55,500 --> 00:21:00,660
 including anyone that you look up to.

285
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:04,060
 These people are as broken as we are.

286
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:08,740
 Leaders and pastors, including myself, we all needed grace.

287
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:11,740
 We all needed the love of God.

288
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:14,180
 Every one of us.

289
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:17,860
 Don't you want to put your faith in flawed humans?

290
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:23,100
 You put your faith, you put your trust in God and God alone.

291
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,300
 Psalm 19.

292
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:29,420
 We read the first six verses.

293
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:37,780
 The first third is talking about the word of creation, the speech of creation, general

294
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,780
 revelation.

295
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,780
 Everyone knows it.

296
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,780
 It's universal.

297
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:49,660
 And then seven to ten, it changed to words from the creator, words of creators, the special

298
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:53,660
 revelation, especially for you.

299
00:21:53,660 --> 00:22:00,820
 The words in the Bible, the words in scripture, those are the words from the Lord, the creator.

300
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:06,260
 Then the last third is our response.

301
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:10,700
 We as creature, how do we respond to the word of God?

302
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:16,500
 Let's read through it and we're going to go through the Apostles' Creed together and then

303
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,900
 we're going to sing a response song.

304
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:19,900
 Okay?

305
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,860
 So Psalm 19, seven to ten.

306
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:25,400
 The second half, second third.

307
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:30,340
 The Lord of the Lord is perfect, reviving the soul.

308
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:34,180
 The statue of the Lord are trustworthy, making wise the simple.

309
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:39,060
 The precept of the Lord are right, giving joy to your heart.

310
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:43,620
 The commands of the Lord are radiant, giving light to the eyes.

311
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:47,060
 The fear of the Lord is pure, enduring forever.

312
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:51,620
 The ordinances of the Lord are sure and altogether righteous.

313
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:56,140
 They are more precious than gold, more precious than pure gold.

314
00:22:56,140 --> 00:23:01,020
 They're sweeter than honey, than honey from the comb.

315
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:04,580
 The words from the Lord.

316
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:07,660
 And then our response.

317
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:13,180
 By your word, by them, is your servant wanted.

318
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:16,620
 And keeping them there is great reward.

319
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:22,940
 Who can discern his own errors, forgive my hidden faults.

320
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:27,020
 Keep your servant also from willful sins.

321
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,700
 May they not rule over me.

322
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:35,180
 Then will I be blameless, innocent of great transgression.

323
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,900
 What a humble prayer.

324
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:41,340
 And he answered prayer with verse fourteen.

325
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:47,740
 May the words of my mouth, the meditation of my heart, be pleasing in your sight, O

326
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,740
 Lord.

327
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,740
 My rock and my redeemer.

328
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:54,940
 Well, we're going to recite the Apostles' Creed together.

329
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,580
 Let's do that.

330
00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:00,900
 Why don't we stand and do that, alright?

331
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:07,860
 If you will believe, we recite it together as if we will believe I'm believing into this.

332
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,580
 Let's recite the Creed together.

333
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:14,860
 I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth.

334
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:18,620
 I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord.

335
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:23,980
 He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary.

336
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:30,620
 He suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried.

337
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,260
 He descended to the dead.

338
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:35,100
 On the third day, he rose again.

339
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:38,780
 He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father.

340
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:42,780
 He will come again to judge the living and the dead.

341
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:48,920
 I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy universal church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness

342
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:53,780
 of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting.

343
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:54,780
 Amen.

344
00:24:54,780 --> 00:25:01,780
 Rachel is going to sing, and we're going to join her together.

345
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:08,780
 I believe in God, our Father.

346
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:12,780
 I believe in Christ, the Son.

347
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:15,780
 I believe in the Holy Spirit.

348
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:19,780
 God, the truth, three in one.

349
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:22,780
 I believe in the resurrection.

350
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:26,780
 Heaven will rise again.

351
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:34,780
 For I believe in the name of Jesus.

352
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:40,780
 Let's do that together, I believe, from the beginning.

353
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:44,780
 I believe in God, our Father.

354
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:47,780
 I believe in Christ, the Son.

355
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:51,780
 I believe in the Holy Spirit.

356
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:54,780
 Our God is three in one.

357
00:25:54,780 --> 00:26:01,780
 I believe in the resurrection, that we will rise again.

358
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:11,780
 I believe in the name of Jesus.

359
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:17,780
 Let's all pray together.

360
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:20,780
 Father, we praise you, we believe in you.

361
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:26,780
 We are believing into you and putting our faith, our whole trust in you.

362
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:33,780
 For you alone is trustworthy, not any man on this earth.

363
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:36,780
 You are the God that we can depend upon.

364
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:39,780
 You are the God we can rely.

365
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:43,780
 For you are the almighty, you are the creator.

366
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:51,780
 Let us praise you, let us hear the spiritual music of the universe.

367
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:57,780
 Proclaiming your glory, proclaiming your awesomeness, your power.

368
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,780
 Thank you for loving us.

369
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:08,780
 And for the rest of the week, we are sent by your Holy Spirit to live for you.

370
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:17,780
 And put our faith in you. And do your will to please you and worship you alone.

371
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:19,780
 In Christ's name we pray, Amen.
