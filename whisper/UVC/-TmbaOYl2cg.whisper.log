[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760]   - All right, guys, this is the Christmas season,
[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.520]   and we're going to talk about the Christmas story,
[00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.800]   of course, and we're gonna turn to the Bible
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.220]   and continue, actually, with this mini-series
[00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.400]   on the pagan canes in the Bible.
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.980]   And I'd love to see all of you,
[00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.520]   and I know some of you are missing today
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.140]   because of some difficulties,
[00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.640]   and we're gonna pray for one another
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.800]   at the end of the service, all right, after the sermon.
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.760]   So I wanna set aside some time at the end of this service
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.700]   to remember some of those who are weak
[00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.000]   and having challenges.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.360]   You know, one of them is Jinfan.
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.400]   Jinfan is still in the hospital, I think.
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.520]   Hopefully, she will be discharged by the end of today,
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.080]   and I'll give you more updates at the end,
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.280]   and actually, it's good to see you,
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.080]   once you're here, and good to see you.
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.760]   I know it's a difficult day yesterday.
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.560]   Jim Borders also, you might, yeah,
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.160]   they went to UR, and so it's a very difficult day
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.240]   for some of us.
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.860]   And remember to pray for one another,
[00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.460]   and we'll do that after the sermon.
[00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.040]   And again, we turn to the Christmas story,
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.520]   which is found in Matthew and Luke,
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.240]   Matthew 1 and 2 and Luke 1 and 2,
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.360]   and today, we're going to focus on Luke 2,
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.960]   and the first few verses talk about
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.920]   the context and the time when Jesus was born.
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.920]   2.1, in those days, Caesar Augustus issued a decree
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.840]   that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world.
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.580]   And this was the first census,
[00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.240]   or the census before something took place,
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.440]   and what that took place was that
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.280]   Quirinius was governor of Syria.
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.280]   And verse 3, everyone went to his own town to register.
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.000]   Now, this is one of the Christmas stories
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.220]   recorded in the Bible about the birth of Jesus.
[00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.680]   As I said, the first two chapters of the Gospel of Matthew,
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.880]   the first two chapters of the Gospel of Luke,
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.440]   which is this passage, it's all about,
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.800]   and the Gospel of Luke did not miss the background,
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.220]   you know, the history, the time of Jesus' birth.
[00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.880]   There are two pagan kings mentioned here.
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.240]   The first one is named Augustus,
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.280]   the second one is Quirinius,
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.960]   and we're gonna focus on Augustus.
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.960]   Augustus was the founder and the first emperor
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.000]   of the Roman Empire, and he was a very powerful
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.040]   Roman king and a political elite.
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.880]   So he rose to power after a series of military conflicts
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.040]   and a series of political successes,
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.040]   and under Augustus, the Roman Empire expanded greatly,
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.240]   and he built many different buildings,
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.440]   and he kept the peace, what we call later day
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.040]   Pax Romana, Roman peace,
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.060]   which means he beat up all the guys,
[00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.980]   you know, he conquered all the lands,
[00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.120]   and then there will be peace.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.640]   So he kept the peace with his iron fist,
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.560]   and he conquered many, many places,
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.400]   including the land of Israel, Palestine,
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.320]   and he imposed heavy taxes, heavy taxes.
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.020]   You think your tax is heavy?
[00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:33.680]   Back in the Roman world, their tax was quite heavy,
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.720]   especially for those who are common people.
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.680]   And Augustus even called himself the son of God.
[00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.860]   From the coins, from the statue,
[00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.500]   from all the inscriptions, you know,
[00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.080]   all these promotions and propaganda,
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.300]   talking about him as the divine son of God.
[00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.460]   And he demanded people to worship him
[00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.540]   and to pledge allegiance to him.
[00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.980]   Now, as we see these three verses,
[00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.980]   notice the words, issue a decree, a decree.
[00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.780]   It was a political order.
[00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.380]   Now, only the Roman emperor can do that,
[00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.380]   can issue a decree, a demand on the people to obey.
[00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:20.380]   And one of the contents of the decree is taking a census.
[00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.220]   Now, census in those days in the Roman world,
[00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.900]   it's not simply counting the heads.
[00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.980]   It's not simply counting number of people.
[00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.160]   It's not just for statistics purpose.
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.180]   The Roman empire would call for census
[00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.900]   every some 10 years or maybe 14 years.
[00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.260]   Every 10 or 14 years, they would call for,
[00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:50.940]   you know, regional or empire-wide census.
[00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.020]   And the purpose of a census is to control,
[00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.700]   is to exercise control of the conquered people.
[00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.700]   So in the census, when the time comes,
[00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:06.120]   you have to report in your hometown to the government.
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.600]   Now, people would often be upset.
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.360]   And that's why in times of census,
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.980]   you know, people often will plan for revolt
[00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.960]   against the empire.
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.880]   And you also notice not only the word decree
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.400]   and also the word census, also Quirinius.
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.080]   Quirinius was a governor of the province of Syria,
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.100]   which includes the land of Palestine, Israel.
[00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.460]   And the word governor is where we get
[00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.200]   the English word hegemony.
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.840]   Hegemony, it means the most powerful guy, you know.
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.520]   He's the most powerful guy in the region, in the province.
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.520]   And of course, the top guy is, this guy here is Augustus.
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.920]   Now, as you can tell from this three verses,
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.920]   Luke is trying to tell us when Jesus was born,
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:02.600]   it was a time of mighty political power,
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:07.440]   exercising their authority over poor people,
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.120]   the common people.
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.300]   And Christmas happened in such a time.
[00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:17.460]   So don't you forget, in the time of Jesus' birth,
[00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:22.660]   it's not what we experience in Christmas.
[00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.620]   You know, usually when Christmas comes,
[00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.880]   what are we thinking about?
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.440]   We think about vacation, right?
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.640]   You got some vacation to burn, right?
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.100]   So you wanna do it by the end of the year.
[00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:39.840]   In times of Christmas, you think about shopping,
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.900]   buying gifts, you know, Christmas lights,
[00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.880]   and all those things.
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.440]   In the time of Jesus' birth, it was not like that.
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.120]   It was a time of domination.
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.320]   It was a time of a political crisis
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.920]   or political instability.
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.840]   And this three verses, you know, trying to tell us
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:03.840]   or to give us the context, the time of Jesus' birth.
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.720]   Verse four, "So Joseph," now, as you can see,
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.840]   the camera is trying to zoom in
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:13.800]   to the main character of the story.
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:18.720]   "So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth,
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:23.720]   "in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem, the town of David,
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:28.440]   "because he belonged to the house and line of David.
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.640]   "He went there to register with Mary,
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.240]   "and Mary was pledged to be married to him
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.360]   "and was expecting a child."
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:40.080]   I think Mary's carrying at least nine months now.
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:43.300]   "While they were there, Joseph and Mary,
[00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:48.300]   "the time came for the baby, Jesus, to be born.
[00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:53.520]   "And she gave birth to her firstborn, a son.
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:58.020]   "She wrapped him up in cloths and placed him in a manger,
[00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:01.860]   "because there was no room for them in the inn."
[00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:05.240]   Now, there's so many details here we can unpack,
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:08.680]   but here, the big picture is the common people,
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.840]   the conquered people, the losers,
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:16.080]   Joseph and Mary included, and Jesus, of course, included,
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:20.200]   and all the Jewish people, they report to their hometowns
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:24.360]   and to recognize that Augustus was ruling over them.
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.540]   Augustus was the king.
[00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:29.380]   Nobody else is the king.
[00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:33.140]   And Mary and Joseph were on their way from Galilee,
[00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:36.180]   which is in the north, to Bethlehem.
[00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:37.980]   As you can see from the map,
[00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:41.820]   right there, far corner on the right,
[00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:46.180]   kind of upper right, you see Nazareth?
[00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:47.100]   Can you see that?
[00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.980]   You can make it out, right?
[00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:50.980]   That is in Galilee.
[00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:54.260]   Galilee, you see the small lake on the right
[00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:58.540]   is the Sea of Galilee, a freshwater lake.
[00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:02.640]   And they have to make the journey to the south,
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:06.860]   which is Jerusalem and Bethlehem.
[00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:11.860]   Now, Bethlehem is located a few kilometer south of Jerusalem
[00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:15.100]   so they have to make the way all the way from the north
[00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:18.740]   to the south, and that is, the red line there,
[00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:23.740]   is 80-mile journey, and mostly, I think, on foot.
[00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:25.460]   Mostly on foot.
[00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:29.060]   You can imagine if you are pregnant with a baby,
[00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:32.940]   eight months, nine months, and you have to walk, right?
[00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:36.540]   Now, most of the image that we have for Christmas
[00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:38.600]   is that they got a donkey, right?
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.700]   They got a donkey.
[00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.980]   They kind of like, they have a Uber, you know?
[00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:48.820]   So Mary was on the Uber, was on the donkey.
[00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:52.660]   Well, not necessarily so, because you got to pay
[00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:54.580]   for the Uber, right?
[00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:57.020]   You can't get the free Uber.
[00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:58.960]   Not necessarily so.
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:03.960]   I think the 80, 90-mile journey, mostly, was on foot.
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:09.160]   80 miles is like three marathons, right?
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:13.060]   Carrying a baby is a very, very difficult journey.
[00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:19.440]   Chapter two, verse four says, "Went up to Bethlehem."
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.340]   And that makes sense geographically
[00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:25.100]   because you're climbing from the north shore
[00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:28.500]   of the Dead Sea, which is right at the bottom center,
[00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.900]   and you have to climb almost 2,000 feet,
[00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:34.460]   and over 2,000 feet, to the central mountain range
[00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:38.000]   where Jerusalem and Bethlehem were located.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.060]   And as you can tell, it's a very difficult journey,
[00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:45.020]   especially for a pregnant woman.
[00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:49.420]   And when they get there, it was time to give birth.
[00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:54.420]   And Joseph, I think probably, at the time of delivery,
[00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:59.180]   he had to urgently hire a midwife to help out.
[00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:03.540]   And there was no, you know, Rush Hospital
[00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:06.380]   or Northwestern Hospital in those days.
[00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:08.460]   There was no delivery room.
[00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:13.460]   And the scripture tells us, they went into the barn,
[00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:19.900]   and there was no place for the baby to lay but a manger.
[00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:26.420]   However, in Luke one and two, we find people like this.
[00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:32.180]   They were able to meet Jesus as their Savior.
[00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:35.820]   As you can tell from verse one,
[00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:39.580]   the main character seems to be Augustus,
[00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:42.460]   seems to be those who hold power,
[00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:45.260]   those who have political might,
[00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.300]   those who have military might,
[00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:50.340]   and they were the main actors in history.
[00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:52.320]   They were the main actors on stage,
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.820]   on the stage of human history.
[00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:57.900]   Augustus, Quirinius, the governor, the king, the emperor,
[00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:01.820]   the political elites, all those people
[00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:06.540]   are the main actors in human story, right?
[00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:09.340]   So we study Western history or Eastern history
[00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:10.540]   or whatever history.
[00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:14.860]   Sometimes we focus so much on the big guys, right?
[00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:17.980]   The kings, the emperor, the generals, right?
[00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:20.260]   Those who can fight, those who can win,
[00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.140]   and those who can conquer.
[00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:24.580]   But in Luke, in the Christmas story,
[00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:30.460]   the concentration or the focus is on the common people,
[00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:33.940]   on Joseph and Mary.
[00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:38.620]   Now, we don't have time to take a lot of details today,
[00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:41.260]   but in Luke 1 and 2, the first two chapters,
[00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:45.540]   talking about Christmas or the arrival of Jesus,
[00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:47.000]   the Son of God, the Savior,
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.980]   the Gospel of Luke mentions so many different people
[00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:54.340]   who have met the baby Jesus,
[00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:58.480]   who have been part of the Savior's story.
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:03.620]   From chapter two, we see Joseph and Mary,
[00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:06.780]   and Mary was probably, you know how old Mary was?
[00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:10.940]   Probably a high school girl, right?
[00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:13.660]   14 year old, 15 year old,
[00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:16.540]   and has the faith to receive Jesus.
[00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:19.140]   And then chapter one,
[00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:25.300]   the parents of John the Baptist,
[00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:28.900]   Zechariah and Elizabeth,
[00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:31.620]   and these two, they're the couple,
[00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:34.820]   were aging and dying couple because they were so old,
[00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:37.660]   and the Gospel of Luke tells us
[00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:39.900]   they had no child.
[00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:42.960]   They're struggling with infertility,
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:47.020]   and in those days, it is a shame to not have a child.
[00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:49.420]   In those days, it was hopeless
[00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:52.820]   if you cannot have a child to carry on your name,
[00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:55.620]   to continue your line and your family.
[00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:57.540]   So Zechariah and Elizabeth,
[00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:00.500]   they were dying and aging couple,
[00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:02.640]   and they had no child.
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:04.580]   However, in chapter one,
[00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:08.580]   God graced them and granted them
[00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:11.760]   a miracle child, John the Baptist.
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:16.500]   And John the Baptist is the pioneer of the Savior Jesus.
[00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:20.100]   That is Luke chapter one.
[00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:23.180]   And then the story goes on and talks about Jesus
[00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:27.460]   when after he was born, when he was eight days old,
[00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:31.020]   he was brought to the temple in Jerusalem for offering.
[00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:35.920]   So Joseph and Mary are carrying an eight-day-old child,
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:38.100]   Jesus, in their arms,
[00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:42.620]   and bring him to the temple in Jerusalem
[00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:47.180]   for circumcision and for offering a sacrifice.
[00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:49.460]   And there in the temple court,
[00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:51.620]   two other people are being mentioned,
[00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:55.700]   and they have the opportunity to take part
[00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:59.700]   and to experience, to meet the baby Jesus.
[00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:01.240]   And the first one is Simeon.
[00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:06.500]   Simeon, the Bible did not tell us how old he was.
[00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:10.880]   I think probably he was in his last days of his life,
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:14.960]   and he was devoted to worship God day and night
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:19.340]   in the temple, and finally he met Jesus, the Savior.
[00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:22.620]   And then the second person is Anna.
[00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:26.260]   Anna was an old widow.
[00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:30.700]   The Gospel of Luke tells us she lived in the temple
[00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:37.340]   day after day with the hope of seeing the salvation happen
[00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:40.260]   in her life.
[00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:45.260]   And there Anna also met Jesus in the temple court.
[00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:50.260]   Now these people, Joseph and Mary, Zechariah and Elizabeth,
[00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:53.340]   and their son, miracle child, John the Baptist,
[00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:57.300]   pioneer of Jesus, and Simeon, Anna,
[00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:02.900]   they are all powerless people,
[00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:07.040]   but in the plan of God, in the story of God,
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:10.900]   they are the main characters,
[00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:14.340]   because they praise God and thank God and worship God,
[00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:17.100]   because finally they can see the Savior
[00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:19.340]   coming into the world, coming into their life.
[00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:22.380]   And they welcome Jesus, the Savior,
[00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:25.420]   with thanksgiving and with faith.
[00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:29.300]   Now if you have time, I would always recommend
[00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:32.060]   in times of Christmas, go into the Bible,
[00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:35.340]   spend some time, and we read and meditate
[00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:39.040]   and reflect on the story of Christmas.
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:42.800]   Now if you have time, look at Luke 1 and 2.
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:46.820]   You see, Luke is trying to tell the story
[00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:49.620]   of some of these common people,
[00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:54.460]   and afterwards, he always record their praise and worship.
[00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:59.180]   Anna praised God, Simeon praised God
[00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:03.420]   after holding and seeing the Savior, baby Jesus.
[00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:07.620]   Zechariah and Elizabeth, they burst out
[00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:11.460]   with praise and worship, because they finally have met
[00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:14.500]   the hope of Israel, the hope of mankind,
[00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:17.620]   the salvation in Jesus.
[00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:20.500]   And Joseph and Mary, of course Mary,
[00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:23.380]   offer a song called "Magnificat."
[00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:28.380]   And that is a song praising God for reversing our role,
[00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:32.100]   reversing, you know, the powerful becomes powerless,
[00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:35.160]   and the powerless become powerful in the sight of God.
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.580]   So all of these people, they are common,
[00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:38.740]   even though they are conquered,
[00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:43.340]   they are in the low, low bottom layer of the society,
[00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:45.060]   and they welcome the Savior,
[00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:47.700]   and they have met the Savior face to face
[00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:49.940]   with thanksgiving and in worship.
[00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:52.640]   Now this is relevant to us,
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:55.500]   because none of us is like Augustus.
[00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.700]   None of us is like billionaire.
[00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:00.680]   Maybe you got a lot of money, okay?
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:03.700]   I guess you are not Elon Musk, right?
[00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:05.500]   You're not in the White House.
[00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:07.580]   You're not the powerful elite.
[00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:12.420]   But this story tells us Jesus came to the life of people
[00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:17.420]   who are powerless, who are poor, and who feel oppressed.
[00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:23.400]   Now Jesus is different from Augustus,
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:26.680]   because his kingdom is different from the Roman Empire.
[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:30.900]   Jesus did not come to collect power for a field.
[00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:34.520]   Jesus is going to rule differently.
[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:37.700]   And as I told you, all the praise songs,
[00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:41.580]   especially Mary's praise song, "Magnificat,"
[00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:46.580]   talks about God in Jesus elevates those
[00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:52.140]   who are without privilege, without status,
[00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:55.120]   elevate them from low to high,
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:57.640]   and release people from bondage.
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:00.380]   And that is the vision of Jesus' kingdom,
[00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:03.320]   is to restore relationship with God
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:05.860]   and restore our brokenness
[00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:09.420]   so that he can breathe life, eternal life in our lives.
[00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:15.300]   Augustus would ask other people to sacrifice themselves
[00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:19.820]   for him and for his power, for his kingdom, for his empire.
[00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:24.680]   But Jesus came and sacrificed himself for us,
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:27.820]   sinners, broken people.
[00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:30.740]   We don't deserve it.
[00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:34.140]   But Jesus came and sacrificed himself for us.
[00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:37.660]   And our situation may be different from 2000 years ago,
[00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:41.500]   but we still see kings these days,
[00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:43.940]   politicians these days,
[00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:46.860]   flexing their muscle for self-interest.
[00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:49.100]   And these people, the powerful,
[00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:53.080]   would benefit themselves and the privileged few.
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:58.580]   Jesus is calling us not to serve ourselves,
[00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:00.420]   but to serve others.
[00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:01.540]   So that's what he did.
[00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:04.460]   The ruling powers may be strong
[00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:07.640]   and seek to bend us to their vision,
[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:12.260]   but Jesus is calling you, calling me, to his kingdom.
[00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:13.580]   And his kingdom is totally different
[00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:15.660]   from the earthly empire.
[00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:20.660]   His kingdom is characterized by service and humility,
[00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:23.980]   service and humility.
[00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:27.280]   As we think about the birth of Jesus in this holiday season,
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.500]   don't you forget,
[00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:33.800]   don't you forget Jesus is calling us for his kingdom.
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:36.660]   And his kingdom is totally different.
[00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:42.660]   And remind ourselves not to seek our own good,
[00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:47.640]   but to give and to serve other people.
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:51.820]   In Luke chapter 22,
[00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:58.640]   almost before Jesus went to the cross and being crucified,
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:01.820]   he said to his disciples,
[00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:04.060]   because they're on their way to Jerusalem,
[00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:07.120]   and Jesus knew that he was gonna die
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:09.180]   a shameful death on the cross,
[00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:12.920]   and he was trying to interact with his disciples,
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:15.200]   and his disciples trying to fight for,
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:17.740]   you know, who's gonna be first in Jesus' kingdom.
[00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:20.880]   And Jesus is trying to tell them and to teach them,
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.780]   this is a totally different way.
[00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:25.980]   It's a way of reversal.
[00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:27.420]   Jesus said to the disciples,
[00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:33.560]   "The kings of the Gentiles, lord it over them,
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:37.600]   "and those who exercise authority over them,
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:41.440]   "call themselves benefactors."
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:45.520]   And the kings, the emperor, the powerful people,
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:49.080]   would call themselves to be benefactors,
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:52.760]   because they are the ones who do good to other people, right?
[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:54.560]   To have charity to other people,
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:58.000]   to shower blessing to other people.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.840]   They are the actors, the benefactors.
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:02.800]   These are the Gentile kings.
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:04.960]   Jesus said in verse 26 and following,
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:08.120]   he said, "You guys, the disciples,
[00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:12.080]   "the church, are not to be like that.
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:17.080]   "Instead, the greatest among you shall be like the youngest,
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:21.920]   "and the one who rules like the one who serves."
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:25.880]   Who is more important in the kingdom of heaven?
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:31.080]   The one who sits at the table, or the one who serves?
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:32.780]   Who is more important, Jesus said?
[00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:38.200]   The one who sits at the table, of course, but not here.
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:42.040]   You know, in the Roman Empire,
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:44.440]   the one who sits at the table, who has the feast,
[00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:47.760]   they are the powerful.
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:51.200]   But in the kingdom of heaven, in the kingdom of Jesus,
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:53.200]   it's not like that.
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:59.280]   Jesus said, "For I am among you as one who serves."
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:02.640]   Jesus came to serve us, not to be served.
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:06.880]   And that's why Jesus, in the sight of God,
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:09.160]   is the real Son of the Most High,
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:13.920]   the real Son of God, not Augustus.
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:16.400]   And Jesus bring us true peace,
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:19.280]   not the Roman peace, not the earthly peace,
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:23.160]   but the heavenly peace, eternal peace,
[00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:26.880]   because our relationship with God can be restored
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.920]   because of what Jesus did for us.
[00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:31.560]   And Jesus comes to serve all of us.
[00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:35.960]   Those who are on top of the pyramid,
[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:39.320]   Augustus, the earthly kings,
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:41.840]   those who have the political power,
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:44.080]   they come to be served.
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:45.920]   But Jesus said, "In my kingdom,
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:49.040]   "the order of things is totally different."
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:53.420]   So as we reflect on the Christmas season,
[00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:56.400]   ask ourselves a question.
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:00.960]   What can we do to serve God and others?
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:06.440]   What can we do not to be served, but to serve others?
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:09.840]   As I told you at the beginning of this sermon,
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:11.640]   we're gonna serve one another,
[00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:13.640]   we're gonna pray for one another.
[00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:16.480]   So let's start with this small action,
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:18.720]   to remember other people, all right?
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:23.720]   So last night, I received a message from Jin Fan,
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:28.640]   and I was kind of taken aback
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:33.640]   because she told me she was in the hospital
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:40.200]   because she was having some high blood pressure,
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:41.840]   beyond normal.
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:46.840]   So Paul and Jin Fan rushed to Northwestern Hospital,
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:51.480]   and I just received a message this morning.
[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:55.560]   As you know, Jin Fan is carrying 34 weeks, right?
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:57.800]   34 weeks, yeah, it's very critical.
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:00.680]   And, but I received a message from her this morning,
[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:03.320]   her blood pressure is back to normal.
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:07.720]   Hopefully, we pray for her, pray for Paul,
[00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:08.640]   pray for the baby.
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:11.040]   Everything will go fine,
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:15.120]   and she will be discharged by the end of today, yeah.
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:18.680]   But we need to pray for them, pray for them.
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:22.160]   And then, and I also received another news,
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:26.240]   is Wang Shi also went to ER,
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:31.240]   because Jin Paul also went to ER because of stomach ache.
[00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:33.880]   But he was discharged last night, right?
[00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:36.560]   Yeah, so they have a very difficult day.
[00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:40.920]   Yeah, so, boy, we need to pray for one another, all right?
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:45.920]   For those of us who are well, and relatively healthy,
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:52.440]   don't forget to serve one another,
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.560]   to care for one another, right?
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:58.600]   Yeah, why don't we spend some time to pray for one another?
[00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:05.280]   So in your quiet prayer,
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:07.720]   please pray for those who are in need,
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:10.960]   Jin Fan and Jin Paul,
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:14.520]   and all the people that God brings to mind.
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:17.600]   (gentle piano music)
[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:20.680]   (gentle piano music)
[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:50.320]   Father, we come before you, we know we are broken,
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:52.760]   we are weak, and we are poor.
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:55.960]   We are not like the powerful.
[00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:59.440]   We are not like those who have might.
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:04.280]   They seem to be the main actors.
[00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:08.320]   But we come before you, we know that.
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:11.320]   Your focus is on us,
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:14.200]   because you love us,
[00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:17.160]   and you take care of us.
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:22.080]   Never have a moment in our lives that's out of your sight.
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:28.160]   Never have a minute in our life that's out of your control.
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:31.320]   So we come before you to acknowledge
[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:34.400]   that you are the Lord, you are our King,
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:40.960]   and you are indeed holding everything together in our world.
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:43.840]   So we wanna give you thanks,
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.240]   we wanna praise you and worship you.
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:48.440]   We sing songs to you,
[00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:53.000]   not to those on top of the pyramid,
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.200]   but to you,
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:28:01.040]   who came to us in Jesus,
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:02.360]   in the form of manger,
[00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:05.400]   the form of a baby,
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:07.440]   just like every one of us.
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:12.560]   You came to save us, to serve us,
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:14.800]   even die on the cross,
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:19.120]   sacrifice yourself in order to redeem all of us,
[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:23.400]   so that our relationship with the Father can be restored,
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:24.760]   so that we can have hope.
[00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:29.080]   And thank you for your love and your grace.
[00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:30.280]   And we don't deserve it,
[00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:33.960]   yet this grace came to our lives.
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:38.840]   So again, in this season of Christmas,
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:41.280]   remind us how you live,
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:43.520]   remind us your life,
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:48.360]   remind us how our Lord Jesus came not to be served,
[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:49.880]   but to serve all of us.
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:54.000]   And yes, Father, we wanna remember
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.280]   some of our family members,
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:57.600]   some of our church members,
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:02.080]   and those who are having a tough time and challenging time.
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:08.160]   And we, first of all, wanna uplift Jinfan,
[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:11.160]   Paul and their baby in your hand.
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:15.120]   We know that they had a very challenging day
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:17.520]   yesterday and today,
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:20.360]   and I just pray that you will grant them peace,
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:24.680]   you'll help them to calm
[00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:28.000]   and to know that everything is in your hand.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   We praise you for bringing the blood pressure
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.200]   down to normal level.
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:36.320]   We praise you for good news.
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:39.960]   And I pray that you will be their protection.
[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:45.440]   And we just pray that Jinfan will be discharged today,
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:47.760]   and you will continue to protect
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:52.760]   and especially watch over Jinfan's pregnancy.
[00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:57.480]   We also wanna pray for our brother, Jinbo.
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:04.240]   We know that he was having just pain yesterday,
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:09.720]   and they were rushed to ER.
[00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:12.840]   Sure, they have a very, very chaotic
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:15.680]   and very, very difficult night,
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:18.240]   but we praise you for good news.
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:20.840]   And I just pray that you will continue
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:22.960]   to bring healing to Jinbo,
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:27.520]   to grant strength to Wanshe and their family,
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:29.600]   be with them, and knowing that, God,
[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:31.760]   you are always our strength,
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:36.400]   and you are our power, and you are our refuge.
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:40.200]   I pray for those we cannot mention by names.
[00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:43.520]   I'm sure some of us are having a very hard time
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:48.520]   and a challenging season in our lives.
[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:54.320]   Help us to lift our eyes to the throne.
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:57.640]   Know that you are the king, and you are in control.
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:01.760]   Increase our faith so that we can trust in you.
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:03.880]   Thank you for being our God.
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:07.320]   Thank you for being, walking with us.
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:10.920]   And you are faithful, and you are always faithful,
[00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:13.000]   yesterday, today, and tomorrow.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.480]   And your grace is always sufficient.
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:17.520]   So we pray that we'll rely on you
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:20.160]   and to believe in you and to trust in you,
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:23.360]   trusting the fact that you are always our provider,
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:25.120]   and you are always our shepherd,
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:27.680]   and you will be with us always.
[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:30.400]   So pray for our church as well.
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:33.120]   As we come to the end of the year,
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:35.880]   we are thinking about the next year,
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:40.160]   our plan, our budget, our financial need,
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:43.280]   and all of the ministries that we're gonna come before you
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:45.880]   and pray that you will bless us.
[00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:48.320]   Whatever we do in your name,
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:51.200]   we'll receive blessing and we'll receive fruit
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:53.280]   so that we can bring glory to you.
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:59.000]   And I pray that as we go out from here,
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.120]   you will send us out to live the life of kingdom
[00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:05.280]   in our family, in our workplace,
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:07.120]   in everywhere you send us,
[00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:10.800]   that we will demonstrate your love.
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:13.440]   You will demonstrate your grace.
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:16.680]   Thank you, Father, in Christ, we pray.
[00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:20.840]   Well, I wanna remind you to continue
[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:22.120]   to pray for one another.
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:27.400]   For those who are weak and for those who are in need.
[00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:32.080]   And I also wanna remind you in the season of Christmas,
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:33.800]   let's do something for other people.
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:37.400]   Maybe a random act of kindness to our neighbors,
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:40.040]   to our brother and sister in the church.
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:43.840]   And please remember one another
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:48.840]   and show the spirit of Christmas a little bit more.
[00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:50.040]   All right?
[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:53.280]   And by the way, this afternoon,
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:56.400]   I just made up my mind to go to the Zoolight
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:58.000]   in Lincoln Park.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   Anyone wanna join us?
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.920]   You can get the tickets yourself
[00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:07.760]   and you can see me and we go together
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:09.760]   for the Zoolight at 5.30 p.m.
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:10.920]   All right, 5.30.
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:11.760]   All right?
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:14.440]   But you have to pay for your own ticket.
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:17.000]   But you wanna hang out with some of the people
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.240]   together this afternoon, please.
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:21.240]   Yeah, you're welcome to join us.
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:22.080]   All right?
