[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.540]   And we turn to the Bible today, all right?
[00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.220]   We started this series on seven letters
[00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.520]   to the seven churches in the book of Revelation,
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.780]   and I want to tell you this, God writes letters, okay?
[00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.460]   God writes letters.
[00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.340]   Just imagine if God writes you an email, all right,
[00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.260]   and tells you what he thinks of you,
[00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.860]   as a Christian, as a Jesus follower,
[00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.940]   as a church, as a group,
[00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.020]   what would that email tell you, all right?
[00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.660]   If God writes you an email,
[00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.260]   if God's going to write you a letter,
[00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.740]   what would the letter be,
[00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.500]   and what is the content of the letter?
[00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.380]   Think about it, because this series,
[00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.220]   we are thinking about this important topic,
[00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.240]   is what Christ himself, the head of the church,
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.860]   you know, the head of the church is not the pastor,
[00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.420]   is not the deacons,
[00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.220]   is not the court team members or ministry team,
[00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.520]   is not you, definitely,
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.400]   the head of the church, or head of our church,
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.260]   is Christ himself, right?
[00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.840]   Jesus Christ himself.
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.700]   What does he think of our church?
[00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.800]   That is what matters, right?
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.160]   And what does he think of you, your role in the church, right?
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.480]   In the book of Revelation, Christ himself, Jesus himself,
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.080]   writes letters to the seven churches
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.140]   in what today is called Turkey,
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.600]   in the western Turkey.
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.440]   And we went through this in the first letter to Ephesus,
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.000]   and there are seven churches there, right,
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.460]   in seven different cities.
[00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.700]   The first one being Ephesus, right?
[00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.880]   And then the second one is,
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.440]   can you make it out from the map?
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.800]   Smyrna, right?
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.640]   Smyrna.
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.360]   And then kind of go clockwise, actually,
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.800]   clockwise, right, all the way to the seventh one,
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.960]   which is the old Assyria.
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.160]   And we read the first letter to the church of Ephesus,
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.360]   and now we come to the second letter.
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.360]   So we're moving from Ephesus, we follow that line,
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.200]   kind of the postal delivery service route,
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.240]   moving north to another harbor,
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.800]   another port city called Smyrna, all right?
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.240]   If you go to Smyrna today,
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.240]   you find that this is a modern city,
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.680]   and it's a very thriving city, actually, right,
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.240]   in western Turkey.
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.080]   By the way, I'm trying to put together
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:36.400]   a church group going to Turkey and Greece next year.
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.520]   I don't know if you're interested.
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.080]   You're interested, right?
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.120]   Yeah, you have to pay, right?
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.240]   You have to pay for it.
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.800]   Anyways, we're trying to put together,
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.160]   you know what happened in the Mediterranean East,
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.040]   the Israel-Palestine conflict, just tragic, right?
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.040]   And everything just, you know, stopped right now, right,
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.040]   in terms of tourism.
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.080]   But I'm trying to, you know,
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.800]   put together a New Testament tour,
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.760]   not going to Israel,
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.640]   because I don't know when I can go to Israel,
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.480]   or we can go to Israel,
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.680]   but hopefully the conflict will die down a little bit,
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.080]   and the land will have peace.
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.880]   But I'm trying to put together a New Testament tour,
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.800]   and that is going to Turkey and Greece, all right?
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.440]   Follow the footstep of Paul kind of tour.
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.760]   It'll be fun, two weeks.
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.400]   And by the way, if you're interested, let me know.
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.560]   I'm not sure, there's no guarantee I can put it together,
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.120]   but it also depends on what's going on over there
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.240]   and in the other part of the world.
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.720]   But anyways, if you go to Smyrna today,
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.600]   it's Izmir in Turkey.
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.480]   It's a thriving city.
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.680]   You see the cruise line cruising off
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.600]   from the harbor of modern day Smyrna.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.800]   And if you visit the site,
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.800]   you find everything you can find in Chicago, right?
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.880]   You know, Supermall and all that stuff,
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.440]   everything is modernized.
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.920]   But, you know, that's the fun thing
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.040]   about going to biblical sites.
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.920]   You know, you always have the mix
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.840]   of ancient and modern, right?
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.080]   You can go to the mall and there's Starbucks there,
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.880]   you know, get a cup of cappuccino or something like that.
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.160]   And you don't feel like you're going somewhere else, right?
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.520]   You're still in the, kind of in the West, right?
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.520]   Kind of in America.
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.440]   But, you know, walking down the street,
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.720]   you find the ancient site
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.240]   where the archeologists has uncovered.
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.600]   And they uncovered the first century Smyrna, right?
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.600]   It was an ancient city with a good harbor, just like today.
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.760]   Back then it was a good harbor,
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.400]   just like Ephesus had a good harbor back then.
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.040]   A big marketplace, right?
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.440]   A big marketplace, you see down there, all the columns.
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.840]   Big marketplace, a forum and a theater,
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.480]   Roman stadium, temples and library,
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.280]   and all the public buildings.
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:15.080]   You see the mountain there is called Mount Pagus,
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.520]   Mount Pagus.
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.280]   And it's a city of great building.
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.920]   And from the ancient texts,
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.600]   we know that people are praising the city, Smyrna,
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.600]   as a beautiful city.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.440]   And it's like a city surrounding that mountain,
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.120]   surrounding that hill, just like a crown, you know?
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.280]   All the city and all the ancient, you know,
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:42.280]   residents and cities and development at the foothill
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.640]   and surrounding that hill.
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.880]   And on top of that hill, Aquapolis, there's a temple.
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.560]   And that is the background of the letter
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.600]   to the Christians in Smyrna.
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.440]   Now, again, this is one of the seven letters.
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.360]   And there were seven letters there.
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.400]   If you read them through,
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.480]   you find that only two letters have no criticism
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:06.800]   of the churches.
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.400]   There are only two out of the seven, right?
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:14.880]   If you take it as a whole, you know, we fail, right?
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.880]   Only two out of these seven churches have no criticism
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.960]   from Christ the letter writer himself.
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.440]   So Christ will get the seven churches.
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:28.440]   There are only two churches that have praises only,
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.000]   commendations only, no criticism.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.440]   And one of them is Smyrna.
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.360]   The other one is Philadelphia.
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.360]   So this letter goes,
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.280]   "To the angel of the church in Smyrna write,
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.120]   "these are the words of him," Jesus himself,
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.000]   "who is the first and the last
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.640]   "and who died and came to life again."
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.320]   First and last, right?
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:55.840]   That kind of echoes the familiar phrase in the Bible,
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.640]   Alpha and Omega.
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.040]   Remember that one?
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:03.120]   Alpha and Omega, there are 24 letters in Greek.
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.800]   And the first letter being Alpha,
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.320]   the last letter, the 24th letter is Omega.
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.960]   So first and last, Alpha and Omega,
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:16.360]   that means that kind of title for Jesus,
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.000]   meaning he has everything under control.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.680]   He knows everything, right?
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.400]   He's the first and last in your life.
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.160]   He's the Alpha Omega of your life, right?
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.360]   Where did you come from?
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:33.920]   Where did you born?
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:34.760]   Where were you born?
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:38.440]   And what have gone through in your life journey?
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:42.040]   From day one of your existence up to now
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.720]   and until future someday, you know,
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:48.800]   you will end your life journey, Alpha and Omega.
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.360]   That is our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.200]   And he says, "I know everything about you."
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.800]   Every single letter and every single detail,
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.320]   every single day and hour you have been through
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.640]   and you will go through,
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:05.960]   God's saying he is the Alpha and Omega.
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.560]   He's the first and the last.
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:09.480]   And he knows everything about you
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:12.240]   and he has everything under his control.
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:15.880]   And so as to the questions in Smyrna
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:19.160]   and that kind of a comprehensive title.
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:23.920]   And also he said, "He died and came to life," right?
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.080]   "He has conquered death
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.880]   "and death should have no authority over you."
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:31.960]   Yes, death and evil have some effect on you.
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:33.160]   It can influence you.
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.560]   It can overpower you,
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:41.000]   but it has no ultimate authority in your life
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   because God in Christ Jesus has conquered the final enemy,
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.640]   which is death.
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.480]   So this dual introduction of Christ himself
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:56.480]   offers some hope and encouragement to all of us, right?
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.280]   Especially the small churches,
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.800]   small house churches in Smyrna.
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:02.840]   Jesus knows everything
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.600]   and he has conquered the final enemy.
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:09.320]   And it has to do with what they're experiencing at that time.
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.920]   And I'm sure if we read this short letter,
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:13.600]   you'll find some echoes,
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.400]   you'll find some resonance.
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.320]   You know, it's kind of like me, you know?
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:18.360]   It's kind of like me.
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:23.080]   Verse nine, the letter goes on.
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:27.480]   "I know your afflictions and your poverty,
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.280]   "and yet you are rich.
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:34.800]   "I know the slander of those who say they are Jews,
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:39.480]   "but they are not, but they are a synagogue of Satan."
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.520]   Now, from this verse,
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:47.400]   do you think the church in Smyrna is rich or poor?
[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.920]   Was it a mega church?
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.000]   Was it a medium-sized church?
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.280]   It's a very small church, right?
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.120]   They don't have a lot of resources.
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.360]   They are poor, right?
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.880]   In profiting, right?
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.160]   Actually, in first century,
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:09.160]   the early Christians, most of them were poor people, right?
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:13.040]   They lack of any resources
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:16.080]   and means to thrive, right?
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.880]   They have to depend on God.
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:19.400]   So this church is not rich.
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:22.040]   They are, in fact, very poor.
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:25.400]   And the church is going through some very tough time, right?
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:26.960]   It's a very tough time.
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.920]   And John, the letter writer, says
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.760]   they are going through some tough times
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.360]   because of the Jews,
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.200]   Jewish slander, right?
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.000]   So what happened there, right?
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.600]   Now, when we read the Bible,
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:44.480]   we have to read the Bible in its own context, right?
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.380]   In the ancient context,
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:51.160]   the term, the Jews, or Jewish people,
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:54.960]   so often not an anti-Semitic statement, right?
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:58.640]   So John is saying Jews or Jewish are slandering
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:02.640]   against the churches, against the church in Smyrna.
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:05.920]   It's not an anti-Semitic statement
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:10.520]   because the early Christians, ethnicity-wise,
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.000]   they were Jewish Christians, right?
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.880]   They were themselves Jews, right?
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:18.000]   How could they be anti-Semitic, right?
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.560]   But in the entire New Testament,
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:22.560]   when it mentions the Jews,
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:26.760]   and they are doing something to persecute the early church,
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:30.400]   the Jews represent the unconverted Jewish people,
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:34.100]   especially the authorities, the leaders of the synagogue.
[00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:36.760]   They would turn Christians
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:39.960]   to the Roman authorities for persecution.
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:43.280]   Remember, Jesus was turned in
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:46.960]   by the Jewish leaders in Jerusalem, right?
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:51.200]   The early Christians, as told in the book of Acts,
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:54.540]   were persecuted by the Jewish people, right?
[00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:56.760]   The Jewish authorities in Jerusalem.
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:59.140]   And they collaborate with the Romans
[00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:04.140]   and try to stumble down the church,
[00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:07.540]   try to stop the church from spreading out, right?
[00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:09.640]   So the early church had that experience,
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.520]   and until the day of John,
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:13.400]   until the day of the book of Revelation,
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.880]   they were still under the pressure
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:18.960]   from the Jewish authorities of the city.
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:21.320]   So we can imagine in the city of Smyrna,
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.880]   there were some Jewish leaders,
[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:25.840]   and they don't believe Jesus as Christ, as the Messiah,
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:29.280]   and they bad-mouthed them, and they slandered the Christians,
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:31.760]   and sometimes they turned the leaders,
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:34.440]   the church leaders, to the Roman authorities
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:39.400]   and trying to persecute the church.
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.640]   So this small church is going through
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:45.360]   some very, very tough experience.
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:48.440]   But Jesus says in this letter,
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:52.880]   he says, "Do not be afraid of what you're about to suffer."
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.640]   Jesus is not saying, "I'm gonna scoop you out,
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:59.000]   "and I'm gonna save you from suffering."
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.120]   Jesus said, "Do not be afraid what you're about to suffer.
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:06.460]   "I tell you, the devil will put some of you in prison
[00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:09.080]   "to test you, and you will suffer persecution
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.520]   "for 10 days.
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:13.160]   "But be faithful, even to the point of death,
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.760]   "and I'll give you the crown of life."
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:20.640]   You know, the main job description of Satan
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:23.120]   is one thing, right?
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:25.640]   One thing.
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:28.040]   If you check Satan's resume,
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:31.720]   there's only one thing, only one bullet point.
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:35.020]   It's to make God's people suffer, right?
[00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:36.840]   That's his job, right?
[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:38.040]   24/7.
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:40.680]   That's what Satan has been thinking about, right?
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.880]   That's what Satan is thinking about you.
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:45.040]   That's what Satan is thinking about our church.
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:48.440]   It's to persecute them, to stop them,
[00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:50.140]   and to close them down.
[00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:53.600]   That is the resume of Satan, right?
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.760]   It's a pretty easy job, right?
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:14:00.160]   24/7, the devil is trying to just destroy your faith,
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.040]   just to lead you astray,
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:05.440]   from believing to unbelieving,
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:11.200]   from unbelieving to unbelieving remains unbelief.
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:15.640]   And that is Satan's job description, only job description.
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:17.200]   And this letter is trying to encourage
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:21.520]   the small church in Smyrna to withstand the pressure,
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:23.200]   to withstand suffering.
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:27.440]   And it says there's a short period of time of testing.
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.080]   10 days, right?
[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:30.240]   10 days.
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:33.680]   You know, if you search all the pages of the Bible,
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.760]   from Old Testament to New Testament,
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.800]   there's one place talking about persecution,
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:40.520]   talking about testing of faith,
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:43.200]   and it mentioned 10 days.
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:47.600]   There's only one passage, and that's Daniel chapter one.
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.560]   Remember that story?
[00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:51.080]   Daniel was being captured,
[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:54.340]   and he was exiled in the Babylonian court,
[00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:58.120]   and he was forced to be assimilated
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:00.180]   to the Babylonian culture.
[00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:02.400]   And Daniel and his three friends were saying,
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.840]   "Hey, you know, give us 10 days.
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:09.840]   "I'm not gonna partake in the royal feast.
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:13.840]   "You know, you have to test us for 10 days, right?
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:16.000]   "And you will know after 10 days,
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   "we will do well and even better than all the other pagans."
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.600]   And as a result, you know, the consequence was that
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:30.400]   Daniel, trusting God, and after 10 days,
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:33.760]   you know, the court sees Daniel and his three friends,
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:36.320]   they're actually more healthy, right?
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.200]   They are better than other people.
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:41.480]   Now, of course, that passage is not
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:46.320]   a modern copycat dietary law, right?
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:52.280]   It's not for us to copy the same thing that they did.
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:55.840]   But it shows us, you know, God is trustworthy, right?
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:57.160]   It shows us God is trustworthy,
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:00.160]   and Daniel and his friends were vindicated.
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:03.720]   They're proven to be innocent, proven to be holy,
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.840]   and set apart by God himself.
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:09.240]   So they finally experienced vindication.
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:12.400]   And that's what Jesus is saying to the church in Smyrna.
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:13.520]   Yes, there's persecution.
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:17.120]   There will be 10 days of testing,
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:19.400]   but God will vindicate you.
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:21.160]   God will protect you.
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.160]   And at the end, you will win
[00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:25.440]   because you are standing on the side of God.
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:27.760]   You're standing on God's side.
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:28.600]   Persecution.
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:33.520]   You know, by the way, persecution is still a reality today.
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:35.200]   Still a reality today.
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.280]   Of course, we're sitting here.
[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:37.480]   We can come in, lazy.
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:40.160]   You know, we can be lazy.
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:45.160]   In America, there's not so much about persecution, right?
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:48.800]   I mean, nobody go out of the church or come in the church
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.560]   and fearful of the neighbors killing him, right?
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:55.080]   Or slandering you, right?
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:57.520]   There may be some pressure.
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:00.640]   There may be some temptation.
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.840]   And that is by and large our experience
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.000]   in America as Christians.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.720]   However, persecution is still very much going on today
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.680]   in other parts of the world,
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:15.680]   especially those countries or areas
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:18.560]   that has no access to the gospel
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:20.520]   or the authority or the government
[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:23.000]   is against the Christian faith.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:29.480]   Like many places in China, right?
[00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.880]   It's very much going on, persecution.
[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:34.520]   Many places in Muslim countries,
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:35.800]   persecution is a real thing.
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:38.240]   And let me read you some numbers, some statistics,
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:41.640]   so that we know what Jesus is talking about here
[00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:44.280]   is not just 2,000 years ago.
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:46.600]   It's very much a reality today.
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.200]   So some numbers here.
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.880]   There were, according to open doors
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.680]   and Gordon Cornwell resource,
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:58.520]   almost 400 Christians are killed, persecuted,
[00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:00.480]   for their faith every month.
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:05.080]   If you figure out numbers, try to calculate the number,
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:09.160]   there were 13 Christians who died for their faith every day.
[00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:14.000]   Even now on average, 13 Christians every day.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.640]   And then 214 churches and Christian properties
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:22.840]   are destroyed every month around the world,
[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.080]   according to open doors,
[00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:28.000]   especially in places hostile to the gospel.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.120]   200 some churches are being destroyed, you know,
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:35.960]   intentionally because they hate Christ, right?
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:40.120]   And these churches suffer damages.
[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:42.760]   Now, the last number, listen up.
[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:47.760]   40 to 80 million Christians have been martyred
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:51.120]   in the course of 2,000 years church history.
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:56.200]   40 to 80 million Christians have been martyred.
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:59.880]   They die for their faith, being persecuted
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.960]   in the course of church history.
[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:04.840]   Church history has 2,000 years old, right?
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:10.800]   And over half of them were martyred in the 20th century.
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:15.720]   The last century, the last century.
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:19.080]   Half of them, that means at least 20 million Christians
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:25.080]   were persecuted and martyred in 20th century,
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:27.440]   in the last century.
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:31.160]   So it's very much a reality, right, today.
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:33.000]   Even though we don't see it, you know,
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.840]   kind of we don't see it in our sight, our mind,
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:37.920]   but it's a reality.
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:42.120]   So what the church in Samaria is going through
[00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:45.280]   is actually what many Christians in other parts of the world
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:46.560]   are going through today.
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.960]   And Satan will continue to persecute Christians.
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:51.040]   Satan will not get tired, okay?
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:53.120]   You go to sleep at 10 o'clock.
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:55.200]   You go to sleep at 11 p.m., right?
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:58.320]   And then you wake up 8 o'clock, 9 o'clock, 10 o'clock, right?
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:00.560]   You have to rest, right?
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:04.080]   But Satan, Satan does not need rest, right?
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:05.960]   Right?
[00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:10.840]   And you know, in Jesus' encounters with Satan,
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:15.240]   with the devil, actually the devil studied the Bible.
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:18.280]   Remember the temptations Jesus had
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:21.120]   in the 40 day of wilderness?
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:24.760]   Satan actually quote from one of the Psalms, right?
[00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:26.520]   Psalm 91, right?
[00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:28.000]   Do you know what Psalm 91 is?
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.480]   We don't know because we don't study.
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:35.760]   Satan's more diligent, knowing the word of God,
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:39.040]   but for the purpose of tempting,
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:43.480]   for the purpose of persecuting Christians.
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:47.720]   So if they misinterpret, they can be led astray, right?
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:50.720]   So Satan will continue to persecute Christians
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:54.300]   with suffering, and by and large for us, it's temptation.
[00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:55.780]   Right?
[00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:59.460]   There are tons of temptations in our lives, in your life.
[00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:00.300]   Right?
[00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:01.540]   How long you been a Christian?
[00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:05.540]   Probably from some months and probably some many years,
[00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:06.820]   right?
[00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:09.300]   And if you check your experience,
[00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:11.780]   there are many, many temptations.
[00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:13.420]   There are many, many temptations
[00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:17.340]   that could have destroyed your faith, right?
[00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:18.180]   Criticism.
[00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:21.580]   Some people will criticize you, right?
[00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:22.860]   Probably unbelieving parents
[00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:25.460]   or unbelieving family members will criticize you
[00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:28.260]   for believing Jesus, right?
[00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:32.140]   And then you experience discouragements, right?
[00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:36.120]   From time to time, you feel discouraged, right?
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:40.920]   Now, I've been serving in church for 25 years, right?
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:45.820]   And I tell you, many, many experiences of discouragement.
[00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:51.700]   Either people give me the discouragement
[00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:56.620]   or I myself perpetuate that kind of discouragement, right?
[00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:59.540]   Don't you feel that way sometimes, right?
[00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:01.860]   You feel discouraged, right?
[00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:05.260]   Your friends left the faith, right?
[00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:08.160]   Your friends criticize you or friends, you know,
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:11.740]   go cold shoulder on you, you know, in terms of faith.
[00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:13.860]   And there are discouragement, there was criticism,
[00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:18.860]   there was negative experience that we all share.
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:22.980]   And that is part of the real temptations.
[00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:25.600]   And Satan's using those occasions,
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:29.800]   using those temptations to lead you astray, you know,
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:33.160]   to beat you down so that you will not be able
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:35.320]   to follow Christ, right?
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:38.860]   You will not be able to serve Christ, you know,
[00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:41.760]   to magnify your shortcomings, right?
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:45.960]   Magnify your guilt, magnify your weaknesses
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:48.960]   so that you feel like you don't deserve
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.300]   to be called a disciple of Christ, right?
[00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:55.980]   And that is trying to lead you astray from grace, right?
[00:22:55.980 --> 00:23:00.980]   Because we can always fall back on grace, right?
[00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:05.700]   Our faith started with grace and ended with sheer grace.
[00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:09.300]   It's not about our work, but Satan can use those occasions
[00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:13.040]   to destroy your faith, to slow down your Christian growth.
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:17.800]   I think this letter is a very relevant letter.
[00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:22.320]   Because it reminds us as Christians, you know,
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:25.360]   we will go through some suffering, right?
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:28.840]   You know what is the most often used image
[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:31.920]   to describe Christian walk?
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:36.920]   What's the most often used, frequently used image
[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:39.400]   in the New Testament to describe Christian life?
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:40.760]   What is it?
[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:42.360]   Let me tell you.
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:43.180]   Battle.
[00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:46.360]   It's a warfare, right?
[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:47.620]   It's a spiritual battle.
[00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:50.800]   That's one image, right?
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:54.560]   Farming is another image, right?
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:57.520]   Have you ever been a farmer?
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:00.460]   It's tough work, right?
[00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:06.480]   Running, you know, running.
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:09.820]   Track and field, you know, it's a competition.
[00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:14.840]   No, these images call for discipline,
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:19.120]   call for willingness to suffer, right?
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:21.920]   Willingness to withstand pressure.
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:23.600]   And that is the call of Christians.
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:26.960]   When Jesus called you to follow him,
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:32.180]   what he really meant was what he meant
[00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:34.440]   when he called the first disciples.
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:39.440]   He said to Peter, Andrew, John, and those guys,
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:43.020]   Jesus said, "Follow me."
[00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:48.020]   Jesus actually meant just follow me,
[00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:51.220]   just walking after me, right?
[00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:54.960]   You know, walking from town to town, from city to city,
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.760]   and you have no place to stay.
[00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:59.080]   There was no Airbnb for you.
[00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:01.160]   There's no hotel for you, right?
[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:05.320]   You gotta, you know, withstand the pressure, right?
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:08.080]   To have the discipline to follow him literally.
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:12.120]   And Jesus is calling you today to do the same thing, right?
[00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:13.060]   It's a battle.
[00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:17.640]   It's a spiritual warfare, and we need to get ready for that.
[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:21.120]   And I'll tell you how to get ready for that, all right?
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:21.960]   From this level.
[00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:25.980]   And, but I wanna give you an illustration.
[00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:29.160]   You know, not too long ago, someone introduced me
[00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:33.540]   the term strawberry generation.
[00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:36.200]   Strawberry generation.
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:37.800]   Have you ever heard of that?
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:42.800]   It's actually a term coined by an Indonesian sociologist.
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:48.320]   You know, it's a professor in Indonesia.
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:52.400]   And that professor actually wrote a book on this topic,
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:55.720]   and the title of the book is "Strawberry Generation."
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:57.860]   And it's a very popular term now,
[00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:02.200]   or used to be a very popular term in Taiwan.
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:08.720]   Now, this term, this label, strawberry generation,
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:11.840]   describes people born after 1990.
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:14.360]   Anyone here?
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:15.200]   1990.
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:16.640]   I'm sure you're not, okay?
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:17.500]   I'm sure you're not.
[00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:21.480]   But let me tell you what strawberry generation is.
[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:23.120]   Now, strawberry generation means,
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:25.960]   you know, this image means, you know,
[00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:28.480]   those people who are born after '90s,
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:33.360]   strawberries look nice and colorful, right?
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:36.040]   And you know, you see creativity,
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:37.960]   you see freshness, right?
[00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:41.240]   And these are the people, so-called Gen Z, right?
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:42.400]   Strawberry generation.
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:44.560]   Look very nice and colorful,
[00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:49.480]   but strawberries bruise easily, right?
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:51.680]   You press it, and then you bruise it.
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:56.660]   And the term actually describes a new generation
[00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:58.680]   that cannot withstand social pressure,
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:02.280]   not willing to work hard,
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:05.320]   or less resistant to challenges in life.
[00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:10.320]   Perhaps, you know, sociologists will say,
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:12.120]   perhaps, you know, this generation
[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:19.400]   grew up in an overly protective environment, right?
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:22.160]   Probably fostered by parents, right?
[00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:25.960]   You heard of helicopter parents, right?
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:30.160]   I was kind of one of them, right?
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:33.960]   When my girl was trying to learn to walk, right?
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:35.800]   And she stumbled, right?
[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:37.800]   I was like, "Oh my God."
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:38.640]   Right?
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:41.720]   "Oh my God, I don't want to get hurt," right?
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:46.000]   And, you know, having too much too soon,
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.460]   growing up in a very comfortable environment,
[00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:49.640]   just like greenhouse, right?
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:52.760]   Strawberries are grown in protected environment, right?
[00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:55.960]   Protected greenhouse.
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:58.040]   Spoiled, right?
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:59.680]   And the sociologists are suggesting
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:03.920]   we have a whole new generation who are like strawberries,
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:04.760]   right?
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:11.600]   So I wonder, are there strawberry Christians?
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:16.200]   Are there a generation of strawberry Christians?
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.480]   You know, we look nice, you know?
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:20.840]   We look kind of creative, right?
[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:23.760]   We have many ideas, and we are fresh.
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:26.240]   But, you know, are we like strawberry
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:30.440]   when we are being pushed or pressured,
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:35.040]   and we get bruised too easily, right?
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:41.560]   This letter reminds us what it means to be Christian.
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:48.640]   The church in Smyrna, they set up a great example.
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:51.080]   They were always under the pressure.
[00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:54.120]   They were always under the attack of Satan, right?
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:55.840]   But Christ encourages them.
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:01.160]   To withstand suffering, right?
[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:04.880]   So your question is, how to handle suffering?
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:07.000]   How should we do it, right?
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.640]   How should we handle pressure?
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:12.040]   Especially pressure related to our faith, right?
[00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:15.440]   Let me give you some pointers.
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:20.400]   First, you need to understand, as this letter tells us,
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:23.600]   understand suffering is a test.
[00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:26.760]   It's a test of your character.
[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:29.240]   It's a test of your faith, right?
[00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:31.600]   Now, remember, when you go through a test,
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:33.520]   of course, it's painful.
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:34.560]   It's not comfortable.
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:38.840]   But remember, only people who are of worth
[00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:41.400]   deserve testing, right?
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:44.040]   Only you are equipped.
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:46.200]   You have been growing up.
[00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:51.840]   That's why God allows testing in your life.
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:56.080]   Because God sees you as someone of worth.
[00:29:56.080 --> 00:30:00.960]   Wanna test you, wanna grow you, even better, right?
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:04.440]   That's one pointer.
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:09.160]   The second one is to understand what faith really is.
[00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:10.680]   Question of faith, following Jesus.
[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:13.160]   What does it mean, right?
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:15.440]   So often we misunderstood.
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:17.440]   We think believing Jesus is simply
[00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:19.400]   just get a ticket to heaven, right?
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:22.080]   Get a passport to heaven.
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:25.360]   Get a ticket to heaven so I can wait in the gate, right?
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:28.200]   I can be passive, I don't have to do anything.
[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:30.760]   And I just wait, someday I'll fly to heaven
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:32.520]   or something like that.
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:35.560]   No, that is not biblical faith.
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:39.760]   God does not save us from suffering.
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:44.520]   But God will save us through suffering.
[00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:47.440]   You see the difference?
[00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:48.800]   You see the difference?
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:51.520]   God does not necessarily save us from suffering.
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:54.640]   Of course we wanna pray that God will save us from suffering.
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:56.280]   We don't have to suffer.
[00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:58.560]   But so often God does not do that.
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:01.600]   But God, in his grace, in his faithfulness,
[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:06.360]   God is telling you he will save you through suffering, right?
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:09.800]   So that you can withstand suffering.
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:12.560]   In his grace, you can depend on him.
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:16.280]   Depend on his grace and his strength.
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:19.240]   The second part, understand what faith is all about.
[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:22.120]   The third point I wanna suggest to you
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:25.680]   is to learn spiritual disciplines.
[00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:30.040]   Learn spiritual disciplines, right?
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:32.360]   Reading the Bible, right?
[00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:36.240]   Reading the Bible, praying every day, you know?
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:40.080]   To have the discipline to go to worship, right?
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:42.560]   To do something, what does it mean, spiritual discipline?
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:45.400]   To do something that is against our
[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:48.720]   most comfortable desire, right?
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:54.120]   If we seek for comfort, of course we will not read the Bible.
[00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:55.520]   We will not seek God, right?
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:57.480]   We will seek sin.
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:59.280]   We will seek our own self.
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:01.000]   We will listen to our own self.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   But spiritual discipline, we're against our own nature
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.880]   and build on the new nature, right?
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:12.960]   The more you practice spiritual disciplines,
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:15.720]   you know, regular prayer, regular Bible study,
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:18.040]   regular getting together with other people,
[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:19.600]   other people of God, other Christians,
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:22.360]   to get encouragement and pray for other people,
[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:25.920]   these kind of spiritual disciplines will build up your life
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:30.080]   and will help you withstand pressures.
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:32.800]   Point number three.
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:36.520]   Number four, learn from great examples.
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:41.680]   People who have finished their course of faith,
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:45.520]   you know, beautifully and finish it well.
[00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:48.480]   Learn from them, right?
[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:51.600]   Last week we had a memorial service
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:54.640]   and we said goodbye or see you later
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:56.320]   to one of the brothers,
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:33:00.400]   one of the actual retired pastor in our midst.
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:05.400]   And he passed away when he was 96 years old, 96 years old.
[00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:10.240]   And he has been serving God for decades
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:12.400]   and he has been faithful.
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:18.760]   You know, by telling stories of his past experience,
[00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:20.920]   he has suffered quite a bit.
[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:24.800]   He had different challenges in his life,
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:27.200]   serving God, following Jesus, right?
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:29.800]   But he finished it well, you know.
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:31.800]   We praise God for his life, right?
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:33.400]   And we can learn from him.
[00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:36.000]   We can learn from great examples of faith, right?
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.040]   And there are many great examples around us.
[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:41.800]   And there are many great examples in the Bible.
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:42.920]   We can learn from them.
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:44.400]   That's point number four.
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:48.360]   Number five, focus on eternal reward.
[00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:50.280]   Someday we will be rewarded.
[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:53.880]   And God is saying to the church in Myrna
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:56.080]   and to our church, to you,
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:57.320]   he who has an ear,
[00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:59.920]   let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
[00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:03.400]   He who overcomes, he who endures,
[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:05.560]   will not be hurt at all.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.080]   By the second death.
[00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:10.480]   By the second death.
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:14.880]   And he will have the crown of life, right?
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:15.960]   The crown of life.
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:21.200]   That is the desire for Christ when he sees you.
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:26.440]   Ask questions, ask follow of Jesus Christ.
[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:28.760]   Look forward to the eternal reward.
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:31.960]   The crown of life and then will not be hurt by second death.
[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:32.800]   What is that?
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:34.600]   First death is the physical death, right?
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:39.160]   The separation of the physical body and our soul or spirit.
[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:41.120]   The second death is the final judgment.
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:44.800]   That is unfold in the book of Revelation,
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:46.320]   the later chapters.
[00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:47.240]   That is the second death.
[00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:49.960]   But Jesus has conquered death.
[00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:52.240]   And second death, final judgment,
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:56.080]   has no power over you, has no authority over you.
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:35:01.320]   So you can withstand because you have this hope
[00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:02.360]   in the future.
[00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:05.480]   And that hope is secured by Jesus Christ.
[00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:09.080]   Let me tell you this, there's a saying that says,
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:13.520]   tough times don't last, but tough people do.
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:15.240]   Right, heard of that?
[00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:18.360]   Tough times don't last, but tough people do.
[00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:21.720]   But I would say of this passage,
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:25.680]   tough times don't last, but God's people do.
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:32.000]   God's people last forever, eternally.
[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:34.160]   Because we are secure in Christ.
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:36.320]   Yes, we can go through some tough times,
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:40.080]   but they don't last because we have this eternal hope.
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:41.200]   Right?
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:43.920]   Let me remind you and let me encourage you today.
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:47.600]   Let me pray and we come before God and say,
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:49.400]   God, we need your strength, we need your grace,
[00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:53.120]   and we know that you are a rock and we can depend upon you.
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:54.400]   We can draw strength from you.
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:56.440]   We can gain strength from you.
[00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:59.320]   We can go on and follow Jesus, right?
[00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:01.360]   Let's pray.
[00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:03.840]   Father, we just come before you.
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:07.280]   We know that we are weak and we are easily defeated.
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:13.640]   Whenever we focus on our old self, our own brokenness,
[00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:16.800]   our own shortcomings, our own weaknesses,
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:22.760]   yes, we will be broken and we'll fall into temptation
[00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:29.040]   because Satan will not get tired of tempting us
[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:32.120]   and damaging our faith.
[00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:35.680]   But we know that you are our rock.
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:40.680]   You are the God who we can trust, the God who is our rock.
[00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:44.480]   And I just pray that with all the pressures that we have
[00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:46.680]   when we follow you, with all the challenges
[00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:50.640]   that we have to go through, that our faith will be tested.
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:55.040]   Our faith will be polished and our character,
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:59.640]   our life, our Christian life will be just like a lampstand
[00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:04.440]   to witness to your faithfulness.
[00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:09.280]   And I pray that for your church, you will protect us
[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:11.960]   and you will bring us through suffering.
[00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:16.560]   And we will know that you are always trustworthy.
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:19.160]   Thank you for being our faithful and loving God.
[00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:22.200]   Thank you for loving us so much unconditionally.
[00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:28.000]   And may your love and your grace continue to carry us through
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.760]   so that we give you glory in Christ and pray.
[00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:36.360]   Well, please stay for a time of fellowship
[00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:38.920]   and then we'll start our Bible study, right?
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:40.440]   Okay, all right?
[00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:42.280]   No Satan is going to do Bible study,
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:46.320]   but we will do Bible study, all right?
[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:47.160]   All right, God bless you.
[00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:50.200]   And stay in the cafe and we'll call you
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:52.840]   when it's time for our fellowship, all right?
[00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:53.680]   God bless.
[00:37:53.680 --> 00:38:03.680]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
