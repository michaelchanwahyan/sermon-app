1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,720
 I'm really blessed to be here and excited to see friendly faces, and it's

2
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,120
 it's a blessing, it's encouragement to my heart. It's really cool to be in this

3
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:25,200
 room with you all again, and just during the time of worship, just thinking about

4
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,800
 all of the time that we've had in this room in the past of worshipping the Lord

5
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:35,640
 together and fellowshipping and sharing meals and and even playing games in

6
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:41,480
 times of just fun and joy, and it was just bringing to my mind the beauty

7
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,360
 of the family of God and of the community and the fellowship that we

8
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:50,240
 share, and so it really is good to be here again in this room with you all and

9
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:55,040
 and to fellowship and to worship together again. That's a beautiful thing.

10
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,880
 I'm blessed to be here this morning, and it's like being back with family, which

11
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:04,840
 is really a really a good thing. This morning we're gonna be looking in

12
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:11,920
 Matthew chapter 10, and we're gonna be talking about generosity, and I had

13
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,640
 started this series a month or so ago about our response to God's goodness in

14
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,680
 our lives, and so this is a part of that series, and we have, we're kind of

15
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,800
 picking up where we left off. It's been a few weeks since we talked about this,

16
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,400
 but it's fine because each one of these topics really stands well on their own,

17
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,560
 and there is so much of God's goodness in our lives, so much more even than we

18
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:43,360
 see or identify a lot of times, and God wants us to respond to Him in response

19
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,840
 to that goodness that He pours into our lives, and so the first few weeks

20
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,560
 that we talked about this, we talked about the response of gratefulness, how

21
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,600
 important it is for us to be grateful for God's goodness in our life, how

22
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,800
 that's a response. Then we talked about repentance and how important it is for

23
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:01,640
 us to respond to God's goodness with repentance and aligning our lives with

24
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,640
 God's righteousness and with what God is doing in our hearts and our

25
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,000
 lives and in our world, and then we talked about faith. We talked about the

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,720
 fact that our response to God's goodness should be one of faith and that God's

27
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:23,920
 goodness in our lives gives us an archive of testimony that we can go to

28
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,160
 again and again in times of uncertainty or times of challenge and have faith

29
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,440
 because we see how good God has been in our lives, and today we're going to talk

30
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,040
 about generosity, that one of the responses that we should have to God's

31
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:45,200
 goodness in our life is generosity and beginning to give to others. So we're

32
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:51,360
 going to look at verse 8 of chapter 10 here, and I'll read this

33
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:57,160
 verse and we'll talk briefly about the context. The verse says this, "Heal the

34
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:01,160
 sick, raise the dead, cleanse those who have leprosy, drive out demons, freely

35
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:07,560
 you have received, freely give," and this is Jesus speaking here, and the context

36
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:14,920
 of this passage, Jesus is speaking to his disciples and he's sending them out in

37
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:19,760
 this passage, he's sending them out on kind of the first church mission trip

38
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:25,080
 that ever took place. It wasn't the first mission trip, undoubtedly. God's

39
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,040
 mission has been in the world since the beginning, but this was the first

40
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,920
 instance of a mission trip of Jesus' followers. So Jesus is sending them out

41
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,400
 in Matthew chapter 10. He's giving them all these different instructions and

42
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:46,200
 that's the context of these words. And in verse 8 here, he reminds them that they

43
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:52,520
 should freely give to others as a response to what God has given to them.

44
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:57,000
 And that's the principle I want us to think about today, that God has been so

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,840
 good to us in so many different ways and out of that we should have a response of

46
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,640
 giving to others. We should have a response of generosity. Another way that

47
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:13,640
 this is phrased in some different translations is it says, "You didn't

48
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:19,760
 pay for this. You did not receive the grace of God through payment, so don't

49
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:24,880
 ask anyone else for that. Be willing to give freely because you have received

50
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,480
 this freely." And as we talk about generosity today, I want us to think

51
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,720
 about it in a few different ways. Obviously there's generosity in giving

52
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,640
 with our material resources or our finances. That's probably the one that we

53
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:43,720
 think of the most when we hear the word generosity. We think of giving gifts to

54
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,720
 someone else, some material item, wrapping a present for someone or we think of

55
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,840
 giving money or something like that. And that's certainly an application of

56
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,240
 generosity and one of the applications that we're talking about

57
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:02,920
 today. But more than that, there are also applications of just our time and energy

58
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:09,760
 giving our time and energy, our presence to other people, but also giving of our

59
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:15,040
 skills and talents and abilities. God has given each one of us unique skills and

60
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:19,760
 talents and abilities that we can use to glorify him and we're to be generous

61
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,640
 with those as well. We're to be generous in giving those things away to others as

62
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:30,280
 well. So when we talk about generosity today, I want us to think about it in all

63
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,720
 of those ways, not just in terms of our money or our finances, but in terms of

64
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:41,680
 our time, our energy, our presence, and also the talents, the skills, the

65
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,320
 abilities that God has given us, that God has uniquely gifted us with. And we could

66
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,320
 also think of it in terms of giving grace and forgiveness to others. That's

67
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,400
 one of the most precious gifts that God has given to us. And that's something

68
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,880
 that it's tough sometimes for us to be generous with. It's easier for us to

69
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:05,520
 give away some money to someone than it is for us to forgive someone who's

70
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,000
 wronged us. And so we have to think about generosity in those terms as well. That

71
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,180
 when Jesus says, "Freely you have received and I want you to freely give," one of the

72
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:17,480
 things that we have received is forgiveness and grace and mercy from God.

73
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:22,820
 And that's one of the things that he's challenging us to give to others. So

74
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:27,720
 we're gonna go through just some points about what generosity should look

75
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,800
 like in our lives as followers of Jesus, and I'm going to illustrate most of

76
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,600
 these from Scripture, from other Scripture passages that illustrate these

77
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,080
 well to us and show us what it looks like. And we'll move through some of

78
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,680
 these. We probably won't get through all of them today, but these are just to give us,

79
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,640
 begin to give us a picture of what generosity should look like in our lives

80
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:53,480
 as a follower of Jesus, and also to help maybe remove some of the misconceptions

81
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:59,000
 or perhaps excuses that we might have when it comes to being generous and when

82
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,560
 it comes to giving away. So the first thing I want us to see is that our

83
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,680
 generosity is really a response to God's overwhelming goodness in our lives, and

84
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,400
 that's what we see right here in Matthew 10:8, that Jesus is saying, "Your

85
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,480
 generosity needs to be motivated by what God has done for you." And that's really

86
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:25,440
 important for us to understand. We'll see that as we look at some of the other

87
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,520
 passages of Scripture today, but if we're trying to give for other reasons, if

88
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,080
 we're trying to give in order to look good in front of other people or in

89
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:40,320
 order to somehow make ourselves feel better or in order to give ourselves a

90
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:46,200
 reputation or any of those other reasons, that's ultimately going to be something

91
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:51,360
 that's self-defeating. It's not going to accomplish the purpose of glorifying God

92
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,080
 and of loving others in our lives very well, because it's selfish. It's

93
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,040
 focused on ourselves, and so our giving really needs to be motivated by God's

94
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:05,520
 goodness in our lives, and as we see what God has done for us, we respond to that.

95
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:11,400
 We're able to give with the right heart, a heart that gives freely and

96
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:17,160
 gives with a motivation to glorify God. The next thing I want us to see is that

97
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:24,360
 our generosity is not dependent on our own abundance or lack, and this is

98
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,120
 important for us to think about. I know in my own life, that's one of the most

99
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:33,960
 simple excuses that I often find to not give to someone else, and as I said,

100
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:39,080
 whether I'm talking about giving my money or some material possession or if

101
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,760
 I'm talking about giving some of my time or some of my energy into a

102
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:47,720
 relationship or some of my presence in someone else's life or giving

103
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:53,640
 forgiveness or giving some of my skills and talents, one of the easiest

104
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:59,040
 excuses for me is to say, "Well, I don't really have that much. I can't

105
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,680
 really give into this because I don't have that much. I don't have that much

106
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:09,040
 material resources to give or I'm kind of tired right now and so I don't feel

107
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:14,520
 like I have the energy to give or I don't want to give of my skill because

108
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:20,800
 I'm not that skilled in that area." Obviously, there are limitations that we

109
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,800
 all have in terms of time and our resources, and so I understand that, but

110
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,960
 at the same time, we have to understand that God is more interested in our heart

111
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:36,440
 than He is in our resources. We see this illustrated really well in the

112
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:42,080
 story that's in Mark chapter 12. This is verses 41 to 44, and I'll read these to

113
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,480
 you. It says, "And he sat down opposite the treasury and watched the people putting

114
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,720
 money into the offering box. Many rich people put in large sums, and a poor

115
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,200
 widow came and put in two small copper coins which make a penny. And he called

116
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,840
 his disciples to him and said to them, 'Truly I say to you, this poor widow has

117
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,720
 put in more than all those who are contributing to the offering box, for

118
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,000
 they all contributed out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty has

119
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,160
 put in everything she had, all she had to live on.'" And this is Jesus who's telling

120
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:18,040
 His disciples that she's given more than anyone else because she's given out of

121
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:24,200
 her poverty and she's given with a genuine and sincere heart. And that

122
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:29,400
 story is really a powerful reminder to us that we may look at our life and say,

123
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,480
 "Well, I don't have a lot to give right now. I don't have a lot of material

124
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,320
 resources to give, or I don't have a lot of extra time, or I'm not really

125
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:43,120
 skilled in that area." You know, someone has a need in their life that's kind of

126
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,080
 in a specific area, and that's not something I'm good at. It's not so much

127
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,920
 about what you have or don't have. It's not about your abundance or your lack.

128
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:57,160
 It's really about your heart and are you gonna respond to God with a heart that

129
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,160
 is genuine and that says, "You know what? I want to love someone else. I

130
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,280
 want to help. I want to serve. I want to be a part of what God is doing, and I'm

131
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:09,120
 doing that because of God's goodness in my own life." And if you respond in that

132
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:18,240
 way, then whatever you have to give will, it'll count. It'll be a blessing.

133
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,120
 It'll help someone else. It will be something that honors and glorifies God.

134
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:28,560
 And that's really clear in this passage. So don't let that stop you.

135
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:34,080
 Don't say, "Well, I don't really have a lot right now." Or another version of that

136
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,480
 that I've used a lot in my life is sometimes I've said, "Well, I'd love to

137
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,880
 give in this area, but I'm gonna wait until I get more in this area of my life

138
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,880
 or in some other part of my life, and then I'll feel free to give." And again, a

139
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:50,840
 lot of times that's just an excuse. I've been there myself where then I've

140
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:55,840
 gotten to that point that I wanted to be at in terms of resources or in

141
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:00,480
 terms of time, and then I still didn't give. So don't let your feelings of

142
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,880
 saying, "I don't have enough," keep you from giving. Begin to give, and if you

143
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,840
 don't have much to give, that's fine. This lady in the story Jesus told,

144
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:15,480
 this poor widow, gave very little. What she gave wasn't going to be noticed by

145
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,920
 anyone in terms of the amount, but it wasn't the amount that was significant.

146
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,920
 It was her heart and the fact that she was giving with the right heart. Another

147
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,480
 thing that's very simple but it's really clear in Scripture is that our

148
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:34,920
 generosity as followers of Jesus, if we have generosity, if we freely give with a

149
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,480
 right heart in response to God's goodness, that generosity leads to reward.

150
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:44,040
 And this principle is throughout Scripture. There's a couple verses in the

151
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:48,480
 Old Testament that are real clear about this. Psalms 112 5 says, "It is well with

152
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,440
 the man who deals generously and lends who conducts his affairs with justice."

153
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,720
 Proverbs 22 9 says, "The generous will themselves be blessed, for they share

154
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,760
 their food with the poor." Now we don't give in order to get a reward.

155
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,200
 If that's our motivation, then as I said at the beginning, it's gonna end up

156
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:13,200
 being self-defeating. We're not gonna experience God's goodness and

157
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,960
 glorifying Him in the way we want to. But Scripture is clear. There is a reward if

158
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:22,600
 we will be generous with the right heart, if we'll care for others, if we will

159
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:27,360
 choose to give of our time and our energy and our presence and our

160
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:33,280
 giftedness and our resources with a right heart responding to God's work in

161
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:38,800
 our lives, then there will be a reward from that. God will bless us and give us

162
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:45,120
 peace and oftentimes give us provision. And I think that's significant. Sometimes

163
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,840
 in that first point that we discussed, we say, "I'm not sure I can do this right

164
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:54,880
 now because I don't have a whole lot." And sometimes we find ourselves

165
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:00,120
 finding out that as we begin to obey God and be generous in the way that He is

166
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:06,280
 putting on our heart, that God provides for us in another way and we have more

167
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:12,760
 than we thought. Whether it's resources or energy or even those talents and

168
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:17,480
 skills that God's gifted us with, we find out that God fills in what we

169
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:22,160
 perceive as lack in a lot of other ways when we just begin to be obedient in

170
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:28,880
 practicing generosity and in giving. And I want us to see as well that our

171
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,920
 generosity helps to break the hold of material possessions on our souls. And

172
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:41,520
 this is big. We live in a world that's a very material world. The things that are

173
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:47,640
 important to us that can really grab a hold of our focus and our

174
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:53,040
 attention and our time and our relationships, they're material things.

175
00:14:53,040 --> 00:15:00,640
 And we're not supposed to be enslaved to material things. We're not. As followers

176
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,480
 of Jesus, we're supposed to have a heavenly perspective and see that the

177
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,120
 eternal things are more important than the material things. We're supposed to be

178
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:12,320
 able to see that people's lives and their relationship to God and our

179
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,200
 relationship to God is much more important than the things that we

180
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:19,760
 possess or the jobs that we have or the titles that go after our name. All that

181
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,160
 different material stuff. We're supposed to have a different perspective but it's

182
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:30,280
 easy to get caught up in everything going on around us in the world that we

183
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:38,480
 live in and to begin to have material things grab a hold of us and to begin to

184
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,000
 commit all of our time and our energy and those gifts that God has given us.

185
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,680
 Instead of using those gifts to glorify God and to give to others, we can end

186
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:51,720
 up just using those gifts to pursue material possessions and to pursue our

187
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:58,080
 own reputation, to pursue our own ambition, our own pride. And one of the

188
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:03,280
 beautiful things about obeying God and generosity is that it helps break that

189
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:10,040
 hold. We find ourselves saying, "I know I'm supposed to give but it's kind of hard

190
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:15,280
 because I want to keep this for myself." That's that hold the material possessions

191
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:19,600
 have on our soul or that earthly thinking and pride and ambition and

192
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:25,760
 things like that have on our soul. But as we begin to obey and to give, we find

193
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:30,160
 ourselves saying, "You know what? I guess that really wasn't as important as I

194
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:36,600
 thought it was and now that I'm giving it away, it's not holding on to me

195
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,880
 as much and I'm able to see that I didn't really need that as much as I

196
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:45,760
 thought in the first place or that thing I was pursuing in my life. It isn't as

197
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:51,000
 big of a deal as I thought it was." And it's important for us to give for

198
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:58,160
 that reason. In 1 Timothy 6 verses 17 and 19 it says this, "As for the rich in this

199
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:04,280
 present age, charge them not to be haughty," or that word means proud, "nor to

200
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,000
 set their hopes on the uncertainty of riches, but on God who richly provides

201
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,800
 us with everything to enjoy. They are to do good, to be rich in good works, to be

202
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,480
 generous and ready to share, thus storing up treasures for themselves as a good

203
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:22,120
 foundation for the future so that they may take hold of that which is truly

204
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:28,480
 life." And in that passage, there's instructions being given to the church,

205
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,080
 to the body of Christ, and there's a whole lot of really good stuff in here.

206
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,400
 He's saying if you're a rich person in this present age, he means if you're rich

207
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:42,480
 in the world's goods and the common definition of what we would think of as

208
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:48,640
 wealth and rich. First of all, he doesn't say like if you're rich, you're evil and

209
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,840
 you have to burn all your stuff. He doesn't say that. He doesn't say it's

210
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:57,840
 sinful to have material possessions, but he says that it can be unhealthy and it

211
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,080
 can be sinful. So he says if you are one of these people that's wealthy in this

212
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:07,320
 present age, don't be proud or arrogant about it. Don't set your hope or your

213
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:12,000
 security or your sense of stability on those material possessions because

214
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,880
 obviously, as we know from other parts of Scripture, they can rot, they can be

215
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:22,200
 stolen, they can disappear. But he says to set your hope on God because God is the

216
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,800
 one who richly provides you with everything that you enjoy. If you have

217
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:34,080
 material possessions that you enjoy and you enjoy your games and your toys,

218
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,480
 whatever they are, if you're a young person, maybe they're Legos. If you're an

219
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:42,600
 adult, maybe it's a boat or a car or something like that. But if you have

220
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,960
 those things that you enjoy, if you have experiences that you enjoy, if God has

221
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,640
 blessed you in some way, you need to understand that God is the one who has

222
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:54,120
 provided you with everything that you enjoy anyway. And then in verse 18, he

223
00:18:54,120 --> 00:19:01,560
 says you should do good and be rich in good works. You should have an abundance

224
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:06,920
 of good works, not just of material possessions, but have an abundance of

225
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:14,000
 works and actions that honor God. And it says be generous and ready to share. And

226
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,800
 as you do that, then you're storing up treasures for yourself as a good

227
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:23,800
 foundation for the future in verse 19. And then at the end of the verse 19, he

228
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,800
 says, so that they may take hold of that which is truly life. And I love that part

229
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,880
 of the verse. He's saying if you're just caught up in the material possessions

230
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:37,520
 and what they mean to you, you're not really living. And if you begin to obey

231
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:44,240
 God and being generous and in freely giving out of God's goodness, then you're

232
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,960
 gonna begin to truly experience life and experience joy and experience peace and

233
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:54,720
 actual real contentment. And all of these things that are gonna be really healthy

234
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:01,840
 and good for you come as you give. And it begins to break that hold of material

235
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,040
 possessions and material aspirations on your soul, and you begin to be free from

236
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:11,720
 those things. Another thing for us to see is that our generosity should not have

237
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:19,320
 strings attached. In 2nd Corinthians 9, it talks about giving. We'll look at these

238
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:26,280
 verses more a little bit later on, but in verse 7, it says, each one must give as

239
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:30,720
 he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God

240
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:36,400
 loves a cheerful giver. And we need to understand that when we decide to

241
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,400
 respond to God's goodness by giving, whether it's giving of our possessions

242
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,720
 or our time or whatever, we shouldn't do that with strings attached. If we're

243
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,960
 being obedient to God and giving to someone else, then we just need to give

244
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:55,400
 and not be worried about what follows. And a lot of times, even as followers of

245
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:00,600
 Jesus, as believers in Christ, we can give with strings attached. We can say, "Well,

246
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:05,160
 yeah, I feel like God's putting on my heart to give financially to someone

247
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:11,400
 else, but they don't use it in a way that I think is right. You know, I'm never

248
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:16,240
 giving to them again." Or we can say, "Yeah, I feel like God really wants me to give

249
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,960
 some of my time to this person in this relationship, and they're hurting and

250
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,960
 they're going through something, and I really know that God wants me to

251
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:30,080
 give and be generous with my time and my presence and my energy. But once I

252
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,080
 started doing that, you know, they didn't really respond how I wanted them to, and

253
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:39,800
 so I think I'm done with it. I don't want to give any more time to them." Or, "Yeah, I

254
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:45,480
 felt like God wanted me to give some of my talents, and I began to share

255
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:50,800
 those talents with people in my church or in my community, but no one really

256
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:55,160
 appreciated it the way I thought they were going to, and so I think I'm done

257
00:21:55,160 --> 00:22:00,920
 giving." There are so many ways that we give with strings attached, and we don't

258
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:06,320
 always realize that, and that's not how we should give. If we're giving as a

259
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:12,000
 response to God's goodness, our only motivation is to honor God and to

260
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,280
 rejoice in what he's done for us, and it shouldn't matter how the gift is

261
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:21,120
 received or how it's used or whether we get praised or recognized for it. And I

262
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,600
 understand that all of us want that. I do too. That's normal. It's human nature. We

263
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:30,560
 want the gift to be used well. We want to be recognized for it. We want for it to

264
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:36,360
 be received well. I get that, but we have to learn to let go of that and say, "I'm

265
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:40,200
 just gonna give in response to God's work in my life. I'm gonna give in

266
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:46,240
 obedience to him. I'm gonna give because Jesus has freely given to me, and there

267
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,160
 are no strings attached, and if it goes great, then I'm gonna praise God and

268
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:55,160
 rejoice for that, and if people appreciate what I've done, then I'm gonna

269
00:22:55,160 --> 00:23:00,120
 be grateful for that. But if no one seems to appreciate my gift or recognize it

270
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:05,640
 and it's not even received well, that's okay. I didn't give it to get

271
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:09,480
 something in return. I gave it out of obedience to God, and there are no

272
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:15,640
 strings attached. Another thing we should consider is that our generosity should

273
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:22,400
 align with kingdom values. Malachi 3.10 is a verse that talks a lot about giving,

274
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,200
 and this one that is quoted a lot. It says, "Bring the whole tithe into the

275
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,880
 storehouse that there may be food in my house. Test me in this, says the Lord

276
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:34,240
 Almighty, and see if I will not throw open the floodgates of heaven and pour

277
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:39,480
 out so much blessing that there will not be room enough to store it." That verse is

278
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:43,880
 a lot of times talked about in the context of giving so that God

279
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:49,960
 will give back to you, and that is a part of what is portrayed in this

280
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,200
 verse. But I just want us to think about the beginning of this verse. It says,

281
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,880
 "Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse." God is calling his people to

282
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,960
 give, but he's calling his people to give into his kingdom and into the work that

283
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:06,860
 he is doing, and I think that's important for us to consider as well. That if we

284
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:10,160
 say, "Okay, I want to give some of my material possessions or my time or my

285
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:16,280
 energy or I want to give some of my skills," we should ask ourselves, "How can

286
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:21,040
 I give those in a way that aligns with the values of the kingdom? How can I give

287
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:26,920
 those in a way that honors God and glorifies him and aligns with the work

288
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:34,120
 that he is doing in the world around me?" And sometimes you may say, "Well, I feel

289
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:39,900
 called to a certain place or a certain type of service. I feel called to be

290
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:45,180
 involved in a specific way," and that's great. And as you explore that, you may

291
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:48,840
 say, "Okay, there's some different- there's an organization that's a part of this

292
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:52,160
 that I could partner with or there's some other group that's doing

293
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:56,640
 this work that I could be a part of." And I think this is a great question for us

294
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,260
 to ask as we look at those opportunities to say, "Okay, well does this

295
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:05,760
 organization or this group or this movement, does it align with some of the

296
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:12,040
 values of the kingdom?" Because if not, then maybe it's not the place for us to

297
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:17,840
 invest and to practice obedience to God through generosity. We know we're

298
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:22,320
 supposed to be doing this. We know we're supposed to be giving. That's clear. But

299
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,920
 it is important where we give and what we're giving to and what we're

300
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:31,200
 partnering with and participating in. And one of the beautiful things is in most

301
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:37,520
 any kind of domain of culture, if there's something you want to be a part of that

302
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:42,040
 God puts on your heart, you'll probably be able to find a Christian group that's

303
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:48,040
 engaged in that area. A lot of the biggest relief organizations and things

304
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:54,720
 like that in the world, especially in the western part of the world, started out as

305
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,880
 Christian groups. So there's a whole lot of groups that you can find and say, "Hey,

306
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,880
 these people are doing good work and it aligns with the values of the kingdom

307
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:07,280
 and I can be a part of this." But sometimes, maybe not. Sometimes you say,

308
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,040
 "Okay, well this is the issue that God's put on my heart that I really want to

309
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:14,120
 give to financially or I want to give my time and energy to or my skills to." But

310
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,880
 there's not really anything in this space that aligns with kingdom values

311
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,280
 and some of the things going on in this space actually are a little bit in

312
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:27,680
 opposition to kingdom values. Well don't be afraid to let God draw you into that

313
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:34,960
 space and start something new and to say, "Hey, it's time for something to happen in

314
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,840
 this space that allows people to use their gifts and their generosity to

315
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:45,360
 glorify God and to point to Jesus at the same time and to align with the values

316
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:51,120
 of the kingdom." That might be a part of what God is doing in your heart and why

317
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,280
 God is stirring your generosity in the first place is maybe to meet a need that

318
00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:00,680
 no one else is meeting or maybe to meet a need that people are responding

319
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:05,440
 to but no one is responding to it with the love of Christ and with the values

320
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,280
 of the kingdom. So I think that's a great question for us to consider as well as

321
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:15,520
 we think about generosity is how can we give our time and our energy and our

322
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:22,240
 resources in a way that really aligns with the value of the kingdom. And a

323
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,560
 similar one that's real clear in Scripture is that our generosity should

324
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:31,720
 be in Jesus's name. Mark 9 41 says this, "Truly I tell you, anyone who gives you a

325
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:36,400
 cup of water in my name because you belong to the Messiah will certainly not

326
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:43,080
 lose their reward." And I think that's powerful. Our generosity should be in the

327
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:47,560
 name of Jesus. That doesn't mean that everything we do we have to tell someone

328
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:51,840
 about Jesus or tell them, "Hey, this is in the name of Jesus," or obviously there's

329
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:56,720
 a lot of acts of generosity that God's gonna put before us and call us to and

330
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,160
 allow us to be a part of that we won't be able to share that and that's fine.

331
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:06,280
 But any time that we can, we should let people know that this is done in Jesus's

332
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:13,360
 name on one level or another. First of all because that glorifies God, but

333
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,480
 secondly because it gives people an opportunity to see that it's not just

334
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:23,280
 you out there being a good person and trying to do something great for someone

335
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:28,160
 else, but it's actually the love of Christ that's in you and that's at work

336
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:35,400
 causing you to care for someone else. And that gives the people who are a part of

337
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:39,760
 that generosity an opportunity to respond not just to you but to respond

338
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:44,080
 to the love of Christ and to say, "Oh wow, this impacted my life and it meant

339
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,680
 something to me and I see now that it's not just because this person gave to me

340
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:53,640
 because they're a cool person but it was because of Jesus." And what does

341
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:57,920
 that mean? What does it mean that Jesus would love me and that he would motivate

342
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:01,440
 someone I don't even know to give to me or to get involved in my life or to care

343
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:07,160
 for me in some way? It opens a door for other people to be connected with God

344
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:13,240
 and to hear the message of love and forgiveness and grace that Jesus has for

345
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:19,640
 them. And so I think anytime we can, we should practice our generosity in the

346
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:25,320
 name of Jesus. And then one more, we'll just do one more today and we'll finish

347
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:28,400
 up the rest in a future message because there's a lot of good stuff here about

348
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:33,480
 generosity, but our generosity should always be to glorify God and that's

349
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:40,560
 really important. In Peter, in the first chapter of 2nd Peter verses 2 and 3, it

350
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,800
 says, "This grace and peace be yours in abundance through the knowledge of God

351
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:47,760
 and of Jesus our Lord. His divine power has given us everything we need for a

352
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,960
 godly life through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and

353
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:58,440
 goodness." Peter's saying, "Hey, anything that you are able to do in response to

354
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:02,640
 God that is good for others, that's coming through the divine power of

355
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,560
 Christ anyway. So don't go out there and act like it's you. Don't go out there and

356
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:11,000
 do good works in your family or your community or in the lives of your

357
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,400
 friends or with other people and give them your time and energy and resources

358
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:19,960
 and then act like, 'Yeah, I'm just a great person. That's why I'm doing this.' It's

359
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:25,920
 not. It's not you. And if it is, if it's centered on you, then it's not gonna be

360
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:29,840
 healthy anyway. It's gonna end up hurting someone else or it's gonna end up

361
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:35,840
 hurting you. Do those things because God is the one who enables you to do it and

362
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:40,080
 give the glory to him. You know in Matthew 6, we talked about this when we

363
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,360
 did the Kingdom Values study during the pandemic, but the first four verses here

364
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:47,720
 Jesus says, "Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to

365
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:52,760
 be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven. So

366
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:56,040
 when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets as the

367
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:59,800
 hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets to be honored by others.

368
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:05,520
 Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. But when you give

369
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:09,320
 to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing so

370
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:12,240
 that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father who sees what is done in

371
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,720
 secret will reward you." That's a Kingdom Value for generosity right

372
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:24,200
 there. Do it to honor God and to truly love your neighbor and don't let

373
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,320
 anybody see it. Don't let people know what you're doing. That's one of the best

374
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:33,560
 ways to love and serve and care for others and to give your time and to give

375
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:39,120
 your energy and to give your resources and to give of your skills and talents

376
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:46,560
 and abilities is in a way that's not gonna lead to you being recognized or

377
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:52,600
 you being put on some type of pedestal. Give in a way that God is glorified and

378
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:59,240
 that other people are truly empowered and enabled and that you don't end up

379
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:03,120
 being the hero of the story because you're not the hero of the story. Jesus

380
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:09,360
 is the hero of the story and we want to always practice our generosity in that

381
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:13,880
 way. There's a lot more. We'll talk about some of this in the future. I'll finish

382
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:17,280
 up this message talking about generosity. But generosity is such a powerful

383
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:21,680
 Kingdom Value. It's so clear in Scripture that our lives as followers of Jesus

384
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:27,680
 should be defined by it. That we should really be generous and overwhelmingly

385
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:32,720
 radically generous. And as we began discussing this morning, it's because God

386
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:37,200
 has been overwhelming and radically good to us. And we should respond to that

387
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:42,800
 goodness by freely giving to others. And we should ask God to really enable us

388
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:47,080
 and empower us to do it in the right way so that it honors him and it truly loves

389
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:52,840
 the people around us. Let's pray. God, we thank you first of all for how you have

390
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:59,520
 freely given to us. God, your grace and your forgiveness are things that we

391
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:05,760
 could never have earned and we could never have deserved. And yet you freely

392
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:11,160
 gave them to us. All of us have fallen short, have made mistakes, have sinned,

393
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:20,360
 have messed up. And yet through Christ, you wiped those things away. You cleaned

394
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:26,320
 up our past. You erased our sins and you opened the pathway to relationship with

395
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:31,780
 the God who created us and loved us. And that's the deepest wonder of the

396
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:38,880
 universe, but it's also the most amazing gift of the universe. And God, we have, if

397
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,320
 we are followers of Jesus, if we've entered into that relationship with you,

398
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:49,720
 then we have already received a gift that is really of unspeakable worth. We

399
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:55,320
 can't even begin to comprehend, much less communicate, how much worth is contained

400
00:33:55,320 --> 00:34:02,040
 in the gift of grace and forgiveness. And so God, may we, out of response to that

401
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:08,960
 overwhelming goodness in our lives, may we begin to give to others freely. May we

402
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:16,120
 begin to lead lives that are defined by generosity and by a spirit that freely

403
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:21,880
 gives of our money, our material possessions, but also our time, our energy,

404
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,880
 our presence, our skills, our...
