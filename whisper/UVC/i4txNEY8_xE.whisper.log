[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.320]   So that's the announcements.
[00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.500]   Again, we come before the word of God.
[00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.500]   We gonna turn to the book of Matthew,
[00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.480]   the gospel of Matthew.
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.080]   So if you have your phone app or you have your Bible,
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.980]   turn to Matthew 24, Matthew 24.
[00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.860]   Last days, according to Jesus, okay?
[00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.900]   Last time I was talking about this,
[00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.440]   the Olivet Discourse.
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.360]   It's a long sermon that Jesus gave.
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.360]   What signs will happen when the Temple of Jerusalem
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.040]   was destroyed?
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.520]   So Matthew 24, the Olivet Discourse,
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.920]   is related to the broad subject of eschatology,
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.040]   the end time, right?
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.960]   The end time.
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.520]   It's not complicated, but this word comes from
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.480]   the Greek term eschaton, right, as you remember.
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.240]   It's about the end.
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.260]   It's about the end.
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.040]   So here Jesus is answering questions
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.880]   posted by his disciples.
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.640]   What would happen when the Temple of Jerusalem was destroyed?
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.600]   What are the signs?
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.400]   And then what are the signs of his second coming?
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.360]   So two questions are lumped together,
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.360]   and Jesus is giving answer to this twofold questions.
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.040]   He is talking about a list of signs.
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.020]   So conveniently, I list it here.
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.680]   You will see false prophets.
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.640]   You will see wars and rumors of wars,
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.140]   earthquakes, persecutions,
[00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.500]   and many people will turn away from faith.
[00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.580]   Their love will grow cold,
[00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.160]   and the gospel will reach to the end of the earth,
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.360]   and there will be unusual astronomical phenomena.
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.760]   The sun and the moon and stars,
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.880]   they will behave differently or unusually.
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.160]   As I told you before, if we understand the background,
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.520]   the context of first century,
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.880]   especially 8030 to 8070, what happened there,
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.800]   all the signs happened before 8070,
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.480]   or around that time.
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.280]   So the first generation of Christians,
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.640]   they have every good reason to expect
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.880]   the second coming of Christ in their own lifetime.
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.160]   Jesus Christ is coming back any time.
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.240]   So no more signs is needed.
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.960]   Sometimes you may have heard some prophecy teachers
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.520]   telling you things like, okay, we are watching for this sign.
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.960]   You know, we are getting closer and closer.
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.920]   But look at what Jesus said, 2430.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.920]   At that time, the sign of the Son of Man
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.920]   will appear in the sky,
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.280]   and all the nations of the earth will mourn.
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.680]   They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.400]   with power and great glory.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.960]   Now Jesus gave a list of signs.
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.320]   He said, this is a list of signs that you guys,
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.800]   the first disciples, will see before 8070,
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.080]   or around that time.
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.560]   So all the signs are already visible.
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.920]   You don't need to wait for another sign.
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.920]   As I said, some of the prophecy teachers today
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.480]   will be telling you, there was a sign we are watching,
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.520]   there was a sign we are waiting for, the end is coming.
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.360]   Jesus said, no.
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.520]   Some of the prophecy teachers will tell you,
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.920]   especially these days, you know,
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.840]   there were a lot of unrest around the world.
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.240]   Some will tell you, okay, Russia invading Ukraine
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.480]   is another sign fulfilled before the second coming.
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.000]   No, this is bogus, this is bogus.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.200]   No need to wait for another sign.
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.200]   Jesus said, the next sign you will see
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.440]   is the sign of the Son of Man's second coming.
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.120]   By the time you see the next sign, it will be too late.
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.360]   It will be too late.
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.080]   So that's why he is trying to convince,
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.080]   trying to teach us how to be prepared for his second coming.
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.640]   Preparing for the second coming of Christ,
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.800]   not by looking for another sign.
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.480]   All the signs we have seen, right?
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.880]   Especially even, you look around the world,
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.600]   there are many things similar
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.780]   to the list of signs happening right before our eyes.
[00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.120]   Yes, of course, because we have seen it
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.800]   in the first century already.
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.400]   So how do we prepare for the second coming?
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.000]   Not by looking for another sign,
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.560]   but by preparing in our own lives.
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.680]   Okay, let's continue with this chapter 24, 36.
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.120]   Jesus said, no one knows about that hour, that day,
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.920]   that day of his second coming,
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.800]   not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son himself,
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:59.040]   but only the Father, only God the Father.
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:04.040]   He determines, he plans, he knows the time of the eschaton.
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.680]   Only he knows.
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:13.760]   So you would not know, even the prophecy teachers these days.
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.260]   You hear here now from time to time,
[00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.800]   some prophecy teachers will tell you,
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.800]   okay, they can calculate the exact day
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.800]   and time of second coming of Christ.
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.560]   Don't believe that, they are false prophets.
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.120]   No one knows about the day and the hour,
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.360]   not even the angels, nor the Son, only the Father.
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.640]   37, as it was in the days of Noah.
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.600]   So it will be the coming of the Son of Man.
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.080]   For in the day before the flood,
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.440]   people were eating and drinking,
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.000]   marrying and giving in marriage,
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.720]   up to the day Noah entered the ark.
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.320]   They knew nothing about what would happen
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.120]   until the flood came and took them all away.
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.860]   This is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.
[00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:13.400]   What it will be like when Jesus comes back is unexpected.
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.880]   The day of the second coming of Christ is sudden.
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.080]   You would not know, I would not know.
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:25.080]   And Jesus likens his second coming to the days of Noah.
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.280]   Remember this story?
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.600]   Okay, our Bible study will go through that story later.
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.960]   Genesis 6 to 8.
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.440]   Chapter 6 to 8 of the book of Genesis.
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.400]   Talking about the great massive flood
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.880]   coming in the days of Noah.
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.680]   And when the flood comes,
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.080]   when the water swifts away some people,
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:49.240]   nobody knew, nobody expected it.
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:54.000]   And Jesus has described what the people were doing
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.320]   in the days of Noah.
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.660]   People were going through their daily routine as normal.
[00:06:58.660 --> 00:06:59.640]   Right?
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.260]   We will be working, business as usual.
[00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:06.120]   But when the flood comes unexpectedly,
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.320]   it swipes them away.
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.000]   Two men will be in the field.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.520]   One will be taken away, the other left behind.
[00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:22.280]   Two women will be grinding with a hand mill.
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.500]   One will be taken and the other left.
[00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.900]   Therefore, keep watch because you do not know
[00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:30.320]   on what day your Lord will come.
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.280]   Now some will use this passage
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.100]   to support a theory called rapture.
[00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:38.560]   Right?
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.760]   You probably have heard of that, right?
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.160]   If you have never heard of that, that's good.
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.000]   All right?
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.320]   Because it's confusing.
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.800]   Some of you may have heard that some people
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:51.080]   use this passage to support so-called rapture.
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:54.200]   Now simply put, what rapture theory talks about
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:58.000]   is that when Christ comes again,
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.920]   he will come first in secret.
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:03.080]   So nobody knows all the earth,
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.760]   all the people would not know.
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.440]   He will come in secrecy.
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:11.280]   And when he comes in secret,
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:14.960]   he will snatch away some people
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:18.760]   and some people will suddenly disappear off the earth
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:22.960]   and leave it behind those who do not believe in Jesus.
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.000]   And that seven years of disaster,
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.440]   intense disasters will befall the earth.
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.040]   It will kick in the seven years,
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:34.560]   the last seven years of human history.
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:37.080]   Now if you read this passage carefully,
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.240]   I don't think the passage is teaching that.
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:41.720]   I don't think the passage is teaching
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.240]   that Jesus is coming in secrecy
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:46.240]   and that will snatch away some people
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:49.320]   and the left behind are those who are doomed.
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.160]   You read this passage carefully,
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.920]   two men are working in the field,
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.360]   one will be taken and the other left.
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.960]   Now in the ancient society,
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:02.800]   men are working outside on farmlands, right?
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.900]   Sometimes father and son working together.
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.800]   One will be taken away, perishing.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:12.400]   Because Jesus is talking about the flood.
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.240]   The flood will take some people away.
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:18.320]   And then those who are not being taken away,
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:21.600]   those are the people who are left behind.
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:25.160]   So in that sense, it's good to be left behind, right?
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.400]   'Cause you don't want to be taken away,
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:29.600]   taken away by the flood.
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:34.840]   Two women will be grinding with a hand mill.
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.920]   Now sometimes, most of the time in the ancient society,
[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:41.880]   the women will work inside the house.
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:45.080]   So the hand mill is two big stone,
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.600]   you know, on top of one another,
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:50.000]   and then you kind of turn it, right?
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.960]   So two women will be working together,
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.960]   you know, opposite, sitting opposite against one another.
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:59.320]   Probably a mother and a daughter.
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:02.440]   One will turn 180 degree,
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:06.640]   and the other person will turn the other 180 degree.
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:09.240]   And then come back on and on and on.
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.040]   Hand mill, moving the hand mill,
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.720]   turning the stone again and again,
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.000]   it's daily routine.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.360]   One will be taken away,
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:21.480]   and the other will be left behind.
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.480]   So if you read this passage carefully,
[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.200]   it is good to be left behind, right?
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:29.120]   Because the flood will take away
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.640]   those who are unprepared for judgment.
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:37.640]   Only Noah and his family in the ark
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:42.120]   were left behind, and they were safe.
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:47.240]   All the rest of the people were being taken away.
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:51.280]   That would be like the future,
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:55.080]   day of the second coming of Christ.
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:58.600]   Nobody knows, business as usual, right?
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.720]   Look at this chart.
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:02.960]   I wanna ask you the question,
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.840]   where are we right now?
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.200]   Now this is the New Testament
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.360]   or the biblical concept of time.
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:14.200]   This is the biblical concept of history.
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:18.800]   It is, as I said before,
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.120]   we are living in between the first coming
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:25.400]   and the second coming of Christ.
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:28.080]   We are living right in between,
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.320]   between the first and second coming.
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:34.520]   We are in this last period of human history.
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:37.800]   We can call it already, but not yet.
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.120]   Already the kingdom of God,
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.240]   the future kingdom of God
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:44.640]   has already in breaking into our history.
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:47.840]   And we are getting closer and closer to the end,
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.400]   getting closer to the eschaton.
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:55.000]   Now one important takeaway from this chart
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:00.520]   is that the biblical concept of time is always linear.
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:05.840]   If you flip the Bible, if you study the Bible,
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:11.960]   you understand the Bible has its own concept,
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:17.440]   perspective on time, our time, human history.
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.160]   And it is linear.
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.720]   It is not cyclic.
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:27.120]   It is not recurring again and again and again
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.760]   as some Eastern philosophies
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:32.260]   or Eastern religions have taught us.
[00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:37.200]   It is not coming back and coming back and coming back again.
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.640]   Not reincarnation, no.
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:41.640]   Not recurrence of eternity, no.
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:46.320]   The biblical concept of time is linear.
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:51.000]   It is going toward an end, the eschaton.
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:57.080]   So in the Bible, human history,
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:00.440]   time has the ultimate purpose.
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:03.080]   There's a destination in human history.
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:06.960]   We're going forward, coming to the end,
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.880]   reaching the eschaton.
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.960]   And when the eschaton comes,
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.800]   the second coming of Christ, the yellow arrow,
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.760]   the second coming of Christ,
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:17.560]   the new heaven and the new earth
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:21.680]   as revealed in the book of Revelation will come,
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:22.800]   will be reality.
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:28.800]   So we are all moving toward the end.
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:34.600]   Practically speaking, there are two ways.
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:38.600]   There are two ways you and I will see Jesus.
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.360]   Okay, there are only two ways.
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.960]   The first way, of course,
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:45.400]   is the second coming of Christ, right?
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.880]   That's what the New Testament, the olive discourse,
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:52.280]   what Jesus taught about on Mount Olive,
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:54.200]   are telling you.
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:56.960]   The end of the age is coming to the end,
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:59.840]   will be conclude at the second coming of Christ.
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.680]   And we will all see God face to face.
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:06.360]   If he comes today, before this sermon ends, okay,
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:07.880]   we will see him face to face.
[00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:10.880]   That's one practical way we will see Jesus.
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:13.800]   And we will all, and each and every one of us,
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:18.040]   will need to give an account of our whole life.
[00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:19.600]   That's one way.
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.600]   The second way we will see Jesus,
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:26.800]   is that when your life ends,
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:33.440]   often without warning, often without warning.
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:38.160]   Friday night, last week, I received a text
[00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:40.920]   from one of my pastoral staff,
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:47.240]   a brother I know from another church up north.
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.800]   I've known him for years.
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:51.880]   No signs of warning.
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:56.360]   He isn't that old, okay?
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:59.000]   He's pretty healthy.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.400]   He was at home last Friday,
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:05.440]   but all of a sudden he fell unconscious.
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.280]   All of a sudden.
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:10.800]   His wife is trying to wake him up, right?
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.720]   But she was not able to wake him up.
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:16.880]   He's now in critical condition.
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.240]   So we were praying for him.
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:22.600]   Since Friday night, and the latest news I know
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:26.200]   is that he's not hospitalized.
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.920]   He got out of the hospital, thank God.
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:30.320]   So he's heading home.
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:33.280]   But it's a wake up call.
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:38.200]   That our life will end, right?
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.720]   You guys all younger than me, you would say,
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:43.120]   "Heh, you go first," right?
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:47.320]   No, not necessarily.
[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.520]   If you go to cemetery,
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:54.120]   you look at the years on the tombstones, right?
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.960]   Many of them are younger than you.
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:02.840]   Have you ever taken a tour to cemetery?
[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:05.320]   I remember I was in Vancouver.
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:07.040]   I was leading a youth group, right?
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:10.640]   There was one Friday night I got a creative idea
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:14.600]   because there was cemetery by the church, you know?
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.640]   So we took a tour.
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:20.880]   We took a tour at night to the cemetery.
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:23.440]   So I assigned the students.
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:26.240]   They were about 20, 25.
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:28.440]   So I gave them assignment.
[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:31.800]   I said, "Go around and survey the cemetery.
[00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:35.560]   "Write down the years of their birth and their death.
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.040]   "Come back, report to me."
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:41.880]   You know, no surprise.
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:45.200]   They found quite a few younger than them.
[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:48.640]   Young people, right, high schoolers.
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:52.400]   Take a tour to cemetery.
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:55.560]   So we got caught, right?
[00:16:55.560 --> 00:17:00.560]   We all need to give an account to God himself, right?
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:03.920]   Two ways you will see Jesus face to face.
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:06.120]   The yellow arrow, he comes.
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:07.720]   Everybody will see him face to face.
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:09.040]   Give an account.
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:11.920]   Second practical way is that you go see him, right?
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:13.960]   You go see him first.
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:18.240]   Ultimately, it's the same
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:20.320]   because we all need to give an account.
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:26.080]   2444, Jesus said, "So you must be ready
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:30.120]   "because the Son of Man will come at an hour
[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:32.840]   "when you do not expect it."
[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:37.400]   When you do not expect, he will come.
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:42.080]   Again, eschatology in the New Testament
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:44.800]   is not teaching us to escape.
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:49.360]   It's not teaching us to get away from this world, right?
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:51.040]   Oh, this world is so much trouble.
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:53.760]   I would rather Jesus come and then I would escape, right?
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.080]   I don't need to go to work tomorrow, right?
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:59.600]   I don't need to deal with this or that trouble tomorrow.
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:00.800]   That's not the spirit.
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:03.480]   That's not the essence of eschatology.
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:08.480]   The teaching of end time is not to help us to escape, right?
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:11.200]   It's to help us to engage.
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.680]   It's to help us to participate
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:18.360]   into what God is doing in this world.
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:22.640]   To fulfill his will, to use our gifts.
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:25.120]   So the Bible never tells us, right,
[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:27.680]   to sell everything of yours,
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:30.920]   do nothing and wait for the second coming.
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:34.040]   The Bible never does that.
[00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:37.760]   The first generation of disciples, they never did that.
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:39.560]   Even though they saw all the signs
[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:43.400]   and they rightly expect the second coming of Christ
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:46.160]   happening in their lifetime.
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.680]   They never just quit their job
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:52.480]   and just go to the mountain and wait for Jesus to come.
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:53.800]   They engage in their lives.
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:54.880]   They preach the gospel.
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:57.120]   They use their gifts to build up the church.
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:01.880]   They go everywhere with the gospel, right?
[00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:05.520]   They have good works out of their faith.
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:09.000]   It's to engage, it's not to escape.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.680]   That is why after all this teaching,
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:17.840]   in the end of chapter 24 to 25,
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:21.240]   Jesus has a series of parables.
[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:24.120]   Now these are the key points.
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:28.600]   Sometimes our focus is on the signs, right?
[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.320]   Oh, there's another war coming.
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:32.400]   There's rumors of war, right?
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.680]   There are earthquakes and all that, right?
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:37.160]   Sometimes our focus are being driven
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:41.400]   to those sensational stuff, right?
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:45.800]   All this end time talk are usually sensational,
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.680]   trying to get your attention,
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:52.680]   trying to shift your focus away from this world, right?
[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:58.000]   Not looking for another sign, but Jesus focus on what?
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.400]   That is the conclusion of his entire two chapter long
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:05.000]   teaching on the last days.
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:09.160]   He taught us a series of four parables here.
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:14.640]   The first parable, 24, 45 to 51,
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:17.280]   parable of faithful and wise servant.
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:23.760]   Always ready to give an account to his master.
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:28.000]   When his master comes back, he is able to give an account.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.200]   The second parable, the 10 virgins,
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:36.200]   or more appropriately, is more like bridesmaids.
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:40.160]   As according to the Palestinian wedding custom
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:43.000]   of first century, they have tons of bridesmaids
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.200]   waiting for the groom to come back
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.040]   from another village, right?
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:51.440]   When the groom leaves the village to the bride's village
[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:55.820]   to pick up the bride, to come back often at night,
[00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:57.520]   often because of the celebration
[00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:01.120]   and because of the good time that they had,
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:04.360]   the groom will arrive late.
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:07.160]   And the bridesmaid of the groom's village
[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:10.840]   will have to be prepared with the oil ready
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:13.720]   because often he will come back at night.
[00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:18.760]   And you have your torch and your oil ready at all times.
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:21.600]   Stay watchful for the groom's coming.
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:27.460]   The five wise bridesmaid, they got oil prepared.
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:31.520]   Even the groom comes back delayed.
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:34.880]   They are ready to go out and welcome
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:36.560]   and to be part of the banquet.
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:41.560]   The five foolish one, they did not have the oil ready.
[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:44.460]   So they could not enter the banquet.
[00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:50.840]   The third parable, 25, 14 to 30, parable of talents.
[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:55.080]   The master's giving his money and trust them
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.640]   to three of his servants.
[00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:02.560]   One give 5,000, the other one 2,000, the other one 1,000.
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:04.880]   The two with 5,000 and 2,000,
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:09.880]   they invest the money to increase the asset of the master.
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:18.080]   The third one took the 1,000 and bury it under the ground.
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:24.960]   And then the parable says, after a long time,
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:31.120]   long delayed period of time, the master comes back.
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:36.560]   The 5,000, 2,000, they gave double of the asset.
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:39.880]   The 1,000 are being cast away.
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:44.200]   Not prepared to give an account.
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:47.560]   Wasted the talent that the master has given him.
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:52.160]   Now again, it's using the first century context
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:53.320]   to tell the parable.
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:58.720]   But the essence, the teaching is easy to grasp.
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:05.360]   Is that God has given us and entrusted talents
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:07.640]   and treasures into our lives.
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:12.160]   Are we, in light of his coming,
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:16.320]   are we investing and doing everything we can
[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:21.060]   to increase the asset of the master's property?
[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:25.760]   As we build the church together,
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:27.880]   as we preach the gospel,
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:30.760]   as we build up our spiritual life, right,
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:32.960]   become more mature disciples,
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:35.960]   we're building up the asset of the master.
[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:39.560]   We're building up the kingdom of God, right?
[00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:43.400]   And trusted with the talent.
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:48.200]   You and I need to work to increase the value of the kingdom.
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:53.960]   The last parable, the sheep and the goats.
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:57.560]   Yes, when Christ comes again,
[00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:00.240]   he is the shepherd.
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.060]   He can separate.
[00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:07.060]   He can tell who is real and who is not real question.
[00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:14.920]   No, it's easy to look like a question, right?
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:19.040]   I mean, don't you know if you've been to church
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:22.920]   for some time, you can act like a question.
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:28.040]   And maybe you act like a question to the point
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:30.320]   that you thought you were really a question.
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:35.200]   Because it's easy to just follow a script, right?
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:39.520]   Sing the song, right?
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:40.360]   It's very easy.
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:44.160]   Most of the songs that the leaders are leading us
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:46.800]   are usually easy to follow.
[00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:50.200]   We can all sing, right?
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:53.520]   We can all pray the same prayers, right?
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:56.680]   We can all read the same Bible.
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:25:02.840]   We can all do many things, right?
[00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:05.840]   But externally, we look the same.
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:12.060]   However, at the core, we need to confront ourselves
[00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:14.520]   whether we are acting like a question
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:18.760]   or are we being a question.
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:21.320]   It's not about doing.
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:25.200]   It's our internal being,
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:30.200]   whether we really have a personal saving relationship
[00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:34.680]   with our Lord Jesus Christ, right?
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:37.600]   And that's why Good Friday is so important.
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:40.440]   Because one day each year,
[00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:45.620]   it's not a meaningless routine or ritual
[00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:50.460]   that we just go with the motion
[00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:52.980]   and thought that we're okay.
[00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:58.660]   Good Friday, why do we call Good Friday?
[00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:02.620]   But what's so good because a man die on the cross, right?
[00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:04.120]   There's nothing good about it.
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:06.460]   But if you think about it,
[00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:11.460]   what the Son of God has done on the cross,
[00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:16.900]   it is good for you who receive.
[00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:19.500]   It's good for me.
[00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:24.500]   It's grace for me that I can be called
[00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:26.420]   the son or daughter of God.
[00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:30.020]   It's a reflection time,
[00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:33.820]   it's a time of reminder to confront ourselves
[00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:35.740]   whether our call is real.
[00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:38.140]   Right?
[00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:41.260]   You know, in many other parables in the book of Matthew,
[00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:46.620]   Jesus said in the last day, when Jesus comes back,
[00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:51.660]   there were many who approach Jesus and say,
[00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:53.860]   "I know you, I serve you,
[00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:56.780]   "I even cast out a demon in your name."
[00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:57.620]   Right?
[00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:00.260]   You know what did Jesus say?
[00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:04.700]   He said, "I don't know you."
[00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:09.740]   Because not everyone call me Lord, Lord,
[00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:11.260]   will enter the kingdom.
[00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:15.540]   Only those who listen to my word and do my will,
[00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:18.260]   and they will be wise.
[00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:21.420]   They will be wise and they will be ready
[00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:23.260]   to come into the kingdom.
[00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:29.020]   So four parables, one after another,
[00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:32.380]   and trying to push us, trying to confront us
[00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:34.340]   with the ultimate question of life.
[00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:36.420]   Right?
[00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:39.060]   Whether we are truly related to God,
[00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:44.060]   whether we are ready and prepared for the kingdom.
[00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:48.780]   Last time I asked you the three Ts,
[00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:55.060]   your time, your treasure, and your talent.
[00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:58.660]   Where is your heart?
[00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:04.140]   You know, Jesus said where your treasure is,
[00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:05.620]   where your heart is, right?
[00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:08.780]   You can lie to yourself.
[00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:11.700]   Where's your time?
[00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:14.220]   Do you manage your time well?
[00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:18.860]   So that you can use your time to extend,
[00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:22.660]   to increase, to extend the kingdom of God.
[00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:26.940]   Your talents, right?
[00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:29.660]   Every one of us has talent, right?
[00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:33.220]   Some of us have $5,000, some of us have $2,000,
[00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:36.780]   some have $1,000, but there's no comparison here.
[00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:39.620]   Because remember what the parable says, right?
[00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:43.420]   The one who received $5,000 gave $5,000, double.
[00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:46.300]   The other one who received $2,000 gave doubles,
[00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:49.500]   that's $4,000, right?
[00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:52.180]   God is calling us not to be a fanfare.
[00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:56.740]   God is calling us to be faithful, right?
[00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:58.940]   Faithful to what he entrusts to us.
[00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:03.180]   So these questions I give it to you.
[00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:08.420]   Let's be prayerful and be reminded,
[00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:10.820]   are we truly related to Jesus Christ?
[00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:12.380]   Are we listening?
[00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:14.060]   Are we doing his will?
[00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:16.340]   Are we prepared for his return?
[00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:19.380]   Let's all pray together.
[00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:27.740]   Jesus, you are the son of God.
[00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:31.020]   The glorious son of God.
[00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:36.380]   And you will return someday, unexpectedly.
[00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:39.500]   You will come.
[00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:43.540]   Because we know that you came.
[00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:46.180]   You came the first time.
[00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:52.060]   To die on the cross, to raise from the dead,
[00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:56.060]   to accomplish salvation, the glorious salvation
[00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:57.980]   for all of us who believe.
[00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:00.540]   Yes, you came.
[00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:05.260]   That's why we know you will come.
[00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:08.780]   According to your word and promises,
[00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:13.460]   your second coming will happen anytime.
[00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:17.140]   Or we will see you anytime.
[00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:23.420]   And Jesus remind us to be your faithful and wise servant.
[00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:27.940]   Help us to examine what we have,
[00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:30.180]   our time, our talent, our treasure.
[00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:37.940]   Help us to ask the question,
[00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:42.580]   are we using all that you have entrusted to us
[00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:44.860]   to increase the asset of your kingdom?
[00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:50.100]   To help extend, advance your kingdom.
[00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:57.820]   Jesus, help us to be alert and to be watchful
[00:30:57.820 --> 00:30:58.660]   at all time.
[00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:04.340]   Live every single one of our days
[00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:06.340]   responsibly and faithfully.
[00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:11.060]   To do all things that will be pleasing to you.
[00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:16.580]   May you continue to grow our faith and grow our church
[00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:21.220]   so that your name will be exalted in Christ's name we pray.
[00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:25.900]   All right, guys, hope to see you again soon.
