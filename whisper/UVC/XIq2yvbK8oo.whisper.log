[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   to bring the word to us.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Does love have an open door?
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   Welcome stranger
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   Give us your tired and poor
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   All those in need
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   Come every weary soul
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   Find your haven, liberty is
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   For all who can breathe free
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   Oh what a beautiful world, what a beautiful world
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   Oh what a beautiful world, what a beautiful world
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   Welcome to America!
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   Does love have an open door?
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   Welcome stranger
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   Does love have an open door?
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   All those in need
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   Oh what a beautiful world
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   We're here!
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   Oh what a beautiful world
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Oh what a beautiful world, what a beautiful world
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Welcome stranger
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Welcome stranger
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   Welcome stranger
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Well it's great to be with you here today.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   I feel like it's been a while though
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   when I realized pulling into the parking lot that
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   there was another church that had parking and there were signs about where I could park and couldn't park
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   and you know even being in this time post-pandemic and yet new waves of the pandemic
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   ministry has just changed tremendously during this time.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   The video that you saw really represents what my work is these days with World Relief.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   World Relief is a local global organization so we are based here in Chicagoland
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   but we have offices in 16 locations around the United States.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   I'm off to the Sacramento office to speak here coming up.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Mark I know has some root there.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   And then we have 20 offices around the globe
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   so we're involved in quite a few settings.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   But the subject matter that I'm speaking to you today about is really something that is dear to my heart
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   not just something that I do for my job.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   And yet I also respect the fact that we're in a pulpit here
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   that this is a place where God's word is conveyed.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   So you don't want to, I don't want you to hear me doing an infomercial.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   I really want you to hear the scriptures today as we speak together.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   And yet I think it will weave well with the conversations that we have around
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   what's happening in our world and the mass displacement of people.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   You may have heard this famous quote before.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   I'm wondering if it's one you're familiar with.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   The quote is, "Each of them is Jesus in disguise."
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Each of them is Jesus in disguise.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   This was Mother Teresa's explanation of her ministry serving the poorest of the poor
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   in Calcutta, India.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   This is what she said of the vulnerable people that she encountered
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   amidst her own struggles and doubts about her faith.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Her life's work, no matter how poor or destitute those she worked with were,
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   was to see them as they truly are, as blessed children bearing God's image
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   no matter where they've come from or who they are.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   Brandon Heath, a contemporary Christian artist known for at least two hits,
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   "Give Me Your Eyes" and "The Light in Me,"
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   was moved by Mother Teresa's words to write a song in 2008 called "Jesus in Disguise."
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Yet today, when I hear the words "disguise" and "vulnerable people,"
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   it's not about ministry these days.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   It's about fear.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   Fear of people who have been displaced.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   They are labeled as a haven for terrorists who are intent on harming us
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   but disguising themselves to sneak into our country.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   In light of 9/11 this weekend, I can certainly see our reasons for caution here.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   But a couple things I think that we should know,
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   and that is that it's not likely that our country would have that happen through those we serve.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Our country's track record on refugee resettlement is a strong and stable work.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   Three million people have actually been brought into this country over the past 30, 40 years now,
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   since 1980 with the Refugee Act, and not one citizen has died at the hands of a refugee.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   So that vetting process has been pretty thorough and extensive through the years.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   Inciting fear of certain people in blanket ways to cast blame on them is bigotry and racism,
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   and it should not be tolerated and should not happen, especially among those of us that are Christians.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Our country and its leaders have not always gotten that right either, and for that I do apologize.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   This is not an easy topic, though, I want to say to you to discuss,
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   so I pray that you hear what I say in the right spirit.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Just as it is the government's responsibility to properly vet people that are entering this country,
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   it is the Christian's responsibility to welcome the stranger.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   If we expect the government to do their job, then we should do ours.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   Most of us who identify as Christians have never really thought about migration or forced migration in particular,
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   but it's in the Bible. From its beginning, in the book of Genesis,
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   we find a man and a woman violating the laws of the land and placed in removal from the Garden of Eden,
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   which is forced displacement. At the end of the Bible, we find John writing the book of Revelation in Patmos,
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   where he is exiled as an expatriate for his beliefs.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   The Bible is full of story after story of forcibly displaced people.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   Joseph was forcibly displaced as a victim of human trafficking.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   Moses was forcibly displaced for taking justice in his own hands.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Moses certainly carried that out. David was forcibly displaced as a political refugee on the run from King Saul for 12 years of his life.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   And Jesus was forcibly displaced to Egypt with his family soon after his birth to find safety from profiling and ethnic cleansing as a refugee.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   And the first missionary in the Bible, if we think of it this way, Philip ran from Samaria or ran to Samaria
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   because of religious persecution that had broken out in the city of Jerusalem.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   Priscilla and Aquila, who were Paul's business partners and ministry partners together,
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   were forcibly displaced to leave Rome and go to Corinth because of their beliefs.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   That's how Paul met them, is because Caesar had thrown out all of the Jews from Rome.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Forced displacement is in the Bible, but very few Christians have recognized it or understood what it means for us and how we treat them.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   World Relief for Us has a 40-day Bible reading and prayer challenge just to help churches understand more of our responsibilities in this area
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   before God regarding the strangers that are in our midst.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   Most Christians just have not had their eyes open to this reality.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   I think one of the main reasons that we see that this day and these attitudes is because of a lack of biblical education around this area.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   But the other thing that I see that we're living in today is a time of great media influence.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   And media is extremely powerful in these days.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   Polling data really tells us today that Christians are more influenced by media and by politics than they are by the Bible and by their faith
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   when it comes particularly to this issue.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   I can tell you though story after story of lives that have been changed by welcoming our newer neighbors.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   The Bible is clear. There is no question with the new society that Jesus brought in that we are to welcome strangers.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   Matthew 25 is probably one of those signature texts, one of those greatest texts to point this out to us.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   I believe the church needs to really wake up to this reality and our responsibility before God to do what we can to help.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   So this morning I'd like us to look more closely at Jesus' words in Matthew chapter 25.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   We're going to be looking at the end of that chapter beginning in verse 31 when God brings true justice to all of the world.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   I'd like to read to you the words of Jesus beginning in verse 31 of Matthew 25.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   It says there, "But when the Son of Man comes in His glory and all the angels with Him, then He will sit on His glorious throne
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   and all the nations will be gathered in His presence.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   And He will separate the people as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   And He will place the sheep on His right hand and He will place the goats on His left.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   And then the King will say to those who are on His right, 'Come, you who are blessed by the Father,
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the creation of the world.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   For I was hungry and you fed me. I was thirsty and you gave me drink.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   I was a stranger and you invited me into your home. I was naked and you gave me clothing.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   I was sick and you cared for me. I was in prison and you visited me.'
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   Then these righteous ones will reply, 'Lord, when did we ever see you hungry and feed you,
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   or thirsty and give you something to drink, or even a stranger and show you hospitality,
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   or naked and give you clothing? When did we ever see you sick in prison and visit you?'
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   And the King will say, 'I tell you the truth, when you did it for one of the least of these, my brothers and sisters,
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   you were doing it to me.'
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   Then the King will turn to those that are on His left and He'll say, 'Away with you, you cursed ones,
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and the demons.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   For I was hungry and you didn't feed me. I was thirsty and you didn't give me a drink.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   I was a stranger and you didn't invite me into your home.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   I was naked and you didn't even give me clothing.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   I was sick and in prison and you didn't visit me there.'
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   Then they will reply, 'Lord, when did we ever see you sick or thirsty or hungry or stranger or naked and not help you?'
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   And He will answer, 'I tell you the truth, when you refused to help the least of these, my brothers and sisters,
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   you were refusing to help me.'
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   And they will go away into internal punishment, but the righteous will go into eternal life."
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   So let me just break this apart a bit for us to think about what the teaching here that Jesus is giving.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   Really the immediate setting that we see here is the passage is the throne room of God for the entire world.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   It's the place where all of ruling of society will happen and that throne room is God's throne room.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   There's a broader setting though here in this particular text and the broader setting is the end of time.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   All things have been finished and time has come to an end.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   But there's a greater challenge even being extended just beyond this section of Scripture in this whole chapter.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   Because we have here the parable of the ten virgins, we have the parable of the three servants, all in this chapter.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   And the broader challenge is that we need to be well prepared and using what we've been given wisely.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   The characters introduced to us here, other than Jesus, are the angels who were with Him
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   and all the nations that have been gathered together in Jesus' presence.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   Imagine that experience.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   All of the nations gathered, I can't even fathom what it would be like to see all of the nations gathered together before Jesus.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   And He is center stage in this.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   He's center stage in the scene that we're hearing here in all of His glory preparing for the final judgment.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   The opening scene and the only scene in this picture is Jesus sorting things out.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   In particular, Jesus as the chief shepherd is separating the sheep from the goats, the blessed from the cursed,
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   those who will go into eternal punishment and those who will go into eternal life.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   What's at risk?
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   Well, both futures and a vast inheritance that's been prepared before creation began.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   But note this, very interesting.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   An inheritance is not something that is earned, is it?
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   But it's something that's given.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   So Jesus is sharing His Father's inheritance by His choice,
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   not as some earned income for what these people have done to deserve that inheritance that He's given them.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   Yet the fundamental character of those who receive this inheritance and those who won't
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   are those who are blessed and those who are cursed, their character couldn't be more different.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   The difference seems to center on those who are willing to help and those who are not.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   Ones whose hearts are tender toward those who are vulnerable around them
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   and those whose hearts have become calloused, whose love has grown cold toward those hurting around them.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   Today, we might call it compassion fatigue.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   With all the suffering we see and are exposed to in our globally collected community,
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   it certainly requires of us great discernment, supernatural power,
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   and even seeing God as our source to respond appropriately to all of these situations that we see,
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   asking God to help us so that we might help others.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   In what ways are we supposed to help?
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   Well, we might think about the grand things that we should be doing,
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   but really this passage of scripture is super practical.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   Pretty much it means just meet basic needs, nothing very extravagant.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   Give someone some food or give them some drink if they're hungry and thirsty.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   If someone's a stranger, find a way to make them feel welcome.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   If they don't have clothing, give them some clothes to wear.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   If they're sick, care for them.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   If they're in prison, go to see them.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   These all sound like really simple actions, but they are essential for life.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   But why should we do this?
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   Why should we be engaged in this kind of good behavior that we think is here?
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   And it's so interesting how Jesus really challenges us to think about it.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   He says we should do this because he identifies so closely with these vulnerable people
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   that the very act of helping them is helping him.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   What are the consequences?
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   Well, the consequences are pretty stark here.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   The cursed are sent away empty-handed into eternal punishment,
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   and the blessed are invited to come to receive the inheritance of eternal life.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   Pretty stark differences there.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   So let me ask this really as we close here.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   I want us to think about making sure that what I'm sharing with you is on good theological footing.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   So I want to really draw my conclusions from Baker's Evangelical Dictionary of Biblical Theology.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   It sounds a pretty credible source for finding this kind of conclusion.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   And it's specifically the words of a Chicago theologian whose name is Scott McKnight.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   And he says this about these Bible verses that we're looking at here today.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   "Jesus demanded that his followers obey him,
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   and that those who were obedient to his will would be called the righteous.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   It's also the case that he called his followers to live a life of love,
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   love for God and love for others.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   As Jesus compared--showed his compassion for others by healing them and helping them,
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   so Jesus called on us to do the very same thing.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   As Jesus was willing to reach out to help people of all nations,
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   so the disciples are charged to make their love transnational in nature.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   Thus the foundation of the tension of the church that it had with Israel
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   over the symbolic value of the nation of Israel
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   may have really rooted Jesus' teaching to love and minister to all nations,
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   not just to Israel.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   This universal love would be a fundamental factor we see here in the final judgment of God."
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   So what's he saying there?
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   He's saying, according to Jesus, loving God by loving others is the greatest commandment.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   And doing it among the nations may be one of the greatest challenges for the church today.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   Jesus said in John's Gospel that the world will know us by our love,
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   and our love for God is expressed in how we love our neighbor.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   But who's our neighbor?
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   Well, fortunately, Jesus answers that question too, doesn't he, in the Scriptures.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   In Luke's Gospel, Jesus says that a loving neighbor is best illustrated by the Good Samaritan,
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   a person who shows mercy to an injured person he doesn't even know,
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   maybe not even respected,
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   and doesn't even share his faith as the priest and the Levite did who passed him by.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   May I say to you today, you and I are that injured person on the side of the road,
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   left for dead in our sins until Jesus showed up and showed us mercy.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   He extended a helping hand to us and gave generously so that you might be well cared for
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   and enjoy the riches of eternal life.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   The big question is this, though.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   Should you and I do anything less for someone who's in a similar situation?
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   And how do we show our love?
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   Very simply, we meet real needs we see in very tangible ways.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   Expecting nothing in return until the final judgment when Jesus will make all things right.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   So may I suggest to you one way you might respond to this eminent need,
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   and an eminent need that's in our own backyard right now as people begin arriving this fall.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   So please watch this video and consider what God would have you do.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   By now we have all seen videos and photos of the evolving crisis in Afghanistan.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   We have heard about the many thousands of people who have been forced to leave behind everything they have or have known.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   People who bear the image of God.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   If you are anything like me, it breaks your heart and makes you ask, "What can I do? How can I help?"
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   At Water Libra, we understand, we believe that you are meant to be a force for good right here in Chicagoland.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   Over the past 20 years, we have guided churches and individuals to welcome, befriend,
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   and help support over 9,000 Afghan immigrants in vulnerable situations in communities all across our nation.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   Over 500 here in Chicagoland.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   Right now, Water Libra is actively preparing to accept 750 people from all over the world to Chicagoland in the coming year.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   There's over 150 coming from Afghanistan.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   We need you.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   This is how you help.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   Pray. Pray for people fleeing Afghanistan and other conflict zones around the world.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   Pray for those who have recently arrived here in Chicagoland.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   And pray that God will reveal how you should respond.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   Volunteer. Gather others from your church to serve in high-need volunteer roles.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   The most urgent needs are on our website.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   Donate needed items.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   Together, we can furnish the apartments of every refugee family who arrives to Chicagoland through Water Libra.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   Give. Financial donations provide many of the vital services and ongoing supports needed by those arriving from Afghanistan and other parts of the world.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   All of these ways to partner are outlined on our website, along with how to register for Here to Welcome, an ongoing way to learn more and get involved.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   We believe in the church.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   We believe that we are called to support in moments of crisis like the situation in Afghanistan and the earthquake in Haiti.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   We look forward to continuing to share with you how you can help change the world.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   There are displaced people all over the world.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   In fact, the current numbers that I see are about one person every two seconds being displaced in the world,
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   which brings us to almost 80 million people.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   People all across Asia, people across Europe.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   We see famines that have created movements of people, earthquakes and hurricanes that move people around.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   Maybe what we're talking about here locally is not where your heart is.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   Maybe your heart is for another group of people who've been displaced, whatever part of the world you're in.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   What's God calling you to do as a result?
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   How is he calling you to act to be his hands and his feet and really to care for him as you care for others?
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   Let me pray for us.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   Father in heaven, we thank you so much for the challenge that we have from your son Jesus and how we care and love others.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   Lord, we know that the world will know us by our love,
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   and so I pray that we would not be characterized as people who make stereotypes and maybe lay aside or turn the other way
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   when we see situations that are difficult, but we step into them and we act in ways that you've called us to act.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   I love the way in the scriptures at the Church of Macedonia that it says that they helped with what they were able
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   and beyond what they were able because of the generosity of their hearts.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   I pray, Lord, that our hearts would not be cold,
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   but that our hearts would be warm toward those who are vulnerable around us and find ways to help them
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   and bring glory to you and serve you as we serve them.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   Thanks so much for this day, God.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   Speak to us and instruct us, even as we saw at Pentecost, challenge our hearts to the things that you would have us do.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   And I pray all of this now in Jesus' name.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   Amen.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
