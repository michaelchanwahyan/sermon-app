[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   Right here?
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   All right.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   Okay.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Today we're going to look at a passage that I had asked Kelly.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   I said, "Hey, Kelly, when was the last time you preached this passage?"
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   Because I wanted to make sure that it's been two years since we looked at Judges chapter 6.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   And when I first looked at the story of Judges 6 with Gideon,
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   we looked at the idea of tearing down the altars and putting the proper altar in its place.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   But today we're going to talk about a topic that I think applies to every single one of us in the room,
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   is the idea of work.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   60% of all of our time throughout the entire week is spent at a job.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   And a lot of times within that job, some of us may love what we do.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   Some of us may just sit in there and say, "Man, is this all there is to my life? I hate my job."
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   And we're left wondering, "Lord, what is it that you're calling us to do in the idea of work?"
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   Faith, work, integration is so important for us as Christ followers
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   because we do that all the time for a good chunk of the rest of our lives.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   We're at work until you decide to retire.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   Whether it's at 60 or whether it's 75 or 80 years old, you will be working.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   And I wish that some of us were probably sitting there, could be like David,
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   where Samuel calls out and is trying to select the next king.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   And David shows up and he whispers to David, "You're going to be the next king."
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   But it doesn't always happen, does it?
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Some of us are like Joseph, where we kind of land in exactly at a time when God uses us.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Joseph is a guy that for some odd reason, his brother sold him into slavery.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   And now he is a slave.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   And somehow or another, God has given him the skills to rise up in the ranks in the palace
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   of where he sold in slavery.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   But then his boss's wife accuses him of sexual malpractice and that he's thrown into prison.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   And later on, because of all the things that are happening,
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   he rises up to be the chief of staff in the political system.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Some of us are like Nehemiah, who is a cupbearer to the king.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   He tastes food so that the king, his boss, doesn't get poisoned.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   And somehow or another, God uses the cupbearer to the king
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   to then rebuild the walls of Jerusalem because he has given him that burden.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Or then some of us look at the two tax collectors in the Gospels.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   There's the tax collector of Matthew, where Jesus says to Matthew,
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   "Pack up everything and follow me."
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   But yet at the same time, he says to Zacchaeus, who climbs up a tree to see him,
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   "I want you to follow me by staying as a tax collector."
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   So how do you know when to be a tax collector?
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   How do you know when to drop everything and follow Jesus?
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   How do you know when to be a king?
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   How do you know when to do all these different things?
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   All of us are on the journey, aren't we?
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Some of us are called to be like Pastor Mark is a full-time vocational ministry.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Some people are called to be a stay-at-home mom.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Some people are called to be a teacher or a nurse.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Some people are called to be an engineer, an entrepreneur.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   How do we begin to know what God has gifted us to be?
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   And it becomes a journey that he leads all of us on.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   And sometimes within the journey, there's different chapters in our life within that journey.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   And within those chapters, is that where you want me to be?
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Maybe, but maybe not.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   And so sometimes he'll ask us to pivot, and 20 years from now, we'll look back at our life and say,
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   "Wow, that's what you've been preparing me for."
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   I think I've told all of you guys I spent the first 10 years of my life building cell towers.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Then from that point on, I spent about three years working in a Korean church,
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   while at the same time, also at that point in time before that,
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   serving in a church over in Chinatown at CCUC.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   And then from that point, I worked at Moody Bible Institute for a number of three years.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   And then now for the last 10 years, I work at Resource Global,
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   and Wheaton College, Northern Seminary for a period of time.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Lord, is that what you're calling me to do?
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   I thought it was building cell towers, or rather that.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   I went to college thinking I was going to medical school.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   God calls us to do different things.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   So today, he calls this particular person,
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   and we're going to look at that person,
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   and we're going to glean some stories that he talks in.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   What the whole idea is, what is God calling you to do right now?
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   And can you and I be faithful to where God has placed us in?
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Because God, for a period of time, has called you at that point in time,
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   at that point in place, to make a difference for the gospel.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   We start in Judges 6.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   I studied this for a number of years.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   And it is such a powerful--it begins with this whole idea,
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   "The people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the Lord.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   And the Lord gave them into the hand of Midian for seven years.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   And the hand of Midian overpowered Israel.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   And because of Midian, the people of Israel made for themselves
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   the debris that are in the mountains and the caves and the strongholds.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   For whenever the Israelites planted crops to Midianites and the Amalekites
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   and the people of the east would come up against them.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   They would encamp against them and devour the produce of the land as far as Gaza
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   and leave no sustenance in Israel and no sheep or ox or donkey.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   For they would come up with their livestock in their tents.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   They would come like locusts in numbers.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Both they and their camels could not be counted,
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   so that they laid waste to land as they came in.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   And Israel was brought very low because of Midian.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   And the people of Israel cried out for help in the Lord.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   Don't ever misinterpret how God uses events in our life to turn us back to him.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   And too often with the Israelites, time and time and time again,
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   the Israelites go and do whatever they want to do.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   But yet God uses situations and circumstances in our life
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   to call and draw us back to them.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   And some of those circumstances may be trials in hard times.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   And here we see an example of that in the hands of the Midian.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   When the people of Israel in John chapter, Judges chapter 6, verse 7,
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   when the people of Israel cried out to the Lord on count of the Midianites,
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   the Lord sent a prophet to the people of Israel, and he said to them,
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   "Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel,
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   'I led you up from Egypt and brought you out of the house of bondage,
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   and I delivered you from the hands of the Egyptians
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   and from the hand of all who oppressed you,
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   and drove them out before you and gave you their land.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   And I said to you, 'I am the Lord your God,
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   and you shall not fear the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell,
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   but you have not obeyed my voice.'"
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   And now the angel of the Lord, when the angel of the Lord appears,
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   you listen to him, "came and sat down on the terebth at Oprah," in verse 11,
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   "which belonged to Joash the Abyssalite,
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   while his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the winepress
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   to hide it from the Midianites."
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   And here's a key verse, and we've looked at it before, verse 12,
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   "And the angel of the Lord appeared to him and says to him,
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   'The Lord is with you, O mighty man of valor.'"
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   In verse 12, "The Lord says to him, 'The Lord is with you, O mighty man of valor.'"
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   If you were to look at the NIV, I'm reading from the ESV,
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   if you were to look at the NIV, it says, "O mighty, mighty warrior."
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   "The Lord is with you, O mighty warrior."
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   And when you're looking at that, your first thought is,
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   "Wait a minute, Lord, why are you calling him a mighty warrior?"
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   That is the verse that sticks out.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   Why is the angel of the Lord calling him a mighty warrior?
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   Why is that?
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   He's threshing wheat in a winepress.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   That and being a mighty warrior don't go hand in hand.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   And you're wondering why.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   Because if you go into it, it's harvest time, right?
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   It is harvest time, the wheat is ready to be harvested,
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   and you're pulling out all of the wheat, and you pull out all the stalks
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   and everything like that, and you usually grab all your wheat,
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   and you lay out on top of a threshing floor.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   And a threshing floor is usually an inclined space out in the open,
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   on a hill and everything like that, and you'll understand exactly what it is,
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   and you'll lay out all your wheat on the threshing floor.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   And from that point on, if you have a lot of wheat, you'll get your oxen,
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   you'll get your horses, you'll get all that stuff,
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   and you're going to stomp on it, stomp on it, stomp on it.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   If you have a tiny little harvest, you'll take a little flail or hammer,
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   and you sit there and you'll hit the wheat over and over and over again,
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   and it separates the stalks and it separates the head.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   And from that point on, once you do that, remember it's out in the open,
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   you'll take a little rake or a winnowing fork, and you'll sit there
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   and you'll lift it high and you'll throw it high up in the air.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   And it separates the two areas.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   It separates the heavier grain on one side and the straw on the other side.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   And then there's seed covering the chaff, and as you're throwing it up
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   with this winnowing fork, it's blowing all over.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   And that's why it has to be up on an inclined space out in the open
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   where there's a lot of breeze that blows everything away.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   And that is threshing wheat on the threshing floor.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   But where is this guy at? He's in--what? He's threshing wheat where?
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   In a wine press. What's a wine press?
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   It's literally a hole, a rectangular hole, in which when I stand in there,
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   it goes up to my waist, and you lay out all your grapes right there.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   And you sit there and you stomp on it.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   And there's a little hole which leads to a set of cisterns or jars
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   and everything like that.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   And as soon as you sit there and you stomp on it and you stomp on it
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   and you stomp on it, all the juice rolls into a cistern.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   But yet it's not an inclined space.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   And yet he is threshing wheat. In where?
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   In a wine press.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   And the angel of the Lord, the Lord, the angel of the Lord calls him,
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   "The Lord is with you, mighty warrior."
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   And when you're sitting there in verse 12, looking at it,
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   you're sitting there, "Okay, Lord, what are you seeing?
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   He's not a mighty warrior.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   He's afraid. He's a coward.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   So why are you calling him a mighty warrior?"
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   Two things, two things, two very important things.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   Number one, the Lord sees you differently.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   The how you see yourself and not how others see you.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   The Lord sees you differently to how you see yourself
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   and how others see you.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   The Lord sees in him Gideon, a mighty warrior.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   We see in him a guy who's afraid.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   That's why he's threshing wheat on the wine press.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   We see a guy who's scared.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   We see a guy who lacks courage.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   And we don't understand what God is trying to say to him.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   "The Lord is with you, almighty man of valor.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   The Lord is with you, mighty warrior." Yes!
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   Because God sees you differently
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   to how you see yourselves and how others see you.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   That's number one.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   Number two, in terms of this, God has a name for you.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   God has a purpose for you.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   God has a vision for you.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   For Gideon was a mighty man of valor, mighty warrior.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   What's the name that he has for you?
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   What's the name that you believe that he's calling you to be?
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   If we all sat here in a group and had an exercise
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   and we got a chance to brag each other,
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   and I know a lot of times primarily with us Asians
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   and other stuff is we don't like to talk,
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   we don't like to brag about ourselves,
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   but we are familiar with what skills and gifts we do have.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   What's the name that he's given to you?
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   What vision does he have for your life?
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   For Gideon is the mighty warrior.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   Maybe for Mark, a lot of times, it's leadership
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   or it's shepherding or something like that, administrative.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   Maybe it's the ability to convene people.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   Maybe it's the ability to inspire people.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   Maybe it's the ability to build together a team
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   or whatever it is.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   Maybe a lot of times your intellect is so brilliant
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   because that's how God is going to--
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   he's using you to do things and change education.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   Maybe it's because your skill, you're going to change healthcare.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   Whatever it is, what is that vision?
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   Maybe it's being an engineer to create innovative tools.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   What is that vision in your life?
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   As we continue to seek the Lord,
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   what is he calling us in our life?
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   There's this one lady that I got a chance to meet.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   She's Filipino, and if you came, she's very quiet,
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   and she would just sit there, and you probably wouldn't even know her.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   Her name is Nikki.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   But what you don't know about Nikki is she is a brilliant lady.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   She is extremely talented, teaches part-time at Stanford University.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   Then she's an entrepreneur, started working in education,
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   worked in colleges and universities and the executive level,
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   but then she started realizing she doesn't have a medical degree
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   and all that stuff.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   She was great at entrepreneurial things.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   She was great at starting up and launching different ideas.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   Now she teaches part-time at Stanford.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   She's the founding CEO of a company that is working with
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   artificial intelligence and nanobots to replace--
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   Kelly, what is that thing when you put oxygen in your--
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   - [Kelly] The nasal canthopathy?
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   - Something like that, where it puts oxygen in your--
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   You can breathe through oxygen, right?
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   I completely blanked on it.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   That's what she's working on right now.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   And why in the world was she doing that?
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   Because during COVID, her mother died because she wasn't getting
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   enough oxygen in her body.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   And she's a single older lady, and she started searching
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   while she was in San Francisco with her mother passing away.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   How do we address this problem?
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   Because her mother was at older age, and she wasn't able to get
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   enough oxygen.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   They weren't able to put enough oxygen in her body, and she
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   passed because of COVID.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   And God used that experience as hard as it was as a Christ follower
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   to look and address the problem.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   And she started finding out these different doctors and what they're
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   doing, and through her entrepreneurial skill, launched this entire
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   company that she's doing to change how she integrates her faith
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   in her work.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   What is the name that God has given us?
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   Gideon, it was "Mighty Warrior."
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   What is the name that he has given you?
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   Because how God looks at you, how God sees you, is different than
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   the picture that we see of ourselves and that others see us.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   Go on, and Gideon says to her, "Please, sir, if the Lord is with
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   us, then why then has all this happened to us?
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   And were all his wonderful deeds that our fathers recounted to us
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   saying, 'Did not the Lord bring us up out of Egypt?'
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   But now the Lord has forsaken us and given us into the hand of
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   Midian.'
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   And the Lord turned to him and says, 'Go in this might of yours
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   and save Israel from the hand of Midian.'
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   Do not I send you?'
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   And verse 15, "And he said to him, 'Please, Lord, how can I save
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   Israel?
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   Because my clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   my father's home.'"
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   Take a look at that.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   You know how Gideon saw himself?
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   The angel of the Lord, the Lord sees him as mighty warrior.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   Gideon himself sees him as the weakest clan and him as the
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   weakest in the weakest clan.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   "Behold, my clan is the weakest in Manasseh."
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   Of all these clans that we have here, my clan is the weakest, and
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   I am the least in my father's home.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   You don't understand this.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   My clan of all the clans is the weakest, and I am the weakest in
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   the weakest clan.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   You know where that put me?
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   Dead last, dead last.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   That's how Gideon sees himself.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   That was the name that he has given himself.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   He has defined himself as someone who couldn't accomplish much
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   because I am the weakest in the weakest clan of everyone, and I
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   am last, and what in the world can you do for me?
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   And now here I am threshing wheat in a wine press because I'm
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   scared of the Midianites, and even though this threshing wheat
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   on the threshing floor is not gonna cut it in the threshing,
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   I'll take whatever I can get because my name is defined by
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   being in the weakest clan and me being the weakest.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   What defines you?
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   What are the insecurities that you have?
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   How do you see yourself?
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   How do you look at yourself in the mirror?
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   Are you not the smartest?
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   Are you not the brightest?
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   And you may have all of these ideas, and if you look at the
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   story in verse 16, the Lord said to him, "But I will be with you,
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   and you shall strike the Midianites as one man."
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   Do you not see what's happening here?
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   When you look at the verses, you know what the Lord never says
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   to Gideon?
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   He never disagrees with him.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   When he says to him, "My clan is the weakest, and menace I am,
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   and the weakest in my weakest clan," the Lord never disagrees
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   with him.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   The Lord doesn't say to Gideon, "Hey, hey, hey, hey, your clan's
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   not the weakest.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   So-and-so, I think, is the weaker one.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   Look, you're not the weakest of the weakest clan, all right?
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   Maybe you're not the weakest, but you're not the weakest.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   So-and-so probably is weak."
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   No, he doesn't disagree with him.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   He doesn't say otherwise.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   He agrees with him.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   He says, "Go in the strength that you have."
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   That when you and I sit here, "Lord, I'm not that smart."
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   You know what the Lord says?
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   "I know.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   Lord, I'm not that talented.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   I know.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   Lord, do you not know the history that I came from?
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   Do you not know how bad I was, my family, the path I came in?
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   Yes, I know.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   Lord, I came through a poor family.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   My parents immigrated here.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   My parents immigrated in '72, and a lot of times, I don't know
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   how to operate in these worlds.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   I know.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   You don't have that experience.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   I know, I know, I know.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   Lord, I'm a little socially awkward.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   I get a little shy.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   I don't know what to say.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   I know.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   I know.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   I know.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   You know why I know?
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   Because I made you.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   I created you.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   I painted your life.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   I designed your entire path in your life.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   I know what's going to happen in your life.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   I know these things.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   I gave you your strengths.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   I gave you your weaknesses.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   You're stuck, Gideon, that you just see what you have.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   You come from the weakest clan, and you're the weakest in the
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   weakest clan.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   But despite all that, Gideon, you're a mighty warrior, because
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   that's the vision I have for you.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   What's the vision that he has for your life?
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   And how is that manipulated by sometimes the name that we have
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   given to ourselves?
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   My biggest encouragement to each one of you, and those who are
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   watching, those who are sitting here, don't you ever, ever let
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   anyone say anything, because your age, your sex, the color of
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   your skin, your education, how wealthy you are, how bright you
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   are, the quality of your work, your job title, all of that,
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   don't ever let people look down on you.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   You come before the Lord each and every single day.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   You say, "Lord, what is it that you're calling me to do?
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   And whatever path you ask me to do, I will be faithful to that,
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   and I will give you the best I can to glorify and honor you,
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   because you have called me to do it with excellence and to
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   continue to pursue the calling that you have for your life."
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   And we may not know what that calling is.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   God may not reveal to you what that calling is.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   It may take 20 years.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   It may take five years.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   But we're pursuing every single day, and we are faithful every
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   single day, and we are coming before the Lord to seek what
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   that means.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   Let me give you an example of that.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   Here's an example.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   And I hope as I tell you this story, you're going to sit
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   there, "Tommy, what are you trying to do?"
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   It's not me bragging about myself, but this is what I
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   learned about faith, work, integration, right?
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   When I graduated from Washington University in St.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   Louis, I actually didn't know what I was going to do.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   I had no job.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   And so I got introduced to a guy who introduced me to a
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   company that built cell towers for a living.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   And so a lot of times I got a job.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   I had no engineering degree.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   I was a general management major.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   And a lot of times, where am I going to go to work?
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   I don't know.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   So I get an introduction.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   I get an interview.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   I sat with this guy named Mike Mitchell, and he's a director
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   at Tower Operations.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   Later on, I reported this guy named Dan.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   But Mike sits there, and he looks at my resume, and he
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   says, "Did you have an internship?"
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   "Nope."
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   "Do you have an engineering degree?"
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   "Nope."
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   "Do you have any experience in the cell phone industry?"
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   "Nope."
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   And he puts it down.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   He says, "Tell me why I need to hire you.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   Just give me a reason why."
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   And I said, "There's no reason why you should hire me."
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   And he looks at me, and he says, "Really?"
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   "Yes, there's no reason why you should hire me, but give
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   me one year.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   I will work as hard as I can, and I will give you everything
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   I have, and I will learn this business, and in one year,
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   I will make a difference in this company."
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   He says, "Oh, yeah.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   I like your answer.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   You're hired."
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   And so the first thing that he says, I get to work, and he
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   says, "We just acquired 200 towers from Verizon Wireless,
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   and those cell towers and all the file folders and all the
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   construction drawings all came in, but here's my problem.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   They didn't put any order to it, so they're all in different--
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   they're all in this room.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   Your first job for the next five months, go organize
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   the file room."
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   I'm a college grad from Washington University in St.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   Louis.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   I was a pre-med major.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   You want me to be a file room, yes?
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   And the Lord said to me, "Tommy, wherever I put you, may
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   you be faithful to where I place you."
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   And so I went, and I had the best attitude because, "Lord,
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   I don't know why you put me here, but whatever it is, let
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   me be faithful to where you have put me."
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   And I learned that file room really well, and I learned to
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   tell the difference between FAA, FCC, environmental, structural
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   analysis, everything.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   But what I didn't realize during all that time was God was in
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   the midst of working and creating me the habits, the
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   discipline of looking at details and being organized and seeing
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   structure every single day for five to six months.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   I had to look at these details.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   After that five months was over, a lot of times they promoted me
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   over to scanner guy.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   I had to scan all these documents.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   I said, "Oh, my gosh, I've got to scan everything, create a
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   system to scan everything."
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   So I did that for another four months.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   During that period of time, I had this one guy named Dan.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   He was our project director, and he says, "Tommy, you've done
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   really well.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   Get some files and meet me every single day," and we did this
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   for three months at 5 o'clock, and I will show you what it
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   means to be a project manager.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   We did that for another three months.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   So all together, I'm now in my company for nine months, and
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   after that, they promoted me as project manager with no
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   engineering skills or anything like that.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   Here's a couple of other things as well, too.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   Now I had a rough boss, but, Lord, are you helping me?
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   Are you working with me?
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   Are we faithful to where our -- the one thing I encourage you
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   wherever you are, are you faithful to where God has
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   placed you to be?
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   Here I am as a project manager, and now I am working on the
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   Sprint project, and usually a lot of times you're building
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   20 towers.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   This year, I had to build 40 towers, and then one day, I'm in
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   a deployment meeting at Sprint, and there's this guy named
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   Sonny Peterman.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   He's the vice president of our region.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   Sonny, you should never work for a boss like that.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   The guy was a crook.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   I mean, the guy was just terrorizing.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   So he walks in, and he sits down unannounced, and the guy
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   from Sprint -- now, back in the days, we had audio
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   conferencing and he says to me, "Tommy, can you get this done?"
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   And I said to him, "I will try my best."
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   Sonny then says to the guy at Sprint, "Let me mute you, and
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   I'll get right back to you."
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   And he mutes him, and he says, "Tommy, can you get this job
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   done?"
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   And I said to Sonny, "I will try."
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   And you know what he says to me?
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   "I don't care if you try.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   I didn't hire you to try.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   I hired you to get this job done.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   Now, if you can't get this done, I will fire you right now and
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   replace you with someone who can.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   Can you get the job done?"
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   I says, "I will."
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   And he unmutes me and says, "We'll get the job done."
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   He walks out of there and says, "Always remember, don't try
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   hard.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   Get the job done."
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   And he walks out.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   A year later, and this is the biggest lesson I learned, and it
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   ties in with everything that we're talking about a year
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   later.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   Sonny comes in, and we have an employee gathering, and he says,
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   "This year's Employee of the Year is Tommy Lee."
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   And he says, "Tommy Lee, wherever I go, in all of the
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   travels, and all the -- when I talk with clients like AT&T,
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   Sprint, and Verizon, they all say, 'If Tommy Lee's on the job,
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   we'll hire you and give you the business.'
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   All of the sales development, all of our -- and when I talk
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   with the janitors, they all know who this guy is.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   And then I talk with him, and all of us go out to the bars on
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   Fridays, but this guy goes to his church and works with his
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   youth.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   That's why I hear him.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   And he says to this, he says, "I don't follow Jesus, but if this
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   is what it means to follow Jesus, then sign me up."
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   And he says that.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   And you know what happened after that?
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   I had a girl who comes over to me, and she was my admin.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   And she says, "Tommy, how are you so joyful?
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   I've had three miscarriages.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   How do you see God in the midst of all these things?"
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   I had another guy, his name was Patrick.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   Patrick would go out to the bars all the time.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   Patrick was always getting drunk.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   And he says to me, "Tommy, what keeps you going?
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   What's your purpose in life?
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   Because I haven't found it yet."
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   My boss, Dan, who promoted me as project manager, calls me up one
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   day and says, "Tommy, I need you to stay after work.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   I need to talk with you about something."
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   I walk in after work, and he says, "Hey, Tommy, my daughter
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   has been diagnosed with a heart issue.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   Can you pray for me?
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   Can we spend some time praying?"
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   And during Christmas, I would give their names,
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   give them all Bibles.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   And that was what I did for Christmas, and I would put their
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   name on it and gave it to each one of them.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   And during my cancer journey when I was gone,
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   I got these Facebook messages.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   And this is now 10 years later.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   And I get these Facebook messages.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   One of them was from Erin, the girl who had three miscarriages,
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   and says to me, "Tommy, I have three beautiful daughters now.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   I lead the VBS in their church.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   I came to know the Lord, and I read your Bible.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   Your Bible's still with me."
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   The other guy, Patrick, Patrick says to me, "Tommy, I'm still,
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   like, going out all the time and drinking, but I got married.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   But I did start going to church, and your Bible's the one that I
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   bring to church every single day."
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   Dan, these are all 10 years later, his wife calls me up
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   and says to me, "I saw on Facebook that you were
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   struggling with cancer.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   Your former boss, Dan, is also struggling with cancer.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   Can you call him because your Bible is still sitting right
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   there by his bedside?"
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   You never know how God uses you.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   You never know what God is calling you to do,
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   all because you do your job well.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   And you are faithful to wherever God has called you to be.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   Whether it's a job that you can't stand,
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   whether it's a job that you hate,
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   whether it's a job where you just don't like the industry,
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   where you don't like your characters, all of those things,
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   are you faithful to where God has placed you at?
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   And are you always praying and asking,
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   "What is that vision that you have for me?
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   What are you preparing me to do?"
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   For Gideon, he leads him on this journey.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   This guy who is at the weakest of all of the clans,
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   that he is the weakest, he is the lowest of all the clans,
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   God is preparing him to be the leader of--
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   to fight against the minions.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   He is going to be their victor.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   What is God preparing you to be?
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   And how is God using all the things that you're doing right
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   now in your job to prepare you for what you're doing right now?
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   Because you don't know.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   He may call you now.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   He may be calling you 10 years from now,
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   do something unique or--
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   what he's calling you to do is be faithful.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   If you look at Nehemiah, he didn't call him until the late
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   '70s, but he was faithful as compared to the king.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   And when it was time to rebuild the walls,
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   do you know what the king did?
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   His boss, the king, gave him time off,
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   gave him all the money that he need,
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   gave him all the papers that he need to get all of those
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   different things, and gave him all the resources and materials.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   Why?
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   Because he liked Nehemiah and he had nothing better to do?
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   No.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   He was faithful as compared to the king.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   Do your job well.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   Be faithful day in and day out in your job.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   Make such a difference and impact in your job that you leave
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   a lasting impact on the lives of people around you,
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   that when you walk away from that job,
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   they're going to sit there and say, "Wow, look at that person.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   I'm able to see Jesus through that person."
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   That's what it means to be a Christ follower.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   That means you treat the janitors well.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   That means you treat the admins well.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   That means you treat your boss well.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   That means that every single person you treat well,
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   that you do a good job, that you are productive,
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   that because God has put me in that situation,
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   I will honor my boss by doing my work with such excellence.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   It glorifies God in all that we do.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   And during that time, you are always praying,
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   "Lord, what is that vision that you have given me?
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   What are you calling me to do?"
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   Because God may choose and show you different things
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   that he wants you to do.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   That's so important about faith and work.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   Sixty percent of our day is spent at work.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   God calls us to work.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   God calls us to flourish and redeem.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   God has given you skills and talents to change your city,
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   to change your community, to change your work,
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   to make this world a different place.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   What is God calling you to do?
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   What is the picture and name that he has given you?
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   For Gideon, it was "Mighty Warrior."
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   But too often, our insecurities causes us to look past
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   what God is calling us to do.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   And for Gideon, he had to get past that insecurity
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   of being from the weakest clan
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   and being the weakest in the weakest clan.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   What is God calling you to do?
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   We are motivated by grace.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   We are saved by grace.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   The cross causes us, motivates us to be where we are.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   Our job now is to take that grace that we have in our life
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   and to make a difference in all that we do.
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   In Christ we pray. Amen.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   Father, thank you for how you continue to serve and use us,
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   how you've created us to become the person you want us to be.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   And so, Lord, may you continue to paint that journey over to us
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   and allow us to see what that name that you have given us is, Lord.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   What is that name you have given us?
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   How have you uniquely designed us to flourish
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   and change this world and redeem this world for you?
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   I pray all of us will be in that journey to see you.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   In Christ we pray. Amen.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   Thank you. Thanks, Mark.
