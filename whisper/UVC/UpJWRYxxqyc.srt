1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,720
 him. Thank you and I'm excited to be here today. I love being at UV. I get to see

2
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:20,280
 old friends and new friends every time I'm here and it's really good to be

3
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,720
 back. I haven't been here for a few months. It's been a while but I was here

4
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:29,600
 years ago for a long time for a period of years was here and always a part of

5
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:34,240
 the UV English service so it's really good to be back with you. This morning

6
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:39,880
 we're gonna look at the story of a mother. It is Mother's Day as we've

7
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:45,800
 already noticed and discussed this morning and that's a special day.

8
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,640
 Hopefully you've already had a chance if your mother is living. Hopefully you've

9
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,840
 already had a chance to connect with her and offer some words of appreciation and

10
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:03,720
 gratefulness and encouragement to your mom. My wife is here with our kids.

11
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:10,560
 We have five kids and our oldest is 11 so she's a very busy mom and my mom I

12
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:18,200
 come from a family of 10 kids so I had nine siblings. I've seen a lot of

13
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:24,360
 moms up close who had a lot to do and seen the service that they give and

14
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,920
 that's what we're gonna talk about today how that can be a model for us. I know

15
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:35,360
 not everyone has a mom who models God's love for them. Sometimes our

16
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,040
 relationship to our mom can be painful and if that's your experience that's

17
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,520
 fine that God can heal that and God can can bring us through that and even the

18
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,880
 things that we're gonna talk about today are things that apply really to all of

19
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:53,320
 us and so we're gonna be looking in the first chapter of Luke. We're looking at

20
00:01:53,320 --> 00:02:00,520
 this very famous mom in Scripture, Mary the mother of Jesus and in this passage

21
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:06,600
 we see the beginning of the story of Jesus's physical manifestation and his

22
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,920
 birth here on earth. Now most of us associate this story with Christmas.

23
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:16,200
 We're in Luke chapter 1 we're gonna be looking at verses 26 to 38 and a lot a

24
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,840
 lot of times we think about this story in terms of Christmas and it is that's

25
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,480
 okay it is a part of the Christmas story but this is also the beginning of not

26
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,120
 just Jesus's birth but the beginning of Mary and of what we see of her

27
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,840
 throughout the story of the Gospels and so today we're gonna think about her

28
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,740
 life a little bit and some of the things that we can learn from her life and the

29
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:45,200
 theme of what we're talking about that we see modeled in her is this this heart

30
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:52,080
 attitude this posture of unseen service and we see this in Mary's life and if

31
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,640
 you had a mom who loved you especially if you had a mom who loved Jesus and

32
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:01,360
 loved you I'm sure you saw this in your mom's life. Moms model this so well for

33
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,880
 us this this attitude this posture of unseen service. So let's think about Mary

34
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:13,480
 for a minute. Here she is a seemingly unremarkable young woman. She's a peasant

35
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:20,240
 woman. She doesn't have any wealth, any authority, any position, any status. She's

36
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:27,040
 from one of the most forgotten small villages in Israel, Nazareth, and she's

37
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,320
 going to become known for being the mother of Jesus but she's also going to

38
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:39,280
 be known as we're considering today for being unknown. There it's conspicuous her

39
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,480
 story is conspicuous because of how little we know about her even though she

40
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,720
 plays this really important role we really don't know a lot about her and

41
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:52,840
 the the biggest picture we see of her is at this point when when Jesus is born

42
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,360
 and then after that throughout the Gospels there's only really small pieces

43
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:04,400
 of her story that we see and that tells us that so much of her service to God

44
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,600
 was unseen so much of her service to God was invisible to us and honestly

45
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:16,960
 invisible even to the people in her life. We don't know how much time she spent

46
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:22,200
 caring for Jesus or all the things that she did as a mom to care for him when he

47
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:28,720
 was an infant or when he was a toddler or when he was a boy and eventually a

48
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,880
 young man. We don't know all of those things that she did. We know she did

49
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:39,000
 those things because that's a part of human life and she was a mom but we

50
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,840
 didn't see them they're not recorded for us. We don't know all the prayers that

51
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:54,160
 she prayed over her son. We don't know all the tears that she cried. Mary we

52
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,600
 know from the scripture it talks about her reflecting and considering things

53
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,680
 in her heart. She was deeply spiritual. She knew God. She was obedient to God.

54
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,600
 She was a servant of God and she watched Jesus be persecuted and she watched all

55
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,360
 the things that Jesus went through in life. That must have been deeply

56
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:18,560
 emotionally wounding to her but we don't we don't see that. That's not a part of

57
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:25,040
 the story that we're given and that's one of the exemplary things about her

58
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,960
 that we can learn from is that she plays such an important part but she's so

59
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:37,200
 humble and she's content for her service to God to be unseen and that's why we're

60
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:41,680
 gonna look at her story today. Since it's Mother's Day she's a great model for us

61
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,760
 and like I said so many moms model that for us as well but I want to be clear at

62
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:52,280
 the beginning here we're not saying that Mary and her unseen service is a great

63
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,840
 model for moms although that is certainly true. We're saying she is a

64
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:01,720
 great model for all of us because being willing to serve and to serve God and to

65
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,960
 be obedient even in ways that no one notices or sees or thanks us for is not

66
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,160
 just something for Mary to do it's not just something for moms to do it's

67
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,120
 something for every believer every follower of Jesus. We should all have

68
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:19,560
 this attitude this this posture of heart that we see in her. So that's what we're

69
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:25,760
 gonna consider today. So let's read this passage together beginning in chapter

70
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:32,200
 26 this is Luke 1 26 to 38. In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from

71
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:37,360
 God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin betrothed to a man whose

72
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,120
 name was Joseph of the house of David and the Virgin's name was Mary and he

73
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:47,620
 came to her and said greetings Oh favored one the Lord is with you but she

74
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:52,080
 was greatly troubled at the saying and tried to discern what sort of greeting

75
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,200
 this might be and the angel said to her do not be afraid Mary for you have found

76
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,240
 favor with God and behold you will conceive in your womb and bear a son

77
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:06,400
 and you shall call his name Jesus he will be great and will be called the son

78
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,960
 of the Most High and the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David

79
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,320
 and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there

80
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:19,320
 will be no end and Mary said to the angel how will this be since I am a

81
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,880
 virgin the angel answered her the Holy Spirit will come upon you and the power

82
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:28,920
 the Most High will overshadow you therefore the child to be born will be

83
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:34,920
 called holy the Son of God and behold your relative Elizabeth in her old age

84
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:40,160
 has also conceived a son and this is the sixth month with her who was called

85
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:48,680
 barren for nothing will be impossible with God and Mary said behold I am the

86
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:55,280
 servant of the Lord let it be to me according to your word and the angel

87
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:02,080
 departed from her the first thing we see in this passage about Mary's heart

88
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:09,120
 attitude her posture is that she has this posture of submission and surrender

89
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:15,400
 and that's so important for us if we want to be willing to enter into unseen

90
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,640
 and unacknowledged service to God we have to have a hard attitude of

91
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:25,680
 submission and surrender it's right there in verse 38 Mary says behold I am

92
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,280
 the servant of the Lord let it be to me according to your word now Mary was a

93
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:38,480
 young woman again there's so much we don't know about her but we know she

94
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:42,960
 must have she was a human being just like us so she must have had a lot of

95
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:48,120
 plans and dreams and hopes for her future just like every young person every

96
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,280
 young person has things that they want to do and ideas in their head of what

97
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:55,280
 they want their future to be like and whether it's relationships or something

98
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:00,560
 they want to achieve or something that they want to be a part of everybody has

99
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:06,440
 those dreams so Mary would have had those as well just like any other young

100
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:15,560
 person and yet she hears this she hears God's truth communicated to her from

101
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:22,320
 Gabriel and what does she do she releases her will and she surrenders to

102
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:29,880
 God's Gabriel's announcement is what we would call a watershed moment or a

103
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:36,160
 turning point in her life she's never gonna be the same after this it marks a

104
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,880
 pivot a change in the trajectory of her life she may have been heading in one

105
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,400
 direction before and now forever after her life's gonna be totally different

106
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:50,320
 she's going in a different direction and she knows that she understands that and

107
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:56,840
 she says that's okay I'm gonna submit to what God is doing in this moment and I'm

108
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:04,120
 gonna say God let my life be what you want may it be to me according to your

109
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:12,040
 word she surrenders to what God is doing and so that's something that we need to

110
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:16,440
 live out in our lives as followers of Jesus we need to be willing to submit

111
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:22,880
 and to surrender to what God is doing to God's truth obviously that's a difficult

112
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,240
 thing submission is a scary word for us just hearing that word is scary because

113
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:34,160
 it means a loss of control it means a loss of what I want my priorities and

114
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:40,400
 objectives and so I want to remind us that as we apply that in our lives what

115
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:46,600
 Mary was doing what God calls us to do is to submit to God's Word and submit to

116
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,760
 God's truth we're not simply submitting for the sake of submission and that's

117
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,200
 one of the reasons that word is so scary for us in our culture a lot of times we

118
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:59,200
 say well I've seen people who have submitted to the wrong thing and then

119
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,600
 they've end up being harmed or abused by that posture of submission right that

120
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:10,960
 causes us to be very wary of the concept of submission and that's true and we are

121
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,840
 to be wise and discerning because we're not to submit to everything we're

122
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:20,680
 actually supposed to resist evil remember James 4 7 submit yourselves

123
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,800
 therefore to God and resist the devil and he will flee from you so there's a

124
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,200
 lot of evil and injustice in our world that we are not supposed to submit to

125
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:34,880
 we're actually supposed to resist but the thing that we are to submit to is to

126
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:40,320
 God's truth and to what God has to say about our lives and that's something

127
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:49,920
 that if we will submit to it it is good and beautiful and right for us to submit

128
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:55,120
 to God and if we think about that for a moment it actually makes sense right

129
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,560
 because if God is who he says he is if he knows everything and he knows

130
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,400
 everything about our life and our heart and our future and if he's also who he

131
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:10,720
 says he is that he is perfectly good and loving then it makes a lot of sense to

132
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,760
 submit to his plan to say God here's what I would like to do here's how I see

133
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,560
 this working out in my future but I'm gonna trust that you have a better plan

134
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,200
 than I do I'm gonna trust that you know more than me I'm gonna trust that your

135
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,440
 desire for my heart is better even than my own desire for my heart and I'm gonna

136
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:33,400
 submit to you it's actually a good and beautiful and right thing for us to

137
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:38,320
 submit to God because he is the definition of good and his will is the

138
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,880
 definition of right and his expressions are the definition of beauty and so if

139
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:48,080
 we will submit to what he's doing then we will experience those things in our

140
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:54,160
 life that goodness that righteousness that beauty but we need to be clear on

141
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,840
 that when we're looking for that posture of submission where are we submitting

142
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,640
 we're submitting to God to what he's saying Mary was right to submit to

143
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:05,520
 Gabriel because Gabriel was communicating God's truth to her and

144
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:10,360
 then what comes out of that what fruit is produced in our lives when we begin

145
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:17,280
 to submit to God the outcome is that God has been able to work his good and

146
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:25,360
 beautiful and right plan in our lives for his glory and for our good Mary's

147
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:31,600
 submission meant that she was able to play this part in God's grand redemptive

148
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,160
 narrative of every human that was going to be saved through Jesus now that's a

149
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:43,240
 beautiful and mind-boggling thing right we think about all of the people from

150
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,800
 every tongue tribe and nation throughout all the generations of the earth that

151
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,720
 have come to relationship with God through Jesus Christ and through his

152
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:56,440
 sacrifice on the cross and through the redemption that Jesus brought and Mary

153
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:01,960
 got to be a part of that story if she had not submitted and surrendered to God

154
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:07,440
 she would not have been a part of that story now obviously in that moment it

155
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,640
 may not have felt great to her to say I'm gonna give up all of my plans and my

156
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:18,880
 dreams and my desires my ambitions and and obey God and she probably had some

157
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:25,280
 some conflict within her some second thoughts but because she did that she

158
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:29,880
 got to be a part of something that was beautiful and amazing and so far beyond

159
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:35,880
 herself and that's true for us as well it's not easy to surrender to what God

160
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,960
 is doing in our lives sometimes it can be difficult to submit but as we do that

161
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:44,120
 we get to be a part of something that's good and beautiful and way bigger than

162
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:49,280
 us and one of the things that's clear in scripture is that God always works

163
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:56,240
 always for his glory and for our good anything that God allows in to our life

164
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,280
 is only there because it's either gonna glorify him and make his name great and

165
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:08,560
 cause people to see him for who he is or it's gonna be good for us maybe not good

166
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,160
 in the way that we imagine when we think about what's good for us we think

167
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:19,000
 comfort blessing success you know material things that's what we think

168
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,400
 right sometimes I think God says hey you know what's good for you at times is

169
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:29,000
 adversity and challenge because that brings growth or to go through something

170
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,120
 difficult because you're gonna learn a lesson you wouldn't learn any other way

171
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,720
 but we can trust that God's always at work for our good even if it doesn't

172
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,280
 feel great in that moment and that's the fruit that was produced in Mary's life

173
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:43,560
 that's the fruit that will be produced in our life if we have that posture of

174
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:50,480
 submission to God God's glory will be evident in our life God will be

175
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:57,200
 glorified and God's plan will be at work in our life and we'll get to see God's

176
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:03,080
 good plan for us and for those around us the other thing we see here is that this

177
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:10,240
 posture of unseen service is a posture of the background vocalists throughout

178
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:16,280
 the rest of the Gospels Mary kind of fades from our view that she's there in

179
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:22,560
 different places she reappears briefly when she and Joseph take Jesus to

180
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:28,240
 present him to the Lord at the temple that's in Luke chapter 2 when her and

181
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,320
 Joseph are looking for Jesus when they leave Jerusalem after the past Passover

182
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,560
 that's later in Luke chapter 2 she's there at the wedding in Cana that's in

183
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,560
 John chapter 2 she was certainly there when Jesus was rejected at Nazareth

184
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:47,360
 that's in multiple Gospels Matthew 13 is where it's at in Matthew she's visiting

185
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,680
 Jesus during his ministry that's recorded in Luke 8 and also in the other

186
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:57,200
 Gospels and John 19 tells us that she was at the cross when Jesus was

187
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:03,200
 crucified so she's there she obviously was a true believer in what Jesus was

188
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:10,640
 doing and she was following him she was a follower but we don't see much of her

189
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,960
 her story really fades she fades into the background just like a background

190
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:21,680
 vocalist if you ever see a singing group or maybe you see some a favorite musician

191
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:27,240
 or artist on TV that you really enjoy most of especially on TV but even at a

192
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,760
 concert if there's screens that are showing them most of the shots are of

193
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:37,040
 the artist right the main person that's mostly you're gonna see and occasionally

194
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,640
 you'll see the background vocalist standing off to the side and they're

195
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,440
 usually you know snapping and dancing sometimes doing their thing but you just

196
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:51,280
 see them for like a half second and then it goes back to the main person right

197
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:59,280
 and that's the role that Mary took she had this posture of fading into the

198
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:05,040
 background now from a human perspective that doesn't seem fair right because we

199
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:09,960
 say well you know the main singer may be a great singer but the background

200
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,680
 singers they can sing great too why is it fair that we're always looking at the

201
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:19,160
 main singer and from a human perspective that's that's actually true none of us

202
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:24,720
 as humans should should necessarily be thrust into the limelight or celebrity

203
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,800
 that's that's not something that that God ordained for us because we're to

204
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:33,480
 love and respect one another we're all made in God's image so we're not to

205
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:42,320
 Center ourselves but when we think about Jesus it's different right because Jesus

206
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:48,120
 wasn't just another man even though he was fully human he was also the Son of

207
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:54,920
 God and he was also here to do something that was so much bigger than anyone

208
00:18:54,920 --> 00:19:00,360
 could comprehend Jesus actually reminded Mary of this in the wedding at Cana in

209
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:06,520
 John chapter 2 verse 4 when Mary comes to him and she's saying Jesus my friends

210
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,040
 are having a wedding they ran out of wine like what can you do and Jesus says

211
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:16,760
 hey it's not the right time yet he reminds her hey I there's something

212
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:20,920
 bigger going on here now Jesus demonstrates his love and care for her

213
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:25,000
 and that he goes ahead and does the miracle it turns the water to wine but

214
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,160
 he was reminding her in in verse 4 of chapter 2 there that he's saying there's

215
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:34,800
 a bigger picture here that you don't see and that was true of Jesus he really was

216
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:39,880
 supposed to be centered because he was the Son of God and he had come to redeem

217
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,960
 the souls of humanity and so everyone else was supposed to be in the

218
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:50,160
 background his purpose was so much bigger than Mary or anyone else he was

219
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:55,960
 fulfilling God's redemptive plan and he was doing something for the good of all

220
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:04,960
 of us and Mary recognized this and she was content to fade into the background

221
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:14,480
 we see it there in verse 35 in verse 34 Mary says how will this be in verse 35

222
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,480
 angels answers her and says the Holy Spirit will come upon you in the power

223
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:25,800
 of the Most High will overshadow you God's power will overshadow you you will

224
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:34,680
 be you will fade you will recede it's what that language is communicating and

225
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,320
 we need to apply that in our lives we need to have that posture as well

226
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:42,320
 remember Jesus taught us to pray in the Lord's Prayer in Matthew chapter 6 verse

227
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,560
 10 he taught us to pray your kingdom come your will be done on earth as it is

228
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:50,320
 in heaven God made your purposes come to the

229
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:57,320
 forefront and may mine recede and fade John the Baptist said one of the John

230
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,000
 the Baptist said a lot of really profound stuff he didn't say there's not

231
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,240
 a lot recorded of what he said but it's all super profound but in John 330 we

232
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:13,200
 have this he said he must increase but I must decrease what a beautiful

233
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,280
 statement of what it means to be a disciple follower of Jesus is that Jesus

234
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:26,200
 gets bigger in people's view and I get smaller and Mary modeled that for us she

235
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:31,000
 faded into the background what about the fruit that comes out of that what fruit

236
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,600
 is produced when we fade into the background when we fade into the

237
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:41,040
 background God's narrative is centered what God is doing becomes the main focus

238
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:47,760
 of the people around us but here's the cool thing is that we still get to see

239
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:55,120
 what's happening and we get to watch it up close I had a friend in another state

240
00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:02,840
 that worked in a big music venue for a long time from like the 70s to I remember

241
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,880
 having a conversation with him in the early 2000s he was telling me about this

242
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:10,200
 and he was talking about all the bands that came through the venue over the

243
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:15,200
 years and big-name bands that you know the biggest bands in North America would

244
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:21,120
 come through and he was there for all the shows but he wasn't in the audience

245
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:26,240
 he was on the stage now he was like a tech so he wasn't performing he was

246
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,680
 making sure everything else worked but he got to see every show from right up

247
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:34,440
 close and he got to see a different view than most people saw because he was

248
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:41,040
 backstage instead of in the audience and that's one of the perks of being in the

249
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:48,800
 background you're not visible but you get to be a part of something from a

250
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:55,640
 perspective that no one else sees and if you're willing to be in the background

251
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:01,120
 of God's work in your life yeah no one's gonna be showering you with praise and

252
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:06,520
 and your service to God might be unseen and unrecognized but you will get to see

253
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:12,680
 some miracles up close you'll get to see some amazing things happen from just a

254
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:19,400
 few feet away I can't even imagine what that was like for Mary for the disciples

255
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:25,000
 for the other followers of Jesus to see the things that Jesus did right there up

256
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:32,040
 close firsthand it's why their lives were radically transformed right because

257
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:36,160
 for them it wasn't something abstract it wasn't a story they heard from someone

258
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:41,440
 else they saw people get healed they saw dead people raised to life with their

259
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:47,080
 own eyes they were right there for it and that's one of the beautiful things

260
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:50,880
 about being willing to fade into the background as you get to be a part of

261
00:23:50,880 --> 00:24:00,880
 that and this is true as a parent it's true for moms it's true for dads if you

262
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,320
 try to make it about yourself and center yourself in your kids life and what's

263
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:10,960
 going on you're gonna create all types of problems but if you'll fade into the

264
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,240
 background and say I'm gonna love this young person I'm gonna help them to

265
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:20,880
 follow Jesus I'm going to help them to walk into what God has for them you'll

266
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,520
 get to see some really neat things happen you'll be a firsthand witness to

267
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:30,000
 those things it's true in disciple making if you're trying to help someone

268
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,880
 else follow Jesus and you make it all about you and you're trying to

269
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:37,360
 communicate all the things that you know and you are really trying to make that

270
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:43,840
 person follow you they're gonna be an unhealthy disciple but if you can fade

271
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,920
 into the background and help them learn to follow Jesus and you come alongside

272
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:53,720
 them and support them and encourage them and continually point them towards

273
00:24:53,720 --> 00:25:01,360
 Christ you're gonna see a miracle of transformation in their life it's true

274
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,120
 when you think about praying for someone else interceding on someone else's

275
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:10,000
 behalf you're gonna pray stuff for someone if you love someone you say I'm

276
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 gonna pray for this person you're gonna pray things they're never gonna know

277
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,080
 about and no one else is ever gonna know about no one's gonna know that you were

278
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,960
 praying for for them to come to know Jesus or that you were praying for them

279
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,560
 to experience blessing in their life or you were praying for them to be healed

280
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:31,000
 in some way they may never know no one else may ever know but when God answers

281
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,280
 that prayer you see the miracle and you get to see it up close because you were

282
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:43,080
 willing to be in the background and it's true in all forms of unseen service that

283
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:50,280
 honors God it's not easy to do something obscure that no one is noticing and to

284
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:54,460
 do it without being acknowledged and without being thanked but one of the

285
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:58,960
 beautiful rewards is that you'll get to see God do some powerful things and

286
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:07,400
 you'll see them up close and then we see here that Mary her unseen service this

287
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:13,640
 is a posture of trust and that's what we've got to learn if we're gonna be

288
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:18,680
 willing to serve God in a way that doesn't center ourselves it's not about

289
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:26,600
 us that's not focused on me then we've got to trust that God's Word God's truth

290
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:35,760
 God's way is best we see that here in her story verse 29 says but she was

291
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,280
 greatly troubled at the saying and tried to discern what sort of greediness

292
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:44,440
 might be verse 30 and the angel said to her do not be afraid Mary for you have

293
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:50,520
 found favor with God Gabriel comes and he begins to explain God's truth to her

294
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:56,280
 and her initial reaction is fear she's saying I don't get it this is terrifying

295
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:07,840
 I'm seeing an angel she's totally afraid but what happens by the time we come

296
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:13,480
 down to verse 37 and verse 38 Gabriel in verse 37 says for nothing will be

297
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:19,400
 impossible with God Gabriel saying hey I know you're scared he even says that in

298
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:24,400
 verse 30 do not be afraid for you found favor with God then he gives her the

299
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:28,080
 message and then at the end he says I know this is tough to believe but

300
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:34,120
 nothing's impossible with God God can do this and then verse 38 what does she say

301
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:39,160
 she says I'm the servant of the Lord let it be to me according to your word she's

302
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:46,880
 saying okay I'll I'll believe you I'll go with it I'll obey we go through that

303
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:54,000
 same process in our life too right when we initially encounter God's truth

304
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:03,640
 God's Word it challenges us sometimes it scares us right and we say God how could

305
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:08,560
 that happen how could that be possible just like Mary was saying this is there's

306
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:12,760
 no way and I could I could have a child I'm not even married I've never been

307
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:17,000
 with a man and there's no way that that child could be the Son of God in the

308
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,320
 side it's not even possible and God may bring you to a place in your life where

309
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:29,760
 he's he's asking you to do something and you said this is not possible you say

310
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:34,240
 God you don't understand it's not possible for me to talk to that person

311
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,720
 at work about Jesus like I don't know how to do that I'm not good at that

312
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:41,800
 stuff and that person doesn't even really like me so it's not even

313
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:51,160
 possible say God it's not possible for me to find time in my week to serve you

314
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,840
 or to connect with this other person I know you've put that on my heart but

315
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:59,560
 it's just not possible I don't have the time God it's not possible for me to use

316
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:05,680
 my gifts in church or somewhere else to honor you because you know I'm I'm

317
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:10,680
 really shy and I'm uncomfortable doing that God it's not possible for me to

318
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:14,480
 make a big move in my life even though I know this is something that you're

319
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:22,440
 putting in front of me it's scary we all come to to God's truth and are

320
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:27,720
 challenged and frightened by at different points in our life just like

321
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:34,880
 Mary was but what bridges the gap for us is we have to trust God that's what

322
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:42,600
 Mary did it's not that between verse 30 and verse 38 she understood the whole

323
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:47,120
 process because she did she didn't say okay now I get it it all makes sense

324
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:53,360
 yeah no she still doesn't understand how it's gonna work because Gabriel told her

325
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:58,320
 she was gonna have a child a super that was gonna be supernaturally placed in

326
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:04,880
 her body and so she's saying I still don't understand any of this so verse

327
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:10,440
 38 is an expression of trust not an expression of oh I get it now I can go

328
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:14,240
 for it I'm comfortable with it she's not saying that she's saying okay I trust

329
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:25,480
 you it's a posture of trust and that's true for us as well we need to trust

330
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:29,560
 what are we trusting in we're trusting in God we're trusting in his love for us

331
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:36,760
 and his goodness as I said earlier God's only gonna allow things in our

332
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:41,560
 lives that are for our ultimate good because they bring him glory and because

333
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:47,040
 they're at work to benefit us even if we don't see the benefit in in the moment

334
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:52,240
 of those circumstances now that's hard to believe sometimes because we go

335
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,720
 through stuff we say I don't see any way this could be for my good so we bridge

336
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:02,040
 that gap with trust say God doesn't feel good doesn't look good doesn't smell

337
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:07,520
 good right now but I'm gonna trust you that this is good that you're at work

338
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:11,440
 that you still love me that you're still good and that what you're doing in my

339
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:17,580
 life it's gonna bring you glory and it's gonna be best for me and when we are

340
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:25,080
 able to do that when we're able to trust in God's love we have peace that even

341
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:29,640
 our unseen service is valuable that's one of the tough things about unseen

342
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,920
 service it's one of the tough things about serving God and obeying in a way

343
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:36,360
 that no one sees because if you do something and everybody in the room says

344
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:42,800
 you did a great job and we're so grateful you did it you already feel

345
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,280
 great about that you you don't ever ask yourself well did I do a good job

346
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:52,680
 because you just heard affirmation from everybody right when you do something

347
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:57,000
 especially when you pour your heart into it you say I really want to honor God

348
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,960
 with this choice or with this ministry or I want to honor God by the way I'm

349
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,800
 caring for this person in my life and you pour your heart into it you do it

350
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,520
 with all that you have and you use all the creativity and the wisdom and the

351
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:14,440
 energy you have to do that and then you walk away and no one says anything no

352
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:21,920
 one says thanks no one says good job no one says that was a blessing to me then

353
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:26,800
 you do have those questions Wow was that just a waste of time why did I even do

354
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:35,000
 that why am I even here what what's the purpose of this but if we're trusting

355
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,880
 in God's love we have the peace that says yeah that that service was valuable

356
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:47,080
 even if it was unseen because God loves me he loves the people in my life he

357
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:51,240
 wouldn't call me to do this and pour my heart into it unless it mattered to him

358
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:56,960
 and if it matters to him that's all I need whether he uses in a big way or

359
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:08,720
 small way that's all I need and when we trust in God we see that God uses that

360
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:17,480
 unseen service in a way that's beyond what we can see or imagine Mary is a

361
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:22,720
 background figure in the story of Jesus but she's not forgotten she's not

362
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:32,640
 invisible here we are talking about her life 2,000 years later so her role was

363
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,480
 important she got to play that part in the grand narrative of redemption that

364
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:43,340
 we were talking about earlier I'm sure she had no idea in verse 38 when she

365
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:49,220
 said okay God let it be to me according to your will she had no idea what that

366
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:55,640
 meant she had no idea that Jesus was the Messiah she had no idea that God was

367
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:59,880
 going to use Jesus to bring people from every tribe and tongue and nation into

368
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:04,200
 relationship with him and to give them a pathway to heaven she had no idea that

369
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:10,720
 we would be sitting here today because of Jesus there's no way she could have

370
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:17,640
 imagined that but she obeyed she surrendered she trusted and that's true

371
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:24,400
 for us too especially in those areas of unseen service we have no idea how God

372
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:29,280
 wants to use that we have no idea the ripples that will go out from that or

373
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:35,320
 how God can use that to change someone else's life or to change someone else's

374
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:38,560
 life who is two or three people removed from the person in front of us that

375
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:46,360
 we're struggling to love and so when we have that posture of trust and we say

376
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:51,160
 God I'm trusting you that your work is going forward that you're loving me that

377
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:55,360
 you're even in a difficult situation that you're doing this for my good and

378
00:34:55,360 --> 00:35:00,960
 for your glory God can do something huge out of that so much bigger than we'll

379
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:10,640
 ever know so that's my desire and prayer for us today now unseen services it's

380
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:16,200
 not easy it's not easy to be a mom wasn't easy for Mary to play the role

381
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:21,960
 that she played it's not easy for any of us to serve God and in an obscure

382
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:28,000
 anonymous way and honestly if you don't know Jesus it's impossible if you don't

383
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,280
 have relationship with God there's really no way you can truly love and

384
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:36,200
 serve someone else in the way that you should without getting some type of

385
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:40,720
 reward or getting something back so if you're sitting here today and you say

386
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:46,960
 this makes no sense to me it's impossible understand that you have to

387
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,440
 have relationship with God through Jesus Christ that's why Jesus came to the

388
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:56,480
 earth it's because we're all sinners were all broken and he through his life

389
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,920
 and then his death satisfied God's justice and God's holiness so that we

390
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:05,000
 could have relationship with God if you're gonna try to love someone else

391
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,120
 this way without relationship to God it's not gonna work but if you do have

392
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:13,720
 relationship to God then God wants you to love and serve others in this way

393
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:22,000
 it's not easy but we're all called to it it can be painful at times it can mean

394
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,520
 pouring ourselves out pouring out our energy our resources our gifts in

395
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:32,400
 anonymity and no one might see it no one notices all that we're giving but if

396
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,960
 it's done in obedience to God and that's the the motive of our heart if we do

397
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,360
 these things if we have a posture of submission and surrender if we have a

398
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:45,640
 posture of fading into the background if we have a posture of trust then God can

399
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:49,160
 use it in an amazing and powerful way and that's what I want to encourage us

400
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:55,080
 with today I want to salute and commend all of the moms who who model this for

401
00:36:55,080 --> 00:37:00,360
 us and who do it so well day in and day out I want to commend this example that

402
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:05,200
 we have in Mary and I want to challenge myself and all of us to live into this

403
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:11,600
 to be obedient to God even when no one's watching to do it for him to surrender

404
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:16,600
 submit to his will to let ourselves not be centered or platform but to fade into

405
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:22,840
 the background and then to trust that he's going to do something with it let's

406
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:28,560
 pray God we thank you for this example we thank you for moms that give us this

407
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:34,120
 example God I pray that we would be grateful and gracious today as we

408
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:39,040
 connect with our moms and just encourage them and express gratitude for for the

409
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:44,440
 way that they loved us but God I pray that you would help us to grow in this

410
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:49,160
 every one of us help us to grow in serving you obedience to you surrender

411
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:57,040
 being willing to to fade and let you be the forefront of our lives God help us

412
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:05,080
 to grow and trusting you help us to be beautiful unseen reflections of who you

413
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:09,120
 are so that the world can see you and so the people can be drawn to that and be

414
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,720
 saved in Jesus name amen

415
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:17,080
