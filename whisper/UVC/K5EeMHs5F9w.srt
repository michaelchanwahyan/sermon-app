1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
 Thank you, James.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,720
 And I'm excited to be here.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,000
 Glad to see everyone here.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,160
 I'm always honored to be able to be at Urban Voice and to be here again and to see old

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,040
 friends and new friends.

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,940
 And excited to open the word with you all today.

7
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:21,560
 So we're going to be looking in John chapter 8 today.

8
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:27,240
 If you want to turn there in your Bible or on your Bible app or whatever you're using

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:33,320
 here, John chapter 8, we're going to be looking at verses 31 and 32, these kind of famous

10
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,720
 verses where Jesus is talking about truth.

11
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,840
 And these are important verses for us.

12
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,080
 Culturally, we live in a time where people talk a lot about truth and think a lot about

13
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,360
 truth, but it's hard for us to define it.

14
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,320
 It's hard for us to figure out what we mean when we say the word truth.

15
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,080
 And Jesus has some really profound things to say here that are really good for us to

16
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,840
 understand, especially in the church.

17
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,240
 So we're going to look at these today.

18
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:07,220
 John 8, 31 says this, "So Jesus said to the Jews who had believed him, 'If you abide in

19
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:13,360
 my word, you are truly my disciples, and you will know the truth, and the truth will set

20
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,360
 you free.'"

21
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:22,040
 What's happening in this passage, Jesus, earlier in the passage in verse 12, he declares

22
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,040
 that he is the light of the world.

23
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,760
 He reveals that to the people that are listening to him.

24
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:32,480
 And immediately, the Pharisees who are listening accuse him of lying about himself in verse

25
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,840
 13.

26
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,760
 So Jesus begins to explain to the Pharisees and everyone else who's listening that they're

27
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,720
 misunderstanding the kingdom of God.

28
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,240
 And that happens in verse 14 on down to verse 29.

29
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:51,440
 And then verse 30 tells us that as a result of what Jesus is saying, a lot of people who

30
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,460
 are listening begin to believe in him.

31
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,160
 They begin to place their trust in him and have faith in him that he is who he says he

32
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,680
 is, that he is the Messiah, the light of the world as he proclaimed himself to be.

33
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:07,040
 Then verse 31, he begins to speak to those people, the people who have begun to believe

34
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,460
 in him, the people who are following him.

35
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:14,400
 And he says, "If you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples, and you will know

36
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,720
 the truth, and the truth will set you free."

37
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,000
 That means these words are spoken to people like us, people who are followers of Jesus,

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,800
 who have already made the decision to believe in him and follow him.

39
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:34,520
 And Jesus is giving us some profound, significant truth about what it means to be a disciple.

40
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:40,360
 Now obviously, in our culture, at times we have a strange relationship with what we call

41
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,100
 truth.

42
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:47,320
 Most of us want to define truth for ourselves, and so we make a lot of statements like, "That's

43
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:52,220
 true for you, but not true for me," or we say, "Live your truth," things like that.

44
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:58,200
 But even as we seek to make truth personal and self-defined, we keep running into these

45
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,020
 kind of unyielding boundaries of reality.

46
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:07,920
 So then what we do sometimes is we relabel the boundaries in order to kind of fit our

47
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,920
 thinking.

48
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:15,080
 We say, "Well, maybe if we change the names and move the goalposts, then it'll make sense."

49
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:21,700
 So now we have terms that culturally we use like misinformation and disinformation because

50
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,700
 there's so much falsehood.

51
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,320
 There's so many things, so many labels that have been changed that people get confused

52
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,680
 about what is true, what's right and wrong.

53
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:35,520
 Yet even in that, we can't decide really what disinformation is or who gets to determine

54
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:40,160
 what the standard of disinformation is, and we argue about that.

55
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,960
 We're desperately trying to figure out what's true, but a lot of times we're also desperately

56
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,240
 trying to make truth in our own image.

57
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,960
 And we want the truth to match our desires and our preferences and usually to excuse

58
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,760
 our shortcomings, to excuse our mess.

59
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,380
 But the reality that the Bible puts in front of us is that we don't live in a world of

60
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,640
 our own creation.

61
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,160
 We don't get to make truth in our image because we live in a world that's created by the almighty

62
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,460
 creator God, and he's the one who's defined reality and truth itself according to his

63
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,460
 own character.

64
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:17,000
 And as much as we might try to escape that, we can't.

65
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,840
 We can't escape that pull of his reality, the world that he has made.

66
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:25,640
 It's like gravity, it keeps pulling us back down.

67
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,480
 So what are we talking about when we say the word truth?

68
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,480
 How are we going to define that?

69
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,000
 How are we going to define that today?

70
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,600
 I think the simplest and most accurate way to think about the word itself is to say that

71
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,660
 truth is something that corresponds to reality.

72
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:45,200
 So a simple illustration of this is if I were to say that I was wearing red leather pants

73
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,640
 today, we could safely say that's an untrue statement, right?

74
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,400
 Because I'm not wearing red leather pants, I'm wearing some type of cotton polyester

75
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,600
 blend that's a tan color, right?

76
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,280
 So that's kind of an obvious illustration.

77
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,640
 If I say something that doesn't correspond to the reality, then we can say, well, that's

78
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,560
 a false statement, that's not true.

79
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:11,080
 Well, if truth is something that corresponds to reality, where did reality come from?

80
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,360
 Where does ultimate reality come from?

81
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,720
 Well, the Bible tells us that ultimate reality comes from God.

82
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,280
 That God's the one who created the universe, created everything that we see.

83
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:26,720
 He is not only the creator of ultimate reality, but he's the only one who really understands

84
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,320
 it and comprehends it and encompasses it, right?

85
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:35,040
 Because God has all knowledge and all power in the universe.

86
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:39,880
 So God's really the only one who can know what ultimate reality is.

87
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:44,600
 He's the only one who can look at all of it and see all of it.

88
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:52,800
 At very best, our versions of reality and our visions of reality are incomplete at very

89
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,320
 best.

90
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,960
 Sometimes if we're honest, we can admit that sometimes they're just plain wrong.

91
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:02,720
 Sometimes we get totally the wrong idea about what is real and important in life.

92
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,960
 But at very best, what we see as real and important in life is gonna be incomplete because

93
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,400
 we cannot see all of reality.

94
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,920
 We can't see all of truth.

95
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,160
 We do not know all the things there are to know.

96
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,120
 But God does.

97
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,960
 He created reality.

98
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,000
 He created the universe.

99
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,160
 He created morality and what's right and wrong.

100
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,060
 Those things are defined by him.

101
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,200
 And so when he makes a statement and says, "Hey, this is what's right.

102
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,260
 This is what's good for you.

103
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,280
 This is the way to go."

104
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,600
 He actually knows what he's talking about because he possesses all the knowledge and

105
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:42,640
 all of the wisdom and he can see it from every angle and he can make a true statement.

106
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,520
 And we can't do that because our knowledge is narrow.

107
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:51,920
 Our wisdom is narrow and our vision is very closely defined.

108
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,680
 We can only see things from our own perspective.

109
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:02,200
 And that reminds us that when we think about truth, there really isn't any such thing as

110
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:06,520
 my truth and someone else's truth, right?

111
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,360
 There's really only God's truth.

112
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,160
 God's the only one who can say what truth is because he's the only one who can see it

113
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,320
 all.

114
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:19,120
 We can have our versions but ultimately, only God's truth is gonna be truth.

115
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,600
 Only God can possess that.

116
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,760
 And Jesus begins to speak about this in chapter 8 here.

117
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:30,560
 Jesus starts to talk about how we, if we are gonna be a disciple, a follower of Jesus,

118
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,780
 then we need to understand his truth and how that takes place, what that looks like in

119
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,400
 our lives.

120
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:42,360
 So the first thing I want us to see that Jesus is communicating here is that if we're gonna

121
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:49,400
 dwell in the truth, then we've really got to soak in God's word.

122
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,920
 And in verse 31, there's a couple of key words here.

123
00:07:52,920 --> 00:08:00,120
 He says, "If you abide in my word, then you are truly disciples of mine."

124
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:07,000
 The word in the original language for abide means to remain or dwell or to continue to

125
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,140
 be present in a place or to sojourn there or another meaning which I really love is

126
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,500
 to endure.

127
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:21,580
 So he's saying if you stay in my word, if you're always there, if you're dwelling there,

128
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:31,420
 if you're living there, if it's your home, then you're a true disciple.

129
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:38,380
 And one of the cool things about this word, like I said, I like that meaning of endure.

130
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:42,500
 It reminds us that there are times when it's not easy to remain.

131
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,940
 It's not easy to stay there.

132
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,580
 It's not easy to continue on.

133
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:50,140
 And that's what Jesus is telling these followers who have just taken the step of faith.

134
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,140
 They said, "Jesus, we believe.

135
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,540
 What does it mean to follow you?"

136
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,540
 He says, "You've got to remain.

137
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,540
 You've got to stay.

138
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:57,500
 You've got to continue to dwell there."

139
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:02,340
 The other key word in this verse is the word logos, the word for word.

140
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:10,420
 When Jesus says, "If you abide in my word," that word in the Greek means like an idea,

141
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:15,500
 a concept, a teaching, a doctrine, a saying.

142
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:20,900
 But in the book of John, particularly, it also refers to Jesus himself.

143
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,340
 And I think that gives this verse a really beautiful double meaning.

144
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:30,440
 Jesus is saying, "You've got to dwell and remain and abide in my teaching, but you've

145
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,860
 also got to dwell and remain and abide in my presence."

146
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,100
 There's two things that are being said in this verse.

147
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:41,700
 Jesus is saying that you've got to understand the truth that I've communicated to you.

148
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,900
 You've got to learn those things and you've got to abide in them, but you've also got

149
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,960
 to abide in relationship.

150
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:51,740
 You've got to be in my presence with me.

151
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:59,700
 And as we said earlier, when he says that, when we think about what truth is and we say,

152
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,780
 "Okay, what does it mean to remain in God's word?

153
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:08,700
 How are we going to know the truth about reality?"

154
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:15,020
 The clearest implication for us, living 2,000 years after Jesus was on the earth, is that

155
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:19,420
 we need to spend time in God's word, the Bible.

156
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:24,020
 Now for these people that Jesus was speaking to on this day, he said, "If you abide in

157
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:29,180
 my word," that could have meant following Jesus around and listening to what he was

158
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,180
 saying.

159
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,180
 But we're not in that position, right?

160
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,580
 We're not in that position, right?

161
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,620
 Jesus is no longer physically present on the earth in a physical body.

162
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:39,740
 So we can't say, "Okay, well, to dwell and remain in Jesus' teaching means I've got to

163
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:43,460
 go to where he is and listen to what he says," because his physical presence has left the

164
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,820
 earth.

165
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:50,940
 So what it means for us is that we have to spend time in the Bible.

166
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:59,100
 And we know that God has told us in the New Testament that the Bible, scripture, is his

167
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:04,660
 word spoken to us, just like if he were speaking in a conversation.

168
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:07,300
 So the Bible is God's revelation to us.

169
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,820
 It's God revealing himself, God saying, "Hey, this is who I am.

170
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,580
 This is what's important about the universe.

171
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,740
 This is what's important about how you live your lives.

172
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,460
 This is how I want you to treat other people.

173
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:19,540
 This is how I want you to care for others."

174
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:27,460
 All those things are spoken to us in scripture, and that's what it means for us to abide,

175
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:34,780
 to remain in Jesus' words, his teachings, his ideas, and also in his presence, is to

176
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:39,900
 be immersed and saturated and soaked in the scripture.

177
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:46,080
 And I chose the word "soak" intentionally because it gives us the picture of something

178
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,260
 that surrounds you and you're just in it all the time.

179
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:52,860
 And that's what our relationship to scripture should be like, especially in the world that

180
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,860
 we live in.

181
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,980
 There are so many things that challenge our faith.

182
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,780
 There are so many things that are difficult.

183
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:04,380
 There are so many things that we face in any given week that can really discourage us or

184
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:08,060
 harm us or knock us down.

185
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:12,060
 And it's not going to be enough to say, "Well, I read a Bible verse once," or, you know,

186
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:17,140
 "I remember something that I heard one time in church," or "One day a week, I'm going

187
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,700
 to try to connect with God."

188
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,980
 We need to be soaking in it.

189
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,420
 We need to have it all the time.

190
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:30,940
 It needs to be a life-sustaining thing that is constantly coming into our lives.

191
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,700
 And so we need to be spending time in God's Word.

192
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,260
 We need to be soaking there.

193
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:41,240
 We need to saturate our lives, be reading it, be considering it, reflecting on it, meditating

194
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,660
 on it, saying, "What does this mean?

195
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,900
 What is God saying to me?"

196
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:47,980
 We need to do this, where we get together with other believers and talk about it and

197
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:51,580
 say, "What does this verse mean, and how can we encourage each other to follow it, and

198
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:55,100
 how can we take care of one another and support one another?"

199
00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:03,860
 That's all a part of remaining in His words, in His teaching that He talks about in verse

200
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,260
 31.

201
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:10,900
 We need to be alive in that relationship with Christ so that we're in His presence, and

202
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:16,380
 the Holy Spirit's working to illuminate God's Word to our hearts.

203
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:21,700
 Now the obvious implication of soaking in God's Word is that to dwell in the truth,

204
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,980
 we have to know the truth.

205
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:28,240
 And in verse 32, where it says, "And you shall know the truth," that word in the original

206
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:34,620
 language "to know" means that you perceive or understand or become acquainted with something,

207
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:40,020
 but it also communicates a knowledge that's grounded in personal experience.

208
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:48,340
 So that's communicating to us that there's going to be a deep knowledge there that involves

209
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:52,500
 the experience of our lives, the things that we go through, not just kind of a head knowledge

210
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,760
 where we're like, "Yeah, I heard that," or "I read that."

211
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,440
 It's gonna really impact our day-to-day.

212
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:08,180
 And first of all, the first step of walking in truth and knowing truth is to just become

213
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,180
 aware of it.

214
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:13,380
 Like we just said, we've got to engage with it, we've got to read it, we make ourselves

215
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,380
 aware of it.

216
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:17,700
 But it has to go beyond that.

217
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:23,300
 If we are gonna dwell in the truth, we have to submit to the truth.

218
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,580
 You shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.

219
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:31,100
 That word "know" is not just saying you know it in terms of awareness.

220
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:35,260
 A lot of times when we use the word "know," we mean awareness.

221
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:40,380
 Like you might say, "Did you know that Chicago's the third largest city in the U.S.?"

222
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,900
 I'm not saying, "Do you know that?"

223
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,020
 Like, "Have you experienced it?"

224
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:47,220
 I'm saying, "Are you aware that Chicago's the third largest city?"

225
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:51,780
 It's two very different things, even though we use the same word.

226
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:56,780
 And so when this says, "You shall know the truth," it doesn't mean you're aware that

227
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:01,900
 Jesus loves you, but it's saying, "Have you experienced the love and grace of Christ?"

228
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,660
 Two very, very different things.

229
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:08,820
 Knowledge that is more than awareness.

230
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:18,420
 In Romans 1:19-21, Paul talks about people that know, it says, "For what can be known

231
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:22,060
 about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them for His invisible attributes,

232
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:25,860
 namely His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived ever since the

233
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:29,020
 creation of the world in the things that have been made.

234
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:33,500
 It's there without excuse, for although they knew God, they did not honor Him as God or

235
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,500
 give thanks to Him."

236
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,420
 Paul's talking about people who know that God exists, they know He's there, they're

237
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:43,300
 aware of God, but they're not submitting to Him.

238
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:47,300
 They're saying, "Okay, I understand that God is there, but that's not going to change anything

239
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,380
 in my life."

240
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:55,420
 So if we're going to dwell on the truth, if it's going to be our living place, and as

241
00:15:55,420 --> 00:16:03,020
 Jesus says in verse 31, if we're going to be a true disciple, then we've got to submit

242
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,580
 to it, not just know it.

243
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:08,540
 We've got to say, "Okay, God, I hear what you're saying.

244
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:14,940
 I may not really like it that much, but I'm going to submit, I'm going to agree with you.

245
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:20,100
 I'm going to actually start to live that out and apply it in my life, even if it makes

246
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:26,420
 me a little bit uncomfortable, even if it's different than how I wish it would be."

247
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:29,900
 And as we submit to it, we've also got to respond.

248
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:36,060
 That's a part of that knowing that is grounded in personal experience.

249
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:42,820
 First John 3, 18 and 19 says this, "Little children, let us not love in word or talk,

250
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,340
 but in deed and in truth.

251
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:48,220
 By this we shall know that we are of the truth and reassure our heart before Him."

252
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:52,940
 It's not enough just to talk about it.

253
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:57,820
 It's not enough just to give mental assent to it.

254
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,100
 We have to live it out.

255
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,980
 We have to respond.

256
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:06,660
 When God challenges our heart and says, "Hey, here's some of my truth, and this is what

257
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:12,140
 it would mean in your life," we have to say, "Okay, I understand that.

258
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,580
 I know it.

259
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:17,180
 I want to submit to it, and then I'm actually going to respond."

260
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:22,140
 So like tomorrow, I'm going to do something different than what I did yesterday.

261
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,180
 That's the response.

262
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:26,900
 There's the awareness of the truth.

263
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,980
 There's the submission to the truth where we say, "Okay, I'm actually going to submit

264
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,900
 to it, apply it to my life."

265
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:37,100
 But we still haven't responded until we've done it.

266
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,780
 And that's when the truth changes us.

267
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:44,380
 That's when it starts to change who we are.

268
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:50,140
 Another thing that's a huge part of the process of truth changing us and dwelling in the truth

269
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,220
 is that we have to reject lies.

270
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,700
 And that's kind of an obvious statement.

271
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,040
 It's like, "Well, obviously," right?

272
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:05,540
 But this is really, really tough for us, especially if you've been in church for very long.

273
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,380
 You may know a lot about the Bible.

274
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,020
 You may know a lot about God's truth.

275
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:12,180
 You may even submit to it and be trying to respond to it.

276
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:18,940
 But sometimes we're stuck in life because we're still holding on to lies.

277
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:22,180
 God comes along and he says, "Hey, I want to put something great in your hand.

278
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:26,260
 I want to use you for me, or I want to bless you in some way, or I want to do something

279
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,260
 in your life."

280
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:32,660
 And he can't put anything there because we're gripping tightly to something that's not true

281
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,140
 that we're still holding on to.

282
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:40,980
 And we've got to reject those lies and let go of them so that we can move forward with

283
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,580
 God.

284
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,580
 And understand this.

285
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,740
 This is really important to understand.

286
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:51,540
 The devil cannot stop anything that God is doing.

287
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:55,420
 Sometimes we get confused and we start to think that God and the devil are like rivals.

288
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,300
 They're not, okay?

289
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:03,140
 God is infinitely more powerful than every being in the universe, including the devil.

290
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:09,980
 So the devil has no equality with God in any way.

291
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:13,100
 The devil hates God and he wants to mess up anything God's trying to do.

292
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,820
 But he can't stop God.

293
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,740
 He doesn't have the power of God.

294
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:22,660
 And so the way that he tries to stop God and mess with his plans is just by lying to us

295
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:26,740
 and convincing us not to cooperate with what God is doing.

296
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,940
 The devil can't stop it.

297
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:31,460
 He can't fight a head-to-head battle against God and win, and he knows that.

298
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:39,860
 But he can lie to us and get us so distracted or so discouraged or so deceived that we

299
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:46,580
 head in a completely different direction and then it starts to thwart the plan of God in

300
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,580
 our life.

301
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,780
 And so that's what he wants to do.

302
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:54,660
 His main tactic in our lives is to lie to us.

303
00:19:54,660 --> 00:20:01,000
 And so it's really important for us to identify those lies and reject them.

304
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,580
 To take them captive when they come into our mind, literally to say, "That's not true and

305
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,340
 I'm not going to believe that.

306
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:11,140
 I'm not going to let that idea just roll around in my head."

307
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,540
 And then replace those lies with God's truth.

308
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,540
 Say, "You know what?

309
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:17,580
 Not only am I not going to believe that, but I'm going to believe what is true."

310
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:22,740
 All right, here's a simple illustration for you to think about.

311
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:25,300
 God is great.

312
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:29,140
 God possesses all power in the universe, okay?

313
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:32,080
 That's a truth that we probably, most of us could easily agree with.

314
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,800
 It's throughout scripture.

315
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,360
 And we give mental assent to it.

316
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,200
 We may even submit to it and say, "Yes, God is great.

317
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,200
 That's why I'm a Christian.

318
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,920
 That's why I'm here in church, because I believe that God is great."

319
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,000
 I'm trying to respond to that, right?

320
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,840
 But here's a lie that comes against that truth.

321
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:53,440
 I have a problem in my life and I feel like the problem is going to destroy me or it's

322
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,600
 going to, you know, I'm super discouraged about it because I feel like there's no solution,

323
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,600
 right?

324
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:06,640
 When I'm thinking that way, I'm starting to believe that in some way God is not great

325
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,880
 enough for that problem.

326
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:14,560
 I'm starting to believe that, yeah, God may be great, but like this is a really big deal.

327
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,080
 God is great, but he's never met my boss.

328
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:22,260
 So you know, we're starting to believe that way.

329
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:25,800
 And so we have to reject that lie and say, "You know what?

330
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:32,080
 Yes, my boss is really challenging to deal with," or, "Yes, this situation is a mess,"

331
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:37,280
 or "Yes, I've made some bad choices and created some chaos in my life."

332
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,400
 But the truth is that God is bigger than this.

333
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,760
 And so I'm not going to listen to the lie that says, "Well, my life's going to be a

334
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,840
 disaster because of what happened or because of the mistakes I made or, you know, I'm going

335
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,440
 to fail at everything I try."

336
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:56,400
 I'm not going to listen to those lies because I know that the truth is that God has a power

337
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,760
 that's greater than anything else and he's at work in my life for his glory and for my

338
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,440
 good.

339
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,960
 We have to reject those lies, say, "I'm not going to believe that," and replace them with

340
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,960
 God's truth.

341
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:13,600
 Another simple one that's really huge is grace in our life, right?

342
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,720
 A lot of times, even though we give assent to the truth that, "Yes, Jesus loves me.

343
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,720
 I'm saved by grace.

344
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,720
 My sins are forgiven.

345
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:26,240
 I don't, my mistakes are not held against me," we can believe that, but lies still come

346
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,240
 in and accuse us.

347
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,320
 And in our mind, we feel so attacked and we feel like, "But I'm a miserable person and

348
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:36,200
 like I just fail so much and I'm not this enough or that enough or fill in the blank

349
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,200
 enough."

350
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,960
 And so we're discouraged because of that.

351
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,880
 It's the same thing there.

352
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:55,960
 We have to say, "Yes, I am certainly imperfect and I need God, but God's grace covers my

353
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,960
 sin.

354
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,320
 I'm forgiven.

355
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,880
 I'm not defined by those mistakes."

356
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,760
 As Pastor Mark read the passage earlier, "Nothing can separate me from the love of God."

357
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:12,120
 Those are truths and we need to bring those into our mind and say, "I'm not going to believe

358
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:17,000
 the lies that I'm just a failure and that I'm worthless and that everything's going

359
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,400
 to turn into disaster in my life.

360
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,400
 Those things are not true.

361
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,600
 I'm going to believe what God has said about me, that He loves me, that I'm forgiven, I'm

362
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,600
 accepted.

363
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:30,000
 He has a plan for my life and yes, it's not complete yet.

364
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,200
 I'm still a work in progress, but God is going to bring that to pass.

365
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,920
 He is going to complete it."

366
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:42,100
 That's what it means to begin to reject lies.

367
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,960
 If we're going to dwell in the truth, we've got to know the truth.

368
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,440
 We've got to soak in it.

369
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,320
 We've got to submit to it.

370
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:54,240
 We've got to respond to it, but we also have to start saying no to these lies that get

371
00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:02,640
 thrown at us by our own desires, by the culture around us, and by the enemy.

372
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,360
 The devil wants to throw those lies at us.

373
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:09,480
 They're fiery darts that he shoots at us to try to bring us down.

374
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,480
 Then what I want us to see is what comes out of this.

375
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:18,120
 If we begin to dwell in the truth in the way that Jesus is talking, what comes out of it

376
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,120
 in our lives?

377
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,120
 What's the fruit of it?

378
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:25,700
 Well, the first thing that we see Jesus point out here is that as we dwell in the truth,

379
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,240
 we live as true disciples.

380
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:36,960
 We're really true followers of Jesus if we're remaining and living in His truth.

381
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:45,000
 You know what that's saying is that the staying power of our faith in Jesus is not a product

382
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:52,040
 of the ease of our pathway as a disciple, but it's a product of our connection to Jesus

383
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:55,640
 and God's truth.

384
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:02,020
 What I'm saying there is the reality and the truth of your followership of Jesus will not

385
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:05,720
 be a product of how hard or how easy your life is.

386
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,320
 It will be a product of how close you are to Jesus.

387
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:15,200
 If you're close to Him, you can go through a lot of really difficult things.

388
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:20,240
 You can come out on the other side and be healthy and be joyful and be full of all that

389
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,160
 God has for you in your life.

390
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:29,880
 Jesus here is not saying when He says, "If you abide in my word," think about that statement,

391
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,180
 "If you abide in my word."

392
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:36,540
 That implies that it's not easy to abide in His word.

393
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:39,240
 It implies that there's going to be some challenges.

394
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:43,760
 It implies that some people are not going to abide in His word and they're going to

395
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,260
 turn back.

396
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:48,600
 It implies that some people aren't going to follow His teaching and some people aren't

397
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,680
 going to understand.

398
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:55,400
 That statement in and of itself is saying, "Hey, it's not easy.

399
00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:02,740
 It's not always going to be fun, but if you will remain, if you will dwell in His teaching,

400
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:08,300
 in His word, in His truth, then you'll be a true disciple."

401
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:13,680
 I think all of us desire to be a true disciple of Christ.

402
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,680
 That's why we're here.

403
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:22,140
 Jesus is saying this is the way to do it, to remain, to dwell, to live in His truth,

404
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,140
 in His word.

405
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:30,340
 And the other beautiful thing that we see is that as we dwell in the truth, we experience

406
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,620
 freedom.

407
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:35,460
 Jesus makes that clear in verse 32, "You shall know the truth and the truth shall make you

408
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,460
 free."

409
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,460
 Think about that.

410
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:45,420
 When we know the truth, when we know the truth about who we are, who God made us to be, the

411
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:49,460
 fact that we're forgiven, we're accepted, that we have a place in God's kingdom, God

412
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:54,420
 wants to use the gifts and the talents and the skills that He's given us to love and

413
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,420
 help others and to glorify Him.

414
00:26:56,420 --> 00:27:01,160
 When we know that truth, what a free place to be.

415
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:08,240
 That can set us free from so much self-doubt and self-loathing and fear and worry.

416
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:15,460
 When we know that God's power is greater than our sin, and we begin to experience the freedom

417
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:22,740
 of getting away from the things that hold us back, the hang-ups, the addictions, the

418
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:27,740
 struggles, and God gives us victory, and we're getting closer and closer to Jesus, and we're

419
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:31,180
 walking away from our old self and saying, "Yeah, that used to be who I was.

420
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,380
 I used to struggle with that.

421
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:34,060
 I used to get angry all the time.

422
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:36,940
 I used to have these problems, but I don't because Jesus is changing me.

423
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:39,700
 I'm being transformed from the inside out."

424
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:43,820
 That's a place of beautiful freedom.

425
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:48,780
 A freedom from bondage, those things that have harmed us in the past.

426
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:55,580
 And ultimately, it's a freedom to get closer to Jesus to know more of His truth.

427
00:27:55,580 --> 00:28:02,540
 It's like a spiral, except inverted in a healthy way, right?

428
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:07,660
 A lot of us sometimes spiral in unhealthy ways.

429
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,780
 I do that plenty of times.

430
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:12,300
 I start thinking about, "Oh, I messed this up," and then I realize, "Oh, I also messed

431
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,300
 that up."

432
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,140
 And then pretty soon, I'm like, "Oh, I messed everything up."

433
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:17,620
 We start spiraling down, right?

434
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:24,580
 But this is like a spiral going up in a healthy way, where as we know God's truth, and we

435
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:31,180
 get free from lies and unhealthy things, now we're able to believe more of the truth, and

436
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:34,540
 submit to more of the truth, and respond to more of the truth, and then we're able to

437
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:37,780
 learn something else that God wants to do in our lives, and submit to that, respond

438
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:38,780
 to that.

439
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:41,260
 And pretty soon, we're getting closer and closer to Jesus.

440
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,340
 We're getting healthier.

441
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:47,820
 God's doing a lot of just beautiful and amazing work in our lives.

442
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:48,820
 And that's what happens.

443
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:53,100
 As we dwell in the truth, we experience freedom.

444
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,460
 And all of us want that.

445
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:57,220
 All of us need that.

446
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:04,580
 And the other beautiful thing about this is that our world needs these type of people

447
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:07,140
 that we're describing, right?

448
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,580
 Think about people that you work with.

449
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:12,540
 Think about people that you go to school with, or that you are around, or even people in

450
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,580
 your own family.

451
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:21,860
 How much do some of those people need someone in their life who understands that they are

452
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:26,900
 loved by God, and who is able to love other people well, and who is not listening to all

453
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:32,100
 the lies of culture, and all the self-condemning things, but is able to see themselves in a

454
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:35,380
 healthy way, and respond to others in a healthy way?

455
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:40,180
 How much do the people around us need that?

456
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:47,180
 So as we dwell in the truth, God begins to use us.

457
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,860
 So that's my prayer for myself.

458
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:51,100
 It's my prayer for all of us.

459
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:57,740
 As we follow Jesus, as we become true disciples, that we would increasingly grow in embracing

460
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:00,300
 God's truth.

461
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,060
 We need to soak in God's word.

462
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:05,740
 If you're not doing that, maybe that's a starting place for you to say, "Okay, I'm

463
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,180
 familiar with the truth a little bit.

464
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:10,980
 I know some stuff, but I don't really spend that much time there."

465
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,380
 Maybe you need to start soaking.

466
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:16,900
 Maybe you need to kind of get immersed in it, spend some more time there.

467
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:20,220
 Maybe submission is the starting place for you.

468
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:23,740
 Maybe you say, "Well, yeah, I've been in the church a long time.

469
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,740
 I know a lot of stuff about scripture."

470
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:30,500
 But maybe there's just some areas where you know what you're supposed to do, but you're

471
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,340
 just not really doing it.

472
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,500
 You haven't submitted to it.

473
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:38,820
 You say, "Yeah, I know that's true, but I don't really want to mess with that part of

474
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,580
 my life."

475
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,980
 Maybe submission is the place for you.

476
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,020
 Maybe it's responding.

477
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:46,780
 Maybe you say, "I know a lot of truth, and I agree with it.

478
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:51,620
 I've submitted to it, but I just, I try, and I don't really follow through.

479
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,620
 It's hard for me."

480
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:56,300
 Maybe you need to respond.

481
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,300
 Maybe you need to reject lies.

482
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:03,420
 A lot of us get stuck there where we're trying to live out the truth, but we just keep holding

483
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:08,540
 on to some of those lies about who we are and about our own weakness and how we can't

484
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,620
 do anything.

485
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,820
 So we just get stuck.

486
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:16,380
 Maybe you need to start rejecting some of those lies.

487
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:23,020
 But may all of us really grow in living as genuine disciples and being set free by the

488
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:25,740
 truth that God has for us.

489
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,020
 Let's pray.

490
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:32,420
 God, I thank you so much for the truth.

491
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:39,500
 I thank you so much for who you are, that you, as the creator of the universe, you,

492
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:44,860
 the one who possesses all wisdom and knowledge, you care about us, and that you're willing

493
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:49,900
 to speak to us, and you're willing to tell us, "Hey, this is the way to go.

494
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:50,980
 This is the way to be healthy.

495
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:55,020
 This is the way to live your lives."

496
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,340
 Because without you, we wouldn't know that.

497
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:01,540
 We'd just be wandering around in the dark trying to make ourselves happy and make ourselves

498
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,340
 feel good.

499
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:08,980
 And most of us would be becoming increasingly miserable.

500
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:12,020
 So God, I thank you that you have spoken to us.

501
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:14,660
 You've given us truth in your word.

502
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:19,500
 And God, I pray that you would help us, especially right here in this room, as your followers,

503
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:24,020
 as disciples, help us to dwell in it, to remain in it, to soak in it, to spend our time in

504
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:29,940
 it, help us to submit to it, to respond to it, to apply it to our lives, help us to reject

505
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:34,740
 the lies that come against the truth and to replace them with your truth in our mind over

506
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:39,020
 and over again, as many times as we need to, to begin to believe the things that you've

507
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:44,900
 said about us and about our world and about our lives, and help us to get free from things

508
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:50,460
 that hold us back, help us to walk in freedom so that we can go boldly and confidently into

509
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:56,020
 the world and love others and point people to the freedom that we've found in Jesus.

510
00:32:56,020 --> 00:33:00,220
 God, we just thank you and praise you for who you are and pray that these things would

511
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:04,340
 be more and more evident in our lives.

512
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,980
 In Jesus' name, amen.

513
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:06,820
 Amen.
