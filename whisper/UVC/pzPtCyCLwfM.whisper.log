[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   - Well, this is the best time to think about
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.160]   the Christmas story and especially the chapters
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.960]   that have recorded the details of the birth of Jesus.
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.120]   And you will find those chapters
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.440]   in the first book of the New Testament,
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.560]   which is the Gospel of Matthew, Matthew 1 and 2.
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.960]   And also the third book of the New Testament,
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.840]   which is Gospel of Luke, chapter 1 and 2.
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.680]   And today we're going to focus on the first two chapters
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.120]   of the Gospel of Luke.
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.440]   And it talks about the prophecy,
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.320]   the annunciation of the birth of Jesus
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.800]   and his pioneer, John the Baptist,
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:45.280]   and also the detail into the details of the birth of Christ.
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.840]   So these two chapters are the so-called Christmas story.
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.760]   Now, when we think about the story of Christmas,
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.640]   we always think about, you know, it's a kid's story.
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.040]   It's a children's story, right?
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.200]   Yeah, you can find Luke 1 and 2
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.160]   in almost all of the children's Bible.
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:09.360]   And it's for a good reason because it's easy to understand.
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.640]   But as we think about this story,
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.240]   think about the details here,
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.440]   you find that it is not a story for children.
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.440]   It is not a story for kids.
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.480]   And perhaps this story, Christmas, is too familiar to us,
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.440]   but we have to read it more carefully.
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.280]   And if we do that,
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.120]   we find that the Bible's Christmas story
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.440]   has so much hidden meanings
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.600]   and so much even political meanings.
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.480]   And worse, that Luke, in the first two chapters,
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.160]   Luke 1 and 2,
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.240]   he used these words to tell the Christmas story.
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.680]   And if you are the first readers of the Bible,
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.720]   you know, if you hop into a time machine
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.760]   and go back to the time of Jesus, the first century,
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.280]   if you hear the story, if you hear some of the words,
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.120]   you will find that these terms are loaded
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.160]   with religious and political meanings.
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.960]   And here I give you the summary,
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.000]   and the summary will tell you that
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.720]   the story is not just for kids to read.
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:26.400]   Here, it says, it used words like Lord, Savior,
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:34.160]   Light, All Peoples, Gospel, Peace, God, or Son of God.
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.520]   Now, I highlight those words
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.280]   because not only they are used in the Gospel of Luke 1 and 2,
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.160]   as you can tell from the first line,
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.520]   the Lord is being used, Angel of the Lord,
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:52.080]   the glory of the Lord, Christ the Lord, Christ the Lord.
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.320]   And then Savior, unto you is born a Savior.
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.440]   And then Simeon, one of the old guys in the story
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.760]   in the first two chapters, when he saw the baby Jesus,
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.000]   he said he saw salvation, Savior or salvation.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.440]   And then Light, the word Light, what is so important,
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.120]   you know, it's used quite a few times
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.240]   in the first two chapters,
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.120]   Light to those in darkness, in the shadow of death,
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.880]   glory, light and glory,
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.680]   light to the nations, the Gentiles, glory to Israel.
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.160]   All peoples, all the world to be registered.
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.440]   Joseph and Mary are forced to be registered to pay taxes.
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.760]   Good news for all people.
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.280]   And then the salvation is for all peoples on earth.
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.960]   And then the word Gospel, we heard so many, so many times
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.600]   and we believe in the Gospel, we proclaim the Gospel.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.720]   And it's translated good news or good news of great joy.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:57.120]   And then peace, peace to guide us in the way of peace, 179.
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.360]   And then chapter two, verse 14, peace on earth.
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.560]   And of course the term God or son of God
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.360]   show up so many times, I don't need to give you examples.
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.800]   And what's so special about these terms is that
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.120]   these terms are political terms used by Augustus.
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.760]   Augustus was the first emperor of the Roman empire.
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.720]   You see the statue on the upper left.
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:29.600]   He used a lot of these words to proclaim himself to be king.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.200]   And he proclaimed himself to be Lord and savior,
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.960]   the light to the nations,
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.720]   the light to all the peoples in the empire.
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.160]   He's ruling all the peoples in the Roman empire.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.960]   He became king and it was the Gospel to the nations,
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.400]   the good news to the nations.
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.200]   And Augustus claimed that his rule will bring upon peace,
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:58.480]   bring to all people the way of peace, pex in Latin.
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.920]   And then he claimed himself to be God
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.560]   and used the title son of God in the coins
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.200]   and in his inscriptions.
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.400]   Now, all of these words highlighted
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.840]   are often used by the Roman emperor,
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.520]   starting from Augustus.
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.800]   In other words, if you watch the YouTube or TikTok
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.920]   or Netflix in those days,
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.600]   all the news channel in those days,
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:29.600]   you will be bombarded by the empire's political propaganda.
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.720]   The political propaganda is telling you
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.960]   that you need to be convinced that who bring you peace
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.960]   and who bring you joy and who bring you the savior
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.200]   and the salvation and the light.
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.080]   It was Augustus.
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.440]   It was the emperor, the Roman emperor.
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.200]   And you will be convinced
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.440]   if you watch those stories and propaganda,
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.520]   you have to put your faith in the Roman emperor
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.920]   because Augustus is God manifest.
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.560]   Augustus is the son of God.
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.080]   He is the bringer of peace.
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.560]   Now, if you understand this background,
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.920]   you understand this crystal story
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.640]   is using those political terms to apply to Jesus,
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.240]   apply to the baby born in manger, humble and small.
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.320]   You see that the Bible's crystal story
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.960]   counters and challenges those claims by Caesar,
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.120]   by the Roman emperor.
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.280]   It says, no, it was not the Roman king who bring you peace.
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.560]   It was not the emperor who bring you joy or security.
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.920]   The Roman empire cannot do that.
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.240]   The Roman empire ultimately is about domination.
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.280]   It's about military conquest, about oppression.
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.520]   That's what Roman empire is all about.
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.560]   And today, if you read this story,
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.720]   Luke is telling you there are many Caesars on earth.
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.880]   There are many kings and kingdoms and empires on earth
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.120]   are telling us the same gospels.
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:09.760]   Things like you will be satisfied,
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.480]   you will have security if you have this or that.
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.720]   If you believe in this or that,
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.880]   if you have this kind of relationship,
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.720]   you have acceptance from your peers,
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.200]   you have this world's measure of success
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.480]   or your technology and all that stuff.
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.280]   The big idea is the gospel.
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.560]   This is the gospel from the secular society,
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.160]   from today's world.
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.760]   Now, it's telling you this story,
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:37.600]   it's telling you this concept
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.680]   that if you possess this or that,
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.760]   if you own this or that,
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.120]   you will be totally secure,
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.600]   you will find fulfillment, you will be happy.
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.120]   That is the gospel of today.
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:51.280]   And that was the gospel in Luke's day in the first century,
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.320]   and Jesus came.
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:56.160]   The Christmas story is telling us
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.680]   we have to counter the claims of today's Caesars.
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:03.440]   Only Jesus Christ, the Lord,
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:07.440]   brings us peace, true peace and security.
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.480]   If you read Luke one and two as a whole,
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.680]   you find that, here's the Chinese version
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.760]   if you're interested.
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:20.000]   If you look at chapter one and two of Luke,
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.480]   it tells you the entire Christmas story
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.560]   in two chapters, two long chapters.
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.080]   You find that the flow of the chapter
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.560]   or the table of content or the outline of chapter
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:29.200]   is pretty clear.
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:34.080]   After the introduction, there's two annunciations.
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:38.640]   An annunciation means hearing the birth of someone.
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:39.140]   All right?
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.880]   The two annunciation, the first annunciation is
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:46.880]   the birth of John the Baptist, right?
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.320]   The pioneer of Messiah.
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:53.360]   And then the second annunciation was the birth of Jesus.
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:59.280]   And then after that is the two mothers meeting together,
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:02.480]   chapter 139 to 45.
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:05.360]   The two mothers is John the Baptist's mother, Elizabeth,
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.680]   and his husband, Zachariah.
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:08.800]   They were very, very old.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.320]   They were without child,
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:13.440]   but God bring them from shame to honor
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.880]   and gave them a child, miracle child, John the Baptist.
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.880]   And that's the first mother, Elizabeth.
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.960]   And the second mother, of course, is Mary, right?
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:26.080]   Mary was pregnant by the Holy Spirit
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:29.280]   and she was carrying the child, Jesus.
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:34.160]   And then the two mothers met together in 139 to 45.
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.200]   John the Baptist was in the womb
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:42.960]   and he was lipping with joy, seeing the Savior's mother.
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:46.720]   Even in the womb, he was looking forward
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:50.320]   to the arrival of the true Savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:53.680]   So the two mothers meeting together,
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:58.640]   and then Mary sang the song, the praise song, "Magnifica."
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:03.040]   And that is a very, very famous hymn.
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.480]   If you've been to a Catholic church
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.400]   or you come from a Catholic tradition,
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:10.880]   "Magnifica" is one of the most significant psalm
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.520]   or hymn sung by Mary.
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:17.280]   And then after this first praise song,
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.680]   is the birth of John the Baptist.
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:23.760]   So it's recording the details of his birth.
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:27.680]   And then after his birth, and he was named John,
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:33.600]   Zachariah, the father, burst out in praises.
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.840]   And that is the second song in the gospel of Luke,
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:39.280]   "Benedictus."
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:43.760]   He's blessing God because of his miracle,
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:47.120]   because of his promise, his faithfulness
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:50.480]   to fulfill the salvation for the people.
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:53.520]   And then chapter two is the birth of Jesus.
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:57.680]   And then after the recording of the birth of Jesus,
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:01.520]   there was song from heaven, from the heavenly angels,
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:05.440]   the angelic army singing the song together.
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:08.960]   And that is one of the most famous Christmas hymns,
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.840]   "Gloria in Excelsis," right?
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.440]   "Gloria in the highest."
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:20.480]   And then afterward, 222 to 240, Jesus was eight days old.
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:24.560]   And from, according to Jewish custom,
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:28.800]   Joseph and Mary need to bring the child, eight day old,
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.120]   to the temple in Jerusalem
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.160]   for circumcision.
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.280]   So the Lord is now in the temple,
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.040]   the true Lord, the true savior,
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.640]   although he's only eight years old,
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:41.040]   showing up in the temple.
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.560]   And then there were different details.
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:45.360]   They offered the sacrifice, Joseph and Mary.
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:52.080]   And then two elderly people, Simeon and Anna,
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.480]   came to meet the baby Jesus.
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:57.680]   And after Simeon saw with his own eyes,
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:02.080]   the eight day old savior,
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:06.080]   he burst out with another song, "Nu Dimittas,"
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:08.800]   which means, "Let me depart,"
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:12.160]   because he has been waiting, waiting, waiting
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.240]   for the salvation to come.
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:18.080]   And finally, in the temple court, he saw the savior.
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.760]   So he said, "Let me depart,
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.080]   "because I can now depart in peace
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.840]   "because the Lord is good.
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:25.200]   "The Lord has been faithful."
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:30.080]   And then the chapter end with 12 year old Jesus,
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:36.080]   and he show up in the temple again, 12 year old.
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:40.240]   And he was sitting there discussing the law,
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.560]   the law, the law of Moses with the teachers.
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.320]   And he was sitting there,
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:46.800]   and that is the posture of rabbi.
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:50.560]   12 year old, he was the rabbi.
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:53.280]   And he was debating and asking questions
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:58.560]   and actually teaching the adults about the Mosaic law,
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:02.160]   about the law and the prophet and the Old Testament.
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:07.280]   That's a pretty amazing chapter, chapter one and two.
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:11.680]   But let's reveal the stories here.
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:15.280]   And in these two chapters, who have met the Lord,
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:16.800]   who have met the savior,
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:20.000]   and experienced the true peace and true salvation?
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:20.880]   Who are these people?
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:23.600]   Now I mentioned here and there,
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:28.720]   you know, the old, right here,
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:34.400]   the old couple, Zachariah and Elizabeth,
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.160]   the parents of John the Baptist.
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.040]   They were really really old and they were without child,
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:42.560]   but God is, God remembers them
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:45.680]   and grant them a miracle child, John the Baptist,
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:48.160]   and then raise them from shame to honor.
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.600]   And then John the Baptist, while in the womb of the mother,
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.360]   he met Jesus in Mary's womb,
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:56.640]   and John the Baptist was leaping for joy
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.560]   as if I want to come out,
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:02.160]   I want to come out and see the coming of the salvation.
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.200]   And then Joseph and Mary,
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.400]   Joseph and Mary, the holy family,
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:09.040]   they were powerless as well.
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:13.280]   They were the bottom of the society
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.440]   under the Roman empire.
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:18.320]   In the chapter two, the shepherds,
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:25.360]   watching the sheep in the fields of Bethlehem,
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:30.160]   they were also the outskirt of the society.
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:35.360]   And then Simeon, an old man waiting for the peace of God,
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:38.640]   the salvation of God to come to reality.
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.400]   And finally he saw it,
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:43.040]   and he saw baby Jesus eight days old,
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:47.120]   and he praises God and sings a song, "Let me depart."
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.760]   And then finally there's another widow, Anna.
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:56.400]   So old widow living around the temple court
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:59.360]   to serve God for years and years and decades,
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:04.160]   and waiting to see the fulfillment of the salvation.
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.960]   Now in these two chapters,
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.280]   those common people,
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:11.520]   not the kings, not the empire,
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:18.880]   not the 1% of the population,
[00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:23.600]   but socially outcast, socially marginalized people,
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:28.960]   they have met Jesus because Jesus showed up to them.
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:34.800]   Now I want to reflect on the last song.
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.200]   And as I said, the last song means
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:42.800]   that Simeon, when he saw the salvation of God,
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.880]   and he burst out in praises.
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:50.160]   And here Luke records the story, 2.25.
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:54.880]   Now there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon,
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.120]   who was righteous and devout,
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:00.880]   and he was waiting for the consolation of Israel.
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:03.520]   And the Holy Spirit was upon him.
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:06.400]   It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:10.560]   that he would not die before he had seen the Lord's Christ.
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:14.160]   Moved by the Spirit, he went into temple courts.
[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.400]   When the parents, Joseph and Mary,
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:20.160]   brought in child Jesus to do for him
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.240]   what the custom of the law require,
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.920]   which is the offering,
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:31.360]   in 28, Simeon took the baby in his arms
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.960]   and praised God, saying,
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:36.080]   "Sovereign Lord, as you have promised,
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:40.800]   "you now dismiss your servant in peace.
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:44.560]   "For my eyes have seen your salvation,
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:48.640]   "which you have prepared in the sight of all people,
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:51.440]   "a light for revelation to the Gentiles,
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:55.120]   "and for glory to your people Israel."
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:17:00.640]   Now, this guy is an old guy, right?
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.560]   And he saw the salvation.
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:07.840]   He's socially marginalized, but he met Jesus.
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:10.160]   Now in the Roman Empire,
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.960]   the strong and the rich,
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:17.040]   they enjoy status and privilege.
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:20.800]   No, they got the money, okay?
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:22.960]   They are the Elon Musk, right?
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:25.040]   They can do whatever they want, all right?
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:28.320]   That's how the Roman world works.
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:30.960]   You have the power, you have the arms,
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:34.160]   and then you rule, and you have the privilege.
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.240]   You have the salvation, you have the peace.
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:40.160]   But the gospel, the Christmas gospel,
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:43.280]   is counter-empire.
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.920]   It's against the empire,
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:49.680]   because it proclaims that the baby born in manger,
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:51.760]   humble and low,
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:56.640]   he instead is the true God.
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.640]   He is the Son of God.
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:02.960]   And the true good news is that Jesus is born in Bethlehem,
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:06.000]   one without power.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.800]   Even though he had power, he had all the glory,
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.680]   but he lay aside his glory and majesty,
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:15.440]   and come into our midst so that we can meet the true God.
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:19.040]   We can experience the true salvation.
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:24.800]   Now last Friday, I and another minister,
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:28.800]   we went to visit a very, very old lady.
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.800]   She was dying.
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:33.200]   So we went to Northwestern Hospital,
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:40.080]   and with all this obstacle we overcome.
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:46.000]   And then we come to the room and saw this old lady.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.760]   And I've known this Christian lady for a long, long time,
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:50.400]   for decades.
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:53.360]   And she has always been faithful,
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:56.800]   and always been supportive of my ministry.
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:00.000]   So I heard about, she was not doing so well.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.040]   And especially the last five days,
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:06.880]   she has not been eating,
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:11.680]   and she has not been drinking for five or so days.
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:13.120]   And she was very, very weak.
[00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:17.120]   So we came and visited her.
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:19.360]   And it's very interesting,
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:24.480]   whenever we visit someone by the sickbed,
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:28.080]   so often it was like the providence of God.
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:33.200]   And as I told you, she was without food
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:35.680]   and without water for so many days.
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:38.480]   And she was over 80 years old.
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:45.360]   And, but when we visited her, she was very, very alert.
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.840]   And it's kind of providence of God, right?
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:53.280]   In those hours, she was kind of, I don't know,
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:57.120]   maybe she sensed that someone's coming to visit her.
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:01.280]   And interestingly, she was able to open her eyes
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:05.360]   and interact with me for a little bit.
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.760]   So I talked to her and I said,
[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:10.720]   "Oh, I'm Pastor Mark, do you recognize me?"
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:14.000]   And she blinked her eyes and tried to nod.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.360]   And I read Psalm 23.
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:20.160]   I read Psalm 23 with her.
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:22.480]   And I saw her smile.
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:27.120]   I saw her eyes, those weak,
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:30.640]   but radiated with hope and joy.
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:34.400]   Now that short encounter,
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:38.160]   a visit of about maybe 15, 20 minutes,
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:41.200]   talked to her family members and talked to her.
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:45.120]   I realized this is actually what this song is all about.
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:51.520]   Someone who has been waiting for God's salvation.
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:55.440]   Someone who has put her hope and trust
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.400]   in the true Son of God.
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:02.000]   And finally, in the visitation,
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.840]   she kind of realized that the hope is in God
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:10.000]   and no one can take it away.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:15.040]   And I see from her eyes, I see from her reaction,
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:19.360]   she was filled with joy and faith.
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:21.520]   And what a moment.
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:23.520]   And I was brought to tears.
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:30.960]   If our lives center on the promise of God,
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:33.200]   God will not fail us.
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:36.880]   Yes, we have to be patient at times,
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:39.840]   patient for the work of God.
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:46.000]   Sometimes we have to wait for days, weeks, months, and years.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.040]   But no one has put the faith in God will fail
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:54.480]   because God has always been faithful to us.
[00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:56.720]   Now in this season of Christmas,
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:22:00.000]   I'm sure you are busy, right?
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.160]   I'm sure you're very, very busy.
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.680]   There are some students here
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:07.440]   and you're probably writing your final papers, right?
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:11.680]   Some of us by the end of the year,
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:14.400]   probably very busy at work
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.240]   and with your family business
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:18.240]   and taking care of different people
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:21.120]   and offering hospitality to your family members
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:23.600]   or you're flying somewhere to visit your family.
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:26.080]   People come in and out.
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:32.400]   And Christmas has always been a season of challenge.
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:36.560]   You know, we can say ho, ho, ho all the time, right?
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:38.960]   I don't know if you listen to the radio.
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:41.360]   It's for old guy like me.
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:43.600]   I listen to radio because when I drive,
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:47.040]   I pop in the radio to the station.
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:52.400]   Since Thanksgiving, I've always listening to the same song
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:54.800]   playing in the radio all the time.
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:55.680]   You know what song is that?
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:59.440]   It's the most wonderful time of the year.
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:02.160]   It's always playing in the radio.
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:04.720]   And you know, I must admit, you know,
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:07.920]   is it really the most wonderful time of the year?
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:10.720]   Well, not quite for me.
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:15.440]   I mean, not so bad, but it's not the most wonderful time.
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:17.680]   And I'm sure it's not the most wonderful time
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.120]   for many of us.
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:24.240]   It may be the most difficult time for many of us.
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:26.560]   Fill with sadness.
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:28.880]   That's why in Christmas season,
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:32.320]   most of the people commit suicide because they're depressed.
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:36.960]   They're depressed in the impression
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:39.040]   that the whole world is having a good time,
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:41.280]   but not you, right?
[00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:44.080]   And it gets you really, really depressive.
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:48.800]   This season can be busy, can be very, very tough for you.
[00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:52.960]   But I want to encourage you today as we close.
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:57.200]   As we read the Christmas story,
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:00.560]   don't forget that you should invite
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:04.720]   the Son of God into your life.
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:09.120]   The low and humble, true Lord and Savior.
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:12.560]   He is the one we can put our trust in.
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:15.760]   And He is the one when we invite Him into our lives
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:17.200]   to walk with us.
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:20.080]   Remember I told you when I visit the patient,
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:22.720]   which Psalm did I read?
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:26.800]   Psalm 23, right?
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:28.720]   Psalm 23, okay?
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:31.840]   You don't need to recite any Psalm in the Bible
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:33.440]   except this one, okay?
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:35.040]   Psalm 23, okay?
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:37.280]   It's applicable in all occasions,
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:39.760]   especially when those people
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:42.640]   who are walking through some tough time.
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:45.680]   Because in Psalm 23, right in the middle,
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:49.200]   it said, "Even though I walk through the shadow of death,
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:50.640]   "the valley of shadow of death,
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:53.120]   "you are with me."
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:56.720]   The shepherd is with you.
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:59.040]   God is with you.
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:03.120]   So as we close, why don't we pray together
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:06.160]   and invite Jesus to come into our lives again,
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:10.000]   to walk with us, no matter what we are experiencing.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.440]   Let's all pray.
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:16.160]   Father, thank you.
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:20.240]   Thank you that you sent your Son
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:25.520]   who laid aside His majesty, His glory
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:28.080]   to come into our midst,
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:32.320]   into our lives, into our hearts.
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:35.360]   So as we close, as we reflect on
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:37.360]   the true story of Christmas,
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:42.960]   we want to open our hearts to invite you in.
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:46.560]   And Lord Jesus, we want to put our trust in you.
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:51.520]   And Lord Jesus, we want to invite you to come to our place.
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:53.600]   And thank you for your grace
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:57.200]   that you don't mind how messy our life is.
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:00.320]   You don't mind how broken we are.
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:03.840]   Yet you came.
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:09.520]   So we invite you to come in to be our Lord and our Savior
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:14.000]   and help us to open our eyes to see
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:18.000]   the true light that brings hope to all people,
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.160]   brings hope to us,
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:25.520]   can be a reality to our lives.
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:29.600]   So again, we invite Jesus to come into our lives
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:33.120]   to be a leader, to guide us,
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:36.800]   to walk alongside with us.
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:41.280]   Even though we may experience some tough times
[00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:42.720]   and challenging times,
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:46.640]   yet we know that you are with us.
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:49.440]   Thank you for being our Lord and our Savior.
[00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:54.640]   And again, help us to reflect on the true meaning of Jesus,
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:57.760]   to thank you, to give you praise,
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:01.360]   because you love us so much in Christ and pray.
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:05.440]   Well, once again, thank you for coming.
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:09.200]   And next week, as Kelly said, it's going to be 11.
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:11.200]   Yes, all right.
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:13.120]   And thanks again for Patrick and Kelly
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:15.520]   for preparing refreshment for us.
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:17.440]   Please enjoy the refreshment
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:21.600]   and stay for a little bit time of fellowship together.
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:22.800]   Okay, God bless.
