[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   My dear brothers and sisters, good morning.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   Okay, you know what, last week actually was the first Sunday worship we had together after the merger.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   So it seems like, you know what, it seems like transplanting our organ.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   So it'll take some time.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   So when you look at each other, actually they are you.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   Okay, we are one body.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   It means that they are part of you, you are part of they, part of them.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   So you need to accept each other as one body of Christ.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   Okay, so this is my homework for all of you guys.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   So before you go home after this worship, as one body, practice oneness.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   Like what?
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   Meet three strangers around you.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   So urban voices, urban voice, you guys, you meet your new brothers and sisters.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   Learn them by their name.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   Look at their eyes, ask their job, and ask their lives, okay?
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   Do the same thing.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Okay, so Puneon, former Puneon, now you are urban voice, don't forget that.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   So ask the other brothers and sisters how they are doing now, okay?
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   This is practicing oneness in Christ.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   So I don't know, can we have the title on the screen, today's message?
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   The message of -- the title of today's message is like this.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   Keep your heart more from the evil than from COVID.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Did you get it?
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   What is the title?
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Keep your heart more from the evil than you are trying to keep from -- keep yourself from COVID.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   So our COVID situation is going on and on.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   And this COVID situation is the most inconvenient and fearful and dreadful period of our lives.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   So what did you experience?
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Do you remember last year, March, COVID situation started in Chicago and then a few months, for the following a few months, everything was closed down.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Do you remember lockdown?
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   There was no people on the streets.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   And all the public places were closed.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   We couldn't do anything.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   There was COVID-19.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   And how about these days?
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   I have three children.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   They go to the public -- they go to the school.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Whenever they have any symptom, like a very light symptom or a mere little fever or just if they -- even if just they sneeze, they need to take the COVID-19 test.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Okay?
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   So COVID-19 is now -- has been so serious for all of us.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Even after one and a half years later now, more than that, what did you learn?
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   What is the greatest lesson through this COVID-19?
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   What did you learn?
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   I learned about the importance of cleanliness.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   So you guys place some -- what is that?
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Sanitizers in front of the doors everywhere.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   What do you think of?
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Cleanliness.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Through this COVID-19, what we learned most is cleanliness, the importance of cleanliness.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   And in today's story, Jesus and the Pharisees and teachers of the law, they were arguing about the true cleanliness.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Why?
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   When Jesus' disciples, they joined eating the food, Jesus' disciples, they were maybe -- they were too hungry.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   So they didn't wash their hands.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   So what did they do?
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Jesus' disciples didn't wash their hands, and they were beginning to eat the food.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   When the Pharisees and teachers of the law, when they looked at them, they were shocked.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   What are you guys -- what are you doing?
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   We Jewish people, if we do not wash our hands, we do not eat any food.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   That is our cleanliness.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   We are holy people.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   That's what the Pharisees were thinking.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Right?
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   They were super holy people, super clean people.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   So they were talking about some cleanliness.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   But when Jesus heard it, Jesus began to talk about another kind of cleanliness.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   What is that?
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Jesus said, when you can read your Bible, please keep your Bible open, and you can go back to the verses again and again together.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   When you look at verse 15, Jesus says like this, "Nothing outside a man can make him unclean by going into him.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   It is rather, it is what comes out of a man that makes him unclean."
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Did you hear that?
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   So here, when Jesus heard the Pharisees and teachers of the law, Jesus is giving a totally different interpretation about the true cleanliness.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   So, what is that?
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   The Pharisees and teachers of the law, they were talking about physical cleanliness, visible, which is visible.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Visible, physical cleanliness.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   But Jesus was talking about what?
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   Spiritual, invisible cleanliness.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   Which is more important?
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Pharisees and teachers of the law, they were keeping the law so well.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   So they thought we are holy people.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   But when Jesus was looking at them, Jesus knew that they were actually unclean.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Who is unclean?
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   The Pharisees and teachers of the law.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   For an example, Jesus was pointing out their fault.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   You are washing your hands before eating the food, but actually you are not holy people.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   You are unclean, dirty people.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Why?
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Because look at what you are doing now.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   What is that Jesus is pointing out?
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Jesus talked about Korban.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   Everybody, Korban.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   Korban.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   C-O-R-B-A-N.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   Korban is some amount of money, very precious gift set aside only for God.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   So the people, they set aside quite a lot of money, and they called it Korban, which is a gift to God.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   Then what happens?
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   If you set aside a lot of money for God, it means that you don't need to support your parents.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   So many Jewish people, they were avoiding the duty of supporting their parents, making their money as a kind of Korban.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   But actually in their tradition, they were not supporting their parents.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   At the same time, they were not worshipping God with their true genuine heart.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   That is their heart.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   So when Jesus was talking about this, what did Jesus do?
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   This is not the only thing.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   When you go down to verse 13, Jesus says that this is not the only thing.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   Actually, Jesus says, "You are doing many other things like this Korban."
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   So look at you guys.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   You are trying to keep the law, but actually you are ignoring the law.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   You are not keeping the law.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   So are you really clean?
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Jesus was asking the Pharisees and teachers of the law.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   Then my brothers and sisters in this place, which is more important?
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   Physical cleanliness, visual cleanliness.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   When you guys are coming to the church, if you do not wash, people will look at you.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   "Oh, look at the guy. Oh, smell. Did you brush your teeth? We don't like it, right?"
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   But how about the cleanness?
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   What is the true cleanness?
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Physical, visual cleanliness, one side.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   The other side, spiritual, invisible cleanliness, which is more important.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   Actually, you cannot compare.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   If you are not clean in your body, it's okay.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   People will frown, make a frowning face at you.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   That's it.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   But if your heart is not clean, what happens?
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   Because of this dirtiness, people go to hell.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   If our conscience, if our mind and heart is not cleaned by Jesus' blood,
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   if our heart is not clean, then what happens to the people?
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   They will go to hell.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   Spiritual uncleanness gives us that penalty, which is more important.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   What else?
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   If our spirit is not clean, what happens?
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   It governs all the areas of our lives.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   Actually, our spiritual condition shapes and decides the whole quality of our lives.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   Are you now painful because your spirit is not clean?
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   Are you now anxious or fearful because your spirit has a problem?
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   Your spiritual condition decides everything in your life.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   I had a couple of days of short trip this week, and then I couldn't brush my teeth every time, three times per day.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   When I didn't do it, when I came back from the trip, I realized my teeth.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   I felt a little pain in my gum because I'm an old man.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   But listen, if our spirit is not clean, day by day, moment by moment,
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   we harvest what we sow when we do not take care of our spirit.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   Then let's think about this.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   When you read the scripture together, what is the source of the spiritual uncleanness?
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   If you do not brush your teeth, what is the source?
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   Yes, a little tiny piece of the food inside and between the teeth.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   That is the source, right?
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   Of the stinky smell.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   But how about the source of the spiritual uncleanness?
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   What is that?
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   This is very important.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   My brothers and sisters, listen to me very carefully.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   This knowledge is really, really important.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   You young people, you need to listen very carefully today.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   What is the source of the spiritual uncleanness?
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   Verse 15.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   Can we go back to verse 15?
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   It's very important.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   Do you see any verse?
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   Okay, verse 15, listen to me.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   It is what comes out of a man that makes him unclean.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   Nothing outside of man makes him unclean.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   Rather, it is what comes out of a man that makes him unclean.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   What did that mean?
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   When disciples heard this verse, they didn't understand, just like you.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   They didn't understand.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   How come?
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   Something out of us, it makes unclean.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   It is not from outside, but from our inside, that is the thing which makes us unclean.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   The disciples didn't understand the first explanation.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   So when Jesus was alone with the disciples, Jesus was explaining one more time.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   From verse 21 to 23.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   Listen very carefully, you young people.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   This is very important knowledge.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   Verse 21.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   For from within, out of man's heart, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance, and folly.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   All these evils, verse 23, all these evils come from inside.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   Where?
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   Not from outside, but from inside and make a man unclean.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   What does that mean?
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   All these evil thoughts, what are the evil thoughts?
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   When they enumerate, when Jesus was enumerating all these unclean evil thoughts, Jesus summarized the first one, evil thoughts.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   What are the evil thoughts?
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   Coming out of your mind, inside.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   Number one, sexual immorality.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   All kinds of dirty desires, sexual desires, dirty desires.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   Where does it come from?
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   And then theft, what is that theft?
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   You want to steal.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   Are you paying the tax honestly?
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   Even so many Christians, they are deceived by the Satan, by the evil spirit.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   And even paying the taxes, they are not honest.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   So when you hear the word theft, you are thinking about really huge rich people?
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   No.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   So many of us, we are choosing the wrong things.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   Theft, that is stealing some money in whatever ways.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   Or murder, what is murder?
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   Jesus said, if you have a hatred inside you, if you have a small hatred inside you, it's just stealing.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   It's killing people.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   Adultery, adultery.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   Greed, what is greed?
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   You desire more than enough.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   You have already enough.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   Who is now hungry?
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   Now in our society, you are hungry?
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   Pastor Mark, Rachel is now hungry.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   She raised, okay, not that kind of meaning.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   You have enough money to buy food, but what I'm saying is, like, nobody is hungry in our society now.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   But people are desiring more.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   People are desiring more and more.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   There is no satisfaction.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   There is no thankfulness.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   Greed, how about malice?
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   What is malice?
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   Young people, what is malice?
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   Okay, you did the wrong thing to me.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   Okay, I'm going to hate you until I die.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   Malice.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   How about deceit?
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   Are you honest in dealing with your job?
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   Dealing with any responsibility?
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   Deceit, lewdness, what is lewdness?
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   Sexually dirty in words and thoughts and behavior.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   Envy, what is envy?
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   You have already enough, but you think that the person, what the person has now is what I now want.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   So you continuously desire what others have.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   Envy.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   Until when?
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   Until you die.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   You are never fully satisfied.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   You never understand that God is the wonderful provider.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   And then slander, what is slander?
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   You talk back, you're biting persons, any character, anything behind their back.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   Okay, how about arrogance?
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   Pride and folly.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   All kinds of foolish things.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   You choose foolish words, foolish behavior, but you think that it's okay.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   When you look at other people, when they are doing it, you are shocked.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   Why they are doing such a foolish thing?
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   But actually, that's what we are doing.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   Then brothers and sisters, where do all these evil thoughts come from?
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   Today's passage is very important.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   It is not from outside, but it is from inside.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   Inside.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   Who is inside?
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   Who is inside?
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   So when you go to the scripture, 1 John 3, verse 8-9.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   When you go to the scripture, 1 John 3, verse 8-9, it goes like this.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   He who does what is sinful is of the devil.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   Did you hear me?
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   He who does what is sinful is of the devil.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   Because the devil has been sinning from the beginning.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   What does this verse talk about?
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   Any sin, every sin is from the Satan.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   It's from the enemy.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   Because when God made us, we were made in God's image.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   What does that mean?
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   We love, we desire the true love.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   We desire the holiness.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   We desire the cleanness.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   That's how God made us.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   But all these kinds of evil and dirty thoughts come from the Satan.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   So where is Satan?
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   In your heart.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   Inside you.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   In your thoughts.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   In your emotions.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   They have built their house in there.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   So this is a very important understanding.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   Jesus said it is not, it is what comes out of a man that makes him unclean.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   So who is inside us?
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   The Satan, the evil spirit.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   You may wonder, how can it happen?
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   Yeah, that's what the Bible reveals.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   That's the truth the Bible reveals about.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   Then, from today, when you have that kind of dirty and evil thoughts, emotions, imaginations, and feelings, and all those things,
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   what should you think?
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   Oh, you Satan.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   Are you trying to enter my heart?
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   Again, you should understand.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   All those evil desires is not your desire.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   You need to understand that those desires are from the Satan.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   Okay?
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   That is the teaching.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   That's what Jesus teaches today in today's passage.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   Then, let's think more about this.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   How does Satan's uncleanness enter us?
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   Okay, Satan can enter through our thoughts, through our emotions, especially through our hearts.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   Then how does it happen?
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   What is our heart?
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   Our heart is like a cockpit.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   Do you know cockpit?
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   Cockpit is the small place in front of the airplane where the pilot flies the whole airplane.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   It's a very small place, cockpit.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   Our heart is like a cockpit.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   Our heart is the center of our being.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   In our heart, what happens?
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   In our heart, we decide and we discern which is right and which is wrong.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   At the same time, we know that, "Oh, that's good. That's not bad. That's good. That's bad."
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   Our heart is the place we discern and we decide everything.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   So our heart is the center of us.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   Right?
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   Then this heart can be stolen by the evil spirit.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   So actually, when we were talking, Pastor Mark read some parts, but actually read a little bit more than I expected, but it was good.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   Why?
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   Because when Pastor Mark read the following passage, it shows two people.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   One is a little daughter of a woman.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   The little daughter was possessed by an evil spirit.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   Possessed.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   The Bible says possessed by the evil spirit.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   Second case was like this.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   What is the second case?
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   The last story. Do you remember?
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   What is that?
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   Death man.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   Jesus says the death came from the evil spirit.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   So when you look at these people, when you look at the Bible, you need to understand that much, much more than we can think, ever think.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   There are a lot of evil possession cases.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   We see like a physical condition.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   Like some psychological issue, mental issue, or a physical issue.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   But behind that, a lot of spiritual issues too.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   Okay?
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   Then, in another story, when you go to Mark's Gospel, chapter 7, when Jesus was expelling the evil spirit, Jesus says, when Jesus called the spirit, Jesus used evil spirit.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   But in Greek language, it says unclean spirit.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   Do you get it?
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   So evil spirit, what they are doing is all unclean things.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   Dirty things.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   We love cleanliness, but actually, so many dirty things are coming from our hearts because of the evil spirits.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   Now you are getting it a little bit?
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   Then, how does the evil spirit enter our hearts?
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   How does the evil spirit enter our hearts?
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   How?
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   When you think.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   When you think, the evil spirit enters your thinking as if it were your thinking.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   Actually, it was not part of your thinking, but the evil spirit comes into your thinking slightly, very secretly.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   Okay?
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   Or your emotion.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   When you are really angry, evil spirit enters your heart.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   Gives more anger.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   More anger.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   Breaking your things.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   Breaking the relationship.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   Breaking the most precious thing in your life.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   Or some strong desire.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   Very strong sexual desires.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   Now young people, you need to listen.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   In your days, if you do not keep your heart pure, you are going to lose everything in your life.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   If you do not keep your heart pure, you are going to lose everything in your life.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   Because it is from the Satan.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   I'm telling you.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   Whatever you cannot do in front of other people, it is from the Satan.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   Listen. What is sin?
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   Sin is everything you cannot do in front of other people.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   Because it's dirty.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   It's not right.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   That's why you cannot do it in front of other people.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   So through your thoughts, through your desires, or some words.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   Some words are trying to enter your heart.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   I experienced a lot of times.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   Now I know how to fight this spiritual battle.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   So many years.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   And God gave me a victory.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   I couldn't do it.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   But God gave me the victory over a long period of time.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   But still, the Satan tries to enter my heart.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   I can feel it.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   Or sometimes, very grotesque, evil pictures.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   Some dirty thoughts and pictures in your heart.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   You know what?
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   This is not yours.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   But it is the Satan's.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   It is the evil spirit in disguise.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   And then all these things, dirty, evil things, they are all lies.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   You need to understand.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   They are not true actually.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   But they are all lies.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   About you.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   Lies about what?
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   Lies about you.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   You guys, at least as far as I know, all the brothers and sisters in here.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   You love Jesus.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   You are saved.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   You want to be holy.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   But that kind of all dirty, evil desires and thoughts, they are not yours.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   They are from the Satan.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   So what is that?
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   It's a lie.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   It's a lie.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   So John's Gospel chapter 8 verse 44 says like this.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   John's Gospel chapter 8 verse 44.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   You belong to your father, the devil.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   Here you is Pharisees and the teachers of the law.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   Okay?
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   Just religious people.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   Religious people.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desire.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   For there is no truth in him.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   Listen here.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   When he lies, when the Satan lies, he speaks his native language.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   For he's a liar and the father of lies.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   Who is a Satan?
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   Satan, whenever he opens his mouth, Satan is a liar.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   He never says any truth about you, about God.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   Okay?
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   So whatever the Satan says, it's a lie.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   It's a lie.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   And he's the father of lies.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   His native language is not Cantonese.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   His native language is not Mandarin or Korean.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   His native language is lie.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   Do you understand?
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   How many times did he lie to you?
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   Do you understand?
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   And then when you listen to the Satan, what will happen in your life?
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   What is the time now?
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   When does the worship end?
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   Ten more minutes?
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   Okay, ten more minutes.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   So listen.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   When you listen to the Satan or the unclean thoughts and desires, this is the things that will happen in your life.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   You're going to break your relationship, broken relationship.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   And there are all kinds of shame, shame and guilt in your life.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   We had a great man in our country.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   His name was Park, just a family name.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   He was a mayor, mayor of Seoul city, metropolitan city, 10 million people.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   He was a mayor, very powerful man.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   He was an activist when he was young, so people respected him.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   He had everything now, mayor of Seoul metropolitan city.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   But you know what?
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   He yielded into the wrong desire and what happened to him.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   He had a sexually wrong thing with his secretary.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   And the secretary was going to expose the sin.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   And this guy, he went on to mountain, he committed suicide.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   Just one single wrong desire killed him.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   My brothers and sisters, this is what the Satan does.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   And then, listen, how can we keep our hearts clean?
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   My brothers and sisters, how can we keep our hearts clean?
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   Number one, guard your heart.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   Everybody, guard your heart.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   Guard your heart.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   Proverbs chapter 4, verse 23 goes like this.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   "Above all else, guard your heart, for it is the wellspring of life."
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   You guys, I have Chinese brothers and sisters here,
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   but I was shocked when I saw you guys.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   Because many brothers and sisters, they have a camera,
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   the security camera in their houses.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   I don't think they need it because they are not rich people.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   But many brothers and sisters, they have a security camera in their houses.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   They lock the door and then it is not enough.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   So they put the security camera in their houses.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   Why? To guard, to guard.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   How about your heart?
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   How about your heart?
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   Are you setting a guard in your heart?
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   Or does every dirty thing come in, goes easily?
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   How is your heart? You need to check.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   How can you keep your heart?
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   What is the guard?
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   If you do not know the word of God,
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   then you don't know how to keep your heart.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   When you check God's word, you need to know that,
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   "Oh, that is right, or that is wrong."
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   You can set a guard according to God's word.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   That's why you need to study God's word day and night.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   Young people, read God's word.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   Don't go into any blog or Facebook.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   Facebook after Facebook, it will kill you.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   Listen. Read God's word. Read God's word.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   Second one, how can we be clean in our hearts?
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   Number two, throw away the sources of uncleanness.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   Throw away all uncleanness.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   The source of uncleanness. What is that?
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   The Bible, Mark's gospel, when you go down more,
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   in the same chapter, chapter 9, Jesus said,
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   "If your hands do something sinful, cut it off.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   If your legs do something sinful, cut it off.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   If your eyes are doing something wrong, pluck it out."
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   There is a seriousness, seriousness of uncleanness, sins.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   1 John 3, verse 9 goes like this.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   "No one who is born of God will continue to sin."
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   If you are born of God, you should stop doing the same sin again and again.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   If you are repeating the same sin again and again,
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   it means you are listening to the enemy.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   This is the enemy's lies.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   You cannot overcome.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   That is who you are.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   You've been enjoying it for more than a decade.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   You cannot get out of that.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   My husband cannot change.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   My wife cannot change.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   That's a lie.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   When Jesus' blood touches us, we should change.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   Like what?
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   What is throwing away all the sources of uncleanness?
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   When you have a pile of dung.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   Do you like dung?
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   You don't like it?
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   If you have a good pile of dung, flies will come, surely.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   But if you clean it up, no more flies.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   In the same way, if you throw away all the evil things from your heart,
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   from your lives, from your habits, then the evil spirit will leave you.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   Third one, come near to the clean gathering and people.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   Come near to the clean gathering and people, just like this.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   Like what?
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   When Jesus was walked about, people wanted to touch Jesus' cloak.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   Just Jesus' clothes.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   Why?
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   They knew that even if I touch Jesus' body or Jesus' clothes,
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   I'm going to be healed.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   Unclean things are contagious.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   At the same time, cleanliness is contagious, too.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   So if you come to the clean people, our heart becomes cleaner and cleaner.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   Number four, wash your uncleanness with Jesus' blood.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   Our guilt and shame of sin is cleansed only by Jesus' blood.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   If you have guilt, if you have any kind of shame, I had a lot.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   In my 30s, I was a sinner.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   I had been going to the church for a long time, but I had a lot of sins inside me.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   Guilt, guilt and shame.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   I had to be covered with Jesus' blood fully, and I got free.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   I was freed.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   1 John 1, verse 7 says, "The blood of Jesus, the Son, purifies us from all sin."
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   What does that mean?
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   Cleanses us from all sins.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   Okay, last one.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   So you know what?
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   What do you do?
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   If you are repeating the same sin again and again, you want to get out of it, but you cannot do it,
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   you need to cry out, "Jesus, save me from my sin and cover me with your sin!"
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   "Remove all the shame and guilt! Make me whole! Make me clean!"
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   Okay?
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   Cry out in your prayer.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   Last one.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   How can we keep ourselves clean all the time?
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   Be filled with the Spirit.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   Ephesians 5, verse 18 says, "Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery."
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   Instead, be filled with the Spirit.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   If you are drinking Facebook after Facebook, all kinds of Instagram and those things,
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   you are drinking the unholy, unclean things.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   How can you be filled with the Holy Spirit?
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   It means that when you sit at home, when you are eating, when you are sleeping, when you are studying,
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   you are filled with God's thinking.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   You are filled with God's emotion, God's Word, God's idea, God's feeling.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   Then you are Spirit-filled.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   How can that happen?
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   If you give the center of your heart to God.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   If not, you cannot be filled with the Spirit.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   We are easily filled with the Spirit of the world.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   We need to be very careful.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   Okay?
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   So, let me close, my dear brothers and sisters.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   We don't like unclean vessels.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   If we have an unclean container, we cannot take the food from it.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   We don't like it.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   If you look at an unclean person, we know that the person has a problem.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   But as I told you, as I challenged you, how is your heart?
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   How clean is your heart?
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   You need to ask today.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   And you need to receive the cleanness only coming from the blood of Jesus Christ,
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   which is our hope.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   Let's pray.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   Let's pray.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   Our Father God, you made us after your image,
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   holy and righteous.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   Fearfully, wonderfully, you made us.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   But Lord, we have lived in this world, and we were stained.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   We got all kinds of uncleanness, and we didn't know that it was a sin.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   We desired it. We accepted it. We received it. We welcomed it.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   So our hearts became so defiled.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   But today, Jesus, Holy Spirit, come upon your people.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   Remove all the uncleanness coming from the Satan.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   Let us understand that all these evil desires are not from us.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   They are not ours, but they are from the Satan.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   So give us the right understanding.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   At the same time, Holy Spirit, be our God in our hearts.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   Give us the desire to love you more, more than anything else on this earth,
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   that we can love you with our clean hearts,
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   and make us clean and healthy in our body and spirit when we love you, Lord,
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   when we pursue you.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
