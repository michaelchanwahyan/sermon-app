1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
 - Well, thanks, Kelly, and make sure you join our family gathering, the GAA, the General

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,800
 Assembly.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:13,600
 We have so many wonderful updates and so many news for you, and not only for staff, for

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:20,240
 myself, and for our ministry as well, and for our possible expansion of our church,

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,040
 and what's the next step for us, right?

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:27,520
 The church has to go forward all the time, and so has your spiritual life, so has your

7
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,000
 Christian life.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,080
 You need to think about what's next for you guys, and that's why we want to focus on this

9
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,080
 series.

10
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:43,040
 And by the way, some update is that my plan in the next few months is to take some of

11
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,040
 you out for lunch or dinner.

12
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,720
 How does that sound?

13
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,720
 Pretty good, right?

14
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,720
 I'll pay for it.

15
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,720
 I'll pay for it.

16
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:56,880
 Yeah, and I want to spend more time to have fellowship together.

17
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:03,040
 I mean, I don't want us to feel like we are separated and isolated, so don't be surprised

18
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:08,320
 if I ask you out for dinner or for lunch, okay?

19
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,800
 There's nothing wrong with you, okay?

20
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,460
 So don't have the misconception that, okay, a pastor is going to have a meal with you

21
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,960
 and there must be something wrong with me, right?

22
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,400
 No, it doesn't work that way.

23
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,360
 Maybe there's something wrong with me, not you, okay?

24
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:28,760
 So that's part of my initiative to do some pastoral care among us.

25
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,960
 And thanks, Kelly, for reminding us.

26
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:38,080
 We still will have the afternoon Bible study, and today we're not going to have it, but

27
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:44,880
 every single second and fourth Sunday of the month, and we still want to continue with

28
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,160
 that until there are some other changes.

29
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:53,520
 But I always value the time to do Bible study with sisters and brothers.

30
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:00,520
 Remember last time, I was in the English group, and there were many, many good questions asked,

31
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:07,000
 even though we moved so slow in terms of covering the passages and the verses, but that's okay.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,120
 We need to study together, and whenever I gather with the people of God to study the

33
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:18,200
 Word of God, I always learn something new, you know?

34
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,880
 I always learn something new.

35
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,720
 I always learn something that is not from the books, that is not from my preparation,

36
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,520
 but from our conversation, we can get to know God and His Word better, okay?

37
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:36,880
 So this series will continue with what Christ thinks of us, thinks of our church.

38
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:41,660
 What does Jesus Christ, the head of the church, think of you and me?

39
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:49,200
 So we study the seven letters to the seven churches, and we start with the first one,

40
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,440
 Ephesus, and then we move on to the second letter to Smyrna, and then the third one to

41
00:02:54,440 --> 00:03:00,040
 Pergamon, and then via Tyre, and now we come to the fifth letter, which is a short letter

42
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,020
 to the church in Sardis.

43
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:08,400
 And because this is a short letter, and why don't we read together, read the entire letter

44
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,880
 first and see what is going on here, what does Jesus have to say to His church back

45
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:17,640
 then and to our church today, all right?

46
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,880
 So chapter two, or chapter three, sorry.

47
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:26,020
 To the angel of the church in Sardis write, "These are the words of Him who holds the

48
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:29,760
 seven spirits of God and the seven stars.

49
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,280
 I know your deeds.

50
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,040
 You have a reputation of being alive, but you are dead.

51
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:42,360
 Wake up, strengthen what remains, and it's about to die, for I have not found your deeds

52
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,360
 complete in the sight of my God.

53
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,680
 Remember therefore what you have received and heard.

54
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:56,960
 Obey it and repent, for if you do not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will

55
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:01,760
 not know at what time I will come to you."

56
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:08,840
 Verse four, "Yet you have a few people in Sardis who have not soiled their clothes.

57
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,520
 They will walk with me dressed in white, for they are worthy.

58
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:18,240
 He who overcomes will, like them, be dressed in white.

59
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:26,040
 I will never blow out his name from the book of life, but will acknowledge his name before

60
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,800
 my Father and His angels.

61
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,320
 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches."

62
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,000
 Remember, it's churches.

63
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,720
 It's not just for the church back then in Sardis, but for all of us, for every single

64
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,680
 one of us, if we call ourselves as Christians.

65
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,680
 Alright?

66
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:52,640
 Now, one of the themes of this letter, only six verses long, I don't know if you pick

67
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:57,400
 it up, the key word, always repeat, you know, in the six verses.

68
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,080
 It's name.

69
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,600
 Reputation.

70
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,360
 Has to do with the name.

71
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:10,240
 Now, as you know, name in the biblical culture is more than just a label, right?

72
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,000
 It's more than just a label to call you, right?

73
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,760
 Or name on your name tag, right?

74
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:20,560
 Name in the biblical culture has always to do with reputation.

75
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,440
 What are you famous for?

76
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,240
 What are you known for?

77
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,440
 What do other people see you and what is your reputation in the community or in the world?

78
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,740
 That is what the name is all about.

79
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:37,760
 And in this short letter, the name repeats again and again.

80
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,840
 And there are two main points I want to cover today.

81
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:50,720
 Is that Christ, number one, cares not your earthly name, your earthly reputation.

82
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,600
 Jesus doesn't really care.

83
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:59,360
 Cares not so much about your earthly reputation, all right?

84
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,960
 As we talk about these letters, we understand we have to understand the letters or read

85
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,200
 the letters in terms of their own context, right?

86
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:16,280
 Sardis, the churches in Sardis or the small community house churches in Sardis, Christ

87
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,360
 is going to remind them in their own context.

88
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:27,600
 And we know Sardis, of course now it's a modern city, but back then it was a very famous

89
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,800
 city.

90
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:35,560
 And it was one of the richest and wealthiest capital city of the ancient kingdom called

91
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,520
 Lydian kingdom.

92
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,040
 And it's in today's western Turkey.

93
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:48,280
 As you can tell from this verses, Christ is writing a letter to Sardis.

94
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:53,360
 And he introduces himself pretty much similar to how he introduced himself in the first

95
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,640
 letter to Ephesus.

96
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:00,240
 He's holding seven stars and he's holding seven spirits.

97
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,600
 And he has everything under his control.

98
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:08,320
 And the letter format goes, he knows something about the church.

99
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,800
 He said, I know your deeds and you have the name of being alive.

100
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,440
 Your reputation of being alive.

101
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:21,760
 Now if you're living in Sardis back then in the first century, you know that you are

102
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:26,280
 living in the one of the most famous cities in the world.

103
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:34,560
 You know, Sardis was known for gold and silver because they have gold mine and silver mine.

104
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:40,560
 As I prepared, I remember when I was younger, I used to play a lot of video games.

105
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,280
 I don't know if you play the game called age of empire.

106
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,280
 Ring any bell?

107
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,280
 No?

108
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,280
 Nobody like video games?

109
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,280
 What's your childhood like?

110
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:57,320
 No, age of empire is a strategy game and you start with some of the people of your own

111
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:03,200
 and then you go out to different places to explore and you have to find resources of

112
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,200
 the land.

113
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,760
 And then build up your kingdom and build up your army and then you're going to beat up

114
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,360
 somebody, right?

115
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,440
 Beat up some of the neighbors and then you're going to conquer them.

116
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,560
 That is age of empire.

117
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:22,800
 What you need in that kind of strategy game, okay, is to find all the resources, natural

118
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,240
 resources like gold mine and silver mine.

119
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:33,600
 And you have to gather the resources and you know, gathering back to your collection center

120
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:37,360
 and then you're going to build up your people, build up your buildings and build up your

121
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,320
 kingdom and then you could, you will be stronger.

122
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:49,640
 Now, Sardis was one of the cities in the ancient world that is close to a big gold mine.

123
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:55,360
 That's why Sardis was one of the wealthiest kingdom, wealthiest city state in the ancient

124
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,120
 world.

125
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,600
 They have the reputation and they are famous.

126
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:07,400
 But Jesus writing to them, yes you guys are rich in terms of your earthly resources.

127
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,400
 You have the reputation, famous for being a city of gold.

128
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:17,440
 But Jesus said, no, you are dead.

129
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,080
 That's pretty interesting, right?

130
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:25,080
 Because in Greek, in the original language, there were only two words.

131
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,080
 You guys are dead.

132
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,080
 You are dead.

133
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:34,480
 They are most famous for their gold mine.

134
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,480
 As you can see, the archeologist is thinking up so much.

135
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:46,080
 There's a river nearby that you can just collect the soil from the riverbed and then you can

136
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:54,480
 sift it and then you will see some of the clumps of gold pebbles.

137
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,720
 And then you're going to put it in the crucible and then you're going to refine it, right?

138
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,560
 And then you're going to get some gold out of it.

139
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:07,920
 As you can see in this center picture, right in the center, they have some samples in test

140
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,920
 tube.

141
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:14,400
 Some of the soil from the river, you can see it's kind of shiny, right?

142
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,960
 So Sardis is being known for this.

143
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,880
 Because the nearby river is a gold bearing sand.

144
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:26,600
 And all these pieces of jewelry of gold and silver are what they are famous for.

145
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:31,760
 I remember I first moved to the United States in 1990, right?

146
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,760
 1990.

147
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,920
 Oh boy, it's 30 years ago, right?

148
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,640
 30 some years ago.

149
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,640
 I live in Sacramento.

150
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,640
 Sacramento.

151
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,200
 It's in Northern California, Central Valley.

152
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:51,200
 It's pretty close to San Francisco, the Bay Area, right?

153
00:10:51,200 --> 00:11:01,880
 So as you know, in the mid, 100 years ago, some 100 years ago, San Francisco and Sacramento,

154
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:06,960
 Auburn, all those towns were blooming cities, right?

155
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:12,400
 Because there were so many people coming to the Bay Area, coming to San Francisco and

156
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,160
 Sacramento area for the gold rush, right?

157
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,800
 Yeah, 49ers, right?

158
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,000
 It's the gold rush, right?

159
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:28,320
 That's why San Francisco is still called (speaks in foreign language)

160
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,080
 Because they have gold, right?

161
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:37,280
 And there were so many Chinese immigrants, actually, coming to the area and they want

162
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,480
 to get some gold, right?

163
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:46,720
 To be rich and/or to work for gold mine and industries.

164
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,680
 But today, if you go to those small towns of, you know, it used to be the gold rush

165
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,840
 towns, they are almost like ghost towns, right?

166
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,200
 Because all the gold is gone, right?

167
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,400
 All the gold and silver are gone, right?

168
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:09,120
 And they were famous for their resources, but not anymore.

169
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,400
 It is the same way in Sardis.

170
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:19,920
 Yes, you have reputation, Jesus said, of being alive, but now you are dead, right?

171
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:27,000
 So Jesus is not talking about financial resources or the physical resources that they have.

172
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,720
 He's talking about the people in Sardis, especially Christian people in Sardis.

173
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:40,120
 Yes, you were known for being wealthiest, but in my eyes, you are dead.

174
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:50,520
 Jesus always focuses on your spiritual status, not your paycheck, not your bank account.

175
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:58,680
 Yes, those are important if you are a good and faithful servant, managing God's resources.

176
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:03,760
 God demands us to be good stewards of your financial resources.

177
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:11,200
 That's why as Christian people, as followers of Christ, we need to have the habit of giving,

178
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,200
 right?

179
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,200
 Living in generosity.

180
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,440
 Generosity, right?

181
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:23,680
 When I say generosity, often we think, okay, those are for the billionaires, right?

182
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,000
 They can practice generosity.

183
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,040
 We cannot be generous because, geez, we just don't have much money in our pocket.

184
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,600
 Wait, seriously?

185
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,600
 No.

186
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,960
 Jesus was the most generous person in the world, right?

187
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:42,720
 Yet he was not rich in the worldly eyes, all right?

188
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:49,360
 So Jesus' followers have to practice that as well, to give and to be generous, all right?

189
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,840
 To give and to be generous.

190
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:58,200
 To the church in Sardis, Jesus says, "You guys are dead."

191
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,400
 All right?

192
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,520
 You guys are dead.

193
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:05,160
 And then he issued a series of five commands.

194
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,640
 It's like a shotgun, you know?

195
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,400
 Boom boom boom, rapid fire.

196
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,760
 Number one, wake up.

197
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,440
 Wake up.

198
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,040
 Strengthen what remains, the little bit remains in you.

199
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,240
 You have to strengthen it.

200
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,560
 It's about to die.

201
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,640
 That means your spiritual life is about to die.

202
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,040
 You're going to lose your salvation.

203
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,440
 You're going to lose your place in God, all right?

204
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:35,080
 So wake up and strengthen what remains, what still remains in you, and it's about to die.

205
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:39,800
 Because Jesus said, "I have not found any of your deeds complete in my sight."

206
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,360
 Number three, remember.

207
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:47,400
 See, this is similar to the first letter to Ephesus.

208
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,480
 You got to remember.

209
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,400
 Remember what you have received.

210
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:56,040
 The gospel, the grace of God, the blessing of God.

211
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,040
 And what you have heard.

212
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,400
 You got to remember all those things to rewind them, right?

213
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:07,000
 Go back to how many years ago or how many months ago you received Jesus Christ and he

214
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,840
 has led your life to this point.

215
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,960
 And we source you and give you all this blessing and provision.

216
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,080
 You got to remember those things, right?

217
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,840
 Remember the early days you were not willing to go to church.

218
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:25,240
 Maybe somebody, you know, invite you or push you around, you know, and you know, insist

219
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,240
 that you come to church.

220
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,440
 And you heard the gospel the very first time, right?

221
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:35,160
 The very first time you impact and you are touched by the love of God.

222
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:39,340
 You see the cross no longer different, right?

223
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,760
 Remember those days.

224
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,800
 Remember what you have received, the love of God, the grace of God.

225
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,160
 And then obey it, number four.

226
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,160
 Obey it.

227
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,700
 Be obedient.

228
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:52,240
 And then repent.

229
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:58,280
 Remember Jesus said if you do not repent, if you do not wake up, I will come to you

230
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,280
 as a thief.

231
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,080
 He is talking about second coming.

232
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:09,000
 In the fifth pages of the gospel, Jesus says I will come anytime to you.

233
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,960
 You know, I think this is a very, very simple truth, right?

234
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:19,100
 Either Jesus comes anytime or you go to see Jesus anytime, right?

235
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:23,320
 We will see Jesus and it will be a sudden moment.

236
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:31,660
 It's not going to, you're not going to plan like when you're going to see Jesus exactly.

237
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,660
 You can't.

238
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,040
 That's a picture of second coming.

239
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:40,480
 Five commands as I said is a series of rapid fire.

240
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,640
 It's to trying to shake you up, it's to wake you up.

241
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,080
 Don't we all need to be waken up?

242
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:52,920
 You know, sometimes Christians, I think we are pretending to sleep.

243
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,280
 Pretending you know, nothing's going on, you know.

244
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,280
 Follow the motion.

245
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:04,360
 You know, I can ignore God one week after another week, one day after another day.

246
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:10,720
 You know, this is really sad because you know, you heard of it.

247
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,840
 You cannot wake someone pretending to sleep.

248
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:19,440
 You know, it is pretend that we don't need, we don't have, we don't have the voice of

249
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,440
 God.

250
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:25,040
 You know, and actually the voice of the Holy Spirit keeps on reminding us every single

251
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,160
 day, every night.

252
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,200
 Holy Spirit is knocking on our door.

253
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,160
 Are you pretending to sleep?

254
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:40,040
 Are you pretending that Jesus is not speaking to you?

255
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,520
 Perhaps you have been faithful Christian for a long time.

256
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,520
 But that was history, right?

257
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,040
 Now I want to tell you, I remind myself all the time, right?

258
00:17:52,040 --> 00:18:00,000
 I have many, you know, if you check my resume, I have some experiences, right?

259
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 I have some histories of serving God, you know, being faithful, right?

260
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,600
 Yeah, I think I did something according to the will of God.

261
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:18,120
 However, I always remind myself, so what, right?

262
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,360
 Those are histories.

263
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:29,400
 As glorious as they sound, those are in the past.

264
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:34,280
 It's bygone.

265
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:40,320
 What matters most is right now, whether you are dead or not, whether you are alive or

266
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,400
 dead, right?

267
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:49,480
 Perhaps you had a good reputation before in the church or in your career or in your

268
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,480
 workplace.

269
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,880
 You know, you were a good witness or you did something for Jesus.

270
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,760
 But what matters most is not in the past.

271
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:02,800
 It's whether you are having a good life, a spiritual life.

272
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:11,360
 Whether you in the eyes of God are alive or you are dead, right?

273
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:17,120
 Especially some of the churches, ancient churches or old churches, if you walk around the city

274
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:23,480
 or you go to different places in Europe or in many different towns and cities, you see

275
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:30,400
 huge ancient, beautiful, you know, Gothic buildings, right?

276
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,200
 Church buildings.

277
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:36,360
 And those were the glorious days for those churches.

278
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:41,640
 But you walk into those churches, there was no vitality there.

279
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:45,640
 There's no spirit there.

280
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:56,680
 And the people of those old churches, they are simply holding on to the property, the

281
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,160
 deeds.

282
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:04,000
 But Jesus said, "You are indeed there."

283
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:13,720
 Last week, some of the brothers and sisters, we have this little expansion committee and

284
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,640
 we're talking about the long-term future for our church, right?

285
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:22,040
 So we've been renting this place for the last eight years.

286
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:28,680
 I still remember day one I was here, we got almost nothing here, right?

287
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:33,400
 And then in the core team, in the last couple of core teams, we were talking about, "Okay,

288
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:39,800
 maybe we should look forward to a number of years from now.

289
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,200
 What can we do?

290
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,560
 How can we expand and develop our ministry and build up our church, right?"

291
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,200
 And I hope this is not just my question.

292
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:53,400
 It's not just a question for the core team leaders, but it's the question for all of

293
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,400
 us.

294
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,480
 It's the concern for all of us.

295
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,480
 How can we expand?

296
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:03,760
 So last week, out of curiosity, someone texted me and, "Hey, would you like to see one of

297
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:10,120
 those old church properties on sale?

298
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,560
 Are you going to check it out?"

299
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,760
 And I said, "Yeah, let's go."

300
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:18,040
 Because it's close by my home and why not?

301
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:22,760
 I just being curious what's out there in the market, right?

302
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:27,000
 So I went and with other brothers and sisters, Jinfang was there.

303
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,160
 And we went in there and there was no more people in there.

304
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,080
 No more people in there.

305
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,040
 The roof is leaking water and all those things.

306
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,580
 And very, very old churches, but look outside.

307
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,020
 Look from the outside.

308
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:46,120
 It was intact and pretty nice for the old days.

309
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,120
 For the old days.

310
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:52,480
 We have a steeple and pretty beautiful facade.

311
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,040
 And how does Jesus see the church?

312
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,040
 How does God see the church?

313
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,040
 Right?

314
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,840
 It's not a church building.

315
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:07,680
 No, by the way, I want to remind you, whenever the New Testament uses the word church, it's

316
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:11,280
 not talking about buildings.

317
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,320
 It's not talking about physical building.

318
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,280
 Church is a community.

319
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,040
 It's a people.

320
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,280
 It's living people.

321
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:26,760
 That is church, right?

322
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,520
 Community of Christians who are faithfully following Christ.

323
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:34,560
 How does God sees the church?

324
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:41,760
 As I said, Christ doesn't really care about your earthly, our earthly reputation.

325
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,640
 What does God cares about?

326
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:49,960
 Christ cares about your heart.

327
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,200
 Your spiritual status.

328
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,160
 Your relationship with God himself.

329
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,680
 So that's point number one.

330
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:02,360
 Christ, number one is Christ cares not your earthly name.

331
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,440
 So often we care so much about our earthly reputation.

332
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,440
 We want to collect gold.

333
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,560
 We want to collect all the resources.

334
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,400
 We don't go to church because we have to go to work.

335
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,320
 We have to earn some more money.

336
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,320
 All the inflation.

337
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,360
 You know how much, you know how expensive the eggs are?

338
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,860
 It's so expensive.

339
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:23,320
 My wife told me, "You don't eat eggs anymore in the morning."

340
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,040
 Because I usually eat two eggs.

341
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,160
 I fry two eggs in the morning.

342
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:33,600
 Back then it was 150, 160 a dozen.

343
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,280
 I ate two eggs every morning.

344
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,280
 That's all I eat.

345
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,560
 I need some protein.

346
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,960
 But last week she told me, "You don't eat any eggs.

347
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,960
 Leave it to your daughter."

348
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,960
 I don't eat any eggs anymore.

349
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,200
 You know, there's financial challenges.

350
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,440
 There's stress in our lives.

351
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,320
 But sometimes we just care so much about our reputation.

352
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:01,600
 You know, we want to collect all these golds and all these resources so that we can build

353
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,600
 up our own life.

354
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,080
 You know, that's what we care about.

355
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,360
 That's what we're concerned about.

356
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,360
 No.

357
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,960
 Jesus said, "Yes, you have to be a faithful steward.

358
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,280
 Yes, you have to manage the resources God has given to you.

359
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,280
 Yes."

360
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:20,640
 But Jesus cares so much more about your heart, about your life.

361
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,200
 Alright?

362
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,280
 The Holy Spirit is knocking on your door today.

363
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,320
 And Jesus is writing to you today.

364
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,680
 Where are you at this point?

365
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,400
 See how you worship me.

366
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,120
 See how you follow me.

367
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,760
 See how you pray to me.

368
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,200
 That's what Jesus cares about.

369
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,600
 Christ cares about your heart right now.

370
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,880
 Not in the past.

371
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,880
 Right now.

372
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,880
 Verse 4.

373
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:53,080
 "Yet you have a few people in Sardis who have not soiled their clothes.

374
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:59,000
 They will walk with me, dressed in white, for they are worthy.

375
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,200
 He who overcomes will, like them, be dressed in white.

376
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:07,040
 I will never blow out his name from the book of life, but will acknowledge his name, his

377
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,440
 reputation before my Father and his angels.

378
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,080
 He who has ears, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches."

379
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,080
 Right?

380
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,480
 Take note how Jesus look at the church.

381
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:22,200
 Jesus delighted to see only a few people.

382
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,560
 Only a few people in Sardis, in the churches of Sardis.

383
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:29,840
 And those few people have been faithful to him.

384
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,840
 Right?

385
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,720
 Have been faithful to him.

386
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:38,240
 Yes, God sees and God values and concerns about the faithful.

387
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:43,520
 Even though they are small in number, you have a few people I see.

388
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,520
 Right?

389
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:51,120
 God sees a few of them because they are dressed in white garments.

390
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:57,400
 In the book of Revelation, in the entire book, white garments and clean garments show up

391
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:02,920
 many many times and symbolize the positive things in our spiritual life.

392
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:10,160
 Purity, holiness, dedication, victory, and glory.

393
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:16,160
 Those are the people, the saints, who follow Christ faithfully no matter what.

394
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,800
 Right?

395
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:25,840
 There are some of the ways we should revitalize our spiritual relationship with God.

396
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,840
 Right?

397
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:34,680
 At this point I want to close in some time of reflection for all of us.

398
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,680
 Alright?

399
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:44,440
 And we want to do so, you know, quietly and to pray to God.

400
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:49,280
 And let me suggest to you, how do we revitalize our spiritual life?

401
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,520
 Remember what Jesus cares about.

402
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,200
 It's your heart.

403
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,280
 It's your heart.

404
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:59,000
 How do we revitalize our spiritual life?

405
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:10,360
 Number one, number one, God's grace, remember, God's grace and God's love is always there.

406
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:16,000
 Even we are not faithful at times.

407
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,880
 But his love never changes.

408
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:24,240
 Now we read through this letter and we find there are so many words of warning.

409
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:29,400
 We often take warning as punishment.

410
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,360
 Harsh and unkind words.

411
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,760
 Right?

412
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:42,760
 But the spiritual warning we find in the Bible, it is there because of God's love for us.

413
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:50,120
 It's not because God yearns to punish us, to yell at us.

414
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:57,040
 God out of his love, out of his grace, try to say those words of warning for all of us.

415
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:01,400
 He wants our names to be on the book of life.

416
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:05,720
 He wants our names to be remembered eternally.

417
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,760
 And that's why God wants us.

418
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:13,160
 So how do we go back to God and how do we revitalize our spirit?

419
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,160
 You know?

420
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:22,200
 So first, number one is don't you forget the grace of God, the love of Jesus, they are

421
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:30,000
 constant even though we may be faithless at times.

422
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,640
 And second is to repent.

423
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,640
 Is to repent.

424
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,600
 Repentance in the Bible is turned around 180 degree.

425
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:47,520
 Yes, I say to God, you know, "Sorry Jesus, help me return back to you."

426
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,520
 Right?

427
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,000
 So I have this prayer here.

428
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,440
 I have this prayer here.

429
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,880
 "Heavenly Father, thank you for everything you do for me.

430
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:01,880
 I come before you to repent of my sins."

431
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,520
 And what are those?

432
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,960
 The dotted lines.

433
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,040
 You can see.

434
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,040
 You can fill it in.

435
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,040
 You know.

436
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,040
 You know.

437
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,040
 Right?

438
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:13,600
 And I want to turn back to you.

439
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,840
 And that's our prayer today.

440
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,520
 Why don't we do that at this time?

441
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:22,040
 Reflect on the love of God and we turn, repent.

442
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,040
 Alright?

443
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:32,920
 Let's spend a minute or so and this is time before you, before the loving Christ.

444
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:39,920
 Amen.

445
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:46,920
 Amen.

446
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:53,920
 Amen.

447
00:29:53,920 --> 00:30:08,920
 Amen.

448
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:23,200
 Let's all pray this prayer together.

449
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:28,040
 "Heavenly Father, thank you for everything you do for me.

450
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:31,840
 I come before you to repent of my sins.

451
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:38,880
 Please help me turn away from my sins and turn toward you, Lord.

452
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:47,160
 I pray you would help me follow you faithfully and give me the strength and grace today.

453
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:50,160
 In Jesus' name I pray.

454
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,080
 Amen."

455
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:56,920
 With the love of God and grace of God, we are being sent out, okay, to follow Christ

456
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,920
 faithfully.

457
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:01,880
 So that's why I picked this verse of the month, okay?

458
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,480
 We did this for the first of the week.

459
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:09,120
 And I feel like maybe we're going so fast, too fast.

460
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,960
 First of the month, so in the next month, October, we're going to repeat that again

461
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,920
 and again, alright?

462
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,480
 And don't you understand this is not words of punishment.

463
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:22,760
 It's the words of loving promises from God.

464
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:30,120
 Here 1 John 1, 9 says, "If you confess, if we confess our sins, He, God, is faithful

465
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:39,400
 and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness."

466
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,280
 Remember this, the grace of God, alright?

467
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,280
 The forgiveness of sin.

468
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,560
 And we can start all over.

469
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:50,640
 To love Christ and follow Him faithfully, alright?

470
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:55,640
 With this word we are sent out and we have refreshment outside, right?

471
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,640
 I don't know, right?

472
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,360
 Yes, we do, right?

473
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,080
 And I want to do one thing new today.

474
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:06,400
 You know, a brother remind me when we have refreshment, sometimes we gather around our

475
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,640
 own little table, alright?

476
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,760
 May I ask you today to gather at the big table, alright?

477
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:17,960
 We're going to chat and we're going to talk about life, okay?

478
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,920
 And enjoy the food together, alright?

479
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,840
 Go to the big dining table, alright?

480
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,840
 If you can, okay?

481
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,840
 Squeeze in, alright?

482
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:31,280
 And then one o'clock we'll have the GA right here, General Assembly.

483
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,960
 And we have very important updates for you, especially financial updates, alright?

484
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,200
 Alright, God bless you.

485
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,620
 (soft music)

486
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:41,980
