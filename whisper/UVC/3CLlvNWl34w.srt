00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,000
(音樂)

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Happy Easter

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
各位 福祉快樂

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
我們可否給桌上的人

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
給他們一個High Five

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Happy Easter

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:41,000
(音樂)

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
如果你們記得在星期五

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
星期五

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
OK

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
兩三天前

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
耶穌死亡的最可怕的死亡

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
是基督的死亡

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
祂被懲罰

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
被判刑

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
祂的身體被困在黑暗的寶寶墓

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
所有的希望都失去了

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
而是 邪惡的 死亡 都獲得了勝利

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
在今天第三天

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
早上非常早

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
女性 女性的徒弟們

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
他們去到耶穌的寶寶墓

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
他們想參觀祂的身體

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
他們來到寶寶墓

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
他們發現寶寶墓已經打開

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
寶寶墓已經空了

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
耶穌已經不在了

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
別害怕 聖經說

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
祂不在了

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
祂已經從死亡中出生了

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
在這時

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
女性們記得

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
耶穌已經告訴她們

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
很久以前 重複地說

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
祂會被祭祀

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
祂會從死亡中出生

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
在第三天

38
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
記得這一點

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
女性徒弟們去告訴

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
在藏身的徒弟們

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
他們告訴他們好消息

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
耶穌出現了

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
祂的徒弟們 祂的家人

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
並且顯示了 祂已經從死亡中出生了

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
耶穌呼喚了祂的徒弟們

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
以及所有的世代的教會

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
來祈求生命的希望

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
耶穌已經擊敗了死亡

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
耶穌已經擊敗了邪惡

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
耶穌已經擊敗了一切

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
祂就是勝利

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
這就是所有的世代的信息

53
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
他們都在祈求

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
在聖誕節我們也在慶祝這個事實

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
我們也在活著這個呼喚

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
我們被神呼喚

57
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
去到外面 去告訴一個完全不同的故事

58
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
去看到一件完全不同的事

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
去看到一件完全不同的事

60
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
去看到現實 去看到我們的生活

61
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
上週 巴黎發生了大火

62
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
納德達教堂也被火燒了

63
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
這令人心痛

64
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
整個世界都在悲傷

65
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
這令人特別痛苦

66
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
因為上週 本來是聖誕節

67
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
聖誕節是在聖誕節中

68
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
聖誕節是在聖誕節中 讓整個基督教世界都記得受苦

69
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
和耶穌的痛苦

70
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
看到大火燒掉了教堂

71
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
我們都感到憂慮

72
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
失去了文明

73
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
失去了所有的文明和建築

74
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
失去了歷史

75
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
我們都看到大火和毀滅

76
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
我們都感到不朽

77
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
我們都看到大火 和毀滅了教堂

78
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
我們都感到不朽

79
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
我們都看到大火 和毀滅了教堂

80
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
我們都感到不朽

81
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
我們都看到大火 和毀滅了教堂

82
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
我們都感到不朽

83
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
我們都看到大火 和毀滅了教堂

84
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
我們都感到不朽

85
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
我們都看到大火 和毀滅了教堂

86
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
我們都感到不朽

87
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
我們都感到不朽

88
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Everything is gone and destructed. All you see is smoke and ash of destruction. But behind this is a golden cross.

89
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:27,000
This is how a good photographer can tell a totally different story, a totally different perspective to see reality.

90
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,000
High above the order, high above the ash of destruction is a powerful reminder of Christian hope.

91
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
This is the hope that we have with the empty tomb of Christ.

92
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And this is the hope we can see and experience in the midst of destruction, in the midst of ash of fire.

93
00:04:46,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Our hope is on the empty cross. Christ is not there. He died on Friday. He was buried. He was in the tomb. And His tomb is empty.

94
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Our hope is on the empty cross to raise in Christ. And please don't forward this picture and say this is a miracle.

95
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So gold has a much higher melting point than wood. This is not a miracle.

96
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
But however, this is a totally different way to see reality.

97
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Easter Sunday calls us to see reality with a different lens.

98
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Put on a different eye glasses. Put on a different lens, a spiritual lens to see life.

99
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
If life is just here and now, death and destruction have triumphed.

100
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:42,000
This is what you get. Ash of destruction, forces of evil, death and Satan.

101
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:51,000
But it shows us a higher reality, a different way, a totally alternative way to see reality.

102
00:05:51,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And that is the eternal lens. With Jesus' resurrection, the forces of evil, evil authorities, death and Satan have been defeated.

103
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:09,000
With Jesus' resurrection, new creation, the Bible says, is set in motion.

104
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:17,000
All in Christ, all people who put their trust in Christ, will share the same victory of Jesus.

105
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:24,000
1 Corinthians 15.20. It says, "But in fact, Christ has been raised from the dead.

106
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
He is the first of great harvest of those who have died in Christ.

107
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Christ's resurrection is the first fruits."

108
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
That's an interesting term. It's a farming term.

109
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It means joy and hope with the first harvest.

110
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And Jesus' resurrection is the first harvest, filled with joy and gratefulness.

111
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You know, you look around our world, it's filled with sin and suffering and death.

112
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You probably caught the news story in Sri Lanka this morning.

113
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
There was a series of bombing of Christian churches as they celebrated Easter Sunday.

114
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
More than 100 people died. Hundreds of people are wounded.

115
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
This is our world. As of destructions.

116
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
But Easter Sunday marks a totally different way to see the world.

117
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It celebrates a new beginning.

118
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The first fruits of the harvest will guarantee the rest of the field.

119
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
There will be harvest. There will be a new beginning.

120
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
So you come to Christ today. You put your trust in Him.

121
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
With the resurrection, you have new hope.

122
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And you are new. New beginning and new creation.

123
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Our church launched three years ago on Easter Sunday.

124
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
With the same conviction, same hope that we have in the raising Christ.

125
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
We launched this church and this new mission.

126
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Why we do that? Because we know the tomb of Jesus was empty.

127
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
There is hope in resurrection. There is a totally different new way to see our lives.

128
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
And because of the hope of resurrection, we have a new mission.

129
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
We are new people.

130
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:27,000
So I pray that may the resurrection of Jesus encourage us all to continue to build the church.

131
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
To plant the church. To extend the mission of God. To continue in our faith.

132
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:39,000
He said in the book of Acts 15, verse 20, "But Christ is already in death."

133
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And Christ's resurrection is the beginning of the people who have been sown.

134
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Who said the people who have been sown?

135
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It must be the church at that time. A new church.

136
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Some people are suffering. Some families have left this world.

137
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
But they are the people in the tomb. They have left the world.

138
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
What are they doing? They are in despair.

139
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Paul wrote this letter to teach them.

140
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,000
We still have despair. Because we have a desire for resurrection in Christ.

141
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Paul said a lot of things about the fact of the resurrection of Christ.

142
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:23,000
He came to this chapter and said, "The resurrection of Christ is like the fruit of the first ripening."

143
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It is a word of the agricultural field.

144
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You know, at this time, in spring, the weather in Barcelona,

145
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
This is the time of the ripening of wheat.

146
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It is the first batch of ripening. The first batch of fruit will not be produced.

147
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
As the first batch of ripening, the first ripe fruit,

148
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
There must be a lot of joy and gratitude.

149
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Because after the rainy season, there are several months of very cold rainy season.

150
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
At this time, it starts to be messy, just like Chicago.

151
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It was snowing last week.

152
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
This is the time of the first batch of ripening.

153
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
People will be full of hope and gratitude.

154
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
And what does the first ripe fruit say?

155
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It is the reason for despair.

156
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Why can there be a reason for despair?

157
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Because without the first batch of ripening, the rest of your crops will be ripened.

158
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:30,000
If there is no first batch of ripening, there is no guarantee that the rest of your crops will be ripened.

159
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Jesus Christ is the first real ripening.

160
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
The first ripe fruit.

161
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Really resurrected from death and will not die again.

162
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
He has completely won over death.

163
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Jesus's resurrection is also a guarantee that all of us who believe in Jesus and rely on Jesus to the end.

164
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
We will have eternal hope in the future.

165
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:01,000
The main purpose of the second batch of ripening is to ask us to look at the world with a completely different perspective.

166
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Look at our life.

167
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Because of the resurrection, God will show a more real existence.

168
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
This is heaven.

169
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
This is God's kingdom.

170
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
The picture you just saw is the one from the St. Martin's Cathedral in Paris last week.

171
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
People all over the world are very sad.

172
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Lost a lot of history and heritage.

173
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Of course, it doesn't matter to some people.

174
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
The most important thing is that they are rich.

175
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
They don't appreciate culture, art, or history.

176
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
But there are many reasons for the destruction of heritage.

177
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
What everyone sees is just ashes and fire.

178
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
We think it's helpless.

179
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
We think there's only some destruction.

180
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
But a good photographer,

181
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
When using a different lens to see the truth,

182
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
There is a completely new concept.

183
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
This picture is after the fire.

184
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
A photographer went to the scene and took the first picture.

185
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
A good photographer uses a different lens to see the truth.

186
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
What he sees is not what ordinary people see.

187
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
What ordinary people see is just ashes and fire.

188
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
But he saw a cross behind.

189
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
If you can understand English, I have already mentioned it.

190
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Please don't say this is a miracle.

191
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Or you will be laughed at.

192
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Because the melting temperature of gold is higher than that of wood.

193
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
So it's not hard to burn the gold cross.

194
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It's very reasonable.

195
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:41,000
But this picture shows that we can see our real life from a new perspective.

196
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
What does the resurrection ceremony do?

197
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
The empty tomb is actually to shake us.

198
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
To re-examine how we see the world.

199
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Change a superhuman eye to a superhuman lens.

200
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Change another pair of lenses to let you see God and God.

201
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
A spiritual lens.

202
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
The 15th chapter of the Gospel of John

203
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Proposes a lot of evidence of resurrection.

204
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Paul said that if there is no resurrection of the dead,

205
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
If there is no resurrection of Jesus Christ,

206
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Our life is just a closed system.

207
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
There will be no external things.

208
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It's a dead end.

209
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It's a dead end.

210
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
The last thing we will see is the end.

211
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Because the last thing we will see is the final enemy.

212
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
That is death.

213
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
He said we only have this life of hope.

214
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
But we are so poor.

215
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
This is the special thing about the Christian faith.

216
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
If you pay attention to the Christian faith,

217
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,000
The special thing is that it is built in a historical event.

218
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It's not a theory of abstract.

219
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
It's not a very solid philosophical thought.

220
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
The Bible never provides a very solid philosophical thought.

221
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
But the Bible tells us that the Christian faith

222
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Is built in a historical event.

223
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
The death of Jesus Christ on Friday.

224
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
The resurrection of Jesus Christ today

225
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Is a historical event.

226
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
This is the most unique thing.

227
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Because of the resurrection of Jesus Christ,

228
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
We can see this world clearly.

229
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It's not just a closed system.

230
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
The resurrection day forces us to realize that our life needs to be changed.

231
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
There is a higher reality.

232
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
God really exists.

233
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
He created the world.

234
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
And loves us.

235
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
He entered our world and saved us.

236
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
These sinners.

237
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Because the resurrection of Jesus Christ,

238
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Think about it.

239
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Life, human life, the last one who speaks in the final stage of salvation,

240
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Is no longer death.

241
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
It's resurrection.

242
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It's despair.

243
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
It's love.

244
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
It's God.

245
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
It's not an evil regime.

246
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
It's eternal life.

247
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
So the resurrection of Jesus Christ from death

248
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Brings a lot of changes to many people's lives.

249
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
From the first generation of believers,

250
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Those followers were greedy and afraid of death.

251
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Then they were willing to dare to come out and spread the resurrection of Jesus Christ.

252
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
All of them believed to death.

253
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Another follower,

254
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Changed 180 degrees,

255
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Is Paul.

256
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
He was originally a person who persecuted the church.

257
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Now he is willing to

258
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Because he saw the resurrection of Jesus Christ.

259
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
He understood this and he is no longer afraid of authority.

260
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Then he went to all over the world to build a church and spread the gospel.

261
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Today, in your life,

262
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You may encounter different difficulties.

263
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I want you to bring the desire of the resurrection of Jesus Christ

264
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Into your life.

265
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
God can direct you to show his own work.

266
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
You are the one who brings the resurrection of Jesus Christ into your life.

267
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
You can tell people

268
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
This world and life can be completely different.

269
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
We will pray later.

270
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:17,000
We will pray for the brothers and sisters who are in trouble.

271
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
We will pray for our friends and brothers and sisters.

272
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
We will pray for each of us.

273
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
We have a mission.

274
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
We have the desire to bring the resurrection of Jesus Christ.

275
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
We go back to our home.

276
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Go back to our life.

277
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Go back to the place where you work.

278
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
You can see the place where you don't know Jesus Christ.

279
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
You can tell people that Jesus Christ is really resurrected.

280
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
How to be resurrected?

281
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Not only a historical fact, but also an experience in your life.

282
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Your attitude is completely different.

283
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
This is your mission.

284
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
We also pray for the church.

285
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Our church says that today is the third year of the baptism.

286
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
We are still very young.

287
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
We still have a lot of needs.

288
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
We still have a lot of places to be filled.

289
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
But the desire to be resurrected pushes us forward.

290
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Let us know that what we have done is of eternal value.

291
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
We will not hate this.

292
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
We are going to pray together.

293
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Pray for those who are weak.

294
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
We know there are many friends around us.

295
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Brothers and sisters in Christ.

296
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
They are facing some struggles.

297
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
We are going to remember them.

298
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
In our prayers.

299
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
We also pray for the church.

300
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,000
This church is found on the hope and faith of Jesus' resurrection.

301
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:47,000
We want to pray for the church because we want the same hope to motivate us.

302
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,000
So that we can go back to our home, our workplaces, our neighborhood.

303
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
To witness and to testify the living hope of Jesus Christ.

304
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Let us all pray together.

305
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
我們請司見上來帶領我們祈禱。
