1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
 her today, Sam.

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,300
 (audience applauding)

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,740
 - Good morning.

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,160
 I'm honored to be here and excited to be here.

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,620
 Privileged to be with you in worship today.

6
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,820
 Thank you to the worship team for leading us.

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,900
 I really enjoyed that time of worship in the Lord.

8
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,680
 And this morning we're gonna talk about something

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,540
 that is really important for us,

10
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,840
 especially in the modern world that we live in,

11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,640
 and that is learning to love dependence,

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,480
 learning to love dependence.

13
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,400
 And that's a difficult thing for us.

14
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,680
 Dependence is not a cultural value

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,580
 that we are used to embracing.

16
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,280
 We live in a culture that really values,

17
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,340
 especially in the United States,

18
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:50,120
 really values individualism and independence,

19
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,900
 self-reliance, self-sufficiency.

20
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,080
 We all feel like that's how we should live

21
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,120
 and that's how we wanna be.

22
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:00,220
 We feel like we don't want to need anyone else.

23
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,060
 We don't want to have to rely on anyone else.

24
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:06,160
 We wanna be strong and get through things on our own.

25
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:11,160
 But the reality is that's not a biblical value.

26
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,580
 And in fact, what the Bible teaches us is the opposite.

27
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:19,440
 The Bible teaches us that we are hopelessly dependent

28
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,420
 on God and that we're also,

29
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,860
 God made us to be interdependent on one another

30
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,460
 in the church.

31
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:30,680
 And so our cultural instincts in the world around us

32
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,780
 kinda fight against that.

33
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,560
 We say, no, I don't wanna be dependent on God.

34
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,720
 I don't wanna be dependent on others.

35
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,140
 I wanna do everything on my own.

36
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:45,000
 But we have to learn to embrace the fact that we're human

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,220
 and that God made us with limitations

38
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,220
 and that we need him and that we need one another.

39
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,420
 So that's what we're gonna speak about this morning.

40
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,760
 We're gonna look at this verse in Genesis chapter two,

41
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,440
 verse seven, just one verse.

42
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,920
 And if you're not familiar with what's going on

43
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,480
 in Genesis two, this is when God is creating.

44
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,120
 And so in Genesis one, God's created the universe

45
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,560
 and everything in it.

46
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,920
 He's created the earth, he's created the animals

47
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,320
 and the plants that are on the earth.

48
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:19,240
 And in Genesis two, Genesis one is like an overview

49
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,320
 of creation, it gives all the different things God created

50
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,640
 and the days and when they were created.

51
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,200
 And then Genesis two is like zooming in on day six,

52
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,880
 which is when humans were created

53
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,920
 and giving us more detail about when we were created.

54
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,480
 And so in verse seven, it tells us, speaking about us,

55
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,720
 it says, "Then the Lord God formed the man of dust

56
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,640
 "from the ground and breathed into his nostrils

57
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,280
 "the breath of life, and the man became a living creature."

58
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,580
 That's our origin story right there.

59
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,680
 The origin story of humanity,

60
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,780
 not as glamorous as we think, right?

61
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,500
 We didn't get bitten by a radioactive spider

62
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,600
 or come from an alien planet.

63
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,400
 We got made out of dust and dirt.

64
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,840
 That's our origin story, that God formed us from dust

65
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,000
 and he literally breathed life into us.

66
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,440
 And not just life, but our soul

67
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,760
 and everything that it means to be human.

68
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,680
 We know in, earlier in Genesis 1, 26 and 27,

69
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,320
 it says that God made us in his image.

70
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,680
 And one of the things that we need to understand about God

71
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,640
 that helps us to understand ourselves is who God is.

72
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,500
 And one of the most significant aspects

73
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,180
 of Christian theology is the truth

74
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,380
 that God is completely distinct

75
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,940
 from all of the created order.

76
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,480
 God is in a class to himself.

77
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,160
 Everything else that has been created,

78
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,920
 everything that we interact with,

79
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,280
 everything in our world was created or made.

80
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,760
 The natural things were made by God.

81
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,320
 Buildings and things like that were built by humans.

82
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,280
 But everything we see and interact with

83
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,600
 was created at some point

84
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,240
 and it had a beginning point in time

85
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,560
 and it will have an end point in time, including us.

86
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,420
 But that's not true of God.

87
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,640
 God is completely different

88
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,760
 than everything in the created order.

89
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,440
 We see in Genesis that God, in the beginning,

90
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,400
 God, he already existed before the beginning of the universe.

91
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,200
 God was pre-existing, he was eternal.

92
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:33,120
 He needs nothing from no one to exist.

93
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,360
 That's who God is.

94
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,240
 And that's important to help us understand who we are.

95
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,420
 Because God made us in his image,

96
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,980
 but not the other way around.

97
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:48,240
 We are like God in some ways.

98
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,920
 God made us in his image.

99
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,480
 So God gave us a soul, this spiritual part of us

100
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,540
 that can have relationship with him.

101
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,800
 God gave us some of the things that we see in our own lives.

102
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,760
 We see the appreciation for beauty and creativity

103
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,840
 and a desire for relationship.

104
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,760
 Those are reflections of God.

105
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:10,280
 God obviously loves beauty and he's very creative.

106
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:14,760
 And he is a relational being.

107
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,480
 Even in the beginning of Genesis there,

108
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,880
 we see God as father, son, and the Holy Spirit

109
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,800
 in the act of creation.

110
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,720
 God's a relational being.

111
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,920
 And we are too.

112
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,960
 We're made in God's image.

113
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,460
 We're like God in some ways.

114
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,880
 But God is not like us in any way.

115
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,400
 And so we have to understand,

116
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,200
 when we start to think about who God is,

117
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,720
 God is completely beyond us.

118
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,340
 And we are finite creations of the infinite God.

119
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,380
 God is unlimited in every way.

120
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:47,800
 He has all knowledge, he has all power.

121
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,320
 His attributes are unlimited.

122
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:54,320
 He is not just loving, but he is perfect love.

123
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,600
 He's the definition of what love is.

124
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,940
 That's how we know love, because of God.

125
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,900
 He is just.

126
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,320
 That's how we know what justice is.

127
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,960
 Because God is the definition of perfect justice.

128
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,780
 He is holy.

129
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:12,540
 That's how we know what's right and holy in the world,

130
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,400
 because God is holy.

131
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,060
 He's the definition of those things.

132
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:20,640
 God is infinite in every part of who he is.

133
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,900
 But we're not.

134
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:28,000
 He created us as finite creations.

135
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,040
 We're a part of the created order.

136
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,760
 Now we're a very special part of the created order.

137
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:38,760
 God created us as the crowning achievement of his creation.

138
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,480
 He gave us, again, his image

139
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,760
 and things that no other part of his creation has.

140
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,360
 We have a soul, we have the ability

141
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,160
 to make moral choices for right or wrong.

142
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,520
 We have the ability to have relationship with God

143
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,840
 and relationship with one another.

144
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,960
 Those are really unique things.

145
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:00,160
 But we are not God.

146
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,160
 We are not infinite.

147
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,020
 We are finite in our capacity.

148
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:07,000
 And even in the attributes of God's character

149
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,400
 that God calls us to reflect,

150
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,800
 we reflect those things in a finite way.

151
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,280
 God's love is perfect.

152
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,020
 We love imperfectly.

153
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:17,320
 And we should seek to love like God.

154
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,940
 God calls us to that throughout scripture,

155
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:22,040
 but still, our love is imperfect, it's incomplete.

156
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,760
 God is perfectly holy.

157
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,800
 Our holiness is always flawed.

158
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,240
 We are finite.

159
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:37,200
 And a part of our finitude, the finite part of us,

160
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,120
 is that we have limitations.

161
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,600
 In verse seven there that we just read,

162
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,200
 God formed humans from the dust of the ground.

163
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,560
 How did he form us?

164
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,760
 He formed us in the way that we

165
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,080
 see one another in this room, right?

166
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,920
 God gave us spiritual bodies, physical bodies.

167
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,080
 He gave us spiritual life as well,

168
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,840
 through the universe and do different things.

169
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,000
 He gave us this physical container for us to live in.

170
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:11,560
 And that physical container has some limitations, right?

171
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,840
 One of the biggest ones is we can only

172
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,120
 be in one place at one time.

173
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,480
 As much as we would love to be in multiple places at once

174
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,840
 and feel like we could get so much more done,

175
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,240
 God gave us that limitation.

176
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,460
 We can only be in one place at a time.

177
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,240
 But there's a lot of other limitations too, right?

178
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,800
 We get tired.

179
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,120
 All of us have to sleep.

180
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,680
 We can work hard, we can hustle, we can do a lot,

181
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,960
 but then we have to rest.

182
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:42,120
 That's just a reality of having a physical body.

183
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,800
 And what I want us to see is that our limitations

184
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,320
 are actually a part of God's good design.

185
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,840
 Sometimes we fight those limitations.

186
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,140
 We say there's something wrong with me

187
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,800
 because I can't do more and I can't do

188
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,540
 all the things I wanna do and what's wrong with me?

189
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,640
 But the reality is our limitations

190
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,700
 are a part of God's good design.

191
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,560
 God gave us those limitations on purpose

192
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,780
 because we need them.

193
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,020
 And one of the biggest reasons that we need them

194
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:11,740
 is to make us depend on him.

195
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:15,180
 We're limited creations that are dependent on God.

196
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,380
 And one of the marks of God's good design in our lives

197
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,140
 is the limitations that he gave us

198
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,940
 that force us to rely on him.

199
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:26,920
 I'm gonna let you in on a secret here.

200
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,360
 Most of you probably already know this,

201
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,560
 but some of you may not.

202
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,340
 But here's the secret.

203
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,540
 It took me a long time to learn in my life.

204
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:38,540
 But the secret is that you cannot have it all in life.

205
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,940
 All right?

206
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:43,540
 And our world, most people in the world

207
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,500
 don't seem to know that or maybe they know

208
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,320
 but they just don't believe it.

209
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,620
 And they think they can have it all.

210
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,480
 And so at every stage of life,

211
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,460
 we are trying to live into that,

212
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,980
 that we can have it all.

213
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,740
 So when we're young and we're a student,

214
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,180
 we're trying to get the best grades

215
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,380
 and also do all the extracurriculars

216
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,620
 and maybe some of the sports

217
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:06,340
 and also be the best rated gamer

218
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:09,980
 and be a great child to our parents.

219
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,860
 We're trying to do it all

220
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,500
 because apparently we think we can

221
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,020
 and apparently we think we have to, right?

222
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,700
 Then we get a little bit older and we're working

223
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,140
 and we're trying to have it all in our career

224
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:24,980
 but also live this really cool life

225
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,560
 where our social media reels are full of great pictures

226
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,140
 and vacations and restaurants and beaches

227
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,380
 and we're trying to do it all.

228
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,100
 And then if we have a family,

229
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,700
 we find ourselves trying to still have it all in career

230
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:40,100
 and everything else but also be a great parent

231
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,020
 and a great spouse and we're trying to do that.

232
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:47,140
 And the reality is we can't.

233
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:50,940
 God never intended it for us to have it all.

234
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,900
 We are limited creations.

235
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,980
 And if we're gonna live in a healthy way,

236
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,740
 then we have to embrace that and say,

237
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,780
 you know what, I'm dependent on God.

238
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,260
 Think about what we see in this passage.

239
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,860
 First, we're dependent on God for our physical life,

240
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,620
 for our very breath.

241
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:11,680
 God breathe the breath of life into humanity.

242
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,820
 And we could say, well, this is just talking

243
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,260
 about the first man, the first woman,

244
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,380
 it's not talking about us.

245
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,820
 But the Psalms speak very clearly to the fact

246
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:24,660
 that God forms each one of us before we are born.

247
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:29,660
 God, it says, God knits us together with his own fingers.

248
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,280
 God is in there in the mess of your DNA

249
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,240
 and not just in the DNA.

250
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,920
 The DNA is the physical part, right?

251
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,800
 God formed you how he wanted you to be,

252
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,840
 with your face and your height

253
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,240
 and your physical characteristics and all that.

254
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,200
 But not just in that, God forms you in your emotions,

255
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,760
 in your personality, in your gifts, in your talents,

256
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,600
 in all those ways.

257
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:59,400
 God forms you just like he formed the first humans.

258
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,000
 So we're dependent on God for our physical life.

259
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,940
 We're dependent on God for our emotional life.

260
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:07,500
 We're dependent on God for our spiritual life.

261
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:12,760
 All of those things, those dreams and desires

262
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,220
 and ambitions that we have,

263
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:19,480
 ultimately, we're dependent on God for those things.

264
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,320
 James chapter four talks about this.

265
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,720
 It says, come now you who say today or tomorrow

266
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,080
 we'll go into such and such a town

267
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,960
 and spend a year there and trade and make a profit.

268
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,760
 Yet you do not know what tomorrow will bring.

269
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,760
 What is your life?

270
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,960
 For you are mist that appears for a little time

271
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,600
 and then vanishes.

272
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,280
 Instead, you ought to say if the Lord wills,

273
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,420
 we will live and do this or that.

274
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,040
 As it is, you boast in your arrogance.

275
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,760
 All such boasting is evil.

276
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,860
 What is that passage saying?

277
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,120
 It's saying, look, you don't know it,

278
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,440
 but you're dependent on God,

279
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,400
 even for your future plans and the things

280
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,460
 that you think you're gonna do next week or next year.

281
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,860
 If God doesn't sustain your life and your emotions

282
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,540
 and sustain you spiritually,

283
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,240
 you're not gonna do those things.

284
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,340
 That's what that verse is reminding us of.

285
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:11,260
 We, as human beings, we don't like dependency.

286
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,580
 We try to convince ourselves

287
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,100
 that we're not actually dependent.

288
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,680
 We love feeling like we're in control,

289
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,180
 even if it's just an illusion.

290
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,660
 We're very good in the modern world

291
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:23,700
 at building a lot of structures around us

292
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,940
 that insulate us from difficult events

293
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,500
 and maintain the illusion

294
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,260
 that we're in control of our lives.

295
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,040
 But we're really not.

296
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,980
 We're dependent on God

297
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,960
 to get us through the day physically.

298
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,100
 We're dependent on God emotionally.

299
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,460
 When we go through times, as Pastor Mark was mentioning,

300
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:44,240
 where we are grieving or we're experiencing loss

301
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,980
 or we're hurting or something unexpected happens

302
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,380
 or we have a disappointment, we lose a job,

303
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:52,780
 we have a relationship where someone is unkind to us,

304
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,260
 we go through those things,

305
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,620
 or at least when I go through those things,

306
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,460
 I'll speak for myself.

307
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,060
 Maybe it's not true for you, but it's true for me.

308
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,420
 Sometimes I go through those things

309
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,940
 and emotionally I just get really wrecked

310
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:06,120
 and I realize how close I am all the time

311
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,740
 from just really struggling emotionally

312
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,300
 and getting stuck

313
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:15,380
 and just being in a really unhealthy place.

314
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:21,000
 So if I think, oh, I'm doing great because I'm so strong,

315
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,620
 I'm lying to myself.

316
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,180
 I'm dependent on God all the time for his strength

317
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,180
 and for his comfort and for his peace

318
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:31,700
 and to sustain me emotionally and certainly spiritually

319
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,780
 for the relationship that I have with God.

320
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:37,040
 That's not gonna happen at all unless I'm depending on him.

321
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,140
 If I'm relying on myself saying, yeah, I'm a great person

322
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,500
 and I know what I'm doing

323
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:46,020
 and I'm out here doing all these things because of me,

324
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:49,220
 I'm gonna be very spiritually unhealthy.

325
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:54,580
 We have to get past our sinful desires

326
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:57,500
 and the lies of our culture that it's all about us

327
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,700
 and we need to rely on ourselves

328
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,700
 and we need to say, you know what?

329
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:04,700
 I am a limited creation and I need God in my life.

330
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,660
 I need him to keep me going.

331
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,780
 I pray this prayer pretty much every morning.

332
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:12,500
 I prayed it this morning 'cause I was tired.

333
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,920
 Just my wife and I, Jessamine is my wife's name.

334
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,740
 We have five kids.

335
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,100
 Our youngest is one

336
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,520
 and so he had trouble sleeping the last few nights.

337
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,980
 So I've missed some sleep.

338
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,420
 So I was tired when I woke up this morning

339
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,580
 and I prayed this prayer that I pray every morning

340
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,660
 before I even get out of bed.

341
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,500
 I just say, God, I need you today.

342
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,700
 I'm really dependent on you.

343
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,780
 I need you physically to get me through the day.

344
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,700
 Just give me the strength and the energy

345
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,540
 to get through this day.

346
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,220
 I need you emotionally and spiritually

347
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,520
 to give me the patience that I need

348
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,060
 to deal with situations that are gonna arise today

349
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:50,060
 or people that are gonna give me difficult interactions

350
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,580
 or whatever it is.

351
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:55,160
 I need you to get through this very day.

352
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,820
 That's a healthy place for me to be.

353
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,920
 It's a healthy way for me to start my day.

354
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,660
 Then we see in Genesis as well

355
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,580
 that we are limited creations

356
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,720
 that are interdependent on one another.

357
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,160
 Again, that's a part of God's good design.

358
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,300
 God gave us limitations

359
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,260
 that not only make us dependent on him

360
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,620
 but they make us need other people.

361
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:20,060
 And we're relational beings

362
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,820
 and God created us for community

363
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:25,820
 or another word that we could use is family

364
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,620
 with one another.

365
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:31,780
 Genesis 2, 18, just a few verses after this in chapter two.

366
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,500
 God looks at the man.

367
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,860
 This is before he makes the woman.

368
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,540
 God looks at the man and says this.

369
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:40,540
 The Lord God said, it is not good

370
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,060
 that the man should be alone.

371
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:48,620
 It's not good for us as humans

372
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,740
 to be isolated and on our own.

373
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,060
 As much as we think it's good,

374
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:55,540
 we think oh, but then I would never be disappointed

375
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:58,360
 if I didn't have anybody else that I had to trust

376
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,900
 or no one would ever hurt me

377
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,340
 if I could just isolate myself

378
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,520
 from these other people who are being mean.

379
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,300
 But God said, hey, it's not good for you to be alone.

380
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,500
 You are relational.

381
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,480
 You need other people.

382
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,740
 And in Genesis 2, 24,

383
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:17,500
 God institutes this covenant of marriage.

384
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:22,220
 He begins the first family between Adam and Eve.

385
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,420
 But he doesn't just begin the first family.

386
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,540
 He begins the first community.

387
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:30,940
 Before there was Adam, there was an individual.

388
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:33,120
 After that, there was community.

389
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,100
 There was a group.

390
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:40,220
 God made us to be in community, in family.

391
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,420
 And we need that.

392
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,940
 And we need to embrace that.

393
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:48,240
 And one of the ways we embrace that is right here.

394
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,500
 The church is a community that God gave to us

395
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,340
 for our own benefit.

396
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,360
 And it doesn't matter if you're married or single

397
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:00,200
 or young or old or even what your background is.

398
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,660
 God in the New Testament talks about that,

399
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,460
 how there's neither Greek or Jew,

400
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,100
 circumcised, uncircumcised,

401
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,500
 barbarian, Scythian, slave, free,

402
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,420
 but Christ is all and in all.

403
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,460
 That God brings us together in the church.

404
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:15,660
 It doesn't matter who we are or what our past was.

405
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,340
 And he says, you're in a family now.

406
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:21,460
 And so you can rely on each other and care for one another

407
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,560
 and depend on each other.

408
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:28,140
 And again, the human part, our sinful nature says,

409
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,020
 I don't want that, I don't wanna need other people.

410
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,380
 I don't wanna need people in my church.

411
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,380
 Sometimes we don't even wanna need our own family members.

412
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,340
 I don't wanna rely on my family.

413
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,840
 I'm not even sure I like them.

414
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,680
 But God says, you need those people.

415
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,620
 I made you that way on purpose because you need help.

416
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,240
 And if you didn't have the limitations,

417
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,800
 you wouldn't go to anyone else.

418
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,840
 You'd just try to do it all on your own.

419
00:18:53,840 --> 00:19:00,240
 That limitation is a good thing for us that God gave us

420
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,040
 so that we would rely on others.

421
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:06,800
 And I just wanna say real quickly here

422
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:12,760
 that those limitations are not necessarily sin.

423
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:17,680
 Look at the order of Genesis, what's happening here.

424
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,120
 Genesis one, the creation.

425
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,440
 Genesis two, like I said, it zooms in

426
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,640
 and gives us this kind of zoomed in view of humans

427
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,440
 and the creation of humans.

428
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,440
 Then Genesis three, what happens?

429
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,640
 Genesis three is where sin enters the world.

430
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,640
 So think about that.

431
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:39,520
 Genesis two, we're created as limited beings

432
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,800
 and there's no sin in the world yet.

433
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,920
 It means our limitations are not sin.

434
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,920
 And a lot of times we feel like,

435
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:51,880
 oh, well, I just can't do enough and be enough

436
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,800
 because I'm broken, there's something wrong with me

437
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:57,360
 and I guess I just need to try harder.

438
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,840
 I need to figure out a way to be better.

439
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,240
 And we treat our limitations like there's some type of sin

440
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,720
 or brokenness.

441
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,960
 God never said that.

442
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,920
 Now, our limitations can lead us to sin

443
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,400
 if we don't respond to them correctly.

444
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,800
 If we hit the wall of our limitations and say,

445
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,600
 you know what, I need help

446
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,680
 and so I'm gonna turn to God for help,

447
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:23,520
 that's exactly what God wants us to do.

448
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,680
 But if we hit the wall of our limitations and say,

449
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,600
 no, I'm gonna push through and I'm gonna find a way

450
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,640
 and I'm gonna do this on my own,

451
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,440
 then yeah, our limitations can lead us to sin.

452
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,680
 But our limitations are not sin.

453
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,680
 And so when we look at our life and say,

454
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,840
 I just can't do it and I can't say yes to everything

455
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,080
 and I can't keep up with it all

456
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,680
 and I can't take it all on, that's okay.

457
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,560
 That's okay.

458
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:50,240
 God didn't make you to do all those things.

459
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,040
 God made you to be able to do a limited number of things

460
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,000
 each day in a limited amount of time

461
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,520
 before you have to sleep

462
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,360
 and you can only be in one place at a time,

463
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,880
 you can't meet every need,

464
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,400
 you can't be friends with everybody,

465
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,360
 you can't do everything that you want to do.

466
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:08,640
 And that's tough for us in the modern world, right?

467
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,000
 In the past, maybe it was easier

468
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,840
 because you didn't see pictures all the time

469
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,080
 of what everybody else was doing,

470
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,920
 so you just lived in your community

471
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,640
 and you felt like, hey, I'm doing okay,

472
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,320
 I'm here in my community with my family,

473
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,640
 with my people, with my church,

474
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,520
 we're doing what God has for us.

475
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,840
 It might have been a little bit easier

476
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,320
 to kind of keep your eyes

477
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,720
 on what God was doing in your life.

478
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,960
 But in the modern world, with the internet and social media,

479
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,040
 we're constantly seeing what everybody else is doing

480
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,480
 and so we have this desire

481
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,200
 to always feel like we should be doing more,

482
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,840
 like we're not doing enough,

483
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,480
 or that we're not enough.

484
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,400
 Like, you know, I'm not good enough

485
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,800
 because I see everybody else

486
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,120
 that seems to be better than me

487
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,000
 or more talented or their life is more exciting.

488
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,440
 Those are not the things that God has told us.

489
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:59,680
 God, it's clear here that God created you

490
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,840
 to be who he wanted you to be.

491
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,440
 He intentionally gave you the talents that you have,

492
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,200
 but he intentionally gave you the limitations you have.

493
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,520
 And he wants you to be dependent on him

494
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,600
 and dependent on others in a healthy way

495
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,560
 and to not try to do it all.

496
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:20,720
 Our limitations are not sin.

497
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,240
 And I want us to see here that dependence on God

498
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,360
 is cooperation, it's not resignation.

499
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,400
 Sometimes we might be mistaken

500
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,440
 and say, okay, if I'm just gonna depend on God,

501
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,400
 that means I'm just gonna kinda resign

502
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,720
 and be like, I can't do it.

503
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,800
 And so whatever happens in life is just gonna happen

504
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:43,040
 and I'm gonna give up because I'm overwhelmed, right?

505
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,760
 But that's not what the Bible teaches us.

506
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:50,160
 It's not a posture of resignation where we just kinda quit.

507
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,640
 The New Testament's clear that we are still

508
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,280
 supposed to be actively engaged in seeking to know God

509
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,600
 and seeking to draw near to him,

510
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,600
 seeking to surrender to his truth

511
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,800
 and seeking to obey the commands of scripture

512
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,240
 and glorify God in our lives.

513
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,880
 So we're not just quitting,

514
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:13,120
 but we are cooperating with what he is doing in our life

515
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,200
 and allowing him to lead and depending on him

516
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,880
 and being honest with ourselves and saying,

517
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,600
 God, I can't make myself.

518
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:24,200
 It's one of the interesting things about this passage,

519
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,400
 Genesis 2, seven, it gives us that origin story,

520
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,560
 that moment of formation,

521
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:31,080
 but the reality is God continues to form us

522
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,200
 throughout our lives, emotionally, spiritually.

523
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,480
 And if we're a follower of Jesus,

524
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,400
 if we're someone who by grace and through faith

525
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,880
 has put our trust in Christ,

526
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,160
 then God is going to form us as a new creation

527
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,240
 into the image of Jesus.

528
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,880
 He's gonna make us look more and more like Jesus

529
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,080
 and that's an ongoing process throughout our life.

530
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,880
 And so we're supposed to be engaged in that.

531
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,360
 We're supposed to be surrendered to that.

532
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,840
 We're not supposed to just give up.

533
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,840
 Dependence is a posture of cooperation

534
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,200
 where I admit my limitations and my need

535
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,480
 and I rely on God's work in my life

536
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,240
 and I cooperate with all of my mind and my soul

537
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,200
 and my strength with what God is doing.

538
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,320
 It's not giving up.

539
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,440
 Ephesians 2, 10 says,

540
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,720
 "For we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus

541
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,200
 "for good works, which God prepared beforehand

542
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,200
 "that we should walk in them."

543
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,600
 It's a beautiful verse.

544
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:28,120
 And it tells us that God has some good stuff for us to do.

545
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,920
 But who is the focus in that entire verse?

546
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,760
 God.

547
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,640
 We're his workmanship created in Christ Jesus,

548
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,680
 which God prepared beforehand.

549
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:40,120
 It's all about what he's doing, not about what we're doing.

550
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,600
 There are good works that we're gonna do,

551
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,200
 but it's through relying on him.

552
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,960
 And that means we're actively involved, but we're dependent.

553
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:52,160
 One of the beautiful fruits of dependence

554
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,280
 is that it can give us peace.

555
00:24:55,280 --> 00:25:01,680
 As I said earlier, having limitations is not sin.

556
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,640
 And understanding that we can't do it all

557
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,280
 is actually a very peaceful place to be.

558
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,160
 When we get to that point where we say, you know what?

559
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:14,160
 I'm not gonna be able to please everybody in my life.

560
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,360
 I'm not gonna be able to commit to everything.

561
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,400
 And instead, I'm gonna depend on God and say,

562
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,200
 God, what's really important for me here?

563
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,080
 What's important for me in this job?

564
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,000
 My boss keeps saying that I need to do this

565
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,200
 and meet these standards.

566
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,760
 What do you have for me here?

567
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,560
 What am I supposed to be doing?

568
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,760
 And I'm gonna live into that.

569
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,120
 That's a much more peaceful place

570
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,400
 than just trying to please all the people around you

571
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,380
 who are constantly saying, we wish you'd do this,

572
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,080
 we wish you'd do that, we want you to be more,

573
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,280
 we want you to give more.

574
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:44,640
 It's a peaceful place when we can say, you know what?

575
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,340
 I was involved in this at work,

576
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,820
 I was involved in this other thing,

577
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:51,780
 someone asked me to volunteer over here,

578
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:54,000
 but I can't do that all.

579
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,940
 I can't do all that stuff because I'm a limited human.

580
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,240
 I'm gonna seek God about what God wants me to do,

581
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,900
 and then I'm just gonna pick one thing,

582
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:02,980
 or I'm gonna pick two things,

583
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:05,180
 or I'm gonna pick three things.

584
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:08,360
 We have different capacities at different times in our life,

585
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:12,600
 but I'm gonna match what I'm doing to my capacity,

586
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,500
 and then I'm not gonna worry about the rest.

587
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,180
 I'm gonna admit that I'm limited.

588
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:21,260
 That's a place of peace.

589
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:24,860
 And those things change in time of life.

590
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:29,220
 I remember when Justin and I got married,

591
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,780
 before we had kids, I was serving as a youth pastor,

592
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:34,420
 and we did a lot of stuff in ministry,

593
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,500
 'cause we had more time than we had kids,

594
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,700
 and when our kids were little,

595
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,420
 they just got dragged along to everything,

596
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:43,860
 and did it all with us, and we still did quite a bit,

597
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,500
 but not as much as we had been doing,

598
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,460
 and as our kids have gotten older, that's changed.

599
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,340
 It's not that we're doing less,

600
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,740
 we're actually doing more than we ever did,

601
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,180
 but it's just in different ways.

602
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,300
 We invest more in our kids,

603
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,660
 and we still invest a lot in ministry,

604
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:03,200
 but not as much as we used to,

605
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,020
 'cause I can't have it all.

606
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:08,300
 I can't be the dad that God wants me to be,

607
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:13,060
 and also be the number one preacher guy

608
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:15,180
 who's putting out stuff all the time.

609
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:17,060
 I couldn't be that guy anyway.

610
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:19,420
 I'm not talented enough to be that guy in the first place,

611
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,460
 but even if I was trying to be that guy,

612
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:24,500
 I wouldn't have enough time to be the dad

613
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,460
 that God wants me to be, and so I have to choose.

614
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,500
 I have to say, God, what is important?

615
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,820
 What do you want me to do?

616
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,900
 You want me to be a husband and a dad first,

617
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,620
 and so I'm gonna put my time there,

618
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:37,780
 and I'm gonna give the time that I can give to ministry,

619
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:40,300
 but I'm okay with the fact that there's some things

620
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,300
 I'm gonna say no to, and there's some things

621
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,540
 that other people are gonna say,

622
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,020
 you know, if you would do this,

623
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:47,540
 it would really work out great for you,

624
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,820
 and I'm gonna have to say, that's probably true,

625
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:52,020
 but I can't, I don't have enough time,

626
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,120
 because God's given me other things to do,

627
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:57,320
 and that's a part of our life.

628
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,460
 Our capacity changes.

629
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,680
 I'm older now than I used to be.

630
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,420
 I used to run a lot faster than I do, jump higher.

631
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,420
 I played sports, all that stuff.

632
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:10,300
 A few weeks ago, Zara, she's seven, she's sitting there.

633
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,640
 We were at the park about two weeks ago

634
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,220
 playing a little family baseball game on the Diamond,

635
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:18,700
 just kind of hitting the softball and running the bases,

636
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,940
 and I was playing with him and running,

637
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:24,300
 and she goes, "Dad, I've never seen you run that fast."

638
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,540
 (laughing)

639
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:30,900
 But it's true, I don't run nearly as fast as I used to,

640
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,740
 but I also don't run that much anymore,

641
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:36,340
 'cause it's a different time of life,

642
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,340
 and that's okay, that's a part of our limitations.

643
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,420
 Aging is a part of our limitations.

644
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:43,080
 And just like I said earlier,

645
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,460
 our limitations are not sin, but they can lead us to sin.

646
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:48,420
 Some people in midlife, they hit that wall of aging,

647
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,460
 and they say, "No, I'm gonna fight against it,

648
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:53,260
 "and I'm gonna go out and blow all my family's money

649
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:56,480
 "on a new car, and I'm gonna leave my marriage

650
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,380
 "and do all this."

651
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,280
 It can lead us to sin, right?

652
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:02,320
 But if we're honest with our limitations, we say,

653
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:07,020
 "Hey, I'm not as fast as I used to be."

654
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,780
 Things are different now, that's okay,

655
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:14,620
 I'm gonna rely on God, and let him equip me

656
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:17,860
 to love the people in my life in different ways.

657
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:20,180
 Maybe I can't do all the things I used to do,

658
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:22,420
 but God can make different ways for me to minister

659
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,580
 and love and care for people.

660
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:27,820
 Then we can maintain health,

661
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,580
 and that's what's really important.

662
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:32,900
 Embracing our dependence gives us a lot of peace,

663
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,940
 when we're able to say, "You know what, I can't,

664
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,340
 "and that's okay."

665
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,380
 That's where God wants me to be.

666
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:41,100
 Embracing our dependence gives us freedom,

667
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,340
 when we're able to say,

668
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:47,940
 "You know, that gap between the desire to have it all

669
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:50,900
 "that we feel and that the world tells us,

670
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:53,360
 "and then what we can actually achieve,

671
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,100
 "that gap can give us a lot of stress,

672
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,100
 "and a lot of anxiety and a lot of worry."

673
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,420
 When we realize, "Here's what I wanna do,

674
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:03,020
 "and here's what I expected that I was gonna be able to do,

675
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:05,820
 "and here's what I thought I was gonna be able to do,

676
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:09,040
 "and here's the reality of what I can achieve."

677
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,420
 As a limited person, with a certain number of hours a day

678
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,740
 that can be in one place at a time,

679
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:16,060
 this is really as far as I can get.

680
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,540
 And there's always a gap there.

681
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:20,300
 We always want more than we can get to.

682
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,660
 Every day is like that for me.

683
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,140
 I'm a very optimistic person,

684
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,020
 so I start every day thinking I'm gonna get

685
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:28,900
 like 20 things done, and usually I get three to five.

686
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:33,800
 And sometimes, if I'm not relying on the Lord,

687
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,140
 I'll get really stressed, 'cause I'm like,

688
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:37,120
 "I didn't get 20 things done, and now what am I gonna do,

689
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,940
 "and now I've got so much to do tomorrow,"

690
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:42,140
 and I get full of stress and worry and anxiety.

691
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,420
 Embracing our dependence gives us freedom

692
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,820
 when we say, "You know what?

693
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:49,820
 "I can do what God enables me to do.

694
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,540
 "I'm gonna depend on Him to make sure

695
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:54,000
 "that I'm doing the right things,

696
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,880
 "and the rest of it, I'm gonna let go of."

697
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,680
 There's a lot of freedom in that.

698
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,020
 Even our mission in the church,

699
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:04,720
 to make disciples of all nations,

700
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,820
 way bigger than anything we could ever achieve

701
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:07,820
 on our own, right?

702
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:10,440
 That is such a huge mission.

703
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,000
 We need to embrace our dependence on God and say,

704
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,680
 "God, yes, we want this.

705
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,680
 "We wanna serve you.

706
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,520
 "We love you.

707
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,640
 "We wanna be your people.

708
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,920
 "We wanna make disciples.

709
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,020
 "We wanna reach our community."

710
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,100
 But we can't.

711
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:26,980
 These obstacles are way bigger than we are.

712
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,440
 We need you to show up.

713
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,900
 We need you to be at work.

714
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,700
 And when we embrace our dependence on God,

715
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,140
 we're able to be free from the pressure

716
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:37,540
 of filling roles that were never ours to fill,

717
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,480
 trying to do things that we were never supposed to do

718
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,960
 in the first place.

719
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,820
 We can be free from the stress and worry of anxiety,

720
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,920
 of carrying burdens that we were never supposed to carry.

721
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,320
 Think about that in your life, in my life.

722
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,320
 Again, I'll speak about myself.

723
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,020
 A lot of the times when I get stressed

724
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,220
 and anxious and worried,

725
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:00,700
 it's because I'm trying to, in some way, know the future.

726
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,500
 Was I ever supposed to know the future?

727
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,340
 No.

728
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,180
 That's a human limitation.

729
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:06,060
 We do not have the ability to know the future.

730
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:08,300
 God does, but we don't.

731
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,620
 So when I try to take that on,

732
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:13,180
 I'm definitely gonna get stressed out.

733
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,540
 There's no way I can know the future.

734
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,760
 Or I try to control other people.

735
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:21,740
 Or I wanna have control over something like my health

736
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,480
 or someone else's health.

737
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:27,700
 God never intended for me to have that ability.

738
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:30,460
 And so if I'm taking that on,

739
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:34,820
 I'm just gonna stress myself out and frustrate myself.

740
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,100
 There is freedom in just saying,

741
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,500
 God, this is a you thing.

742
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,340
 This is not a me thing.

743
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,260
 I can't.

744
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:44,700
 You know, Matthew 11, 29 to 30 says this.

745
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,220
 Take my yoke upon you and learn from me,

746
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,940
 for I am gentle and lowly in heart,

747
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,560
 and you will find rest for your souls,

748
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53,280
 for my yoke is easy and my burden is light.

749
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,140
 Jesus said that.

750
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,380
 Now how could Jesus say that?

751
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:59,380
 How could he say his yoke is easy and his burden is light?

752
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,820
 'Cause this is the same Jesus that also said,

753
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,500
 if you wanna be my disciple,

754
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,660
 you have to take up a cross and follow me.

755
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,300
 This is the same Jesus that also said,

756
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,820
 in this world, you will have troubles.

757
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:14,580
 So when Jesus said his yoke was easy and his burden was light

758
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:18,260
 he wasn't saying there's not gonna be any problems,

759
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,540
 there's no adversity if you follow me,

760
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,460
 it's smooth sailing for the rest of your days.

761
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,600
 That's not what he's saying.

762
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:28,740
 What he's saying is if you follow me and you do it right,

763
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,580
 the yoke is easy and the burden is light

764
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:34,240
 because you're not carrying it, he's gonna carry it.

765
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,860
 But for that to happen in our lives,

766
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:39,420
 we have to embrace our dependence on him.

767
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:44,140
 And the last thing I wanna point us to

768
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:47,700
 is that embracing our witness is a dependence to others.

769
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,620
 In a world that so values individualism

770
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:56,200
 and hustle and self-reliance,

771
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,260
 being someone who says, you know, I can't do it all,

772
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:02,700
 I need help of other people, I have to rely on God,

773
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,680
 that in and of itself is a witness,

774
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,900
 that in and of itself is counter-cultural,

775
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,180
 that in and of itself is something

776
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,500
 that people take notice of.

777
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,300
 And they say, this person's different

778
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,860
 'cause everybody else is trying to do it all on their own

779
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:17,500
 and trying to project an image

780
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,820
 that they've got it all together.

781
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:22,060
 And so if we are willing to say, you know what,

782
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,940
 I don't have it all together,

783
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,320
 I actually need things in my life,

784
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,100
 I'm a dependent person, I'm a limited person,

785
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,560
 that's a witness to what God is doing.

786
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:36,020
 Now earlier I said that God continues to form us

787
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,340
 throughout our lives.

788
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,780
 In Jeremiah chapter 18, in the first four verses,

789
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:44,780
 there's this beautiful illustration of the potter

790
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:47,980
 that's forming the clay, right?

791
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,780
 And it talks about how the clay

792
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,940
 has to surrender to that process,

793
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:54,360
 embrace being formed by the potter.

794
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:57,560
 The clay doesn't get to say to the potter,

795
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,500
 I think this is how you should mold me.

796
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,540
 The potter is the one who is in control of that process.

797
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:07,460
 And that process of forming and shaping and removing,

798
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:09,860
 that's a painful process, right?

799
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:10,980
 Think about what happens.

800
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:14,460
 The clay gets formed, it gets shaped,

801
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:17,300
 parts of it are chopped off, removed,

802
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:20,500
 and then what happens, if you know anything about pottery,

803
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,420
 what happens next is it goes in the fire.

804
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:26,980
 And it gets heated really hot.

805
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:31,300
 And a lot of times it goes in the fire multiple times.

806
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:35,140
 But then what comes out on the other side

807
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,940
 is something that's beautiful,

808
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:40,220
 something that's valuable, something that's useful,

809
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,460
 and something that if it's really well made,

810
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:46,340
 it reflects the craftsmanship of the maker.

811
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,880
 In our house we have some really nice, fine dinnerware

812
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,840
 that my wife's grandmother got us when we got married.

813
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:57,140
 We never use it, but it's really pretty.

814
00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:00,480
 It sits in this hutch next to our dining room table.

815
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,040
 And every time I look at it, I'm always amazed

816
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,920
 because it's so beautiful.

817
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:08,240
 The craftsmanship in it is really intricate and amazing.

818
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,620
 And I'm always kind of in awe of whoever made it

819
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:14,600
 because that's, I know I could not do that.

820
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,260
 And that's what can happen in our lives.

821
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:21,640
 If we're willing to surrender to being dependent on God

822
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,640
 and our need for him and allowing him to form us

823
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,340
 and shape us and mold us,

824
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:28,560
 and even through taking us through difficult things

825
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,600
 like going in the fire, maybe even more than once,

826
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,940
 when we come out on the other side,

827
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:38,400
 there's something in us, in our life,

828
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,540
 that's valuable and useful and beautiful,

829
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:43,520
 and it's glorifying to God.

830
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,200
 And the people around us who observe it,

831
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:50,520
 they say, "Wow, that person is really different.

832
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,680
 "There's something really beautiful in their life

833
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:57,280
 "and something that testifies to someone else."

834
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,240
 That's another beautiful thing about dependence

835
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,160
 is when other people see it, they know it's not us.

836
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,800
 They don't look at us and say,

837
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,100
 "All this stuff going on in your life

838
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,780
 "is because you're so great and you're so smart

839
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:12,440
 "and you're so tough and you hustle so hard."

840
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,600
 They have to look at our life and say,

841
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,360
 "There's something else going on here

842
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:21,000
 "'cause it's not you," right?

843
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,840
 And that's what we want.

844
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,960
 We want to be in that place where we are reflecting

845
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,000
 God's work in our life, where we're dependent on him,

846
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,760
 where we're experiencing the peace and freedom

847
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,200
 that comes from that,

848
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,960
 and that's a witness to the people around us.

849
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,720
 And that only happens as we learn to embrace

850
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:42,420
 our need for God and the need for the people around us,

851
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,560
 that God created us with.

852
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,200
 We are limited creations.

853
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,760
 That's okay, God made us that way on purpose,

854
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,540
 and we need him, and he wants us to turn to him

855
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,440
 in our lives and to rely on him.

856
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,260
 Let's pray.

857
00:37:54,260 --> 00:38:00,320
 God, thank you so much for your truth

858
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,920
 and the way it speaks to us.

859
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,500
 There are times when it's tough to hear.

860
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:06,480
 We don't always want to hear that we are dependent

861
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,960
 or that we have need.

862
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,880
 We'd rather just hear that we're great

863
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,580
 and that we have it all together.

864
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:15,180
 But the reality is we do need you.

865
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:17,260
 You formed us from dust, from nothing,

866
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:22,080
 and you breathed life and vitality and a soul into us.

867
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:25,260
 But we did not make ourselves.

868
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:29,460
 You formed us, and you are still making us.

869
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:32,800
 And so God, please help us to embrace our need for you,

870
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,620
 to be honest with ourselves about our limitations

871
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:39,300
 and the fact that we can't do it all,

872
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:42,820
 to embrace the interdependence that you gave us

873
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:47,300
 in the church, the people around us that we need,

874
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,420
 to rely on you and others,

875
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:52,340
 to help us live into who you want us to be

876
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,420
 and who you've called us to be.

877
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:58,380
 God, thank you that you are loving us

878
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:01,000
 and you are at work in our lives to form us and shape us

879
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,060
 into something that's way more beautiful

880
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:06,860
 than we could imagine or we ever would have planned for.

881
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,580
 And I pray that you would continue that

882
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,600
 even this week in our lives.

883
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,200
 Give us comfort, give us peace, give us hope.

884
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:17,300
 Help us to rely on you.
