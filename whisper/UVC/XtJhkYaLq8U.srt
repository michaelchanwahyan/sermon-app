1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,160
 (audience applauding)

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,500
 - Thank you, good morning to all of you guys.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,460
 And for those who are sitting here,

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,620
 those who are watching, my name is Tommy Lee.

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,260
 It is always an honor to really be here

6
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,020
 with all of you guys.

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,500
 I graduated from business school,

8
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,620
 and then from that point, I spent about 10 years

9
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,140
 building cell towers, and that's what I thought

10
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,860
 I was gonna do all my life.

11
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:26,420
 Then from that point, I was a pastor for about three years,

12
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,060
 actually working in a Korean church.

13
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,060
 And I was there, I realized,

14
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,180
 and Pastor Mark does a great job as a pastor,

15
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,940
 I realized being called to be a pastor

16
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,540
 just wasn't something that God was calling me to do.

17
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:42,020
 I love the Lord, I wasn't called to be a pastor.

18
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,620
 And then after that, I got hired at this big Bible institute

19
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:48,040
 called Moody Bible Institute here in the city.

20
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,580
 So I worked for the president's office, Dr. Michael Easley,

21
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:53,580
 I said, "Okay, this is what you're calling me to do, Lord."

22
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,980
 And I realized, after spending about four years there

23
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:01,260
 working with the bigger ministry, it was very top-down,

24
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,220
 it probably wasn't for me as well, too.

25
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,180
 And so when Dr. Easley transitioned out,

26
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:06,900
 I transitioned out with him.

27
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,940
 So now these days, I get a chance, I realize,

28
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,740
 I fit in this thing where I could do multiple things.

29
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,620
 We started Resource Global that works

30
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,740
 with young Christian marketplace leaders

31
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,020
 in Singapore, in Malaysia, in Nairobi, in South Africa,

32
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:25,020
 and Austin, Texas, and also in Indonesia.

33
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,780
 Now I also then got hired to work with Northern Seminary,

34
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,140
 where I get a chance to partner with Pastor Mark

35
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,260
 under the Growth Center for Church and Missions,

36
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,060
 their executive director.

37
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,700
 Then I got hired by Family Foundation

38
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,860
 to run Together LA initiative over in Los Angeles,

39
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,740
 and most recently as the managing director

40
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:45,060
 of the Wheaton Center for Faith and Innovation

41
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,380
 at Wheaton College.

42
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,280
 And I realized I actually do better

43
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,260
 when I could run four different things versus one thing.

44
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,820
 And all of us are wired differently.

45
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,060
 All of us are in a journey.

46
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,700
 I think from what I heard from James last week,

47
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,220
 the speaker talked about what does it mean

48
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,200
 to give of your life, to give of your treasures,

49
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,920
 both financially as well as your time.

50
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,940
 Today, we're gonna talk about a story

51
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:13,600
 that I have loved and I've come to love,

52
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,140
 and it's the story of Gideon in Judges chapter six.

53
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,380
 I hope that you guys have not heard

54
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:23,740
 about this passage recently, and I'm repeating again,

55
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,740
 but man, I love diving in this story

56
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:31,420
 because it's a reminder of how God uses ordinary people

57
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:35,900
 like you and me to do extraordinary things.

58
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,380
 So let's dive in the story of Gideon.

59
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:42,940
 In Judges chapter six, verse one,

60
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,180
 it begins in verse one, "The people of Israel

61
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,340
 "did what was evil in the sight of the Lord."

62
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,060
 And you're gonna find in the book of Judges,

63
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,980
 that's a theme over and over again.

64
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:57,740
 The Israelites are always doing what was evil

65
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,660
 in the eyes of the Lord.

66
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,020
 They're always getting in trouble.

67
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,860
 They're always doing something that forces,

68
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,980
 no matter what God has done to them,

69
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,980
 from the days of Moses to the days of Joshua,

70
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,440
 and judge after judge, you see the same theme

71
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,780
 over and over again, that the people of Israel

72
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,420
 did what was evil in the sight of the Lord.

73
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:23,060
 "And the Lord gave them into the hand of Midian

74
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,660
 "for seven years," I'm reading out the ESV.

75
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:30,020
 "And the hand of Midian overpowered Israel.

76
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:33,620
 "And because of Midian, the people of Israel

77
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,220
 "made for themselves the dens that are in the mountains

78
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,100
 "and the caves and the strongholds."

79
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,500
 They had nowhere to turn, they just hid there.

80
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,820
 "For whenever the Israelite planted crops,"

81
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,220
 whenever it was harvest time,

82
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,900
 whenever they knew it was harvest time,

83
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,180
 "the Midianites and the Amalekites,"

84
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,340
 not just the Midianites,

85
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,060
 but they brought along the Amalekites,

86
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:57,300
 "and the people of the east will come up against them."

87
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,380
 So already they're scared, already they're hiding in caves,

88
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,060
 already they're hiding in all of these different things.

89
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,340
 Harvest time, they're invaded by the Midianites,

90
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,120
 the Amalekites, and all the people in the east.

91
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,840
 "They would encamp against them

92
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,740
 "and devour the produce of the land as far as Gaza,

93
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:19,940
 "and leave no sustenance in Israel,

94
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:23,160
 "and no sheep or ox or donkey.

95
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,500
 "For they would come up with their livestock in their tents.

96
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,740
 "They would," I love this description,

97
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,660
 "come like locusts in number,

98
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:35,380
 "both they and their camels could not be counted,

99
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:39,480
 "so that they laid waste the land as they came in.

100
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,460
 "And Israel was brought very low because of Midian,

101
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:48,460
 "and the people of Israel cried out for help to the Lord."

102
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:53,220
 In today's culture, we see a little bit of that, don't we?

103
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,900
 We see recently a lot of times the terror

104
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,860
 or the violence that's happening,

105
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:03,180
 and I am, here we go, in Russia and the Ukraine.

106
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:08,140
 You see the huge city or huge country that we see in Russia.

107
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:11,380
 You see tiny Ukraine that was once a part

108
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:15,100
 of the Soviet Union, the USSR back in the '80s.

109
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,740
 You see Russia trying to put together

110
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:22,340
 the former Soviet Union and trying to exert their power.

111
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:27,340
 They are already overrun and captured Georgia quietly.

112
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,420
 And now here, Ukraine, right before they became,

113
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,860
 they applied to be members of NATO.

114
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,340
 Here they are, and for the last month,

115
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,080
 they're bombing, they're bombarding all of these things.

116
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,080
 Take a look at this map here and there.

117
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,460
 Look at what they're trying to do.

118
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,740
 And for them, it's a show of power.

119
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,620
 And it reminds me of the Midianites.

120
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,540
 Here the Israelites are sitting there,

121
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:54,720
 hiding in their strongholds, hiding in their caves,

122
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,720
 and they are overrun by an enemy that's far larger to them.

123
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,020
 It is a show of power.

124
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,900
 We see this clearly here in Russia

125
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,780
 with these pictures here and there.

126
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,940
 It is Putin, their president,

127
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:16,740
 and that big table symbolizes how he perceives power,

128
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,500
 that there is a distance to how he sees power.

129
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,380
 And it shows that I am in charge

130
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,100
 and you have to submit to me.

131
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,380
 And when we look at this particular thing,

132
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:33,380
 God gave the Israelites into the hands of the Midianites.

133
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,640
 And why is that?

134
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:40,740
 Because God uses events in our lives to get our attention.

135
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,980
 There's sometimes in the midst of God calling us

136
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:49,200
 in our lives, we go in a misdirection, we get distracted.

137
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,740
 We start giving into our own personal agenda.

138
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:57,740
 We start doing the things we wanna do because it's my life.

139
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,740
 I've worked hard, it's my decision.

140
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,220
 No one could tell me what to do.

141
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,180
 I dictate, it's all about me.

142
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,340
 But when we become Christ followers,

143
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,100
 that rule is out the window.

144
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,860
 Our life is no longer ours.

145
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:15,300
 Our decisions are no longer ours.

146
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,860
 But we submitted to the gospel, we submitted to the cross.

147
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:22,180
 And along the way, God uses events in our life

148
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:25,180
 in order to get our attention, to bring us back to him.

149
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:29,100
 And we see this clearly when he gives them

150
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,700
 to the hands of the Midianites

151
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,140
 because they keep turning their life to the Lord.

152
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:37,220
 And sometimes in the midst of our life,

153
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:41,100
 God loves you so much.

154
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,100
 God loves and wants the best for you

155
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:49,100
 that he will use hard times and trials in your life

156
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,960
 to turn you over to him.

157
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,660
 All of us will deal with trials in our life.

158
00:07:55,660 --> 00:08:00,100
 It is not a matter of if, but rather a matter of when

159
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,740
 that God uses those trials to turn our life.

160
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:07,460
 And for the Israelites, it had gotten to the point

161
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,860
 that they were so low because of Midian

162
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:15,660
 and the people of Israel cried out for help in the Lord.

163
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,780
 When the people of Israel cried out to the Lord

164
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:21,060
 on the count of the Midianites,

165
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,020
 the Lord sent a prophet to the people of Israel.

166
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,900
 And he said to them, "Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel.

167
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,100
 "I led you up from Egypt."

168
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,940
 This is what I did from you.

169
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,100
 "I brought you out of the house of bondage.

170
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,740
 "And I delivered you from the hands of the Egyptians

171
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,960
 "and from the hands who had oppressed you

172
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:46,960
 "and drove them out before you and gave you their land.

173
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:51,000
 "And I said to you, I am the Lord, your God.

174
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,300
 "You shall not fear the gods of the Amorites

175
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,420
 "in whose land you dwell,

176
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,400
 "but you have not obeyed my voice."

177
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,760
 Here's a key one, verse 11.

178
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,840
 Pay attention to this one

179
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,640
 because I really want you to focus on this.

180
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,960
 "Now the angel of the Lord came and sat

181
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,560
 "under the terebinth at Opera,

182
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,860
 "which belonged to Joash the Abysserite,

183
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:21,640
 "while his son Gideon was beating out by impress

184
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,200
 "to hide it from the Midianites.

185
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,900
 "And the angel of the Lord appeared to him

186
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,800
 "and said to him, the Lord is with you.

187
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,720
 "Oh, mighty man of valor."

188
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,720
 If you have the NIV, it says mighty warrior.

189
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,440
 If you have a pen, if you highlight things in your Bible,

190
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,400
 you take this right away and you highlight it.

191
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,680
 And you remember this verse because when you look at this

192
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,560
 and God calls him a mighty man of valor,

193
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,680
 already you're sitting there,

194
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,780
 wait, what in the world is this?

195
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,620
 That doesn't make any sense.

196
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,520
 Why is that?

197
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,160
 Let me show you something.

198
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,600
 Pastor Mark, let me just say this.

199
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,600
 You teach this class, right?

200
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,520
 All right, mighty warrior, look at this.

201
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,680
 When the angel of the Lord, NIV says mighty warrior.

202
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,220
 Take a look at this.

203
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,640
 Pastor Mark, you teach a class on archeology.

204
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,240
 He probably knows this a lot more.

205
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,160
 I've been to Israel once in my life,

206
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,500
 but it was through that experience,

207
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,440
 I learned so much.

208
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,800
 So let me explain to you the situation

209
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,520
 that is happening, right?

210
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,760
 It is harvest time.

211
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,120
 And now when the wheat and grain

212
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,720
 and everything's ready to be harvested,

213
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,920
 you bring all of that, you use your sickle

214
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,040
 and you cut out all of the wheat

215
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:46,040
 and you bring it to what they call as a threshing floor.

216
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:50,600
 As you could see, it is out in open air.

217
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,120
 It is usually on top of a hill.

218
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,840
 It's usually in an open area,

219
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,620
 in like a little hill area where the wind can blow

220
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,240
 and you lay everything out.

221
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,420
 If you look at the picture, you see some of the oxen

222
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:08,840
 or some people will use a little hammer called flail.

223
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,460
 And you're sitting there knocking

224
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:14,700
 or you have your oxen, your horses step all over it.

225
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:18,460
 At that point in time, it separates the husk

226
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:21,860
 as well as the grain and it just separates it.

227
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,140
 Then from that point on,

228
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:26,720
 you use what they call a windowing fork.

229
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,080
 It's a big rake.

230
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,520
 And you've seen pictures of this.

231
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:33,560
 You take it and you lift it up as high as you can.

232
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,280
 It's hard work.

233
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,900
 The chaff is blown from the wind and everything like that

234
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,340
 and it blows in the air.

235
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:44,820
 The husk, which is heavier, fall in one pile.

236
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,940
 The grain falls in another pile.

237
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,660
 And so as a result, you have to understand

238
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:54,300
 the threshing floor has to be out in the open air.

239
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,760
 But where is Gideon?

240
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,840
 Gideon is in a wine press.

241
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,280
 You're wondering, so what's wrong with that?

242
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:06,140
 Let me show you a picture of what the wine press looks like.

243
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,620
 This is the wine press.

244
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,540
 I get to the Garden of Gethsemane, right?

245
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:13,540
 And it's a garden, no, it is a tomb.

246
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,740
 The tomb where Jesus is buried.

247
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:18,860
 And there right in front is this wine press.

248
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,380
 And I didn't understand what a wine press is

249
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,860
 until I saw this picture.

250
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:28,700
 And the story of Gideon made so much sense.

251
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,600
 Here's what happens in the wine press.

252
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:36,660
 Right there on the top, they lay out all of the grapes.

253
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,700
 From that point on, you see that hole

254
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,580
 that leads all the way to the bottom.

255
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:43,420
 And that path then leads to another hole,

256
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:47,060
 which there's a bunch of jars or what they called cisterns.

257
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:50,900
 Once you lay out all the grapes, it's about waist high.

258
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,780
 Mark, I hope you're gonna have to correct me

259
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,740
 and let me know if I'm wrong later on.

260
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,860
 And from that point, you lay out all the grapes

261
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,380
 and you step on it.

262
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:01,460
 I've seen pictures where there's a contraption on top

263
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,300
 and you hold onto it,

264
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,860
 and you just keep stepping on all of the grapes.

265
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:08,660
 And then eventually all of the juice flows

266
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:13,420
 from down that corridor and into what they call a cistern.

267
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:16,480
 And so what's the picture of this?

268
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,340
 It is this.

269
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:22,300
 The angel of the Lord calls him a mighty warrior.

270
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:26,900
 He is not a mighty warrior.

271
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,180
 Because when you read this passage, you're sitting there,

272
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:34,180
 Lord, are you sure you have the right picture correct?

273
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:38,460
 Do you not know where Gideon is?

274
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:43,460
 He's threshing wheat, not on the threshing floor,

275
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,700
 but in the wine press.

276
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,460
 And you know why he's in the wine press?

277
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,480
 Because he's afraid.

278
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,300
 Because he's a coward.

279
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,620
 Because he's running away from the Midianites

280
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,620
 so that no one sees him.

281
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:03,820
 Are you sure you have the right person, Lord?

282
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:07,580
 Mighty warrior?

283
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,560
 Mighty man of valor?

284
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,440
 I'm seeing a coward here.

285
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,660
 And why is that?

286
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:19,660
 God's picture of me is different than the picture

287
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:24,660
 I have of myself or that others have of me.

288
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:28,600
 God's picture of me is different than the picture

289
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,320
 that sometimes I have of myself

290
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,680
 or the picture that I have, that others have of me.

291
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,640
 Let me give you an example of what I mean by this.

292
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,940
 All of you guys have probably watched this movie, right?

293
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:42,560
 All of us are familiar, Avengers Endgame,

294
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,040
 and we're sitting there and they go meet Thor

295
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,000
 and we're expecting the God of Thunder,

296
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,640
 the one that we were familiar with all of the movies

297
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,000
 coming out and what do we see?

298
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,160
 Fat Thor playing video games.

299
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,760
 And you're sitting there, what in the world happened?

300
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,600
 Because he had given up hope.

301
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,080
 He was done.

302
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:09,840
 But something saw Thor as the adventure that he was,

303
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,440
 the hero that he was.

304
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,520
 Because deep inside, and you saw that encounter

305
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,620
 with his mother, there was a hero,

306
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,760
 despite a person who gave up hope.

307
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:26,260
 Sometimes we do feel like a fat Thor.

308
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:29,280
 Sometimes we are scared.

309
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:33,320
 Sometimes how we perceive ourselves

310
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,840
 is different than how others perceive us.

311
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,160
 Sometimes how others perceive us is different

312
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,240
 than how God perceives us.

313
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,020
 For us, we see fat Thor.

314
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:48,080
 God sees a mighty man of valor.

315
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:52,600
 God sees in Gideon, not someone who's scared,

316
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,520
 not someone who's a coward,

317
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,000
 not someone who's trying to escape.

318
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,800
 What he sees in Gideon is a mighty warrior,

319
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,640
 the one who's gonna lead his people there,

320
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:08,560
 the one who's gonna battle against him.

321
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,320
 Let's keep going on.

322
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,880
 And so he calls them, and here's the next part that I love.

323
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,680
 And the angel of the Lord appeared to him and says to him,

324
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,400
 Lord is with you, almighty man of valor.

325
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,160
 And Gideon said to him, please serve.

326
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,040
 If the Lord is with us,

327
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,240
 then why then has all of this happened to us?

328
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,000
 And where are all his wonderful deeds

329
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,800
 that our fathers recounted to us saying,

330
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,000
 did not the Lord bring us up out of Egypt?

331
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,640
 But now the Lord has forsaken us

332
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,160
 and given us into the hands of Midian.

333
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,120
 Underline this one as well too, verse 14.

334
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,440
 And the Lord turned to him and said,

335
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,480
 go in this might of yours,

336
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,480
 and Gideon, I want you to save Israel

337
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,600
 from the hand of Midian.

338
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,320
 Do not I send you.

339
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:07,120
 And he said to him, please, Lord, how can I save Israel?

340
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,120
 But behold, my clan is the weakest in man's sight.

341
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:14,360
 So out of all the clans, Lord, my clan is the weakest.

342
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:18,720
 And I am the least in my father's house.

343
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,360
 So pretty much what you're telling me, Gideon,

344
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,360
 is out of all the clans, your clan is the weakest,

345
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,600
 and you're the weakest one in your clan.

346
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,640
 That's what you're telling me, right?

347
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,360
 So you know where that makes Gideon?

348
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,440
 Dead last.

349
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,440
 He's the weakest person in the weakest clan.

350
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,280
 Not very good.

351
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,000
 And you're using him to lead the charge

352
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,600
 to battle the Midianites.

353
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,080
 Powerful statement, next thing.

354
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:56,080
 And the Lord said to him, but I will be with you.

355
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:01,020
 And you shall strike the Midianites as one man.

356
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:06,020
 And he said to him, if now I have found favor in your eyes,

357
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,360
 oh wait, and I am the least in my father's house,

358
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,680
 and the Lord said to him, but I will be with you,

359
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:17,160
 and you shall strike the Midianites as one man.

360
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,120
 So what the Lord is saying is,

361
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,960
 he comes to him and he says, okay, I am the weakest clan,

362
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,200
 and I am the weakest in the weakest clan.

363
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,920
 And you know what the Lord says to him?

364
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,280
 He doesn't disagree with him.

365
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,760
 He doesn't tell him, you know,

366
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,600
 no, you're not the weakest clan.

367
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,680
 So-and-so is weaker than you.

368
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,840
 Here's what you have.

369
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,000
 Well, your clan's not the weakest clan.

370
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,720
 Your clan's pretty good.

371
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:48,720
 No, he doesn't disagree with him.

372
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,100
 In fact, he actually kind of agrees with him.

373
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,280
 It's like you and I are saying, right?

374
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,660
 A lot of times is we talk, you guys talked last week

375
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:59,760
 about what it means to give God our time and our treasures.

376
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,480
 It's like when you and I are sitting there,

377
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,800
 Lord, I'm not sure if I could serve you

378
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,720
 because I'm not smart enough.

379
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,760
 That sometimes is our excuse.

380
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,880
 I'm not talented enough, right?

381
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,320
 I'm not as strong as that particular person.

382
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,360
 I can't be as charismatic.

383
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,840
 I'm not very good in public like that.

384
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,300
 I'm very shy.

385
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:24,480
 And it's, God is saying, I know.

386
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,720
 I'm not disagreeing with you, I know.

387
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,200
 I know you're probably not the smartest person in the room.

388
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,480
 I know probably you're not the most talented person

389
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,320
 in the room.

390
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,400
 I know so-and-so probably is better up front than you.

391
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,320
 I know you're probably shy.

392
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,400
 I know.

393
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,240
 I know all these things.

394
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,800
 You know why?

395
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,960
 Because I created you.

396
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:51,120
 And when I created you, I gave you those skills.

397
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,960
 And when I created you, I made you different.

398
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,080
 I made you unique.

399
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,640
 I know.

400
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,960
 Get in, I know you're the weakest clan.

401
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,880
 I know you're the weakest of the weakest clan.

402
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,040
 I know all these things because I put you there.

403
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,280
 Because when you were born, before you were born,

404
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:10,080
 before any of us were born, I designed you

405
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,080
 and I mapped out your life.

406
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,400
 I know exactly what you're capable of.

407
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,440
 But here's the thing, and underline this,

408
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,520
 but I will be with you.

409
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,400
 And that's the difference.

410
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,240
 I want you to do that.

411
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,320
 I know what your deficiencies are.

412
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,200
 But when I call you, I will be with you.

413
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,680
 And that becomes the key.

414
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:37,000
 It won't be easy.

415
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 It's not gonna be always very fun to obey my will.

416
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,080
 It's not always gonna be smooth sailing all the time.

417
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:52,240
 But I see you differently than how you see yourself

418
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,280
 and how others see you.

419
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,840
 I see you as a mighty man of valor, a mighty warrior.

420
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,640
 And I'm calling you to fight the Midianites.

421
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,240
 And I realize you're the weakest clan.

422
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,160
 I realize you're the weakest in your weakest clan,

423
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,840
 but I will be with you.

424
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:14,400
 And that's where all of us needs to stop and think,

425
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,080
 what does God want you to do in your life?

426
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,520
 And what is holding you back?

427
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,360
 Because all of us have insecurities.

428
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,160
 All of us have struggles.

429
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,040
 All of us have doubts.

430
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,400
 But what is God saying to us?

431
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,480
 And how do we begin to walk confidently?

432
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,160
 Knowing it may not be easy, but walk confidently

433
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,960
 because that's what God has called him.

434
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,280
 Which leads us to the next portion, all right?

435
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,120
 Next portion is this.

436
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,320
 And so later that night,

437
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:53,840
 he calls him and let's go over to verse 25.

438
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,720
 That night he prepares,

439
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,600
 and here's the, I think the most important part of it.

440
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,920
 That night the Lord said to him,

441
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,120
 "I want you Gideon to take your father's bull

442
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:07,440
 and the second bull seven years old.

443
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,200
 And I want you to pull down the altar of bow

444
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,160
 that your father has

445
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:17,280
 and cut down the Asherah pole that is beside it.

446
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:22,200
 And I want you to build an altar to the Lord your God

447
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,400
 on the top of the stronghold here."

448
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,560
 And here's what it looks like with the Asherah pole.

449
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,320
 Asherah pole.

450
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,760
 And so what God is saying to this,

451
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:36,000
 "Lord Gideon, I see you threshing wheat in the wine press.

452
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,360
 I want you to fight the Midianites.

453
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,400
 I want you to lead the charge.

454
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:44,400
 But before you do, before I send you to battle,

455
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,400
 I need you to tear down that altar.

456
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:52,000
 I need you to put the proper altar in its place.

457
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,440
 I need you to tear down that altar.

458
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,680
 I need to build a proper altar

459
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,120
 that honors the Lord in all that you do."

460
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,880
 That's what I want you to do before you go out to battle.

461
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,480
 If you were to apply it in our context today,

462
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,640
 I have a calling for you.

463
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,840
 I want you to do something.

464
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,000
 But before you do,

465
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 we're gonna have to do some business in your life.

466
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,240
 I'm gonna need you to tear down some of the altars

467
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,160
 in our life, specifically in our hearts.

468
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:26,680
 And I'm gonna need you to put the proper altar in its place.

469
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,560
 I'm gonna need you to make sure that things are right.

470
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,000
 A lot of times within the altar is within our hearts.

471
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 There is no big altar that we have

472
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,960
 that we all go to like we have with the temple.

473
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,200
 That altar is in the life.

474
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,240
 God establishes that altar in our life.

475
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,120
 And I have a plan for you.

476
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:50,440
 I need you to establish the proper altar in its place.

477
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,040
 What do I mean about that?

478
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,440
 I love the fact that God has a plan for us.

479
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:04,120
 But frankly speaking, all of us struggles with heart issues.

480
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,080
 And I probably was shared a little bit

481
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,320
 about this in the past.

482
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:12,520
 All of us have heart issues in our life.

483
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:17,360
 All of us struggle with skeletons in our closet.

484
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,400
 The majority of the group here are Chinese.

485
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,720
 I see our two Caucasian friends in here.

486
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,640
 And I find that Caucasians are very vulnerable

487
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,480
 in their life.

488
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,400
 Asians tend to be very private for the majority,

489
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,200
 especially if you're older, you're very private.

490
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,440
 You don't let people hear, you don't show vulnerability.

491
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,920
 I find our Caucasian friends are more so vulnerable.

492
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,840
 And we like things and we wanna have this appearance

493
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,680
 that we have.

494
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:47,480
 And so we live with what we call a shadow mission.

495
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:51,120
 That our shadow and how we live our life

496
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,120
 are two separate things.

497
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,200
 Our shadow reflects who we truly are.

498
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,480
 But on the outside, we try to pretend

499
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,320
 like we're someone different.

500
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,160
 We try to show people the persona or personality

501
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:09,240
 we want them to see, which is so different

502
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,440
 than what we struggle on the inside.

503
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,080
 Some of the four or five basic heart issues

504
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,840
 that some of us have.

505
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,200
 Before God could use you,

506
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:24,120
 he wants you to deal with some of these issues in your life.

507
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,920
 That some of you are sitting here right now

508
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:31,280
 and you're dealing with the issue of guilt.

509
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,600
 That there are things in your life

510
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,960
 that nobody knows that you've done.

511
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,000
 And only you know.

512
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,840
 You've hidden it pretty well from different people.

513
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:46,320
 Maybe a thought, maybe something you've done,

514
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,200
 something it is and it bothers you.

515
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,000
 God wants you to learn to deal with that guilt.

516
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,120
 He wants you to learn the power of confessing your sin.

517
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,240
 The power of allowing him to take away that guilt

518
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:05,160
 that is eating up your life all the time.

519
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,560
 For some, it's the power of anger.

520
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:13,080
 There is anger that you have because of a parent,

521
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:16,240
 a sibling, a friend, something that happened

522
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,240
 at work, you got bypassed for a job, whatever it is.

523
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,400
 You feel like you got a short end of the stick,

524
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,600
 whatever it is, you're dealing with that anger.

525
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,840
 Maybe greed.

526
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,840
 Maybe it's greed that you're dealing with.

527
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,040
 It's all about me.

528
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,760
 I need my money, I want to be successful.

529
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,600
 I want to have lots of money, I want that Tesla.

530
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,720
 I want that home, I want that, maybe it's greed.

531
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,360
 I want my crypto to grow huge.

532
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,760
 And then once I get so much money,

533
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:50,440
 God, I'll come and satisfy you because I need to work life,

534
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,400
 I need to provide for my family.

535
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,960
 It's that greed that over, and when you're sitting there

536
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,040
 listening to sermons about giving of God

537
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,880
 or your story, you're sitting there, yeah, I'll do it,

538
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,440
 but I got to make sure I take care of myself first.

539
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:08,080
 Guilt, anger, greed, maybe it's jealousy.

540
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,640
 Why does so-and-so always get the benefit of doubt?

541
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,800
 (thuds)

542
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,080
 Why does so-and-so always seem to get

543
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,680
 the great opportunities and work?

544
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,240
 Why does so-and-so get this,

545
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,400
 or why does my sibling get this and that?

546
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,400
 Maybe it's jealousy.

547
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,560
 And you're struggling with that because you're sitting there,

548
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,920
 why do I get the short end of the stick?

549
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,240
 Or maybe it's judgment.

550
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:40,240
 Judgment of how you perceive people of different color,

551
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,520
 how you perceive different people that you struggle with,

552
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,480
 judgment toward other people that you see in your family,

553
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,880
 whatever it is.

554
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,620
 Which one is it?

555
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:54,400
 All of us struggle at one point with each one of these.

556
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:58,080
 For me in my life, I've watched this destroy my family

557
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,720
 in a great deal.

558
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,880
 I have a twin brother and I have a younger sister.

559
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,880
 I see my twin brother a lot, he lives in Phoenix, Arizona

560
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:10,220
 with his three kids and Sarah, his wife.

561
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:13,440
 My younger sister is two years younger than me.

562
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,320
 I haven't seen her in 15 years.

563
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,760
 She stopped calling our home 15 years ago.

564
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:24,040
 She got into it with my mom 15 years ago.

565
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:28,080
 And that anger between her and my mom never subsided.

566
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,800
 She walked away from home, never to come back.

567
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,080
 I haven't seen her in any Christmas gatherings,

568
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,560
 any holiday gatherings.

569
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,380
 When my two daughters were born, never got a note.

570
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:40,680
 When I was sick in bed with cancer, never heard from her.

571
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,520
 Because she can't let that anger go away.

572
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,900
 Because why?

573
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,040
 My mom deals with that anger.

574
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:51,080
 My mom growing up as a hardworking Chinese immigrant

575
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:55,520
 in 1972 came from China and when she came in here,

576
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,440
 she had nothing and she had to start all over.

577
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:02,960
 And there was so much anger and resentment that she had

578
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,320
 that she never can let go of that anger.

579
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,460
 And that anger, she took it out on us as kids growing up.

580
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:13,240
 She was always hard on us.

581
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,600
 It was never enough.

582
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,960
 That A that we got, you better make it A plus.

583
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,700
 That B you got, you're grounded.

584
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:24,580
 That belt or that hanger, pick one.

585
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:26,920
 We always had to do that.

586
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,840
 The anger and my sister was never able to let it go.

587
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,700
 I deal with that anger as well too.

588
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,520
 I struggle with that anger.

589
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,560
 I could fool you people easily.

590
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,600
 I'm 44 years old.

591
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,700
 I look decently well.

592
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:47,360
 I dress nice, I have a successful career.

593
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,320
 But inwardly, I struggle with that anger.

594
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:55,100
 I grew up and we are in church here in the Bridgeport area

595
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:58,160
 where a lot of times there's a lot of diversity.

596
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,480
 I came here, I was born in '77,

597
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,840
 came to Chinatown and Bridgeport.

598
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,740
 And in my school at Robert Healy,

599
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:09,400
 I was probably one of only five Chinese kids in that school.

600
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,120
 For years, I was chased after,

601
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,800
 I remember there was some Caucasian kids

602
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,800
 that would chase us down the block all the time.

603
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,120
 They would just beat us up all the time.

604
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,520
 Everywhere I go and every street I turn,

605
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,360
 I still remember when I was in fourth grade,

606
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,280
 there was this eighth grader

607
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,600
 who just wanted to pick on us all the time.

608
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,840
 I went to one street, he found the stair.

609
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,800
 Went to another street, found the stair.

610
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,960
 It was rough when you're the only Chinese kid

611
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,380
 in the community.

612
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,160
 I still remember there was just one guy

613
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,500
 who would ride on his bike

614
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:44,900
 and just pick on all the Chinese kids in the community.

615
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,540
 I grew up a little chubby,

616
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:49,460
 I grew up not always being very smart.

617
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:52,600
 And I heard the conversations, my sister was brilliant.

618
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:56,740
 Perfect SAT, perfect ACT, perfect grades,

619
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:58,180
 straight A's, never got a B,

620
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:00,500
 went to Yale, got perfect score there.

621
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,780
 I struggled with school.

622
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:05,740
 I had to work hard for my school.

623
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:06,980
 And I always heard people say,

624
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:09,940
 "Hey, you're not as smart as your older brother.

625
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:12,820
 "You're not as smart as your younger brother."

626
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,780
 And I was made fun of at school

627
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:18,200
 because I was kind of chubby at that point in time.

628
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,580
 And that made me live with self-esteem issues,

629
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:24,660
 which eventually became anger.

630
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:27,100
 And I always lived with that anger

631
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,980
 where I wanted to prove people wrong.

632
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:32,620
 I wanted to stick it to them

633
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:35,460
 and show them and do things.

634
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,760
 As I grew in my faith,

635
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,720
 I had to come before the Lord and say,

636
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,360
 "Lord, where's my heart?

637
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:49,060
 "Lord, what do I need to do to lay it before the cross?

638
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:53,180
 "Lord, what does it mean to have my heart come before you?"

639
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:57,140
 I had to learn slowly and slowly to lay it down.

640
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:01,880
 Every day in my life, I still remember all the voices,

641
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,460
 all the people who said I couldn't do it.

642
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:06,140
 I still remember their faces.

643
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,820
 That's still there.

644
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:10,380
 But it's a choice I have to make every single day to say,

645
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:13,560
 "Lord, give me the strength to do what is right.

646
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,640
 "Allow my heart to continue to honor you

647
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,140
 "in everything I do."

648
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:22,300
 Because God wants you to tear down that altar

649
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:27,180
 and put the proper altar in its place.

650
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:31,440
 God's picture of you is different

651
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,040
 than the picture you have of yourself

652
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,940
 and that others have of you.

653
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:39,480
 God's picture of you is different.

654
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:43,760
 He sees in Gideon a mighty man of valor, a mighty warrior.

655
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,200
 What does he see in you compared to what you see in yourself?

656
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,600
 Go in the strength that you have,

657
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,440
 whatever you are,

658
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,920
 because I designed you with your strengths

659
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,560
 and your weaknesses.

660
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,260
 Go in the strength that you have,

661
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:02,580
 and I will be with you.

662
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,800
 I'm gonna be with you.

663
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,560
 May not be easy, may not go smoothly,

664
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,260
 but I'm gonna be with you.

665
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,600
 But before you do,

666
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:12,400
 put the proper altar in its place.

667
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,240
 Tear down the altar

668
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:19,560
 and put the proper altar in its place.

669
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:24,560
 God uses ordinary people to do his extraordinary work.

670
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:30,480
 God uses ordinary people to do his extraordinary work.

671
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,820
 Let's pray.

672
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:36,360
 Father, thank you for this church.

673
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,840
 Thank you for the people who are sitting here.

674
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,720
 Thank you for the people who are watching online,

675
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,920
 wherever they are in the world.

676
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:46,600
 Allow us to hear you, Father.

677
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,960
 Allow us to walk with you.

678
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,960
 Allow us to continue to understand the vision

679
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,800
 that you have for us,

680
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,840
 to listen, to hear the vision,

681
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,040
 and continue to follow you,

682
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,420
 to understand that you have a calling.

683
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:03,120
 Despite our inefficiencies, despite our baggage,

684
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,920
 you are there with us.

685
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,520
 But more so, Lord, I pray for our heart issues

686
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,720
 that with people here in this room.

687
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,400
 We pray with some of them who are struggling

688
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:16,400
 with the guilt or the anger or the jealousy or the greed,

689
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:20,400
 I pray that you would do surgery in their lives.

690
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,360
 And allow us as we wrestle with those

691
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,800
 to have the courage, the strong strength from you

692
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,800
 to follow after you.
