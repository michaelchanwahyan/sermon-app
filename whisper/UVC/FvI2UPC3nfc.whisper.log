[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   Welcome family, it's great to be with you again.
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:08.000]   Today is part two of this message that we're looking at asking and receiving in Matthew
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   chapter 7.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.920]   We're going to be in verses 7 to 11 again.
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.400]   So let's dive into this and look at what God has to say to us.
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.400]   Starting in verse 7 it says this, "Ask and it will be given to you.
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.400]   Seek and you will find.
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.120]   Knock and it will be opened to you.
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.960]   For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds.
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.240]   And to the one who knocks it will be opened.
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.720]   For which one of you, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone?
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.360]   Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent?
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.320]   If you then who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:44.140]   will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him?"
[00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.960]   You know, last week as we began to look at this passage and discuss it, we talked about
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.320]   kind of the obvious and direct reality of this passage, that Jesus is just challenging
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.240]   us to ask God, and that we don't do that enough.
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.520]   And a lot of times it's because we don't have faith.
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.400]   We're not actually confident and trusting God that he actually will be present in our
[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.160]   life, meet our needs, bring the transformation that we need or the provision that we need,
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.120]   whatever it is that we might be asking for.
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.120]   A lot of times we don't trust that God can do that.
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.840]   And so we talked about some of those obstacles to faith that we need to deal with.
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.040]   Maybe we don't believe that God is powerful enough.
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.640]   Maybe we don't believe that God is good enough.
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.200]   Or maybe we don't really believe that we're weak and we think that we can still find the
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.840]   solutions and the answers and fix our lives on our own without God.
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.440]   Whatever those things are, we need to learn to put them out of our life so that we can
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:46.320]   begin to truly trust and have faith in God and begin to ask him for the things that we
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.280]   need in our life, the big and the small things.
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.820]   And today I want us to consider, what are we supposed to ask for?
[00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.080]   Because if we're learning the lesson that we talked about last week and we're saying,
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.760]   "Okay, I want to learn to have more faith.
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.560]   I want to learn to have more confidence and trust in God.
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.280]   I want to learn to ask God.
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.880]   I want to learn to rely on him for everything."
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.120]   Then we get to the question of, "But what do I ask for?
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.560]   What's important for me to ask for?"
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.800]   And that's a really valid question for us to ask.
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.320]   James chapter 4, in the first eight verses, it says this, "What causes quarrels and what
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.980]   causes fights among you?
[00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.360]   Is it not this?
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.160]   Your passions are at war within you.
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.380]   You desire and do not have, so you murder.
[00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.400]   You covet and cannot obtain, so you fight and quarrel.
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.520]   You do not have because you do not ask.
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.040]   You ask and do not receive because you ask wrongly to spend it on your passions.
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.200]   You adulterous people, do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God?
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.960]   Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.240]   Or do you suppose it is to no purpose that the scripture says he yearns jealousy over
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.600]   the spirit that he has made to dwell in us?
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.520]   But he gives more grace, therefore it says God opposes the proud and gives grace to the
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.520]   humble.
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.320]   Submit yourself therefore to God.
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.120]   Resist the devil and he will flee from you.
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.640]   Draw near to God and he will draw near to you.
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.560]   Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded."
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.120]   This passage is giving us a picture of God's love for us and how God really does want us
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.320]   to be in relationship with Him and not distracted by everything else in our world.
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.560]   How God even has a spirit of jealousy and says, "Hey, I want you for myself.
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.120]   I love you and I want you to be in relationship with me."
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.660]   But in the beginning it echoes some of the things that we've been talking about.
[00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.560]   In verse 2 it tells us that we don't have because we don't ask.
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.400]   It's saying, "Listen, there's a lot of things in your life that you don't have just because
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.400]   you're not asking.
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.760]   You're not even asking God for them."
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.120]   But then in verse 3 it says that there are things that we ask for and don't get because
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.680]   we're asking for the wrong things.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.080]   We are asking for things that we just want to spend on ourselves.
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.680]   We're asking for things to gratify our own flesh and our own lusts and our own passions
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.080]   and our own pleasures and our own comfort.
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.160]   And that's not necessarily what God wants to give to us.
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:06.240]   And so there are things that we ask for and don't get because we're asking selfishly.
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.860]   And that's what I want us to think about today as we learn to ask, "What are we going to
[00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:11.860]   ask for?"
[00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:17.320]   And I think Jesus gives us some clues in this passage and also just in the context of the
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.480]   entire Sermon on the Mount.
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.400]   We see that Jesus is pointing us towards what we should ask for.
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:31.540]   So when we look at verse 9 of Matthew chapter 7, Jesus gives us this illustration of someone
[00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.760]   asking for a gift.
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.000]   And Jesus says, "Which one of you, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone?
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.360]   Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent?
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.600]   If you then who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.520]   will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him?"
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.440]   Now part of this illustration, Jesus is just pointing us to the fact that God is good and
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.960]   he wants our good in our lives.
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.620]   And that God is going to act in that way that we can trust the goodness of God, just like
[00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.640]   we talked about last week.
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.240]   And that's a powerful truth here.
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.920]   But I think there's also a powerful truth here for us to consider about what is good
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.880]   in our lives and what is best.
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.560]   God knows us in a way that we don't even know ourselves.
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:20.440]   And God is going to work in our lives in a way that is truly for our best, not just for
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.860]   what feels good to us in the moment.
[00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.440]   And that brings up some different questions here.
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.220]   What does it mean to ask God for truly good things?
[00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:36.080]   What does it mean to ask God for truly what's best for us in our lives?
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.500]   I think all of us can think of plenty of things that we would ask God for.
[00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:46.840]   And so if we just say, "Okay, God wants me to ask him for things and that's the end of
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.880]   it," we would probably all say, "Okay, I know what I want to ask for.
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.200]   I want to ask for comfort.
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.200]   I want to ask for stuff.
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.960]   I want to ask for success.
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:54.960]   God give me a lot of money.
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.960]   Give me a big house.
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.280]   Give me a few cars to drive.
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.800]   Give me good health.
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.320]   Give me time to sit on the beach with my family.
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.040]   God make things easy.
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.420]   Give me relationships where no one's unkind to me.
[00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.720]   And make everything work out at my job.
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:16.280]   Or better yet, make me not even have to go to work anymore.
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.320]   Make me no longer have to do school."
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:23.480]   If we were just going to ask for whatever we wanted, it would probably be a pretty long
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:28.680]   list of things that were focused on our own selfishness and on our own comfort, right?
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.200]   That's just the honest reality of most of us as humans.
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.680]   And that's borne out in the way we live our lives.
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:40.560]   The things that we pursue and the things that we try to fill our lives with are often based
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.680]   and focused on our own selfishness or comfort.
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:49.640]   They're based on trying to gain things and possessions and prestige and stuff, comfort,
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.600]   pleasure for ourselves.
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:55.720]   And they're based on trying to insulate us from things that would hurt us or make us
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:00.600]   uncomfortable or make life difficult or make anything challenging in our life.
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.160]   That's how most of us operate.
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.060]   That's how most of us live our lives.
[00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.600]   But is that really what's best for us?
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.240]   Well there's no question that that's something that feels good in the moment, right?
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.880]   It feels good to have an easy life.
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.640]   It feels good to not deal with challenges and adversity.
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.720]   It feels good to not have anyone in your life be sick.
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:23.120]   It feels good to not have anyone be unkind to you.
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:27.600]   There's no question that that's what feels good in the moment is pleasure and comfort
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.560]   and the pursuit of those types of things.
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.520]   But is that what's truly best for us?
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:37.480]   And so when Jesus is pointing us to the fact that God is good and he's going to give us
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:42.040]   good things, he's going to give us bread, he's going to give us a fish, he's going to
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:48.000]   give us what we truly need in our lives to sustain us spiritually, that Jesus is actually
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.480]   teaching us to pursue holiness.
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:55.320]   Jesus is teaching us to pursue what's truly important in our lives.
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:59.200]   And I think there's a really powerful truth here as well.
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:02.800]   That God is ultimately waiting for our response.
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.440]   I've talked about this a lot, but God is not coercive.
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.440]   He is not.
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:11.760]   He's a God of love and he's not a God who forces us to do things.
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:17.720]   God has all the power in the universe, but he doesn't use that power to force us to do
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:18.720]   things.
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:25.200]   He can control things and he turns the course of history wherever he wants it, but he doesn't
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.720]   force us to love him.
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:32.280]   He doesn't make us enter into relationship with him, even though he could, because God
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.480]   is a God of love.
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:38.160]   And that's true in our lives as followers of Jesus as well.
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:42.760]   We see it true in the world at large that there are many people who do not love God
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:46.360]   and who are not in relationship with him, who are not a part of the kingdom of God.
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.920]   God is not going to force them to be in relationship with him.
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:54.880]   But even those of us who have begun relationship with God and come into the kingdom and begin
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:09:02.360]   to live our lives in obedience to him, he's still not going to force us to change.
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.040]   He's going to invite us to change.
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:08.360]   He's going to invite us into transformation, but he's not going to force us to make it
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.040]   happen.
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.260]   God is waiting for us to respond.
[00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.280]   Just like when you send an invitation to someone and you say, "Hey, I want you to come to my
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:19.400]   birthday party," or "I want you to come to my graduation party," or "I want you to come
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:24.760]   to my wedding and my retirement party," whatever it is, you send the invitation, you say, "Please,
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.720]   RSVP," and then you wait for their response.
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.880]   That is what God is doing to us.
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:30.880]   God is inviting us.
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:33.840]   He's saying, "Hey, I want you to come into relationship with me.
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:39.400]   I want it to be deep and fulfilling and satisfying, and I want it to be transformative in your
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.400]   life.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.000]   And this is what I'm inviting you to.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.840]   I'm inviting you to live out the values of the kingdom and to experience all the goodness
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.520]   of what it means to be a child of God.
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:55.400]   But I'm not going to force you to do it, and I'm going to wait on you to respond."
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.320]   And that's what God is doing.
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:02.560]   Because God is waiting for us to respond, we have to begin to pursue holiness.
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:07.940]   We have to begin to choose to draw near to God, like the book of James talks about.
[00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:12.600]   If we will draw near to Him, then He will draw near to us.
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.080]   But He's waiting for us.
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.800]   I think that's really powerful.
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:20.600]   A lot of times when we look at our life and we say, "Well, I've asked for something that's
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:25.680]   not coming to pass," or "I want to grow in my faith, and why doesn't God just make that
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.320]   happen in my life?"
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:30.520]   Sometimes we assume that it's God's fault, that like, "Well, this hasn't happened yet
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:34.080]   because God just doesn't really love me or He doesn't really care about me, or He doesn't
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:37.760]   want to meet this need, or He doesn't want to help me grow in my faith, or He doesn't
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.240]   want to change this thing in my life."
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.040]   And actually the opposite is true.
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.920]   God is right there the whole time saying, "I love you.
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:49.240]   I want to go deeper in fellowship with you."
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:52.400]   We're the one who is not responding to God.
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:56.680]   We're the one who's holding God at arm's length, and we're the one who's saying, "God, I don't
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.840]   want to go any further in my relationship with you.
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:01.200]   I don't want to give you any more control over my life.
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:05.100]   I don't want to give you any more access into my heart."
[00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:10.040]   God is waiting for our response, and Jesus is teaching us that we need to pursue holiness
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.520]   and draw near to God.
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:16.560]   God wants to give us those things that are spiritually sustaining to us, the bread and
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:21.860]   the fish, but we don't have them because we're not responding.
[00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:23.740]   We're not asking God for those things.
[00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:28.280]   We're not saying, "God, instead of just making me comfortable and giving me everything I
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:32.180]   want in my life, can you give me the things I truly need?
[00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:33.340]   Can you give me holiness?
[00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:35.600]   Can you give me righteousness?
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.560]   Can you help me to live rightly before you?
[00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:41.080]   Can you help me to live out the values of the kingdom, even if it means walking through
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.080]   adversity?"
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:46.520]   But we don't ask for that, and God is waiting for us to ask.
[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:49.300]   God is waiting for our response.
[00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:54.860]   There was this pastor of a previous generation that spent a lot of time preaching and ministering
[00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:55.860]   right here in Chicago.
[00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:56.860]   His name was A.W.
[00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:57.860]   Tozier.
[00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:01.340]   He wrote a lot of excellent books, so if you haven't ever read any of them, I encourage
[00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:02.720]   you to check some of them out.
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:06.060]   I remember reading one of his books and coming across this interesting statement where he
[00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:11.620]   said, "Every man is as holy as he wants to be."
[00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:15.820]   On the face of it, that statement sounds kind of crazy and almost heretical, right?
[00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:18.060]   It almost sounds like, "What is this guy saying?
[00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:22.580]   Is he saying that we manufacture holiness, that we make holiness happen?"
[00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:24.620]   We know that is not true in any way.
[00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:29.480]   That it's only through Christ and what he's done on the cross that we could ever draw
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:30.480]   near to God.
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:33.160]   It's only through Jesus that we could ever have relationship with God.
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.000]   It's only through Jesus that we could ever experience holiness.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.040]   It's not that we manufacture holiness, and that's not what Tozier was saying.
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:45.640]   What he was saying is that when there is a deficit in our holiness and the rightness
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:50.840]   of our relationship to God, it's because there's a deficit in our desire.
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:53.120]   It's not because God doesn't want us to be holy.
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:55.800]   It's not because God doesn't want to teach us and grow us.
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:58.900]   It's not because God doesn't want to take us farther.
[00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:02.040]   It's because we don't want it.
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:03.920]   We don't want to go any further.
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.680]   We don't want to grow any more.
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:09.360]   We don't want to become more holy and any closer to God.
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:12.400]   And that is a powerful truth.
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:16.000]   I think Matthew 7 is really pointing us towards that here.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:22.320]   Jesus is saying, "Listen, I want you to learn to ask God for good things in your life, and
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.640]   you need to know what to ask for.
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:25.720]   Ask for the good stuff.
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:26.840]   Ask for holiness.
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:32.720]   Ask for the spiritually transformative things in your life, because that will cause you
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:35.160]   to grow into who God wants you to be.
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:38.640]   And if you're not growing into who God wants you to be, it's not because God doesn't want
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:39.640]   it for you.
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:44.080]   It's because you don't want it, and you're not moving towards it.
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:48.280]   You're afraid of it, or you're holding on to your sin, or you're letting something else
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:49.280]   hold you back.
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:54.040]   And I think when we look at these verses in Matthew 7 in the context of the Sermon on
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:59.840]   the Mount as a whole, we see that Jesus is teaching us that God desires us to possess
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:02.840]   and live out Kingdom values.
[00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:07.600]   If we say, "Okay, Jesus is telling me to ask," and if we just pulled this passage out, Matthew
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:12.680]   7, 7-11, and looked at it out of context, we could say, "Well, what is Jesus telling
[00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:13.680]   me to ask for?"
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:14.680]   Anything, right?
[00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:17.640]   Like I said earlier, maybe it's just stuff and comfort and pleasure.
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:24.000]   But when we look at it in the context of the entire Sermon on the Mount, it begins to open
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.400]   up what we're supposed to ask for.
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:31.520]   Jesus tells us to ask, "What has He been talking about this whole time?"
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:33.840]   He's been talking about the values of the Kingdom.
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:35.800]   He's been talking about poverty of spirit.
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.280]   He's been talking about meekness.
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:38.960]   He's been talking about being a peacemaker.
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:44.080]   He's been talking about storing up treasures in Heaven, seeking first the Kingdom of God.
[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:46.520]   He's been talking about being pure of heart.
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:51.680]   He's been talking about having a clear spiritual vision.
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:55.800]   All these things that we've discussed over the last year that Jesus has been talking
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:15:01.760]   about, that's the context of this statement where Jesus is asking, "It will be given you."
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:04.160]   He's saying, "Hey, here's the values of the Kingdom.
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.200]   I'm laying them out in front of you."
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:10.760]   And as you listen to them, yes, they are things that you do not currently possess in your
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.400]   life.
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:15.600]   So ask, and it will be given to you.
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.680]   Ask God for them.
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:21.000]   Seek them, and you will find them.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.520]   Look, and God will open that door and begin to give you those values of the Kingdom in
[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:30.760]   your heart and in your life and begin to allow you to live them out.
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:33.800]   And that's one of the things that Jesus is teaching us here.
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.820]   Jesus is teaching us what to ask for.
[00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:39.400]   We should ask for the values of the Kingdom.
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:45.240]   We should seek the values of the Kingdom, and we should ask God to begin to give them
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:50.880]   to us so that we possess them and we live them out in our lives.
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:55.440]   Another thing that Jesus is teaching us here is that God is more interested in our spiritual
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:58.120]   well-being than our material well-being.
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.560]   That's really important for us to understand.
[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:04.920]   When we think about prayer and we think about asking God, I think all of us have had experiences.
[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:09.560]   If you've been a follower of Jesus for very long, I'm sure you've had an experience where
[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:13.520]   you've asked God for something, and you didn't get what you wanted, or you didn't get it
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:15.300]   in the way that you wanted.
[00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:16.660]   And that's challenging for us.
[00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:17.880]   That challenges our faith.
[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:21.400]   That causes us to say, "Okay, God, can you answer prayer?
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:23.360]   Do you want to answer prayer?
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:25.760]   Why would you not answer this prayer?"
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:28.640]   It gives us a lot of questions, right?
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:34.240]   And I think we need to understand that God is more interested in our spiritual well-being
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:36.120]   than our material well-being.
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:41.920]   Sometimes we ask for something that may be what's best for us materially and physically,
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:47.360]   and in the moment we may ask God for some stuff or for some pleasure or for some comfort
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:51.400]   or to work something out in a way that's great for us.
[00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:55.280]   And maybe that's not what God wants to do in our life at that moment.
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:17:01.600]   Because maybe God sees that giving us that thing or that position or that situation or
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:06.520]   that job or that educational achievement or whatever it is in that moment would actually
[00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:09.440]   not be what's best for us spiritually.
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:15.040]   Maybe that would cause us to be proud or cause us to look down on other people.
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:19.880]   Or maybe it would just cause us to miss out on a lesson that we desperately need to learn,
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:22.880]   that we've got to go through some adversity to learn.
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:28.320]   And so God in his love for us is more concerned with our spiritual well-being than our material
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:29.320]   well-being.
[00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:35.520]   And sometimes God says no or sometimes God says wait when we ask because he has a lesson
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:41.780]   that's so valuable for us to learn spiritually that we would not learn if he just said yes
[00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:44.160]   and gave us the thing that we want.
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:47.080]   And we have to remember that when we're asking God.
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:50.480]   Jesus is pointing us to that in the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:55.240]   He's saying yeah, there's a lot of things that you could ask for, but here's what you
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:59.400]   really truly need, what's really truly going to be good for you and what's really truly
[00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:04.480]   going to bring peace and fulfillment and satisfaction and joy into your life is to possess and live
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:05.480]   out the values of the kingdom.
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:07.080]   You need to ask God for that.
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:12.120]   And God's more focused on you being healthy spiritually than he is on you just getting
[00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.240]   everything you want out of life.
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:18.200]   And that's really valuable and powerful for us to know.
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:24.120]   There are times when we just want things to be easy and simple and quick and exactly how
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.120]   we want them to be.
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:27.880]   And we ask God for that.
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:28.880]   And that's okay.
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:30.280]   It's okay to ask God.
[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:35.440]   But God doesn't necessarily say yes to that because God wants what's best for us in a
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:36.960]   deeper way.
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.440]   And that's what God is going to move towards.
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:42.640]   You know, God is more interested in his kingdom than ours.
[00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:46.360]   Sometimes we ask God things that really just have to do with our own kingdom and our own
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:49.520]   pursuit and what's going to benefit us.
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:55.240]   And God loves us and he wants good for us, but he's more interested in the goals of his
[00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:57.720]   kingdom than he is in ours.
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.600]   And that may sound selfish.
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:04.200]   We might say, well, how could God be so selfish and not want what's best for me?
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:09.960]   But if we're honest with scripture and who God says he is, if God really is all powerful
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:17.600]   and all knowing, then how foolish would it be for him to allow our goals and priorities
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:21.760]   to outsize his goals and priorities.
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:25.360]   His kingdom should come first.
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:30.480]   And so it's only right for God to be more interested in the goals of his kingdom than
[00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:33.360]   in the goals of our kingdom.
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:36.840]   And the reality is that God is more interested in his glory than ours.
[00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:40.320]   And again, if we're honest with scripture, that's only right.
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:43.000]   That's exactly how it should be.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.240]   God should be more interested in glorifying himself than in glorifying us.
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:53.960]   And so as we ask for things in our life, we need to understand that God is going to respond
[00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:58.560]   and God is going to teach us and to grow us and to love us.
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:03.480]   But it may not always move in the direction of our glory or the goals of our kingdom or
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:05.880]   even our comfort and pleasure.
[00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:11.160]   Sometimes it will, but there will be many times when it does not because God is more
[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:13.560]   interested in our spiritual well-being.
[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:17.840]   He's more interested in glorifying himself and in advancing his kingdom than in just
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:20.400]   giving us what we want.
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:24.400]   So I want to give us a few things to think about as we close out here.
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:29.560]   As we begin to think about asking God and what we should ask for, I would say, don't
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:33.240]   be afraid to ask God for anything big or small.
[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:37.320]   God cares about your life and he wants to hear the desires and needs of your heart.
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:39.400]   So pour those out to him.
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:42.720]   Even if those are small things, pour them out to God.
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.840]   If they're emotional needs, pour that out to God.
[00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:47.480]   If they're physical realities, pour it out to God.
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:50.520]   Even if you're not sure and you say, "Well, I don't know if I'm just asking for my own
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:51.520]   comfort or pleasure."
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:53.880]   There's nothing wrong with asking.
[00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:57.280]   If that's not what God has for you, then God will reveal that to you.
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:02.520]   But it's just like little children are not afraid to ask a loving parent for a gift,
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:05.160]   even if they know the answer might be no.
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.640]   And we are God's children.
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:07.640]   He loves us.
[00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:12.880]   So don't be afraid to ask for gifts, even if it's something that may not be right for
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:13.960]   you at the time.
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:15.800]   God can tell you no.
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:18.560]   Don't be afraid to ask for anything big or small.
[00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:20.400]   Pour your requests out to God.
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:24.320]   Consider that privilege that you have of going before the Almighty God of the universe to
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:26.920]   make your requests known.
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:30.960]   And then I would encourage you to, if you're not sure whether or not you should ask for
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:36.000]   things, ask for things that you know are in alignment with kingdom values.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.920]   Ask for things that you know are in alignment with God's will.
[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:43.080]   You know, we can say, "Well, I don't know if I should ask for this in my work or for
[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:44.080]   that in my work."
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:50.320]   Well, if one situation in your job is going to give you an opportunity to display poverty
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:55.440]   of spirit or to be a peacemaker, then you should probably ask for that because it's
[00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:58.000]   in alignment with the values of the kingdom.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.360]   There are certain things that we don't have to wonder about whether or not we should ask
[00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:06.080]   for or God wants us to have them if they're already in alignment with kingdom values.
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:09.440]   We don't have to ask God and say, "God, do you really want me to help the poor and the
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:10.440]   needy?
[00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:12.280]   Is that something that you want me to do?"
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:13.920]   The answer is already yes.
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:17.600]   God's made it clear that that's a kingdom value that we should be helping those who
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:18.720]   are in need.
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:23.520]   So you might need to ask some specific questions about how you do that and who specifically
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:24.520]   you help.
[00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:28.160]   But you don't have to ask whether or not you're supposed to help because you already know
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:30.060]   the kingdom value there.
[00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:34.960]   And so think about kingdom values in your life and some areas, some of those situations
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:38.080]   that you may be confused about and you may be asking God's questions.
[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:43.640]   Maybe those questions are already answered just by looking at and aligning yourself with
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:46.280]   the values of the kingdom in those areas.
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:51.680]   And ask for things that match God's priorities, that align with God's priorities.
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:53.560]   What's important to God?
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:58.080]   God wants the people around you to feel his love, to feel his forgiveness, to feel his
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.200]   grace, to feel his goodness.
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:03.280]   God wants the people around you to come into relationship with him.
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:06.760]   And so if you say, "Well, I don't really know what to pray for my family," or, "I don't
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:10.880]   really know what to pray for my friends or my co-workers or my classmates," that's a
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:12.640]   great place to start.
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:14.160]   Start asking God for those things.
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:17.440]   You know what God's priorities are for those people in your life.
[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:20.720]   God wants them to experience his love and his forgiveness.
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:22.680]   God wants them to come into relationship with him.
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:29.560]   God wants them to be served by you, by the members of the family of God.
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:31.480]   Start asking for that stuff.
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:34.400]   You don't have to wonder if God's interested in those things.
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:36.080]   We already know that God is.
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:40.480]   Those are priorities in God's heart and in God's kingdom.
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:45.000]   And ask for God's glory, things that are in alignment with God's glory.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:51.560]   Again, we don't have to wonder if God is going to be behind things or in things that are
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:52.800]   glorifying him.
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:57.120]   We know that God is going to be in things that are glorifying him.
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:00.160]   And so when you face a situation in your life and you're like, "I don't know what to pray
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:01.160]   here.
[00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:04.240]   I don't know which outcome to pray for," that's a great place to start.
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:06.080]   Say, "You know what?
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:09.680]   There's this situation before me and this could happen or that could happen, and I'm
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:12.960]   not sure what God wants in my life."
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.960]   Begin to pray, "God, would you be glorified?
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:17.120]   I don't know what I'm supposed to choose.
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:18.120]   I don't know what's going to happen.
[00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:19.120]   I don't know the future.
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:21.480]   I don't have control over it.
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:24.520]   But would you be glorified whatever happens?"
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:28.560]   Begin to ask for things that are in alignment with God's glory.
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:35.000]   The reality is none of us have as much control over our lives as we think we do.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.560]   We are not able to control the situations that are presented to us in life, but we can
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:43.320]   control the way that we respond to them.
[00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:49.120]   And God wants us to ask for his help in every situation that we face.
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:52.460]   God wants us to ask for his help when we have a need.
[00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:58.960]   God wants us to ask for his help when we are afraid, when we are confused, when we don't
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:03.440]   know where to go, when we need guidance, when we experience some type of deficit in our
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:07.640]   ability and we say, "God, I want to love this person, but I don't know how."
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:13.840]   Or "God, I want to live out the kingdom values in this situation, but I don't have the capacity
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:15.160]   to do that."
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:17.440]   God wants to help us in those situations.
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:21.680]   God wants us to ask for his help in every situation of our life.
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:24.200]   And we need to learn what to ask for.
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:28.160]   The things that align with the values of the kingdom, the things that align with God's
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:31.180]   priorities, the things that align with God's glory.
[00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:35.240]   We need to learn to seek holiness, to seek to draw near to God.
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:41.720]   We need to pursue that because God is waiting for us to respond to him.
[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:45.600]   If there's not holiness and righteousness in our life, it's not God's fault.
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:48.520]   It's on us because we're not moving towards him.
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:51.440]   He's always moving towards us.
[00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:57.800]   And we need to really seek and ask God to allow us to possess and live out these values
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:58.800]   of the kingdom.
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:25:59.800]   Let's pray.
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:04.400]   God, I thank you for the privilege that you've given us to ask you.
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:07.480]   And I pray that we would learn to ask you for the right things.
[00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:12.440]   I pray that we would learn to ask you for the things that are truly best for us, for
[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:16.840]   the things that are spiritually valuable, not just for our material and physical well-being,
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:21.400]   but that we would ask for the things that really are going to be best for us.
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:25.840]   I pray that we would learn to ask for things that align with the values of the kingdom,
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:32.080]   that align with your will and your priorities, your goals, and your glory in our life, God.
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:37.560]   And God, I pray that you would help us to begin to ask and seek to pursue holiness in
[00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:40.600]   our life, to pursue deeper relationship with you.
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:44.760]   And I pray that you would help us to ask that we would be able to possess the values of
[00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:48.900]   the kingdom, that you would give us these values of the kingdom that we've talked about
[00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:54.480]   in our hearts in a real way so that we can live them out and that we can experience you
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:27:00.880]   using us to bring healing and love and encouragement and salvation to the world around us, to the
[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:01.880]   people around us, God.
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:01.880]   In Jesus' name, amen.
