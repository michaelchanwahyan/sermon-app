1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
 Can you say hi, like high five or whatever?

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,000
 Just wave your hand, okay?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Good to see you all.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 And it's good to be back to think about the Lord's,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,120
 the Lord's word, what it's gonna say to us.

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,760
 We're gonna go through our series,

7
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,520
 continue with our series, Faith and Time.

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,920
 Think about how we use our time.

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,940
 Think about how God will put different markers

10
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,140
 in our time, in our journey,

11
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,440
 to remind us of his work and his grace.

12
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,260
 Today, we're going to talk about the concept

13
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:34,460
 or the practice of Sabbath.

14
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,320
 Sabbath.

15
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,600
 Sabbath is what day of the week?

16
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,920
 First day, third day, fifth, sixth?

17
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,960
 What's your guess?

18
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,800
 The seventh, right?

19
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,760
 Yeah, exactly, seventh, yeah.

20
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,480
 The seventh, okay.

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,480
 Well, according to Jewish calendar,

22
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,480
 it's Friday, sundown, you're gonna launch the Shabbat.

23
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:06,120
 And then for 24 hours until Saturday,

24
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,200
 which is the seventh day, right?

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,720
 Seventh day of the week,

26
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,240
 until the sundown of the next day on Saturday.

27
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,560
 So 24 hours is the Sabbath or Shabbat, all right?

28
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,520
 It is a regular weekly practice,

29
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,640
 even for many modern Jewish people,

30
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,600
 Israelis, or even in Jewish communities today,

31
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,800
 like community in Skokie or in other areas,

32
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,280
 Brooklyn or anywhere you get a concentration

33
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,640
 of a lot of Jewish people,

34
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,840
 they will continue the practice of Shabbat.

35
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,280
 Friday night to Saturday night,

36
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,120
 for 24 hours, they don't do any work.

37
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,280
 They stop anything that they do in the past six days.

38
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,160
 So they cease all the work,

39
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,000
 and then they don't do a lot of things,

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,040
 like they don't cook.

41
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,400
 They don't start any fire.

42
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:08,560
 So in modern day technology, they put their phone away.

43
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,920
 They don't push any button, you know what I'm saying?

44
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,560
 'Cause you push a button, the light will go up, right?

45
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,040
 And that is considered a violation of the Shabbat,

46
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,320
 because you're lighting things up, right?

47
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,080
 Starting a fire.

48
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,080
 Strange, right?

49
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,160
 Do you wanna live like that?

50
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,000
 No, right?

51
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,360
 (audience laughing)

52
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,360
 But if you ask them, many of them will be grateful

53
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,420
 for such a practice.

54
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,800
 Interesting, right?

55
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,520
 To stop anything that you're doing,

56
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,400
 just to take a break,

57
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,400
 especially in our technology tyranny.

58
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,120
 We are living in a technology tyranny.

59
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,240
 We are being massacred actually by our phone,

60
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,920
 by technology, by a lot of different things.

61
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,560
 So it's a very interesting practice.

62
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,560
 And actually the Bible emphasizes once and again

63
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,480
 that the people of God should do something like that,

64
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,520
 should observe Sabbath.

65
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,320
 As I said, many modern Jewish people,

66
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:21,320
 modern Israelis, they are practicing this sort of Shabbat.

67
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:26,620
 So let me give you some example.

68
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:31,620
 If you go to Israel or any community

69
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,700
 that has a lot of Jewish people,

70
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,720
 you'll find a Shabbat elevator.

71
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,200
 A Shabbat elevator is a Jewish elevator.

72
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:47,200
 So whenever there's a weekly Shabbat or high holidays,

73
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,240
 they already program the elevator

74
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,280
 so that you don't have to go into the elevator

75
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,160
 and push a button, right?

76
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,200
 Again, that's why I said, if you push a button,

77
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,960
 something light up, it consider violation

78
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,640
 because you are lighting things up, right?

79
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,040
 You're starting a fire.

80
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,360
 So here's one of them.

81
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,280
 I think this picture was found in Brooklyn, in New York.

82
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:18,040
 The second one is another form of Shabbat elevator.

83
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,560
 So you go to a high rise, right?

84
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,560
 And this elevator, the one on the right, elevator A,

85
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,000
 and which floor do you go to?

86
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,280
 This Shabbat elevator, by the way,

87
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,240
 we will stop at every single floor and then come back.

88
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,640
 So you go into the Shabbat elevator,

89
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,240
 you don't have to press the button.

90
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,640
 It will close automatically.

91
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,560
 It will bring you to the floor that you want

92
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,680
 and then you will exit, right?

93
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,680
 And then the elevator A on the right is that,

94
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,080
 from basement to ground floor is zero,

95
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,200
 to one, two, three, four, and then come back down

96
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,640
 to zero and then minus two or basement,

97
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,000
 and then go back up.

98
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,860
 Elevator D is a little bit different, right?

99
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,400
 If you want to go to floor eight,

100
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,220
 then you take A or you take D.

101
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,160
 That's right, if you take A,

102
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,680
 then it will take a long time for you

103
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,440
 because you have to come back.

104
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,040
 And then you find out I was in the wrong elevator.

105
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,080
 And then you have to go to D, right?

106
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,400
 So it will stop every single floor

107
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:32,400
 in order for you to cease doing any work to observe Shabbat.

108
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,180
 Last one I want to show you is this one.

109
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,820
 It's a warning sign in case of fire,

110
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,980
 do not use the elevator.

111
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,640
 Do you know that?

112
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,160
 We shouldn't use elevator in case there's fire, right?

113
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,700
 And even worse, if you go into a Shabbat elevator, right?

114
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,940
 'Cause it will bring you to the floor of fire, right?

115
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:54,940
 (laughs)

116
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,180
 And then you have to survive the floor

117
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,140
 and then you come back, right?

118
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,460
 It will be a big trouble for you.

119
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,300
 This sort of thing is very interesting.

120
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,820
 But as I said, the Bible keeps on talking about

121
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:10,900
 the marker in the lives of the people of God

122
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:14,420
 that they need to do something like that, all right?

123
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:17,080
 In their time, in their schedule,

124
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,640
 there has to be something that will show,

125
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,800
 that will mark themselves away from

126
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,540
 or different from other people in the world.

127
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:31,080
 Shabbat is one of the killer, one of the sure marker.

128
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,320
 So what does it mean?

129
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,900
 Shabbat means stop.

130
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:40,080
 You stop doing anything.

131
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,580
 You cease to work.

132
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:45,600
 One day a week.

133
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,040
 You stop doing what you have been doing for six days.

134
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,400
 And then you stop for one day.

135
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,660
 That is what Sabbath means.

136
00:06:54,660 --> 00:07:00,680
 The first time the Bible mentions Shabbat is

137
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,620
 Shabbat is the creation story, Genesis 2.

138
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:09,060
 The creation of heaven and earth,

139
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,640
 everything is done, was complete.

140
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:15,500
 On the seventh day, God had finished his work of creation.

141
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,580
 So he rest Shabbat from all his work.

142
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:24,760
 And God blessed and sanctified, declared holy the seventh day.

143
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:31,220
 Because it was the day when he rested Shabbat

144
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:35,000
 from all his work of creation.

145
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,960
 So right off the bat, the very first page of the Bible,

146
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,860
 God works like that.

147
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:46,040
 Six days he created or he organized the entire cosmos,

148
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:51,400
 arranged it in such a way that is in order.

149
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,820
 And then the seventh day, God blessed and sanctified

150
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:59,980
 and set it apart, declared holy, or the seventh day.

151
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:05,200
 And then there is the fourth commandment

152
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,060
 in the 10th commandment passage.

153
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,140
 One of them is Exodus 20.

154
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:15,160
 Remember to observe the seventh day by keeping it holy.

155
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,240
 And by the way, this is the fourth commandment.

156
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,840
 This is the longest explained commandment of all 10.

157
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,920
 You know, other commandments are just one or two sentences.

158
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:32,080
 Here, talking about Shabbat, the fourth commandment.

159
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,500
 Observe the seventh day by keeping holy.

160
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:39,660
 You have six days each week for your ordinary work.

161
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:43,980
 But the seventh day is special.

162
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:48,140
 It is Sabbath, day of rest, dedicated to the Lord, your God.

163
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,660
 On that day, no one in your household may do any work,

164
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,960
 including your sons and daughters, your male servant

165
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,660
 or your female servant, your livestock, everything else,

166
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:03,840
 even your sheep, even your pets, your dog, your cat.

167
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,200
 They stop doing any work.

168
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,500
 I know your dogs and your cats don't do any work.

169
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,240
 You do works for them, right?

170
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,720
 In six days, the Lord made the heavens and the earth,

171
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,620
 the sea and everything in them.

172
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,440
 On the Shabbat, on the seventh day, He rested.

173
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,180
 And that's why the Lord Yahweh blessed the seventh day

174
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:29,460
 and set it apart, sanctified it as holy.

175
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,560
 This is how God works.

176
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,720
 Six days of work, and then one day, He set it apart,

177
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:40,520
 sanctified it, declared it special and holy.

178
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:44,680
 Holy and special, distinct from all the other six days.

179
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:48,940
 A six plus one, parallel, right?

180
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,920
 Six days, and then one day, six day and one day.

181
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,060
 It's like you read the music scores, right?

182
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:01,000
 You know how to read music scores?

183
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,920
 Kind of, right?

184
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:07,020
 There's always rest at some places, right?

185
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:10,560
 Good music does not mean you jam everything together

186
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,360
 and there's no space, right?

187
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,360
 You hear someone play piano, if he's good,

188
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,640
 play some sort of instrument,

189
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,800
 there has to be intentional rest in between, right?

190
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,280
 Do you get it?

191
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,120
 Right?

192
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,260
 It's like you writing a novel or something.

193
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:32,180
 There's always commerce in between.

194
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,780
 And then period, here and there.

195
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,520
 Punctuations.

196
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,180
 Sabbath is our life punctuation.

197
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,440
 It's our rhythm.

198
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:46,160
 God set the rhythm of our life.

199
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,160
 Six plus one, and then six plus one.

200
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,220
 This is how God works.

201
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:54,880
 God bless the seven day and declare it holy.

202
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,980
 Can you see what God does here?

203
00:10:58,980 --> 00:10:59,820
 It's very interesting.

204
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,120
 I read, you read it again.

205
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,200
 I mean, there's so many familiar passage in the Bible

206
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,640
 that we thought we know what it means

207
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,540
 because it's so familiar.

208
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:13,500
 But if you slow down and read the key words,

209
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,900
 you pick up the meaning.

210
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,960
 Genesis one and two is one of the examples.

211
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,500
 We all know the creation account, right?

212
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,900
 We read it and we feel it's so familiar, right?

213
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,980
 There's nothing surprising.

214
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:31,300
 But if you come to the seventh day, chapter two,

215
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,140
 it's very interesting.

216
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:36,300
 God bless, incentivize, declare holy the seventh day.

217
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:40,600
 Now what's so special about it?

218
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,380
 God created everything, right?

219
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,460
 Day one to day six.

220
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:48,620
 Then found the climax is creating humanity, right?

221
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,580
 There were a lot of things.

222
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:54,600
 There are a lot of stuff that God put in order

223
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,480
 in the universe.

224
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,880
 Now those are the things that can be set apart, right?

225
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,420
 Just like the temple, you go into a holy place,

226
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:08,360
 there were something more sacred than others, right?

227
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,000
 There's always distinction between what is sacred

228
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,440
 and what is not sacred, what is holy and what is profane.

229
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,620
 Things can be set apart, right?

230
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,900
 People can be set apart.

231
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:23,160
 Priests serving in the temple services,

232
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,580
 they can be set apart, they can be sanctified.

233
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,900
 They can be declared holy, different from other people.

234
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:34,060
 So things can be set apart and personnel can be set apart.

235
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,640
 However, the first thing God set apart

236
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,720
 is not a person or a people.

237
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,280
 It's not a thing or things.

238
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,520
 The first thing God sanctified is time.

239
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:51,080
 24 hours out of one week.

240
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:57,680
 He bless it, seven days, and declare it holy.

241
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:05,040
 Find it interesting that in the creation rhythm,

242
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,240
 there is a time pattern.

243
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,660
 There is a slot of time in the entire week

244
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:16,280
 that is called sacred time.

245
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:22,020
 Not anything, not any person, not any object,

246
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:26,700
 but a period of time, right?

247
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,880
 There's one very famous rabbi

248
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,380
 who wrote a very well-known work on Shabbat.

249
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,640
 His name is called Abraham Herschel.

250
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,920
 Now let me give you a quote.

251
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,340
 I think this quote worth your reflection.

252
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:50,880
 He talks about Shabbat, a time that is set apart.

253
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,960
 Sacred time, special time.

254
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:59,640
 So Herschel said, "There is a realm of time

255
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:04,780
 "where the goal is not to have, but to be."

256
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,620
 Not to own, but to give.

257
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:14,240
 Not to control, but to share.

258
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,500
 Not to subdue, but to be in accord.

259
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:22,700
 Now think about this thing.

260
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:27,540
 Consider all things in the universe,

261
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:31,700
 all things that God created, all the small, big things,

262
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:35,860
 you know, down to the molecules, down to the atoms,

263
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:43,780
 up to the planets, right?

264
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:48,660
 The galaxy, the universe.

265
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:54,340
 But there's only one realm that is different.

266
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:57,180
 It's the realm of time.

267
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,760
 The realm of time is purpose.

268
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,440
 It's not to subdue.

269
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,820
 It's not for us to control.

270
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,740
 That's interesting because, you know,

271
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:11,740
 like objects in the universe, you can subdue

272
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:14,500
 and you can control, you can take possession of it.

273
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,180
 Like this table.

274
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,740
 You know, I can take this table

275
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,740
 and you don't have this table.

276
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,820
 If I take it.

277
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:24,760
 Like the chair.

278
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,100
 You're sitting on your chair.

279
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,700
 Nobody's gonna sit on your chair

280
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,300
 because you're sitting on it, right?

281
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,700
 Unless, you know, the other person's sitting on your lap.

282
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,900
 You take possession of it.

283
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,940
 You control it.

284
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,860
 You subdue it.

285
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,940
 Now this is our desire, this is our purpose all the time.

286
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,900
 We take control of something

287
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,860
 and then nobody else can control it.

288
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:48,700
 It's kind of taking exclusive possession of something.

289
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,780
 Some property, right?

290
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,660
 Your house, right?

291
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,140
 You just bought a house, right?

292
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:54,980
 Somebody?

293
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,820
 You bought a house, it's your house,

294
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:00,940
 it's not somebody else's house anymore, right?

295
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:04,780
 Nobody can knock the door and say, "I wanna come in," right?

296
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:07,020
 You can only come in by invitation.

297
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,460
 It's your house.

298
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,820
 You take possession of it.

299
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,620
 But Herschel said, "Time is different."

300
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:15,540
 Think about it.

301
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:19,580
 You have 24 hours, I have 24 hours, right?

302
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,380
 You can take possession of 24 hours

303
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:25,380
 and take my hours out of mine, right?

304
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,780
 I have 24 hours, you have 24 hours,

305
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,740
 you have seven days, I have seven days.

306
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:35,620
 It is a realm not to own but to give.

307
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:40,420
 God created us as beings in time.

308
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,540
 You realize that?

309
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,380
 We live in time.

310
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:47,220
 We watch the clock.

311
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:50,420
 What time we go to work?

312
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,860
 We don't wanna be late.

313
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:56,180
 What time we go off work and then we have our time, right?

314
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,940
 What time do we go for dinner?

315
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,340
 After the service, what time are we getting there

316
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,340
 to have lunch, right?

317
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,820
 We don't wanna be late, right?

318
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,420
 What time is service?

319
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,820
 We wanna be there, right?

320
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:14,380
 But time is a realm in the entire universe

321
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,900
 not to control but to share.

322
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,980
 Think about it.

323
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,140
 When we have fellowship together,

324
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:25,820
 when we worship together, it's a time to share.

325
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:32,140
 That's why worship in the Bible has always been,

326
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:37,140
 has always been corporate, a group, a people together,

327
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:42,380
 not alone, right?

328
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:46,020
 Not individual enjoyment.

329
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,820
 We come together to share.

330
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,620
 It's very interesting.

331
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,540
 God blessed the seventh day.

332
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,140
 The first thing that God sanctified

333
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:00,140
 is the period of time in our lives.

334
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:06,900
 In your week of work, 24 hours, God set it apart.

335
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:14,460
 That's why when the Bible talks about Shabbat,

336
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:18,660
 it always relate to other things.

337
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:23,660
 Leviticus 23, six days each week for your ordinary work.

338
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:26,660
 But the seventh day is the Sabbath day,

339
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:30,140
 the Shabbat of complete rest,

340
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:33,260
 an official day for holy assembly.

341
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:37,700
 It is the Lord's Shabbat day.

342
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,740
 It must be observed whenever you live, wherever you live.

343
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,180
 In addition to Shabbat,

344
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,940
 there are the Lord's appointed festivals,

345
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:48,820
 official days for holy assembly

346
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:53,180
 that are to be celebrated at their proper times each year.

347
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,420
 Now, what does it mean?

348
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:59,260
 Shabbat for some other purpose.

349
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:03,660
 So in some sense, you start working,

350
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:08,660
 but in another sense, you do something together,

351
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:13,900
 which is holy assembly, to get together to worship,

352
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,420
 to get together to celebrate,

353
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:19,740
 to acknowledge who is in charge.

354
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,740
 And who is in charge?

355
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,660
 God is in charge.

356
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,300
 You go back to Genesis 2,

357
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:30,500
 when the Bible describes the work of God,

358
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:34,020
 the six days of creation,

359
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,900
 and then He rests on the seventh day.

360
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,780
 Now, it does not mean that God is tired.

361
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:43,540
 It does not mean that God is not human.

362
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,260
 It's not like us, right?

363
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,500
 We work for a whole day,

364
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,580
 and then we go back home and we sit on the lazy boy,

365
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,660
 and then we say, "We are tired."

366
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:55,220
 We want to get refreshed.

367
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:58,780
 No, God is not like human, but He rested.

368
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,300
 Now, what does it mean?

369
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,940
 Now, in the biblical world, in the ancient world,

370
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:06,980
 when they think about God resting,

371
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:13,420
 they are thinking of God being enthroned.

372
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,100
 Being the king.

373
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:20,340
 So whenever God rests, God rests in His temple.

374
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:24,660
 His temple is where He operates the entire world.

375
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:29,380
 So when Genesis 2 talks about God resting,

376
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,700
 it's talking about God being the king.

377
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:35,460
 He is seated on the throne,

378
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:40,460
 and He controls and organizes the entire cosmos.

379
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,780
 He operates the entire cosmos.

380
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:43,900
 That's what it means.

381
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,580
 Doesn't mean six days, He works so hard,

382
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,620
 and then the seventh day, "Oh, He's so tired.

383
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,740
 "He's exhausted.

384
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,100
 "He needs some rest."

385
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:55,300
 No, sixth day, He put together the entire cosmos,

386
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:59,300
 arranged it in such a way that it's in order.

387
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,860
 And then the seventh day,

388
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:04,260
 He sits in the control room in the temple

389
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,380
 to operate the entire universe.

390
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:09,060
 It's kind of like, it gives you a modern analogy.

391
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:14,060
 It's like, remember when the pandemic started

392
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:17,580
 about two, three years ago?

393
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,820
 Remember we have to switch everything back

394
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,100
 from in-person to online?

395
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,980
 So I bought a new computer.

396
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,260
 So I went to my basement, right?

397
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,580
 And then I got all the computer parts,

398
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:34,540
 my standing table, my monitors, my keyboard,

399
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,340
 and all the parts.

400
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,900
 I got everything in the basement.

401
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:42,420
 And then I spent almost like two to three days

402
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:46,900
 to put the entire computer system together,

403
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,740
 camera and all this stuff.

404
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,780
 Now, you got the wires,

405
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:57,780
 you got the different big or small parts.

406
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,220
 You put everything together.

407
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,300
 Now, if you imagine,

408
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:05,500
 we put the entire computer system together,

409
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,620
 what do you do after you're done?

410
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,740
 - Rest.

411
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,580
 - You rest.

412
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,140
 What do you do?

413
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:17,100
 The first button I push is the power on button.

414
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:21,980
 'Cause that is when the time you control, you operate.

415
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:28,340
 Same way, God put everything in order,

416
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,580
 like putting together a computer system.

417
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:33,700
 And then He push not the off button,

418
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,860
 He push the on button.

419
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:40,260
 So He's the King over the entire cosmos.

420
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,700
 He control everything.

421
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,300
 Now, that's what it means

422
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:48,260
 when the Bible talks about Shabbat.

423
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,420
 It doesn't really,

424
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:54,420
 it means more than we imitating God,

425
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:57,060
 'cause God works six days in one day, right?

426
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,860
 Six in one, six in one.

427
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,900
 It's more than imitation,

428
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:04,100
 but it's more on participation.

429
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,060
 We can participate, we can join.

430
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,860
 Or live under God's control.

431
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:13,660
 So we set apart one day a week to worship,

432
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:17,820
 because we know the universe, your universe, your world,

433
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:21,860
 is not controlled by you.

434
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:27,260
 It's by the one who created all things.

435
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:32,820
 That's what worship is all about, right?

436
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,740
 That's what worship is all about.

437
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:38,780
 Worship meaning we know we are not in control.

438
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:43,140
 We are not the ultimate operator of our lives.

439
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:46,100
 There's one who is Lord of all, right?

440
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,380
 Who is the God of all.

441
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,540
 He is involved in everything that you do.

442
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:54,140
 So one day in seven days,

443
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:59,700
 to be set apart in order to give Him honor,

444
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:04,380
 to tell Him, "Yes, you are the Lord who control my lives.

445
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,900
 You are the Lord who controls my career.

446
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:11,460
 You are the Lord who controls my future.

447
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:14,020
 I participate in your kinship.

448
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,940
 I participate in your worship.

449
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:20,220
 You are everything, and I want to do your will."

450
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,500
 Right?

451
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,300
 That's what worship is all about.

452
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:27,500
 You come in here to join our worship.

453
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,820
 It's not just going through some motions,

454
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:33,900
 you know, joining a program.

455
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:38,340
 It's to look upon God Himself.

456
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,260
 He is the one who set up everything,

457
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:44,940
 and He's the one who is in the ultimate control, right?

458
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:53,860
 Let me close by giving you some suggestions

459
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:57,060
 how to practice Shabbat.

460
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,380
 How do you practice Shabbat?

461
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:04,060
 You know, I tell you, I do that all the time too.

462
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:07,860
 Most of the people assume

463
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:11,180
 that I go to church because of work, right?

464
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,900
 Yeah, yeah, I work, right?

465
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,900
 But you know, some people would come to me,

466
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:21,860
 "Oh, pastor, do you really have your Shabbat?

467
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:24,340
 Because you come here to work, right?"

468
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:28,420
 And I want to tell you, it's not really work for me.

469
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,900
 Seriously, it's worship.

470
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,180
 I relate to God.

471
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:37,020
 Yes, I do some work, right?

472
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,300
 I do some preparation.

473
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,300
 You too do.

474
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,660
 You need to do some preparation too, right?

475
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:46,060
 So I come here, I really enjoy the worship service.

476
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:55,740
 So I come with a mentality, with an attitude

477
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:58,660
 that I'm not here to just output.

478
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,060
 I'm getting some input too.

479
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:05,020
 When I worship with the people of God together,

480
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,820
 you know, my spirit is refreshed

481
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:09,500
 because I draw closer to God.

482
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,580
 With that kind of attitude,

483
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:15,060
 this is how we practice Shabbat, right?

484
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:19,580
 Well, you know, let me explain.

485
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:22,060
 In the Old Testament, it's the seventh day of the week.

486
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,260
 In the New Testament, it's the first day of the week,

487
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,780
 Sunday.

488
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:26,900
 Why?

489
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:27,740
 Why?

490
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:32,740
 Because the real work, the real creation is in Jesus Christ.

491
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:36,940
 He rose again from the dead on the third day.

492
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:39,260
 He died on Friday, on the third day, on Sunday,

493
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,740
 the first day of the week.

494
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,020
 That's why in the New Testament,

495
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:45,660
 you always see the phrase, first day of the week.

496
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:48,180
 Jesus rose from the dead.

497
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,420
 First day of the week, they collect offering.

498
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,260
 They worship together.

499
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,620
 First day of the week.

500
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,420
 This is the weekly example.

501
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:59,220
 Now again, I come to church.

502
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,460
 I'm not here just working.

503
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:04,540
 I'm here to enjoy and I am here to get closer to God

504
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:08,180
 because I know this is the time that is sacred.

505
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:10,020
 This is a time that is set apart

506
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:13,940
 from all these other things that I did in the past six days.

507
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:16,620
 It's a sacred time.

508
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,620
 It's a holy time.

509
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:20,300
 Sanctified.

510
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:23,620
 I spend time with God in the worship service.

511
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,700
 So let me suggest to you,

512
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:31,220
 one thing is to adjust your mentality

513
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:34,140
 when you walk into a worship service.

514
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,140
 To stop your work.

515
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,100
 Stop checking your phone.

516
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,500
 Stop thinking about the stock market.

517
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:44,580
 Stop thinking about your career.

518
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,660
 Yeah, I know it's been stressful.

519
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,860
 I know it's been stressful, you know,

520
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,700
 being more than men and women.

521
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:55,420
 There were a lot of things that we wanna do.

522
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:58,780
 And sometimes we treat the Shabbat,

523
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:02,380
 the one day of the week, as our extension.

524
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:06,540
 Oh, for six days I have so much work.

525
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,700
 And then I spill over to the seventh day, right?

526
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:13,500
 Oh, I'd rather not go to observe it.

527
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:17,420
 I want another day to finish my work, right?

528
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:21,780
 I want another day to earn some more money, right?

529
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:24,900
 I want another day to increase my income, right?

530
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,540
 I mean, what other time do I have?

531
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,300
 I have six days of work, right?

532
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,220
 And then the seventh day,

533
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,980
 I better use it for my own purposes, right?

534
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,740
 I wanna earn some money.

535
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:37,740
 Now, Shabbat is a spiritual discipline, right?

536
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:42,740
 Well, ask yourself, when do you have enough money?

537
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:45,180
 When will you have enough money?

538
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,820
 When will you have enough salary?

539
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:49,100
 When?

540
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,140
 How much is enough?

541
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:53,060
 (laughs)

542
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,460
 When is enough is enough?

543
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:59,220
 It's never enough, right?

544
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,220
 You never stop.

545
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:05,820
 So Shabbat is to stop, to cease, cease our work,

546
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:10,820
 and know that God is the God of all.

547
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,740
 He's the God of my finance.

548
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:16,500
 He controls my finance, He controls my money.

549
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,220
 He controls my time, therefore.

550
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:24,380
 And I wanna set this time apart as a sacred time.

551
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,780
 That's a weekly Shabbat.

552
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:29,540
 So let me challenge you, let me invite you.

553
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:33,660
 Come to the worship service with your heart fully prepared,

554
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:39,380
 fully prepared for worship, right?

555
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,380
 Well, learn from our worship team.

556
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:45,460
 They always come early, so much early,

557
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:50,260
 as early as they can in order to prepare, right?

558
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:53,700
 In order to prepare the worship service

559
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,620
 for other people, for all of us.

560
00:29:55,620 --> 00:30:01,620
 We come early because we wanna set apart this time as sacred.

561
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:07,180
 Then secondly, I wanna invite you

562
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:12,020
 to do a little Shabbat every day, a little Shabbat.

563
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:18,300
 Many, many years ago, probably 500 years ago,

564
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:21,900
 there was a guy called Brother Lawrence.

565
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,420
 Now, Brother Lawrence was in Europe at that time,

566
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:29,380
 and he was a monk, a little monk in the monastery.

567
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,580
 The monastery has a lot of people.

568
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,900
 Has a lot of people who wanna be priests

569
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:37,060
 or wanna be pastors in the monasteries.

570
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:39,180
 And Brother Lawrence was working

571
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,780
 in the kitchen of the monastery.

572
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,620
 And he wrote a little book, "In the Presence of God,"

573
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:47,380
 or "Practice the Presence of God."

574
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:51,420
 Now, that little book, he shared his secret

575
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:55,960
 of how to live in the presence of God every day,

576
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,960
 no matter what I do.

577
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,440
 And his secret is, when he was struggling

578
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,820
 with his relationship with God,

579
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:07,740
 he find himself sometimes distant from God himself.

580
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,420
 So he figured out some way to keep himself

581
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,960
 in the presence of God.

582
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,020
 So this is what he did.

583
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:16,700
 Every day he was in the kitchen doing dishes,

584
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,260
 very mundane work.

585
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:23,620
 But he find the secret is, whenever he has time,

586
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,020
 he would do a little prayer.

587
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:28,500
 And that little prayer is very simple.

588
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:32,580
 It's like, "God, I wanna do this for your sake.

589
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:36,540
 "And God, I wanna do it for your honor, and help me."

590
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:39,940
 It's just that simple prayer.

591
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:42,140
 So he start his work in the morning,

592
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:46,680
 pray that prayer.

593
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,240
 And then he find that it's helpful for him

594
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,160
 to be aware that he is doing everything

595
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,860
 and living in the presence of God.

596
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:59,820
 And then he increase it by doing that prayer at noon,

597
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:04,680
 and then in the afternoon.

598
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,400
 And then pretty much it becomes his second nature,

599
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:11,260
 that whenever he does the dishes,

600
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,700
 whenever he mopping the floor,

601
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:16,700
 he will pray to God silently, quietly,

602
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,660
 and pray that, "God, I wanna live in your presence.

603
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,420
 "I wanna do this for your honor."

604
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:24,860
 That book, that secret,

605
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:28,160
 became one of the Christian classics.

606
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,680
 Everyone finds it helpful.

607
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:38,620
 Find rest in every single moment that you can in your day.

608
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,820
 Even when you're driving,

609
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:43,660
 even when you're doing your work,

610
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:46,600
 pray that little prayer,

611
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,840
 and pray that, "God, I wanna live in your presence.

612
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,840
 "Help me to be faithful.

613
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,760
 "Help me to love you more."

614
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,000
 No matter what you do, changing diapers,

615
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,040
 mopping the floor, doing some mundane work,

616
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,780
 you can live in the presence of God.

617
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:06,660
 So I wanna invite you to be more faithful,

618
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:09,220
 to really enjoy this sacred time,

619
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:13,980
 one day a week, first day of week.

620
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:16,300
 It's not just coming here to follow the motions

621
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,360
 and follow the program,

622
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,260
 but you really come to God himself.

623
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:26,380
 And secondly, on your daily basis, around the clock,

624
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,340
 starting tomorrow, Monday,

625
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,160
 do the little prayers.

626
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,240
 Live in the presence of God, right?

627
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,760
 Knowing that God is always there with you.

628
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,880
 Let's all pray together.

629
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,360
 Father, we wanna give you thanks

630
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,200
 for the fact that you are ever-present,

631
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,440
 the fact that you are everywhere.

632
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,760
 You are in the world.

633
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:54,360
 You are especially in our heart.

634
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:58,400
 And thank you, Jesus, for your cross,

635
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:02,340
 for the empty tomb that we can be called

636
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,500
 your sons and daughters.

637
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:08,380
 Now pray that we will learn how to do Shabbat.

638
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:13,580
 We'll learn every single day how to stop

639
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:16,660
 and to think about you, stop and pray to you.

640
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:20,420
 And help us to learn how to worship you,

641
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:26,380
 one day a week, to cease our works of the six days

642
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,220
 and to draw closer to you.

643
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:33,660
 And I pray that we wanna give you thanks

644
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:38,620
 for such a rhythm that you have set up in our life

645
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:42,420
 so that we will run in your order,

646
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,620
 we'll follow your order.

647
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:47,620
 And God, be with us and be present with us

648
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:52,260
 so that we'll grow in our relationship with you.

649
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,580
 In Christ's name we pray, amen.

650
00:34:56,380 --> 00:35:00,140
 Well, I'll see you next week, the next Shabbat.
