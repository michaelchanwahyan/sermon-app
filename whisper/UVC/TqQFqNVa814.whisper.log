[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920]   - Thanks, Kelly.
[00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.300]   Well, why don't we say hi to your neighbors?
[00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.600]   I know some of us are out of town
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.960]   and cannot be here this week,
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.640]   and there are people who have gotten
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.880]   to some minor or major car accident
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.720]   in the past week or two,
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.060]   and our prayers go out to them
[00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.320]   and to continue to pray for them,
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.360]   especially Phoebe.
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.680]   Phoebe's still on break
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.720]   because of the serious car accident.
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.280]   She's fine, but she does need more time
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.740]   to recuperate, all right?
[00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.580]   So let's keep praying for them
[00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.920]   and praying for our church ministry.
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.160]   Today, we are going to finish our series
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.680]   on atomic wisdom, okay?
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.520]   Atomic wisdom.
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.840]   This is part three, okay?
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.640]   Let me move this around.
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.480]   Part three.
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.980]   What we are doing is that we take
[00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.360]   one of the best seller out there,
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.400]   and the book is called "Atomic Habits," all right?
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.040]   Some of you might have heard of this book,
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.440]   "Atomic Habits."
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.240]   It's a very popular book.
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.440]   It talks about behavioral psychology.
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.480]   It talks about how we build good habits,
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.440]   and we ask the question,
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.400]   what kind of conditions are necessary for life change?
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.240]   What kind of conditions are necessary
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.200]   for the probability of achieving your goal?
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.160]   In the new year, some of us might have some new goals, right?
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.360]   You may have new goals to be on diet
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.300]   or do more exercise or be more healthy,
[00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.360]   something like that.
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.240]   We try to draw insight from this book
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.880]   called "Atomic Habits,"
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.280]   and it's already translated into different language,
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.560]   Chinese included,
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.480]   and it draws so much insight from behavioral psychology
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.220]   and trying to help us to set up a system,
[00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.800]   how to set up our life in general
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.540]   to have good habit, to have healthy habit,
[00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.300]   and we wanna combine this so-called secular insights
[00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.340]   into biblical wisdom,
[00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.100]   and that is on the right, the book of Proverbs,
[00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.260]   and if you wanna find the book of Proverbs in the Bible,
[00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.060]   it's right in the middle after the book of Psalms.
[00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.620]   The book of Proverbs is the part of the wisdom literature,
[00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.580]   and this is part three,
[00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.860]   so we're going to reveal what are the principle
[00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.660]   that are necessary for life change,
[00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.340]   and number one, we talk about 1% power, right?
[00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.060]   Remember, if you do a tiny change every day
[00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.300]   after a whole year of 360-some days,
[00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.260]   you will receive or you will achieve your goal
[00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.260]   in 30-some fold multiplication,
[00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.380]   and do not estimate the tiny power
[00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.380]   of every tiny change that you do every single day,
[00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.580]   and principle number two is incentives
[00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.780]   or disincentives are effective,
[00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.260]   incentives and disincentives.
[00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.720]   If you set up some goal in your life,
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.540]   for our church, for our fellowship,
[00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.160]   probably we're gonna read the Bible a little bit more,
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.240]   or we wanna pray more,
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.660]   we wanna build up some of the good habits,
[00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.820]   and we do need to set up some incentives and disincentives,
[00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.660]   but tell you the truth.
[00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.940]   I finished this series in the 10 o'clock service,
[00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.560]   and after the part three, after this one,
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.540]   a brother came up to me, and he said,
[00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:30.460]   thank you for your message,
[00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.020]   thank you for encouraging us to set up a good habit,
[00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:38.020]   good life, and he pulled out an envelope from his pocket
[00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:43.820]   and gave me $50, because he heard the first part of message,
[00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.860]   and he wanna build up some good habit,
[00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.740]   and he wants to have some incentive
[00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.100]   or disincentive in his life,
[00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.220]   so he was encouraged by the message, by the insight,
[00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.420]   and he built up some good habit,
[00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.340]   and after part three of the series,
[00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.300]   he came up to me and gave me $50, yeah,
[00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.260]   praise God, right, praise God, $50.
[00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.760]   Anyways, so you have to think about life changing,
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.700]   it's necessary to have some benefits, some incentives,
[00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.420]   right, you go to the gym, you get some incentive,
[00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.340]   and you're gonna praise yourself,
[00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.540]   or you wanna uplift yourself,
[00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.540]   so you have system with incentive or disincentives.
[00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.460]   Number three is specifics are better than generals, right,
[00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.820]   set up a goal, set up a system,
[00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.700]   which is as specific as possible.
[00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.700]   Number four is that our community is important,
[00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.300]   because the people that we hang out with,
[00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.420]   the people that we see a lot,
[00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.340]   will have influence on us, so the community is important.
[00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:54.340]   Number five is the power of default, default, all right,
[00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.580]   so you set up your habit, and you say,
[00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.380]   this is the priority, and this is the default of my life.
[00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.140]   Every single morning, what are your defaults?
[00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:09.420]   You wake up, and you brush your teeth,
[00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:13.180]   wash your face, right, these are your default, right,
[00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.620]   so in order to have good habit in our life,
[00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.180]   you have to have, you have to understand
[00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.020]   the power of default, the effect of default, all right,
[00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:28.020]   so the assumption to make this habit possible.
[00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.420]   Number six is making it personal, all right,
[00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:34.420]   making it personal, either you find a friend
[00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.220]   who is keeping you accountable,
[00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:41.100]   making it personal will make it even more possible
[00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.020]   to have your new habit set up.
[00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.700]   So number seven now, number seven
[00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.340]   is the power of environment, all right,
[00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:52.400]   so you need to understand, if you want your life to change,
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.900]   or you want a kid's life change,
[00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.980]   we need to set up a good environment, good environment,
[00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.460]   the physical environment have so much impact on us,
[00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.320]   all the people around us, all right.
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.540]   Many, many years ago, many years ago,
[00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:11.020]   many, many years ago, I used to have a TV in my bedroom,
[00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.460]   a TV in my bedroom, somebody gave me a TV, right,
[00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.700]   so I said, where should I put it?
[00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.500]   I put it in my bedroom, right,
[00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.200]   you think it's a good environment?
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:26.340]   No, right, no, it was so bad, it was so bad,
[00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:30.180]   so I took it off, right, because when we had the TV
[00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:35.060]   in the bedroom, you know, it disrupt my sleep, right,
[00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.900]   and my kids, when they were so much younger,
[00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.140]   they come into my bedroom all the time,
[00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:43.420]   because they wanna watch TV, or lying on the bed, you know,
[00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:48.180]   so I remove it, because it was a bad environmental setup.
[00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:52.600]   So behavioral psychology here, study finds that
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.180]   how people maintain a diet,
[00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.200]   how people maintain a good diet.
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:03.580]   As you know, in the United States, we eat too much, right,
[00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.300]   we have so much to eat, we have so much to eat,
[00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.220]   we always eat too much.
[00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:13.700]   Well, study finds that it is simple to maintain a diet,
[00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:18.100]   to eat a little bit less, and the method is very simple.
[00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:22.340]   You make a habit before you have a meal,
[00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:25.860]   you drink two glasses of water, right,
[00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.020]   you drink two glasses of water,
[00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:30.200]   then you will eat a little bit less, right,
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.220]   that makes sense, right?
[00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:36.420]   Many, many years ago, when my kids were still so much younger,
[00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:37.940]   five year old, six year old, you know,
[00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:42.700]   sometimes we, in Chicago, we drive all the way to Toronto,
[00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:45.580]   right, to have some good Chinese food, right, yeah.
[00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:47.140]   Here, the Chinese food is fine too,
[00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:48.340]   but you know, you go in Toronto,
[00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:50.300]   you got so much better, right?
[00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:55.300]   So many years ago, we go to Toronto for family trip,
[00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:58.820]   because the kids were so young,
[00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:03.760]   they did not know how to appreciate good food, right?
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.260]   The expensive food, they don't know how to appreciate it.
[00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.300]   So we, as good parents, we bring the kids first
[00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:13.180]   to the bakery, so we buy them a bun or so,
[00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:15.220]   and fill up their stomach,
[00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:17.580]   and then we go to a good restaurant, right?
[00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:20.180]   So we adults can enjoy it, right?
[00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:24.060]   That sounds like a very, very good insightful wisdom, right?
[00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:25.660]   We save a lot of money, right?
[00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:28.460]   Because we only buy good food for ourselves, right?
[00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:29.820]   Because they don't know how to appreciate it,
[00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:32.180]   why spend the money on them, right?
[00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:37.180]   So, the study finds that if your stomach
[00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:41.940]   is a little bit full, then you go to the meal,
[00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:46.940]   then there's a bigger chance for you to maintain a good diet.
[00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:52.020]   And the flip side is telling us that new habit,
[00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:54.380]   you have to make it easy and natural.
[00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:57.900]   And there are some behavioral psychological study
[00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:02.900]   done for cafeteria of a hospital in Boston.
[00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:05.460]   And the study is trying to find out
[00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:09.940]   how to encourage the staff to get healthy food
[00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:11.620]   in the cafeteria.
[00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:14.340]   And the plan is very simple,
[00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:18.380]   is to change the layout of the cafeteria.
[00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:21.220]   Change the layout of the cafeteria.
[00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:26.060]   Simply by changing the layout, you get so much effect.
[00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:30.820]   Now, the layout change has to do with bottled water
[00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:34.060]   being put at the entrance of the cafeteria.
[00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:37.220]   And fountain drink, where do you put it?
[00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:39.380]   You put it all the way back, right?
[00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:42.120]   Make it difficult for you to get fountain drink, soda.
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:45.580]   So, after three months, the study finds
[00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:50.580]   that water consumption increases 25.8%,
[00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:56.020]   and soda consumption drops by 11.4%.
[00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:58.060]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.420]   It's the same way.
[00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:05.420]   I mean, many of you go to office and work in the office.
[00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:10.140]   Sometimes you find office cafeteria layout intentionally
[00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:13.060]   to discourage you to get snack food.
[00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:18.180]   Snack bowl or candy bowl or junk food
[00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:20.560]   is being placed in the breakout room.
[00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:25.780]   And then the healthy food or water is being put
[00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:29.260]   on some place where it's convenient.
[00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.540]   What goes wrong in the last few years
[00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:34.140]   is that people working from home now, right?
[00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:36.460]   And that is bad, right?
[00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:37.300]   That is bad.
[00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:40.760]   Because in the pandemics, everybody works from home,
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:43.880]   works at home, and there's a huge temptation, right?
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.940]   You work from home, right?
[00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:49.600]   With your computer, and kitchen is right next to you,
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.760]   and you get hungry, right?
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:56.020]   You get boring, and then you go to find some potato chips
[00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:58.480]   or some snack food, right?
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.480]   And that is unhealthy.
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.640]   And actually, the biblical wisdom has so much to say
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.640]   about our environment, especially about the people
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.020]   that we hang out with.
[00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:10.080]   They have effect on us.
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.080]   Proverbs 27, 17.
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.920]   27, 17.
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:19.320]   It says, "As iron sharpens iron,
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.500]   "as one man sharpens the face of his friend."
[00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:27.760]   It says, "If you surround yourself with good friends."
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:30.220]   Now, in the immediate context of chapter 27,
[00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:32.560]   it talks about bad relationships.
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:37.040]   So 15 or 14, verse 13, talk about bad relationship,
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.080]   bad community.
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:41.440]   It will have a negative effect on your life.
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:46.440]   But here in verse 17, the wise teacher is telling you,
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:50.360]   if you surround yourself with good and spiritual people,
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:52.620]   you will grow, you will grow.
[00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:56.260]   If not, your life will decline.
[00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.040]   You will slowly drift away from God.
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:02.840]   You will slowly drift away from the fear of the Lord.
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:07.720]   And it tells you, nobody can be a Christian alone, right?
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.200]   No one's an island.
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.960]   Everyone is connected, and that's why you need to belong
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:15.600]   to a spiritual community, a home church.
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:16.560]   And that is important.
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:21.560]   You cannot do Christian from home, all by yourself, right?
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:26.880]   And the biblical language for Hebrew is very interesting,
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:33.080]   because in Hebrew, here it tells you a piece of iron
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:38.240]   sharpening another piece of iron, right?
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:41.480]   And slowly, you will increase the value
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:44.720]   of both pieces of iron, right?
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:48.360]   The iron, one piece by itself, it has value.
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:53.260]   However, if you rub it with another piece of iron,
[00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:57.760]   both of them will get sharpened and becomes a knife, right?
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:01.200]   It becomes a knife or some tool,
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:05.800]   and the value of the piece of iron will increase.
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:08.180]   And what it said about, the funny thing about Hebrew
[00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:13.180]   is that in Hebrew, the word faith, faith,
[00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:18.320]   is actually used to describe the blade of a knife.
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:23.300]   The blade of the knife is actually the face of the knife.
[00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:27.460]   So the wise teacher is saying, as iron sharpening iron,
[00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:32.420]   as one friend sharpens the blade of the other friend,
[00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:34.440]   the face of the other friend.
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.960]   So no one can be a Christian alone.
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:40.080]   You need to plug in to some sort of community
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.520]   or small group or some local church
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:45.200]   in order for you to grow spiritually,
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.080]   to grow your relationship with God.
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:50.300]   So that is the power of environment.
[00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:55.520]   Principle number eight is habit bundling or habit stacking.
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:59.400]   Now what the psychologist is telling us
[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:03.640]   is that if you wanna build some new habit,
[00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:08.640]   you need to tie the new habit to some established habits.
[00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:12.480]   Some habits that you are doing like your second nature.
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:15.420]   How many of you drive a stick shift?
[00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:18.180]   How many of you drive a stick shift?
[00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:21.380]   There you go, all right, here's the man.
[00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:25.740]   I drive a stick shift for so many years.
[00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:30.540]   So even today, I get into a car,
[00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:33.220]   my left foot will do something.
[00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:35.060]   I will try to find the clutch.
[00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:35.880]   And then there are times,
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:39.200]   because I have automatic transmission car as well,
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.880]   so sometimes I jump into the car
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.320]   and then try to find the clutch.
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:44.720]   There's no clutch there, right?
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:48.080]   Because it becomes a second nature for me, right?
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:50.120]   So that's established habit.
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:51.360]   So the psychologist is telling us
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:52.720]   if you wanna build new habit,
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:57.720]   you have to attach it or tie it with some established habit.
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:00.400]   And the easiest way to develop this
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:03.080]   is to think about, okay, established habit,
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:05.940]   and then I wanna add something to my established habit.
[00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:11.640]   Every morning or every night, you brush your teeth.
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:13.740]   When is the best time to floss your teeth?
[00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:16.680]   It's after brushing your teeth, right?
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:22.320]   Brushing your teeth is already an established habit, right?
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.960]   I hope that's true to you.
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.440]   It's established habit.
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:28.640]   It's kind of, you don't have to think about it.
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:31.880]   But if you are not flossing your teeth regularly,
[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:35.000]   the best way, the behavioral psychologist is telling us,
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.840]   is to stack it onto some established habit.
[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:41.080]   If you check the wisdom literature in the Bible,
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:44.200]   it actually talks about stacking,
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:48.040]   something adding to some of the habits
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:50.440]   that you may already have.
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:54.280]   Here, chapter four, verses 20 and following.
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:58.240]   The father is teaching the son to have wisdom.
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:01.960]   So he says, "My son, pay attention to what I say.
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.560]   "Listen closely to my words.
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:06.520]   "Do not let them out of your sight.
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:08.400]   "Keep them within your heart,
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:11.080]   "for they are life to those who find them,
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:14.440]   "and health to a man's whole body.
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:17.480]   "Above all else, guard your heart,
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:20.960]   "for this is the wellspring of life."
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:22.400]   You see the stacking here?
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:26.680]   One of the way you appreciate the book of Proverbs
[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:29.640]   or wisdom literature is that there are short sayings,
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:33.520]   and sometimes one short sayings has two short verses.
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:38.480]   Verse B is stacking on verse A, all right?
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:42.400]   It's like staircase, A and then B, A and then B.
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:44.840]   Sometimes A, B, and C.
[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:48.080]   Here, it says, "My son, pay attention."
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:49.480]   Pay attention.
[00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:52.080]   It's actually a military word.
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:54.480]   It describes soldiers, you know,
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:58.840]   standing, guarding on the top of watchtower.
[00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:03.840]   And what the soldier is doing is actually paying attention,
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:07.800]   paying attention to noise from the enemies.
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:09.880]   Maybe there's approaching army,
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.600]   approaching horses to the city,
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:14.760]   and you pay attention to it.
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:18.040]   So he says, "My son, pay attention to what I say.
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:21.800]   "Listen closely to my words."
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.440]   Pay attention, listen closely.
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:27.480]   Do not let them out of your sight.
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:29.640]   Put it right in front of you.
[00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:33.720]   Keep them within your heart, right?
[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:36.440]   Stacking one on the other.
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:38.040]   Because they are life, right?
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:40.360]   They are the wellspring of life.
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:44.640]   I remember I told you when I was in college,
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:47.760]   I failed the first test of my chemistry class,
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:52.040]   and then the following nine tests, I built a new habit.
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:53.960]   After the lecture, after the class,
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:57.760]   I don't go with my classmates to go out to Starbucks, right,
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:59.080]   to have a good time there.
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.880]   No, I go immediately to the library
[00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:04.200]   and to review the materials.
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:09.200]   And I actually use less time to ace the test.
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:13.920]   All my classmates, they have fun, they have good time, right?
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:17.640]   But at the end, I ace all nine tests.
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:20.720]   And that is habit stacking.
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:24.760]   You stack one new habit to your established habit.
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:28.000]   And that is habit bundling.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   And principle nine is to make your goal attractive.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.040]   Make it as attractive as possible.
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:41.120]   Use different wordings to describe your goal,
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:44.440]   to describe your system, to describe your new habit.
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:49.440]   If you use attractive words, you will tend to change.
[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:55.280]   You go to the gym, you have to do some exercise.
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:58.120]   If in your mind, if in your mind,
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:02.000]   you use some negative description
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   to describe that new habit, you will bound to fail, right?
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.120]   Oh man, I have to go, I have to drag my body to go, right?
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:16.120]   But if you describe your new habit in a nice way,
[00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:19.220]   there is a bigger chance for you to achieve it.
[00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:23.080]   You know, in the United States hotel rooms,
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:28.980]   they are trying to find ways to encourage the customers
[00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:32.260]   to reuse the towel.
[00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.660]   That will save a lot of money, right?
[00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:37.340]   Because sometimes you go to a hotel, you stay there,
[00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:41.580]   and then you use the towel only once or just part of it,
[00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:44.940]   right, and then you throw it on the ground, right?
[00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:49.020]   And then you use, and after that, you use a new towel, right?
[00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:50.220]   And by the end of the day,
[00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:54.360]   you probably use three or four towels, right?
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:57.800]   Which are unnecessary.
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:02.420]   And the hotel manager is trying to do a study.
[00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:05.800]   It says that if you wanna encourage guests
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:10.800]   to reuse their towel, you describe reusing towel
[00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:15.020]   with some good words.
[00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:18.860]   As you can tell here, it says,
[00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:23.860]   dear guests, every day, tons of water, gallons of water,
[00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:29.420]   are used to wash towels that have been only used once.
[00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:35.380]   And this hotel is committed to conserve natural resources,
[00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:37.540]   and this is how you can help, right?
[00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:41.780]   If you put it back on the rack, I'll use it again.
[00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:45.940]   If you throw it on the floor, please exchange it, right?
[00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:50.020]   And the study finds out, because of this wording,
[00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:52.780]   even at the wording, save the planet, right?
[00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:55.020]   You don't have to do anything to save your planet.
[00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:57.020]   You just reuse your towel, right?
[00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:59.220]   It makes you a hero, right?
[00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:04.100]   The study finds that this means it's effective.
[00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:09.540]   And then the end, the result is 75% of the guests
[00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:13.660]   in the hotel, reuse their towel more than once.
[00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:18.020]   Because you describe in such a way to save the planet,
[00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:23.020]   right, we do this together, you establish some social norm
[00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:26.320]   for people to conform to it, right?
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:30.820]   And the wisdom literature has so much to say about this.
[00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:35.820]   It describes wisdom with beautiful, glorious terms.
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:42.360]   Chapter four, wisdom is supreme, therefore get wisdom.
[00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:48.240]   Though it costs all of you, get understanding.
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:52.240]   Esteem wisdom is being personalized as a woman.
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:56.240]   Esteem her and she will exalt you.
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:58.960]   Embrace her, she will honor you.
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:04.980]   It is a garland of grace, it's a crown of splendor.
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:10.480]   If you get wisdom, you get crown of splendor, right?
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:15.960]   Supremely, you know, super positive terms to describe,
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:19.300]   you know, living a life of wisdom in front of God.
[00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:22.720]   Developing our spiritual life,
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:27.140]   developing our close relationship with our God, our creator.
[00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:30.840]   Positive terms, you know, positive effect
[00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:33.680]   of the descriptors that we use.
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:38.680]   Some years ago, there was a famous,
[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:42.900]   a very famous speech therapist.
[00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:47.040]   Her name is Nina Rustin, Nina Rustin.
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:53.040]   She is a British therapist to help children
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:58.000]   how to correct their pronunciation,
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.840]   how to correct their speech.
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:04.840]   And what Nina Rustin does is more than
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:07.520]   the typical therapist will do.
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:10.440]   A typical therapist will correct the pronunciation,
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:13.480]   the saying of how they pronounce terms
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:18.240]   and how they make sound for the children.
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:22.680]   And that is necessary, but Rustin does more than that.
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:26.660]   Rustin call on the whole family of the child
[00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:30.960]   into her office and she assign assignment
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:34.440]   to each of the family members.
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:37.760]   And every family members, she said,
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:40.120]   "You have to do something in your family.
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:44.440]   "And what you do is you have to go home
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:47.440]   "and every single day make it a daily habit
[00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:52.440]   "to praise one of the family members."
[00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:54.000]   To find something specific,
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.640]   to praise one of the family members,
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.600]   maybe your sibling, maybe your parents.
[00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:01.560]   But you find something specific to appreciate,
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:04.520]   to thank, to praise.
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:08.280]   And then the one who is receiving the appreciation
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:12.480]   has to say something to receive it.
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:15.440]   You can't say a typical Asian way, right?
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.880]   No, no, no, no, I'm not good, right?
[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:19.760]   We always pretend to be humble, right?
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:21.060]   This is our Asian culture.
[00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:25.920]   The one who is receiving has to say something
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:28.780]   in positive term.
[00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:31.920]   So for example, mom can say,
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:34.500]   "John, I love how you share with Matthew."
[00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:38.520]   And John cannot refuse it.
[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:41.200]   John has to make it happen as well.
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.840]   John has to say something like,
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:45.800]   "Thanks, I appreciate the compliment.
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:48.120]   "It made me happier, thanks mom."
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:53.760]   And this dialogue has to be a daily habit
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:56.120]   in the whole family.
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:57.760]   And Linda Woodson finds that
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:02.200]   if you wanna improve a child,
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:05.040]   improve her speech,
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:08.880]   you cannot do it alone, right?
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:11.360]   You cannot just fix the child.
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:15.980]   You have to have the entire family get involved.
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:21.520]   And by doing so, the entire family culture has changed.
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:25.560]   We appreciate each other and encourage each other
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:28.480]   and build up the confidence of one another.
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:30.600]   And especially, it will help the child
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:32.800]   who is struggling with speech.
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:37.800]   And what's funny is that right after the therapy,
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:44.320]   not only the child, speech has been corrected.
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:48.840]   The husband and wife relationship has improved.
[00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:51.500]   And they come back to Linda Woodson and say,
[00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:53.920]   "Thank you, thank you for improving our marriage
[00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:55.000]   "and our family."
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.120]   So that is the principle.
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:59.880]   It is common sense, right?
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:04.400]   But to make our goal, to make the system attractive,
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:07.840]   make it positive, will increase the possibility
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:09.980]   of achieving our goal.
[00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:11.560]   The last principle, number 10.
[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:16.080]   It is to establish system, not goal.
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:22.560]   Think about not goal, but the system achieving the goal.
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:26.720]   It's not the end that you most concerned about.
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:31.040]   It's the means to the end that is most important.
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:36.040]   So here I want to quote a long quote from Atomic Habits.
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:40.920]   And I only have the Chinese, but what it says is that,
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:45.920]   goal and results are not so much important.
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:47.760]   Why?
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:52.760]   Because he gives the example of Olympic athletes.
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:57.960]   All the Olympic athletes are trying to get the goal, right?
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:01.480]   Every one of them has the same goal, to win,
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:02.720]   to get the goal.
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:07.620]   So what is the difference between a winner and loser?
[00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:11.520]   The winner has set up a system with tiny habits
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:14.120]   of training himself or herself
[00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:18.520]   in order to get the gold medal, right?
[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:20.480]   That is the only difference.
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:24.240]   The difference is not at the goals that they set.
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:27.440]   It's the system, it's the habits that they have.
[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:31.440]   So all of this interesting, insightful psychology
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:35.040]   is telling us how to build a good life.
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:39.160]   And actually if you find, if you read the book of Proverbs,
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:42.480]   it has so much to say about how we should set up
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:45.760]   a good system in our life, right?
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:49.140]   Now in the book of Proverbs, the first nine chapters,
[00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:51.680]   first nine long chapters,
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:54.560]   are the introduction of the whole book.
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:56.000]   The introduction of the whole book.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.520]   And this introduction is very interesting.
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:01.140]   It introduced two characters.
[00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:03.760]   The first character we can call lady wisdom,
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:05.800]   or woman wisdom.
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:09.400]   So wisdom is being personified,
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:13.320]   being described as a person, as a lady, as a woman.
[00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:15.740]   And the other character, the second character,
[00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:19.840]   is lady folly, or woman folly.
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:22.960]   That's very interesting because you find wisdom,
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:27.080]   it's like you look for a good wife, right?
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:32.080]   If you reject wisdom, if you love folly or foolishness,
[00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:36.480]   you will find yourself marrying to a wrong woman, right?
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:40.640]   That's very interesting, but if you consider the context,
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:43.540]   you understand why it is being described in such a way.
[00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:49.800]   Because the book of Proverbs is teaching of wisdom
[00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:53.420]   from the father to the son.
[00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:55.440]   When the son is growing up,
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:57.840]   one of the main goals in his life
[00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:01.500]   is to establish a good family, right?
[00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:03.120]   To find a good wife.
[00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:06.440]   So the father is using this means, this metaphor,
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:09.720]   to teach the son what is most important,
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:12.460]   is to find wisdom in God.
[00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:16.220]   In chapter nine, verses one to three,
[00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:18.720]   it says wisdom has built her house,
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:21.700]   he has held out his seven pillars.
[00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:25.520]   The wisdom, or lady wisdom, has prepared her meat
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:27.680]   and mixed with her wine.
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:32.460]   She has also set her big table, big table of good food,
[00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:34.540]   sent out her servant, her mates,
[00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:38.820]   and she calls from the highest point of the city.
[00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:43.260]   Is calling out to the young men, the young people,
[00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:47.100]   to come to her table, come to her house.
[00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:49.140]   She's calling out and yelling out
[00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:51.220]   from the highest point of the city.
[00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:56.220]   That is what the lady wisdom is trying to say.
[00:29:56.540 --> 00:30:00.640]   And then also, the lady folly has so much to say,
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:03.140]   and what she said is actually similar
[00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:06.400]   to what wisdom wants to say.
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:10.020]   Chapter nine, verses 13 to 14.
[00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:13.060]   The woman folly is loud,
[00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:15.660]   she's undisciplined, without knowledge.
[00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:18.980]   She sits at the door of her house,
[00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:20.700]   again prepare a table,
[00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:25.700]   on the seat at the highest point of the city.
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:28.620]   So the lady wisdom is calling out
[00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:29.760]   from the highest point of the city,
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:32.080]   and then the lady folly is calling out
[00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:34.380]   from the highest point of the city.
[00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:36.200]   And what's interesting about this phrase,
[00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:37.980]   at the highest point of the city,
[00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:40.240]   is at the top of the mountain.
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:44.120]   Now in the biblical culture,
[00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:46.580]   when you see a mountain,
[00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:49.480]   mountain top,
[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:53.500]   you usually think of the temple,
[00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:59.060]   because all the temples are built on the Acropolis,
[00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:00.700]   the highest point of the city.
[00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:04.920]   So here lady wisdom at the highest point of the city,
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:07.780]   calling out to those who need wisdom,
[00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:11.860]   and the lady folly also calling out from the same place,
[00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:13.740]   from the highest point of the city.
[00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:14.740]   What does it mean?
[00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:19.080]   It means wisdom is not just secular,
[00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:23.020]   self-improvement pieces of advice.
[00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:27.340]   Wisdom is actually God himself, right?
[00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:29.780]   God is calling out from the highest point of the city
[00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:31.940]   to his temple, his house,
[00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:36.580]   to invite us to build relationship with him, right?
[00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:39.260]   But at the same time, the false gods,
[00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:41.180]   the gods of the culture,
[00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:43.260]   the gods out there, the false gods,
[00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:45.560]   are also calling out from the same place,
[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:46.740]   from their temples,
[00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:52.280]   to entice people or to tempt people to follow them.
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:55.680]   So if you come to this point,
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:58.000]   you understand the book of Proverbs
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.400]   is not just talking about self-improvement strategies.
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:04.400]   It's not just being better.
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:07.600]   It's not just becoming a better man or woman.
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:09.160]   It's actually about worship,
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:13.000]   about your relationship with God.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.280]   Remember the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:21.200]   The fear of the Lord is the proper relationship
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:23.680]   between you and God is the beginning,
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:25.800]   is the foundation of wisdom.
[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:29.720]   So it's not just talking about self-improvement.
[00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:34.100]   It's talking about us worshiping the right God,
[00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:35.020]   the true God.
[00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:39.500]   So I hope that we will end this series
[00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:41.760]   by this appeal,
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:45.920]   that God is calling you from his temple,
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:47.640]   from his dwelling place,
[00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:52.240]   to invite you to build a right relationship with him.
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:55.640]   And the good news we have from the Bible
[00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:58.640]   is that we, as sinners,
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:03.640]   we are being prepared for the salvation of Christ.
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:08.720]   And Jesus came in our place,
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:10.200]   in the place of sinner,
[00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:13.740]   to die for us, to sacrifice himself for us on the cross,
[00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:16.320]   in order to bring us back and redeem us
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:19.480]   so that we can be the children of God.
[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:23.340]   And I hope that this will be true to each and every one of us
[00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:27.140]   that we will build on the beginning of wisdom
[00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:30.680]   to get to know God in Christ.
[00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:32.920]   Everyone who has accepted Jesus Christ
[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:37.120]   as his personal savior and the Lord of his life
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:41.120]   will be related to God,
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:43.800]   totally forgiven,
[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:47.520]   and stand righteous in front of the Holy God.
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:49.640]   And that is the beginning of wisdom.
[00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:52.840]   And I hope that this will be your decision today
[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:55.200]   to get to know God in Jesus Christ,
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:58.080]   and you will begin a life of wisdom.
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:33:59.080]   Let's pray together.
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:05.440]   Father, we love you because you came to save us.
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:09.440]   You came to redeem us in Christ Jesus.
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:12.120]   Thank you for the way of wisdom
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:16.600]   that is laid before us.
[00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:19.360]   Thank you for bringing us back to you.
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:25.320]   And our Lord Jesus is the way, the truth, and life.
[00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:29.660]   So we come and approach you without fear,
[00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:32.040]   approach you afloat,
[00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:34.520]   fearlessly,
[00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:39.080]   all because Jesus Christ has done so much for us,
[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:42.480]   forgiving our sins and accepting us just as we are.
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:45.680]   Thank you for what Jesus has done for us
[00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:49.360]   to die on the cross, die for our sin,
[00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:50.640]   so that we can live.
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:56.520]   And thank you for inviting us into your relationship.
[00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:59.400]   And I pray that each and every one of us
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:04.020]   will begin with our relationship with you,
[00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:07.600]   to invite Jesus to be our savior,
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:09.720]   that we can call you as our father.
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:13.760]   Thank you, and make us new.
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:16.920]   Help us to build new habit of wisdom,
[00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:20.200]   to live wisely,
[00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:23.560]   to live in the fear of you,
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:27.580]   and to live wisely, to walk wisely,
[00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:29.240]   to bring glory to you.
[00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:31.300]   In Christ's name, we pray.
[00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:33.600]   Well, God bless you all,
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:35.860]   and I hope to see you next week,
[00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:38.040]   and we continue to worship our God.
[00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.800]   Stay behind for our lunch,
[00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:42.520]   and after our lunch, around one o'clock,
[00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:45.240]   we will split into different groups for Bible study,
[00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:48.080]   and we'll continue to study the Gospel of Mark.
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:49.120]   All right, God bless.
