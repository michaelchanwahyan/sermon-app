[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400]   email, so yeah.
[00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:05.560]   So today we have Pastor Mark to give us a message today.
[00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.400]   - Hey guys, we are starting a new series,
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.320]   and this series I want to connect the Bible and the land.
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.360]   Now you have heard me saying the Bible
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.040]   is not written to us, right?
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.020]   It's written for us, alright?
[00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.160]   Now why do I say that?
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.000]   Why do I say that?
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.120]   Because indeed the Bible was an ancient document,
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.120]   and it's not directly written to us,
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.500]   but it's written for us.
[00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.400]   That's why we need to understand the Bible
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.040]   in its own context.
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.240]   So I want to connect the Bible and the land.
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.160]   Sometimes we read the Bible, we read scripture,
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.760]   without the context, without the background.
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.300]   And that's why we miss so much of the nuance
[00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.840]   of what the word of God will say.
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.240]   So I would like to explore the whole land with you,
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.080]   at least virtually, virtually we can do that,
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.840]   and think about some of the Bible passages,
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.180]   some of the words of God.
[00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.360]   And today we are going to a place called Hezekiah Tunnel.
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.900]   Hezekiah Tunnel.
[00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.500]   And one of those passages that mention this tunnel
[00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.020]   is found in the book of 2 Kings, chapter 20, verse 20.
[00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.420]   Let me read that first.
[00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.420]   The rest of the events, the account in Hezekiah's reign,
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.840]   including the extent of his power and how he built a pool
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.980]   and dug a tunnel to bring water into the city
[00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.660]   are recorded in the book of the history
[00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.340]   of the Kings of Judah.
[00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.340]   Hezekiah died and his son Manasseh became the next king.
[00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.500]   That is toward the end of the kingly account
[00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.460]   or royal record of King Hezekiah.
[00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.420]   Now he's a good guy, and that's why we want to spend
[00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.420]   some time with what he did and what it means to us today.
[00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.560]   There are three points I want to go through.
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.620]   The first one is to understand who Hezekiah is
[00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.840]   and the record of his reign.
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.120]   That's the first part.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.800]   The second part is the importance of faith
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.080]   from a biblical perspective.
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.480]   And third point is the call for stewardship,
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.600]   biblical stewardship.
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.320]   Now first one is the record of Hezekiah.
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.320]   Now if you read 1 and 2 Kings, it's original one book,
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.400]   it records king after king what they did
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.440]   and sort of a political history, sort of a political book,
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.300]   talking about the kingdoms, right?
[00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.880]   Remember David, well Saul was the first king,
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.060]   and then David and then Solomon,
[00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.060]   and then the United Kingdom under these three kings
[00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.600]   crumble after Solomon.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.660]   And then it was split into North and South, right?
[00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.800]   The Northern Kingdom is called Israel.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.560]   The Southern Kingdom is called Judah.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.080]   So then they parallel and develop,
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.920]   and there are so many different kings
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.960]   in the Northern Kingdom and the Southern Kingdom.
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.200]   And 1 and 2 Kings are tracing the political history
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.440]   of what happened to the people of God in those days.
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.700]   So there were about 19 kings in the Northern nation
[00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.420]   of Israel, 19 kings, and all of them,
[00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.340]   all 19 of them are bad guys.
[00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:33.400]   And then the Southern Kingdom had about 20 kings,
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.480]   only eight of them are good guys,
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.300]   and all the rest of them are bad guys.
[00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.660]   Now this scripture, this passage that I just read
[00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.520]   is the conclusion of Hezekiah's reign.
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.980]   Now the Bible in 1 and 2 Kings
[00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.820]   spend about three chapters, long chapters,
[00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.980]   to record what is important in the political history
[00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.880]   of King Hezekiah.
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.660]   And this is toward the very, very end,
[00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.420]   the last couple of verses.
[00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:05.480]   He said what?
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.860]   "The rest of the event in the reign of Hezekiah,
[00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.880]   "including the extent of his power,
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.460]   "and how he built a water pool
[00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.380]   "and dug a water tunnel to bring water into the city,
[00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.080]   "are recorded in the book of the history
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.980]   "of the kings of Judah.
[00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.440]   "And then he died, and his son became the next king."
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.720]   Now what happened in the reign of Hezekiah
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.880]   was that he had a big problem,
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.180]   and the problem is called Assyrian problem.
[00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.880]   Now if you know, imagine a big map,
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.960]   the Middle East, the Near East.
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.120]   Right at your upper right-hand corner
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.980]   is the big guy, the Assyrian Empire,
[00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.620]   with mighty military power.
[00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.080]   And they're expanding to the west.
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.600]   Expanding to the west,
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.660]   and the ultimate goal is to conquer Egypt.
[00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.800]   In order for Assyrian Empire to conquer Egypt,
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.700]   he has to pass through one land bridge,
[00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.480]   the only land bridge of the world.
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.140]   It's the land of King.
[00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.440]   That's where Hezekiah was, Jerusalem was there.
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.740]   Israel, Palestine.
[00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.020]   It's the land bridge for all three big continents, right?
[00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.200]   Europe, Asia Minor, and then Africa, and then Asia.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.240]   Now he had to pass through the land of Kingdom
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.440]   in order to go to his ultimate destination,
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.840]   which is Egypt, right?
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.180]   So he had to pass through that land,
[00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.600]   but if the local kings in the Middle East
[00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.020]   if the local kings in the land bridge
[00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:48.980]   obey him and follow the empire of Assyria,
[00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:50.440]   then you're okay, right?
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.540]   You just pay more taxes, right?
[00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.980]   If you rebel against the Assyrian Empire,
[00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.300]   the Assyrian Kingdom, the military might
[00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.340]   will come down upon you and will crush you.
[00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:08.140]   Now in those days, the military strategy
[00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:13.140]   for conquering a city is to lay siege around the city.
[00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:16.000]   You know what lay siege around the city is?
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.320]   They surround the whole city,
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:23.980]   and then they trap you inside the city wall, right?
[00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:28.220]   And then until you, staff you to death
[00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.080]   or thirst you to death, right?
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.940]   You can't come out, you can't go in, right?
[00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:37.940]   And that's what Assyrian military is trying to do.
[00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:40.780]   To Hezekiah in Jerusalem.
[00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.540]   So what Hezekiah did was he tried to block
[00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:49.540]   all this small water sources,
[00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:53.680]   all of this mountain spring, small springs,
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.620]   around the city of Jerusalem in the hill country.
[00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.680]   And then he shut himself into his own city.
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:05.680]   And Hezekiah's strategy is so that the city
[00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:11.100]   is prepared for the siege with enough food and enough water
[00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:16.100]   so that the Assyrian soldiers surrounding Jerusalem,
[00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:19.500]   hopefully they will get tired
[00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.140]   and then they will go back home, right?
[00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:26.060]   So as long as you make sure you are sustainable,
[00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:29.340]   the city is sustainable, then you're okay.
[00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:32.040]   And that is the strategy of Hezekiah.
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.100]   I think that's the only way, right?
[00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.200]   'Cause you cannot stand against a monster, right?
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.920]   You gotta prepare yourself.
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.340]   So that's what Hezekiah did.
[00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:45.340]   He built a new water tunnel to bring water into the city.
[00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:48.660]   Now back in those days, usually when you need to get water,
[00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:53.420]   you had to go outside of the city wall to the valley.
[00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:55.780]   'Cause usually the spring is in the valley, right?
[00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:58.220]   It's outside the city wall and then you come back, right?
[00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:00.820]   In time of peace, you're okay, right?
[00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:03.500]   You pass through city gate two times a day,
[00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:04.740]   go out and go in.
[00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:07.220]   You get enough water, you come back.
[00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:10.860]   But in times of war, you cannot do that.
[00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:12.680]   That's what Hezekiah did.
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:16.740]   He tried to block all this little water springs
[00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:21.740]   in Jerusalem area and then shut himself into his own capital
[00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:27.740]   and built a new plumbing to bring water into the city
[00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:32.180]   so that they can sustain the Assyrian siege.
[00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:33.540]   Now I have three minute video.
[00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:36.260]   I wanna show you what this tunnel is like.
[00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:41.260]   Now as I said, the background of the Bible,
[00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:46.000]   the context of Bible is very concrete.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.060]   You can actually walk it.
[00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:50.580]   You can actually see it and touch it.
[00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:52.620]   So Hezekiah tunnel is one of them.
[00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:54.860]   Let me try to show you the three minute video.
[00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:57.860]   (crowd chattering)
[00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:02.760]   - My right is Gihon Springs.
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:07.060]   Gihon Springs right here.
[00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:10.980]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:23.140]   - Oh, so cold.
[00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:26.060]   (crowd chattering)
[00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:29.980]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:34.500]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:37.420]   (crowd chattering)
[00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:41.340]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:45.260]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.180]   (crowd chattering)
[00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:52.940]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:55.860]   (crowd chattering)
[00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:59.780]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:21.180]   - This is the Hezekiah tunnel
[00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:22.500]   and we are walking through it
[00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:26.540]   and we are using a 360 camera
[00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:29.340]   so that you can see the environment.
[00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:33.020]   And this is a man-made tunnel, 2,000 feet long
[00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:35.860]   and done by two different teams.
[00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:39.340]   And one team starting from the spring,
[00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:40.900]   from the origin of the water.
[00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:45.580]   And the other team is coming from the port of Siloam,
[00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:47.700]   south of the city of David.
[00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:50.940]   And two teams listening to one another
[00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:55.620]   and they are built through the mountain.
[00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:59.340]   And as you can see, the size of the tunnel is a body.
[00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:02.660]   And they dig and dig and dig
[00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:06.020]   and they listen to each other and the noise of the digging.
[00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:07.940]   And they try to meet together.
[00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:12.940]   And at the end of the engineering project,
[00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:15.500]   two teams did meet together.
[00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:17.100]   And it was a celebration.
[00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:21.140]   And the water tunnel is through
[00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:23.100]   and the water from the Gihon Strait
[00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:26.380]   can go down to the south of the city of David
[00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:29.380]   so that people can get the water
[00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:32.380]   without going out of the city wall.
[00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:37.700]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:40.700]   (people chattering)
[00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:48.100]   - Sorry about that.
[00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:49.500]   This is my bad.
[00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:52.180]   And now, the tunnel is too long.
[00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:56.940]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:59.940]   (people chattering)
[00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:02.940]   (people chattering)
[00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:07.460]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:16.060]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:28.260]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:32.780]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:57.260]   - Well, it is very interesting, right?
[00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:58.700]   You can actually walk the tunnel
[00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:00.060]   that is recorded in the Bible.
[00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:02.980]   And especially you have a 360 camera.
[00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:05.300]   And thanks to Hale for lending the camera.
[00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.820]   I think in the YouTube world,
[00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:12.140]   we are the first one recording the tunnel
[00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:13.860]   using a 360 camera.
[00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:15.260]   Yeah, praise God.
[00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.340]   Anyways, makes you wanna go, right?
[00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:18.620]   Makes you wanna go.
[00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:21.340]   It spent about 40 minutes to walk the entire tunnel.
[00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:25.380]   Total pitch darkness.
[00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:30.380]   And it was built in Hezekiah time, 700 BC.
[00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:35.900]   That's when Hezekiah had a crisis.
[00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:39.460]   If you see the diagram here,
[00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:41.780]   you see that the Gihon Spring,
[00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:44.300]   which is now flowing,
[00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:47.260]   even now, there are clean water coming out of the mountain
[00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:48.380]   from Gihon Spring.
[00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:50.660]   Gihon Spring is on the right.
[00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:52.060]   You see that blue line?
[00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:55.780]   That blue line, S-shaped, curved blue line
[00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:58.820]   is the line of Hezekiah Tunnel.
[00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:03.260]   I was kind of walking the first third of the tunnel.
[00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.460]   So you start from Gihon Spring on the right.
[00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:10.220]   And then the entire tunnel is about 2,000 feet long.
[00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:13.500]   And you walk the entire thing with a flashlight.
[00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:16.900]   And you went through the tunnel to the end,
[00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:20.220]   and you come out to the open air again,
[00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:21.420]   which is on the left.
[00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:23.300]   The left is Siloam Pool.
[00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:28.300]   Now this is a mighty thing that Hezekiah did in his time.
[00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:31.460]   And let me tell you this.
[00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:34.180]   If you understand a little bit about the background,
[00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:38.700]   you know this tunnel, 2,000 feet long,
[00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:40.300]   a body width, right?
[00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:43.860]   If you're too big in size, you cannot fit in, right?
[00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:45.260]   And good luck to you, right?
[00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:50.700]   And then water flowing from the spring
[00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:54.740]   all the way to the Siloam Pool inside the city.
[00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:56.900]   This water tunnel, this plumbing system
[00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:01.860]   was the greatest achievement in his time
[00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:03.540]   in the entire world.
[00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:06.580]   You go back to 700 BC,
[00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:12.060]   the greatest plumbing system was done by Hezekiah Tunnel.
[00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:13.820]   You can't find it in Rome.
[00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:15.940]   You can't find it in Greece.
[00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:18.940]   You can't find it in Iran or Iraq.
[00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:21.820]   The greatest plumbing system of all time
[00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:25.180]   during Hezekiah's time was found there.
[00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:27.780]   And we were walking through it, right?
[00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:29.580]   The greatest plumbing system.
[00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:30.780]   Probably the plumbing system is better
[00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:32.580]   than those in your homes.
[00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:35.620]   The best plumbing system.
[00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:37.460]   The best achievement.
[00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:38.700]   And because of that,
[00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:43.820]   now one of the questions is why the tunnel was not straight?
[00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:46.700]   Why wasn't it straight?
[00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:47.860]   From left to right,
[00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:52.380]   the shortest distance should be a straight line, right?
[00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:53.740]   Through the mountain, right?
[00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:56.460]   You just hill through the mountain, straight line.
[00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:57.380]   Now what happened was that
[00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:00.420]   because during the Assyrian crisis,
[00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:03.820]   they had to build this plumbing system ASAP,
[00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:05.340]   as soon as possible.
[00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:07.740]   So he divided into two teams of workers.
[00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:09.140]   They're trying to dig from,
[00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:12.500]   one dig from the spring, downhill.
[00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:16.500]   The other team, team B, is digging from the water pool
[00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:21.060]   at, on your lower left, all the way uphill.
[00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:24.580]   And they're trying to hear the noise of digging.
[00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:26.940]   Trying to discern where the other team is.
[00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:28.900]   So they're trying to dig through the mountain.
[00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:33.260]   That's why it's curving around inside the mountain.
[00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.740]   Now this is a great achievement
[00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:38.700]   because, no, you didn't have any GPS, right?
[00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:40.780]   You didn't even have flashlight back then.
[00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:43.260]   You only have oil lamp, right?
[00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:44.940]   You have oil lamp and candle,
[00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:47.340]   and then you have to go through the mountain,
[00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:52.460]   totally dark, and try to hear the noise
[00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:55.820]   so that you can meet together at the midpoint.
[00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:57.060]   You see the midpoint?
[00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:59.140]   They're trying to dig in, you know,
[00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:00.740]   with some excitement, right?
[00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:02.100]   You want to get to work, right?
[00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:03.540]   Because the Assyrians are coming.
[00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:05.340]   Crisis is coming to us.
[00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:06.540]   So they're trying to meet together.
[00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:09.140]   So the middle point is kind of like,
[00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:10.260]   there are some false starts,
[00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:13.820]   there are some false places
[00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:15.860]   they have to correct themselves.
[00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:18.380]   So that's why the tunnel is not straight.
[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:22.340]   And then toward the end, there is an inscription.
[00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:25.260]   About 150 years ago, there's a high school boy
[00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:28.900]   who skipped school that day, 150 years ago.
[00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:31.340]   And then he was swimming in the pool.
[00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:34.380]   And then he started to say to himself,
[00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:37.300]   "Okay, let me go inside the tunnel."
[00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:39.740]   So he swam, swimming, swimming,
[00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:42.340]   and swim a little bit into the tunnel,
[00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:45.780]   about six meters deep inside the tunnel.
[00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:47.140]   And then he slipped.
[00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:51.220]   He drowned a little bit, and then he got up.
[00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:52.740]   And then he wiped his face,
[00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:57.300]   and he saw a stone inscription on the side of the tunnel.
[00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:01.540]   And that inscription can be translated,
[00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:04.940]   and it is kind of, you know,
[00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:07.620]   two feet by one foot,
[00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:11.100]   a stone inscription.
[00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:12.700]   And if you translate it,
[00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:16.660]   what it says is the story of digging through the tunnel.
[00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:18.220]   Let me translate it.
[00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:21.620]   The tunnel, this is the story of the tunnel.
[00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:24.340]   And they are digging against each other
[00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:26.540]   while three cubits was left.
[00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:29.460]   The voice of a man called to his teammate,
[00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:32.980]   his counterpart, and there was a sada,
[00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:34.420]   whatever that is, right?
[00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:36.820]   Probably a crack in the rock.
[00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:38.620]   And on the right and on the left,
[00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:39.860]   on the day of the tunnel,
[00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:42.300]   the stone covers struck each other
[00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:46.300]   toward his counterpart, X against X,
[00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:49.940]   and flow water from the source, the Gihon Spring,
[00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:54.700]   to the port for 1,200 cubits.
[00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:58.340]   It's about 1,900 feet long,
[00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:03.340]   and six cubit high in terms of the height of the tunnel
[00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:05.900]   over the head of the stone covers.
[00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:07.260]   Now, I don't know how to translate
[00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:10.780]   to express the excitement,
[00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:13.260]   because this is a historical record, right?
[00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:15.140]   So all you can do, all I can do,
[00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:18.180]   is add exclamation mark, right?
[00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:19.740]   You add a lot of exclamation mark.
[00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:23.580]   This is the greatest achievement of all time.
[00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:27.580]   It is the water tunnel is being done, right?
[00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:30.340]   So the high school boy who skipped school that day
[00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:33.700]   found this important inscription.
[00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:36.540]   So I guess one of the lesson is it's okay to skip school.
[00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:41.340]   You found something really, really important, right?
[00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:44.620]   Anyways, this is what the Bible recorded.
[00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:49.420]   This is the water tunnel, the greatest achievement of all.
[00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:53.940]   And second king did not fail to mention it.
[00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:55.300]   And that's the first point.
[00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:57.700]   But the second point I want to bring out
[00:19:57.700 --> 00:19:59.700]   is the importance of faith.
[00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:04.140]   Let me try to understand the biblical perspective
[00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:06.060]   on the life of Hezekiah.
[00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:09.580]   And how does the Bible see your life?
[00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:13.500]   How does Bible evaluate your life?
[00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:17.180]   How does the Bible evaluate the reign of Hezekiah?
[00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:22.380]   Let's take a look at this passage again.
[00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:24.340]   2020, second Kings.
[00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:27.740]   The rest of the events in Hezekiah's reign,
[00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:30.180]   including the extent of his power,
[00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:33.020]   how he built this and that water tunnel,
[00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:36.980]   recorded somewhere else in the book of history
[00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:38.340]   of the kings of Judah.
[00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:45.020]   Now this face, the rest of his achievements,
[00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:51.740]   is often repeated throughout the book of first and second Kings
[00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:55.620]   for each king, his political history.
[00:20:55.620 --> 00:21:00.140]   At the end of it, the book of Kings always concludes
[00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:03.620]   the rest of the events of this king or that king.
[00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:08.660]   Now in terms of Hezekiah, the Bible sees,
[00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:13.660]   did record the great achievement, the water tunnel.
[00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:17.900]   Again, it's the best plumbing system in his time
[00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:18.740]   in the world.
[00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:22.060]   However, what is the key word here?
[00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:26.260]   The key word is the rest.
[00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:33.340]   Now if you record, if you are the court historian,
[00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:37.460]   if you're going to write a book on Hezekiah,
[00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:40.380]   what would you spend most of your details
[00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:41.900]   or most of your content on?
[00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:45.800]   You're gonna talk about this tunnel.
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:49.560]   You're gonna talk about the engineering project,
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:52.200]   the water engineering project, right?
[00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:56.020]   Now if you have read some of the political history
[00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:59.380]   or autobiographies of politicians,
[00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:01.780]   you will open the book and you find,
[00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:05.400]   okay, this president or that politician
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:07.860]   has done something great, right?
[00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:12.420]   That's what biography, royal biography does.
[00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:17.420]   To praise a guy or a lady,
[00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:22.000]   how, what great achievement he has done or she has done.
[00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:25.980]   All kinds of autobiographies,
[00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:32.340]   Obama, Hillary Clinton, or whatever big politicians,
[00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:35.260]   when they write their own biography,
[00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:37.020]   when they write their own story,
[00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:40.500]   they would lift up or exalt
[00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:44.060]   the great things they have done.
[00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:47.780]   Here, second Kings has done something totally different.
[00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:51.980]   The greatest project, yeah, I'll mention it,
[00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:54.740]   but it's the rest of the archive.
[00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:56.220]   You can dig it up, right?
[00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:58.640]   I save it on another hard drive, right?
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:00.420]   But you can reshift the data if you want,
[00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:01.760]   if you're interested.
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:04.460]   But I'm not interested in it, right?
[00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:07.500]   It's in the rest of his deeds,
[00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:11.900]   the rest of his achievement is recorded in the other book.
[00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:14.260]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:16.600]   I wanna talk about not his great achievement.
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:20.820]   I wanna talk about something else.
[00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:23.940]   Now, this is the biblical perspective on someone's life.
[00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:26.160]   Think about your life.
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:29.060]   If you're gonna write a book,
[00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:33.260]   a biography of yourself, your history,
[00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:35.580]   what would you put in it?
[00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:38.780]   You probably would think, naturally,
[00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:42.080]   we would think that we'll put our great achievement, right?
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:45.300]   Which school I went to, I went to Harvard,
[00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:47.480]   I went to the best school of the world,
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:49.740]   I got the best education, right?
[00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:54.740]   I graduated with, I don't know, straight A, 4.0, right?
[00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:58.540]   And I went to this company or that company,
[00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:02.300]   Fortune 500 company, I got so much achievement.
[00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:05.800]   And I'm gonna put it in my book, my reign.
[00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:10.540]   But that is not the perspective of the Bible.
[00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:14.340]   The Bible pay attention to something else.
[00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:17.060]   Yeah, you have your own achievement, that's fine.
[00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:19.900]   I'm gonna talk about it in one verse.
[00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:25.340]   The rest of the chapters from 2 Kings 18 to 20,
[00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:28.000]   what does the book of Kings talk about?
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.900]   And think about it.
[00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:32.600]   If you understand the perspective,
[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:37.320]   how would the Bible, how would God sees your life?
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:39.220]   How would God evaluates your life?
[00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:45.220]   The rest of his deeds, mentioned somewhere else.
[00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:47.020]   But what I wanna focus on,
[00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:51.120]   what the Bible wants to emphasize is this.
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:55.460]   At the beginning of Hezekiah's reign, his record,
[00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:58.060]   18 verse three,
[00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:03.660]   Hezekiah did what was pleasing in the Lord's sight.
[00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:06.740]   Just as his ancestor, his father David, had done.
[00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:11.540]   He removed the pagan shrines, smashed the sacred pillars,
[00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:13.340]   and cut down Asherah posts.
[00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:17.620]   Those are the pagan idols across his country.
[00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:20.720]   He broke them and he removed them.
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:24.620]   Hezekiah trust in the Lord God of Israel.
[00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:28.140]   There was no one like him among all the kings of Judah,
[00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:30.420]   either before or after his time.
[00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:33.580]   He remained faithful to the Lord in everything.
[00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:36.740]   And he carefully obey all the commands
[00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:40.500]   of the Lord had given Moses.
[00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:42.260]   So the Lord was with him.
[00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:47.380]   What the Bible sees is his faith,
[00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:52.100]   his spiritual life, his relationship with God.
[00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:58.020]   When things are going right in his life, God walks with him.
[00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:02.180]   When he faces crisis, a Syrian crisis,
[00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:04.700]   or whatever crisis you are facing,
[00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:07.180]   he depend on the Lord, he trust in the Lord.
[00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:11.780]   That goes into the record of first and second kings.
[00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:14.340]   That's what God wants to see.
[00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:16.140]   That's what God want to focus on.
[00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:18.740]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:24.980]   Your construction, your achievements,
[00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:26.860]   maybe they are important.
[00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:28.460]   You know, in Hezekiah's day,
[00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:32.500]   he had to devise some political strategy.
[00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:36.460]   He has to achieve something in order to defend the city.
[00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:38.500]   But at the end of the day, who save him?
[00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:42.060]   Yahweh save him, God save him.
[00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:47.180]   When crisis hits you, you can do all the preparation.
[00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:50.660]   This is part of our faithful stewardship, right?
[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:52.060]   We have to be responsible.
[00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:53.940]   We have to go to a doctor.
[00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:56.420]   We have to find the best medical treatment.
[00:26:56.420 --> 00:27:00.140]   We have to find the best way to manage our lives.
[00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:02.500]   But the end of the day, do not forget
[00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:05.580]   as what happened to Hezekiah.
[00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:09.460]   He did not save himself.
[00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:14.220]   The water tunnel, as mighty as it was, did not save him.
[00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:17.700]   At the end of the day, he went to the temple
[00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:20.580]   and prayed for salvation.
[00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:23.140]   Prayed that God will help him.
[00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:25.700]   And then God help him.
[00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:29.700]   At the end of the day, the credit goes to the creator,
[00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:32.860]   his Lord and savior, no one else.
[00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:35.940]   You see what I mean?
[00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:39.060]   You can manage your life.
[00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:39.900]   You should.
[00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:44.020]   You may have a little bit achievement here and there,
[00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:46.620]   here and there, and maybe those are important.
[00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:51.060]   But when God sees your life, okay,
[00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:53.220]   I put one verse, summarize it.
[00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:57.140]   All your achievement are becoming footnotes.
[00:27:57.140 --> 00:28:01.580]   The main content of your life is your spiritual life.
[00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:04.260]   It's your faith.
[00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:07.460]   Whether you are depending on God in times of crisis,
[00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:12.020]   whether you do not forget God in times of blessing,
[00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:14.260]   it's your relationship with God.
[00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:18.540]   That is all that matters at the end of the day.
[00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:20.660]   That is God's perspective seeing you.
[00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:24.940]   Not how the culture sees you, not how the world sees you,
[00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:26.620]   not how you see yourself.
[00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:29.820]   It's how the Bible sees you.
[00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:36.020]   That brings to my third point, it's the call for stewardship.
[00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:41.700]   God has entrusted us with different things,
[00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:46.580]   resources, time, our money, all kinds of resources
[00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:48.660]   He has entrusted to us.
[00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:53.580]   That's why we have this word, theological word, stewardship.
[00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:57.540]   Comes from an old English word, steward.
[00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:00.820]   A steward is a manager of the house.
[00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:05.300]   To use a modern analogy, it's kind of like a bank manager.
[00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:08.860]   When you go to the bank, you deposit your money
[00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:11.420]   into your bank account.
[00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:14.260]   And the bank is entrusted with your money,
[00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:18.100]   and the bank, hopefully, the bank will faithfully
[00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:21.460]   and wisely manage your money.
[00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:23.420]   In times of need, you go to the bank
[00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:26.100]   and you withdraw some money, right?
[00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:28.820]   It really does not belong to the bank manager.
[00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:32.900]   The bank manager is managing someone else's resource,
[00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:34.740]   your resource.
[00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:38.660]   This is the same way our relationship with God and you.
[00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:43.660]   God entrusts something in you, in your life.
[00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:45.980]   And you're kind of like a bank manager.
[00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:47.540]   You're a steward.
[00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:52.540]   And the only thing required for you is faithfulness.
[00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:57.020]   Whether you're using all the resources as much as possible
[00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:59.420]   to serve God and to worship Him.
[00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:02.660]   That is biblical stewardship.
[00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:04.820]   And do not forget that.
[00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:08.580]   And that's what Hezekiah's story is all about.
[00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:11.140]   Why didn't the Bible, I actually want the Bible
[00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:16.140]   to talk more about the Hezekiah tunnel, right?
[00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:20.780]   I want a whole chapter talking about it.
[00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:25.100]   However, the biblical author did not care.
[00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:27.860]   And think about it.
[00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:30.180]   In the great scheme of things,
[00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:35.180]   God does not really care about your earthly achievement.
[00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:40.060]   What He cares is how you manage it to glorify Him.
[00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:43.440]   How you build your life on the word of God,
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:44.780]   in obedience to Him.
[00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:47.760]   That is what matters at the end of the day.
[00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:54.380]   You are God's steward and trusted with all sorts of things.
[00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:58.220]   How are you managing it?
[00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:03.180]   If God calls you to give an account today,
[00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:07.100]   how would you respond?
[00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:07.940]   Today.
[00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:12.780]   Will God seize your life saying,
[00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:15.060]   "Hey, you are being faithful.
[00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:18.660]   "You're a good and faithful servant.
[00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:20.360]   "And you're coming to my kingdom."
[00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:25.500]   Or maybe God will see you, you are wicked.
[00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:30.020]   You wasted all of my resources.
[00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:32.140]   You are not a faithful manager.
[00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:33.580]   That is biblical stewardship.
[00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:40.100]   I officiate a lot of funerals.
[00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:42.100]   I've served in the pastoral role
[00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:45.900]   for probably close to 30 years.
[00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:49.420]   And I have done so many, so many funerals.
[00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:52.380]   I remember one year, in my early year,
[00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:57.200]   I have to officiate 40 funerals in a year.
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:00.540]   40 funerals.
[00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:03.300]   Sometimes two funerals a week.
[00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:05.540]   Especially in winter time in Chicago.
[00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:08.300]   More people die in the depressing time.
[00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:12.200]   If you go to a funeral, if you go to a funeral,
[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:15.320]   well, I mean, it's not a nice thing to say,
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:17.620]   but you should go to funerals more.
[00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:20.300]   At 10 funerals.
[00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:22.180]   You know why?
[00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:26.500]   Because there's a part in the funeral service,
[00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:29.300]   there's a part called eulogy.
[00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:33.100]   Eulogy means speak good, right?
[00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:34.920]   Speak good, it's a Greek word.
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:37.620]   Speak good of a person, right?
[00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:41.040]   Eulogy is, you know, reciting the history
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:43.320]   or remembering the history of someone,
[00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:46.440]   the deceased family member.
[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:49.300]   All the eulogies I've heard
[00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:56.260]   have nothing to do with the deceased achievements.
[00:32:56.260 --> 00:33:00.820]   Nobody will come up to the podium in the funeral service
[00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:04.300]   and say, "Oh, he got a lot of money, you know what?
[00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:05.700]   "He got a lot of investment.
[00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:08.580]   "He's so great in terms of money.
[00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:12.340]   "Look at how many figures he has in the bank account."
[00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:14.260]   Nobody will say anything like that.
[00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:17.140]   Most of the eulogies will talk about
[00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:18.540]   the character of the person.
[00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:23.060]   How he has been a blessing to other people.
[00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:28.620]   The family, the community, the neighborhood, right?
[00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:31.500]   The church, his spiritual life.
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:36.200]   Most of the things mentioned in the eulogies
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:39.520]   are those things, the spiritual things, so to speak.
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:42.100]   Your relationship with God
[00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:45.100]   and your relationship with other people.
[00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:47.820]   Whether you are walking in the way of God
[00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:52.780]   or you are loving other people just as God loves them
[00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:54.380]   and you try your best to do it,
[00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:57.500]   those are the things going to the account.
[00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:03.060]   Those are the things going to God's record of your life.
[00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:06.220]   Don't lose that focus.
[00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:08.480]   Let's pray.
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:15.420]   Father, we wanna build our lives on your grace
[00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:16.980]   and thank you for calling us.
[00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:21.460]   Thank you for entrusting so many wonderful,
[00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:23.140]   great things in our lives.
[00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:26.100]   Yes, we do have some achievements.
[00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:31.760]   We exert great efforts in building our lives,
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:34.260]   but we pause right now
[00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:41.220]   and ask you to help us see our lives in your perspective,
[00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:48.340]   to evaluate all our doings, all our efforts
[00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:50.380]   in light of your eternal kingdom.
[00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:56.580]   And I pray, I pray that in times of blessing,
[00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:57.700]   we do not forget you.
[00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:01.900]   We thank you, we praise you.
[00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:06.340]   And in times of crisis, we don't forget you,
[00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:11.680]   knowing that you are our rock and you are our salvation.
[00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:16.580]   Thank you for your deliverance, thank you for your healing,
[00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:21.540]   thank you for your blessing that we enjoy.
[00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:26.540]   So in times of crisis, help us to focus on you
[00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:29.180]   because in the end of the days,
[00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:33.620]   it's our faith in you that matters.
[00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:38.400]   Pray that you will help us to focus on your kingdom.
