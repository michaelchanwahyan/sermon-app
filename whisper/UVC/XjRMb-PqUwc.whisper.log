[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.160]   Good morning, guys.
[00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:02.920]   Why don't we say hi to each other?
[00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.480]   Just wave your hand.
[00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.680]   Good to be here.
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:06.520]   Whose bottle is this?
[00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.760]   Oh, it's some living water, yeah.
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.880]   Okay, today we are going to continue
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.040]   with the reflection on what is going on
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.560]   in Israel-Palestine.
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.320]   I'm not going to talk so much about
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.320]   what is going on right there on the ground.
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.240]   It's tragedy to both sides.
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.880]   No matter what happened, ground invasion
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.760]   or spill out into a regional conflict,
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.240]   it's going to be bad.
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.680]   What I would like to do is, in this conflict,
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.360]   there were a lot of different arguments
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.960]   and a lot of different discussions about the land.
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.200]   So I would like to walk you through,
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.800]   like what I did last week,
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.320]   walk you through the entire Bible
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.840]   from the first book, Genesis,
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.680]   to the last book, Revelation,
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.320]   and what is going on with the theme of land.
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.960]   Definitely in the Old Testament,
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.120]   there were a lot of discussions
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.640]   and a lot of emphasis on land,
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.240]   land of Canaan, which is between the Mediterranean Sea
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.200]   and the desert on the right,
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.400]   that narrow corridor.
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.480]   In this conflict currently happening,
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.400]   people often come to the debates and the arguments,
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.360]   whose land is this and who should stay in this land?
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.160]   And it can be very divisive.
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.160]   But I want to walk you through
[00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.520]   from Old Testament to New Testament,
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.920]   what is going on here.
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.800]   Sometimes we miss the big picture.
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.560]   The Bible, when the Bible talks about the land of Canaan,
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.680]   the promised land, it actually talks about grace.
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.800]   It actually talks about God's gifting the land
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.400]   to the Israelites, to the Old Testament people.
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.240]   And the land is a sheer, a sheer gift from God.
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.280]   And the people of God get to enter
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.200]   and to enjoy the land all because of God's grace.
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.800]   Of course, there was a covenant between God and the people,
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.600]   and the people are to be faithful.
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.760]   People are to follow the Torah,
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.560]   the principles lay out in the Old Testament,
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.240]   especially the first five books, how to manage their land.
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.320]   So when the Bible talks about God gifting the land
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.880]   to the Old Testament people,
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.760]   it is not saying, okay, anything goes.
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.120]   You know, I just give you this piece of property
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.080]   and you can just go in and do whatever you want, right?
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.440]   And by the way, we talk about the people of God being chosen,
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.560]   right, chosen people of God.
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.560]   The word chosen or the concept of election, chosen,
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.440]   does not mean the people being chosen have privileges,
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.520]   does not mean the people being chosen are superior.
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.680]   Chosen or being elected means God is choosing you
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.040]   to be his instrument to bless other people, right?
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.120]   So it's the land, the land is a gift.
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.000]   And the Israelites are called to manage it well
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.080]   and to give back and to love God.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.080]   So there are many different principles in the Torah,
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.760]   and I wanna give you a sample of it.
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.840]   One of the sample that talks about
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.600]   how people should behave in the land,
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.120]   in the land gifted by God.
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.320]   Deuteronomy 24, it says,
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.320]   "When you beat the olives from your olive trees," okay,
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.480]   "don't beat it twice.
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.400]   "The remaining olives are for the foreigners
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.040]   "or the orphans, the widows.
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.120]   "When you gather the grapes in your vineyard,
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.080]   "do not clean the vines after they are picked.
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.480]   "Leave the remaining grapes for the foreigners,
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.200]   "orphans, and widows.
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.160]   "Remember that you were slaves in the land of Egypt.
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.640]   "That is why I am giving you this command."
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:57.560]   Now, this is very interesting.
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.120]   When you beat the olives, what does it mean, right?
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.520]   Have you seen the olive tree?
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.080]   Olive tree, no?
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.000]   Okay, you've seen olives, right?
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.840]   In whole foods.
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.760]   Right, but olive tree, the olive tree,
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:12.920]   it's like an umbrella,
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.400]   and when you harvest olive tree,
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.920]   the olives are on the tree, on the branches,
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.000]   and how you do it?
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.960]   You have a blanket under the tree,
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.680]   and then you use a wood stick,
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.880]   and then you beat the branches.
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.360]   When you beat the branches, the mature olives will fall,
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.120]   and then you will gather it underneath
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.680]   with a blanket or with baskets.
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.160]   So that's what it's talking about.
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.200]   When you beat the olive tree,
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.960]   when you harvest the olive tree,
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.580]   don't harvest to the end every single piece of olives.
[00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:47.520]   Leave it there.
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.600]   Why?
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.680]   Because after you harvest,
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.920]   then the poor and the needy,
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.680]   they will come to your field,
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.420]   and they can have their summit field.
[00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.220]   You see what it's saying?
[00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.440]   Okay, vineyard as well.
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.640]   You know, have you seen vineyard?
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.200]   Grapes, have you seen grapes?
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.040]   Whole food, right?
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.760]   Yeah, but vineyard, we're talking about vineyard, right?
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.560]   The branches, right?
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.880]   When the grapes mature, you're gonna clean them, right?
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.880]   You can take them down, cut them down.
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.200]   But what it says here is that you have to have leftover
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.920]   remaining in the vineyard, on the vines.
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.200]   Please, why?
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.000]   Because the needy will come by,
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.680]   and they can enjoy the fruit.
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.000]   That is what land management or farm management
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.160]   looks like in the Old Testament.
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.640]   And usually those laws,
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.920]   this kind of law, similar principles,
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.520]   are all over the place in the Old Testament.
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.960]   And usually they are followed by one clause,
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.640]   what we call the motive clause.
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.200]   Motive clause, verse 22.
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.700]   It gives you the motive.
[00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.800]   So the Torah is not just like,
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.680]   you know, I give you this principle, this commandment,
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.280]   and you have to observe it,
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.340]   so you can earn my favor, right?
[00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:03.660]   No.
[00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.100]   It gives you the motive clause.
[00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:10.260]   Remember that you were once slaves in the land of Egypt.
[00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:15.540]   Remember you were saved by grace.
[00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.860]   Remember I saved you by grace from Pharaoh, from Egypt.
[00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.960]   Now you settled down in the land.
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.040]   You should not imitate the oppressors, right?
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.740]   You should leave behind some resources
[00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.060]   so you can bless other people, right?
[00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.900]   You can be generous.
[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.440]   So the promise of,
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.180]   they get to enter the land
[00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.300]   in order the land will be filled with,
[00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.740]   you know, resources, can bless other people.
[00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:48.700]   Again and again, the Bible tells us in the Old Testament,
[00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:54.860]   the land promise was already fulfilled.
[00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.180]   Not one word has failed.
[00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.740]   Everyone was fulfilled.
[00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:03.980]   Not one thing has fallen.
[00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:08.400]   Everything God promised to the Israelites were fulfilled.
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.500]   That's why they can settle down in the land,
[00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.700]   and then they build a kingdom, right?
[00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:17.980]   But of course, that's not how the story goes, right?
[00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:19.620]   In the Old Testament, when the people of God,
[00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:22.140]   they build their own kingdom, then they were divided,
[00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:24.340]   and they continue to oppress other people.
[00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:28.460]   And until 586 BC,
[00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:32.020]   God sent the Babylonians to destroy Jerusalem
[00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:35.220]   and the country of Judah,
[00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:39.500]   because they violate, they violate the Torah.
[00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.420]   So they were in exile.
[00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:45.020]   But then in exile, they came back, right?
[00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:47.580]   Under Ezra and Nehemiah,
[00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:50.380]   you can also call that second Exodus.
[00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:55.380]   And other Exodus, they came back from the exile land,
[00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:00.340]   back to Jerusalem, back to their homeland.
[00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:04.060]   But more importantly, when they came back to the land,
[00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:08.360]   they did not treat it as we conquest.
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:11.860]   They're not conquering the land again.
[00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:13.020]   When they came back to the land,
[00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:16.340]   they understand it is a regifting.
[00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:20.740]   God is regifting them a new, generous,
[00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:26.020]   a gracious opportunity to serve God.
[00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:30.420]   So you remember those guys, Ezra and Nehemiah, right?
[00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:32.660]   Came back, Ezra as a scribe,
[00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:34.700]   and teaching the people the Torah,
[00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:39.700]   and lead them into a spiritual revival, right?
[00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:44.740]   And then there was big, long prayer in Ezra chapter nine.
[00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:49.400]   And then Nehemiah had prayed the same prayer,
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:53.900]   or similar prayer in chapter nine of the book of Nehemiah.
[00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.940]   They all talk about the same thing, and with the same tone.
[00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:59.180]   And let's listen to their tone.
[00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:01.780]   In the midst of spiritual revival, back in the land,
[00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:04.580]   being regifted.
[00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:07.900]   Oh my God, I'm ashamed, utterly ashamed,
[00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:11.460]   for our sins are power higher than our heads.
[00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:15.980]   But now we have been given a brief moment of grace,
[00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:18.340]   for the Lord our God has allowed a few of us
[00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:20.220]   to survive as remnant.
[00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:21.740]   We are the remaining people,
[00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:25.260]   because we have abandoned your commands.
[00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:30.260]   There's no demand of God, giving them the land again.
[00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.140]   There's no demand of God that says,
[00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:36.620]   no, this land belong to us, because we were here first.
[00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:39.200]   There's no sense of entitlement,
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.560]   but only a sense of repentance, right?
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:46.080]   Knowing that God is now gracious enough to regift them,
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.360]   so that they can serve God in the land.
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:53.020]   And then the Old Testament story continues into,
[00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:57.100]   between the Old and New Testament,
[00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:59.140]   there were three to 400 years,
[00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.660]   and the people of God were still yearning
[00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:03.100]   for the real return.
[00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:06.140]   Because yeah, physically they are returned, right?
[00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:08.100]   They have returned to the land physically,
[00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:10.100]   but spiritually, politically,
[00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:13.620]   they were still under different empires, right?
[00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:18.620]   Persian empires, Greek empires, and then Roman empire.
[00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:21.760]   They did not have their freedom.
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:24.680]   And the people were looking forward,
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:29.200]   someday God will fulfill his promise again,
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:32.880]   fulfill his promise in the Messiah.
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.640]   So the second theme we have to think about
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.600]   is that the entire Old Testament
[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:40.880]   is actually pointing forward to a goal.
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:43.380]   And that goal is our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:47.760]   In Jesus, we find that all the promises of the land
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:50.720]   and other promises are fulfilled.
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.440]   Yes, the people lost the land because of a sin.
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:56.440]   After exile, they were still up in the air.
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:01.960]   But not because God failed, God is faithful.
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.960]   The people failed, the other party of the covenant,
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:08.440]   they failed, they did not keep the covenant.
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.000]   Now this has to do with Jesus.
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:13.740]   Now think about how the New Testament,
[00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:17.260]   the first book of New Testament introduced Jesus.
[00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.460]   What is the first book of the New Testament?
[00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:24.700]   Gospel of Matthew, right, Matthew.
[00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:28.020]   The genealogies, right, from Abraham
[00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:31.820]   all the way down to Christ, and then the birth of Christ,
[00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:35.860]   and then living under an other pharaoh,
[00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:39.140]   Held the Great, and he was persecuted.
[00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:42.200]   And then the Holy Family, Joseph, Mary, and Joseph,
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:45.480]   they were kind of exiled from the land
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:49.360]   and they went down to Egypt, which is on the left-hand side.
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:53.240]   And then after the pharaoh, the new pharaoh,
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:57.560]   Held the Great died, they returned back to the land, right?
[00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:00.460]   So there's exile and return in the life of Jesus.
[00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:03.020]   So as you can see in the Bible,
[00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:05.720]   already in the first book of the New Testament,
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:10.100]   the Gospel of Matthew, they look at the life story of Jesus,
[00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:12.380]   his life, his mission, his ministry,
[00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:16.760]   his death and resurrection, in light of the story of Israel.
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:19.460]   Because in Jesus, no matter what happened to him,
[00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:21.680]   no matter what he did and what he said,
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:24.300]   they find that Jesus is the true Israelites
[00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:27.940]   who keeps the covenant perfectly.
[00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:30.780]   He fulfilled all the promise and secure all the promises
[00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:33.140]   for those who are in Christ.
[00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:35.980]   You are in Christ, I am in Christ.
[00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:40.980]   So in that sense, we share that promise,
[00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:46.500]   which is included, which the land is included.
[00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:49.140]   So in some sense, as we trace the entire Old Testament
[00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:52.860]   to New Testament, we know that, so listen up,
[00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:56.380]   Old Testament, the Old Testament is incomplete
[00:12:56.380 --> 00:13:00.880]   without the New Testament, right?
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.720]   If you read the entire Old Testament,
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:07.080]   which probably you haven't, right?
[00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:10.440]   But if you read them, all the books, 39 books,
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:13.620]   you come to the end, it's an open-end book.
[00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:15.320]   What is going on, right?
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:18.100]   We're still yearning for another episode, right?
[00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:22.560]   In some sense, you can imagine the Old Testament
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:26.560]   and New Testament as a unit, as an entire grand story
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.760]   that has a lot of episode.
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:33.640]   The Old Testament is episode one to episode 98.
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:39.440]   After 98, you're still yearning for something, right?
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:43.320]   The hope, the promise is unfulfilled.
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:48.320]   And then episode 99 is New Testament, right?
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:53.560]   Jesus came and he fulfilled all the promises.
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:55.520]   He secured the fulfillment.
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:01.200]   Where's episode number 100?
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:05.400]   It's the new heaven, new earth, right?
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:07.640]   That we're all going in Christ.
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:11.140]   In that sense, Old Testament and New Testament are a unit.
[00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:14.280]   So when you trace the land promise, the theme of land,
[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:18.320]   you come to Jesus and Jesus fulfilled principally,
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:22.840]   fundamentally, he fulfilled that promise of inheritance,
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:24.640]   the promise of land.
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:28.740]   So in the New Testament, we are not looking forward
[00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:33.740]   to any point or any piece of property on earth.
[00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:37.380]   You cannot find it with a GPS.
[00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:40.640]   You find it in Jesus Christ, the living person
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:43.340]   who loved you and died for you and rose from the dead.
[00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:49.340]   Let me take a look at, fast forward to the book of Hebrews.
[00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:53.120]   Hebrews chapter 11.
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:57.360]   Remember this chapter is a list of faithful heroes, right?
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:58.960]   In the Old Testament.
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:02.720]   So-and-so is so faithful and they obtained the promise.
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:07.720]   And now come to 1110, Abraham, talking about Abraham.
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:12.720]   Abraham is the first story, the forefather of Israel.
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.520]   He was confidently looking forward to a city
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:20.520]   with eternal foundations, a city designed and built by God.
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:24.720]   So what was Abraham looking for?
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.680]   He was probably in episode three, right?
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:29.360]   Abraham in the Old Testament.
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:34.280]   He was looking forward or hoping for not a point
[00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:38.360]   on the map, not a physical point on the map,
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:42.000]   but looking forward to the heavenly city.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.920]   And the New Testament is clear.
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:51.000]   It's clear the new city is in episode 100.
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.440]   Someday in Christ, we will see that new city
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:57.360]   coming down from heaven, the new Jerusalem to earth.
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:59.520]   And that is our hope.
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:01.960]   The Bible is clear, the fulfillment of land promise.
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:06.160]   Indeed, every promise of God is found none other
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:10.120]   than Jesus himself, Jesus Christ himself.
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.880]   Ephesians chapter one.
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:17.440]   It talks about how blessed we are in Christ.
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:20.160]   How many promises and how many blessings
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.360]   we receive in Christ.
[00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:24.000]   Chapter one, seven.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   In Christ or in God, we have redemption through his blood.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.640]   The forgiveness of our trespasses,
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:34.760]   according to the riches of his grace,
[00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:38.360]   which he lavished upon us.
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:43.360]   God is so resourceful and he is so willing
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:46.600]   to lavish on us blessing.
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:50.120]   I remember when my kids were younger,
[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:56.160]   of course, young kids, they like candy, right?
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:57.640]   They like candy.
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:00.920]   I used to buy them some candy, right?
[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:02.400]   And then they were so happy.
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:05.800]   When I buy them a little box of candy
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.680]   and they were overjoyed, right?
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:11.880]   Little did they know that my credit card
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:16.240]   can buy millions of candies.
[00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:21.000]   And I can shower upon their heads, right?
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.040]   That is what is happening here in Ephesians one.
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:29.280]   God is God of blessing.
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:34.280]   And in Jesus, we have so much riches of his grace,
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:38.680]   which he lavished upon us in all wisdom and insight.
[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:41.840]   Verse nine, making known to us the mystery of his will
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:45.040]   according to his purpose, which he set forth in Christ
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:47.140]   as a plan for the fullness of time
[00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:49.500]   to unite all things in Jesus,
[00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:52.340]   things in heaven and things on earth.
[00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:55.860]   Everything in the universe, everything in the cosmos
[00:17:55.860 --> 00:18:00.860]   is united together, found the fulfillment in Jesus Christ.
[00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:06.580]   Verse 11, in him we have obtained an inheritance, the land.
[00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:09.340]   And what is the land?
[00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:13.440]   Episode 100, new heaven and new earth.
[00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:19.380]   We have obtained the inheritance, the property in heaven,
[00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:20.980]   in new heaven, new earth,
[00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:25.980]   having been predestined according to the purposes of him
[00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:30.360]   who works all things according to the counsel of his will
[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:34.220]   so that we who are the first to hope in Christ
[00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:38.220]   might be to the praise of his glory.
[00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:43.220]   This is episode 99, and telling us someday we will inherit.
[00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:48.580]   The inheritance, the land in episode 100.
[00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:53.360]   I know most of us live in Chicago, right?
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:57.060]   We live in Illinois, right?
[00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:00.060]   You know the most expensive house in Illinois?
[00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:01.380]   Where is it?
[00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:05.860]   The most expensive house in Illinois, in the state of Illinois.
[00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:06.700]   Where is it?
[00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:09.460]   Let me give you a clue, in Chicago.
[00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:10.600]   It is in Chicago.
[00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:12.860]   The most expensive house in the state of Illinois
[00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:14.820]   is in Chicago, in the city of Chicago, right?
[00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.340]   Have you seen it?
[00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:17.340]   Which neighborhood?
[00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:19.720]   Lincoln Park.
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:20.980]   Anyone from Lincoln Park?
[00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:25.540]   The most expensive house in Illinois
[00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:28.200]   is located in Chicago, Lincoln Park.
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:33.860]   The price for the house is 50 million.
[00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:38.460]   50 million, imagine that, one house, right?
[00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:43.460]   25,000 square feet, 11 bathrooms.
[00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:47.280]   Praise God, 11 bathrooms, right?
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:52.840]   Eight city lots, eight city lots, right?
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:53.680]   How many houses do you have?
[00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:54.980]   One house is one lot, right?
[00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:58.940]   Oh, no, no, no, one lot has so many houses, right?
[00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:05.020]   Eight city lots, big house, huge house.
[00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:10.540]   Imagine this most expensive house is God's inheritance.
[00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:13.620]   I'm using a very finite analogy, right?
[00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:17.600]   Imagine this is the inheritance that we have in Christ.
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:22.020]   Now, you don't get to live in that house yet, right?
[00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:27.020]   We're still in episode 99, but the key is given to you, right?
[00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:29.700]   If the key of the house is given to you,
[00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:33.700]   how you treat, where you gonna put your key?
[00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:35.100]   Where you put the house key?
[00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:40.660]   A 50 million dollar house, the key is already given to you.
[00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:43.160]   Someday you're gonna get into this mansion
[00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:45.460]   and you can enjoy the inheritance.
[00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:46.940]   Where you gonna keep the key?
[00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:50.680]   I don't know.
[00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:55.260]   I don't know, somewhere in the safe, right?
[00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:57.580]   Would you give it to your dog?
[00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:58.780]   Probably not, right?
[00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:00.580]   Hopefully not.
[00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:02.720]   That is the new heaven, new of the inheritance
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.500]   that Apostle Paul is telling us.
[00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:08.060]   In Christ, we have that gift.
[00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:10.900]   We have that inheritance, secure and fulfilled
[00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:12.220]   in Jesus Christ.
[00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:17.860]   That's why we are being gifted so much.
[00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:20.260]   And at the same time, if we understand
[00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:24.740]   that we have experienced grace of God, right?
[00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:26.700]   The lavish grace of God.
[00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:33.340]   It should motivate us to be generous people, right?
[00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:36.260]   We are so generous.
[00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:39.580]   We can be so generous because we are so blessed.
[00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:41.420]   I know Thanksgiving is around the corner
[00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:45.300]   and I've been thinking about grace,
[00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:47.580]   the goodness of God, the blessing of God,
[00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:50.340]   and our responses.
[00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:54.620]   I wanna close today with a parable, a parable by Jesus.
[00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:56.260]   And usually when we hear this parable,
[00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:57.660]   when we study this parable,
[00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:04.260]   we don't read this parable with the perspective
[00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:07.900]   of inheritance, the father's house, right?
[00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:09.540]   The household, the big household.
[00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:15.660]   Usually we read this parable understanding the love of God.
[00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:16.900]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:20.660]   But I wanna go through this parable with you
[00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:24.140]   and with this perspective.
[00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:25.940]   Remember the parable of prodigal son?
[00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:28.020]   The prodigal son?
[00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:32.900]   The younger son who is rebellious, right?
[00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:35.740]   And he took his inheritance and go to far country
[00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:37.580]   and waste them all, right?
[00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:40.100]   And he was suffering and he just thought on him,
[00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:42.180]   hey, maybe I should return to the father's house
[00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:44.260]   and rather be a servant, right?
[00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:46.580]   That's a parable of prodigal son.
[00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:48.500]   But actually if you read it carefully,
[00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:52.460]   the parable of prodigal son is parable of two sons.
[00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:58.380]   Two sons, the younger and the older, right?
[00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:00.540]   The younger and the firstborn.
[00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:01.980]   The younger son, as I said, goes away
[00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:04.740]   and spend all of his inheritance from the father
[00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:06.180]   and he suffered so much.
[00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:08.900]   And then the son realized the patience
[00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:12.660]   of the father is enduring, right?
[00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:17.660]   So he decided to just go back to the father's house.
[00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:23.060]   He hurts his father deeply and he knows
[00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:26.080]   he does not deserve the favor of God.
[00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:29.580]   So he made up his mind and say,
[00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:32.480]   no, I'm not worthy to be called my father's son,
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:35.300]   but I would rather go back to be one of his servants.
[00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:40.300]   So he goes back and he just wanna work for his father
[00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:44.020]   as a slave working for the master.
[00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:46.420]   But when the son returns home, what did he find?
[00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:50.460]   He does not see a stern master,
[00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:53.860]   but a loving and patient father waiting for him.
[00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:57.740]   The loving father is waiting for him.
[00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:00.700]   He saw him and felt compassion and ran
[00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:03.620]   and embraced and kissed him.
[00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:07.300]   Now, this sort of actions, usually in that kind of culture,
[00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:11.560]   in biblical culture, means humiliation.
[00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:14.820]   Old men don't run.
[00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:17.900]   They walk slowly, right?
[00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:21.100]   And respectfully, keeping their honor.
[00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:23.700]   But this father seeing the younger son coming back,
[00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:27.620]   he ran and embraced him and kissed him
[00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:30.140]   and threw a party for him and celebrate.
[00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:31.640]   So the son returns home,
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:36.060]   returned to his father's land and inheritance.
[00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:42.860]   Now, at this point, the firstborn,
[00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:45.260]   the elder son came back, right?
[00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:48.460]   And how did he react?
[00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:53.240]   He comes home from the farm
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:56.060]   and he heard about the celebration
[00:24:56.060 --> 00:25:01.060]   for the long lost younger brother, but he was angry.
[00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:03.740]   He said, "It's not fair."
[00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:04.720]   Why?
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:07.060]   Because he has been working so hard, right,
[00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:08.700]   to earn his father's favor.
[00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:14.140]   And he was angry against his father
[00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:17.120]   and the younger son, his brother,
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:19.540]   because he has been working so hard
[00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:22.500]   to earn the favor of God.
[00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:24.640]   And the father never threw a party for him.
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:28.780]   He, the elder son, is a dutiful son.
[00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:33.540]   He's a very faithful son, but he never realized, sadly,
[00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:37.720]   he is already living in and enjoying
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:39.560]   all the inheritance of the father,
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:42.840]   all the inheritance of the father,
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:44.880]   every single day since he was born.
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:50.900]   He would enjoy it and he would inherit
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:54.020]   all the land and inheritance.
[00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:57.200]   You see here, the two sons,
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:02.200]   one find that God's favor is undeserved.
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:05.800]   The other one is trying, working so hard
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:08.600]   in order to earn that, right?
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:10.760]   And the parable ends with, you know,
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:15.760]   you don't have to do that because God is so rich
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:21.440]   and God has blessed you and give you the inheritance.
[00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:24.960]   Now, usually theologians would define grace
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:27.400]   as unmerited favor.
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:30.360]   What does it mean, unmerited favor?
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:34.700]   It means that you don't deserve the grace of God,
[00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:36.360]   the love of God.
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:39.160]   Nonetheless, God loves you.
[00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:41.540]   God loves you even you don't deserve it,
[00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:44.660]   even you feel you don't deserve it.
[00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:46.460]   God still loves you.
[00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:48.320]   That is grace, right?
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:51.280]   No debate about it, unmerited favor.
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:54.760]   You don't deserve it, unmerited, but it comes upon you.
[00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:57.580]   But this is only one side of the coin.
[00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:03.320]   I will say grace is also dismerited favor.
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:06.400]   Now, what does it mean, dismerited favor?
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:07.720]   I don't know how to translate in Chinese,
[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:09.200]   so yeah, don't worry about it.
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:12.080]   It's called dismerited favor.
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:16.480]   What it means is that you deserve judgment.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.600]   We sinners, we deserve condemnation,
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:25.420]   yet condemnation does not come to us.
[00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:29.280]   God forgives.
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:34.280]   God forgives us even we do deserve condemnation.
[00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:37.880]   That is dismerited favor.
[00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:41.800]   It's not just unmerited favor, it's dismerited favor.
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:43.320]   This ought to be the motivation
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:46.060]   for our entire Christian life, right?
[00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:51.380]   You don't have to work so hard to earn God's favor,
[00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:56.060]   but it has given to you unmerited and dismerited.
[00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:59.260]   Once we experience the grace of God,
[00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:04.940]   our relationship with God should be motivated
[00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:09.180]   by a grateful response.
[00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:12.900]   Since God loves me so much, and I'm not worthy,
[00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:18.900]   I'm not dismerited, yet God's love comes upon my life,
[00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:21.620]   and I want to respond to God with gratitude,
[00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:25.260]   with worship, with my service.
[00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:28.540]   Yesterday, I read something really,
[00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:31.240]   I think it's meaningful for this season, Thanksgiving.
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:36.260]   That short piece is about gratefulness and gratitude.
[00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:39.440]   It's a reminder for me,
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:43.460]   and I want to close my sermon with this.
[00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:48.420]   There's a fine line between doing things for God
[00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:51.460]   with a strong sense of responsibility,
[00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:56.460]   and serving God with gratitude, gratefulness.
[00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:59.380]   So that short piece talks about this.
[00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:01.940]   Let me run it through.
[00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:08.080]   Grateful for, house to clean.
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:11.020]   You can take it as, I have to clean my house.
[00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:13.580]   Such a burden for me, right?
[00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:15.500]   Have you cleaned your house lately?
[00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:16.420]   Such a burden.
[00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:21.440]   But you can also reflect it on the other side.
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:25.420]   Yeah, I can clean my house because I'm grateful.
[00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:28.780]   God has given me a safe shelter to live.
[00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:32.100]   Doing laundry, right?
[00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:33.820]   It sucks doing laundry.
[00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:36.580]   I don't do it, my wife does.
[00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:38.700]   It sucks.
[00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:42.460]   But consider, we are doing laundry
[00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:47.460]   because God has been so blessing us with clothes to wear.
[00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:51.580]   Doing dishes, last night I was doing dishes,
[00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:53.940]   a lot of dishes, because my son came back
[00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:56.300]   to spend the night.
[00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:58.700]   Yeah, there were so many dishes, right?
[00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:01.380]   I do dishes, it sucks.
[00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:06.820]   You know, it come from a spirit of just being responsible.
[00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:09.000]   The elder son, by the way, the elder son.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.400]   I'm working so hard, right?
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:16.220]   But gratitude says, we have food to eat, right?
[00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:18.020]   That's why we do dishes.
[00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:19.740]   Grocery shopping, right?
[00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:21.660]   It's routine, it's tedious.
[00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:26.180]   But God has provided me money, it's proficient.
[00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:27.420]   I have to clean toilets.
[00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:30.860]   But thank God for indoor plumbing.
[00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:35.660]   There were a lot of noise in my life,
[00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:38.660]   but thank God, we have people around us
[00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:40.100]   who care about us.
[00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:43.380]   There are endless questions about homework,
[00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:45.580]   for the kids especially, right?
[00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:47.500]   Endless assignments they have to do.
[00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:49.960]   Oh, so tired.
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:56.020]   But gratefulness says, hey, my kids are growing, right?
[00:30:56.020 --> 00:31:00.060]   Early wake-ups, just like this morning, right?
[00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:01.620]   Early wake-ups.
[00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:02.840]   Or Monday, right?
[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:06.720]   Anyone has Monday blue?
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:08.220]   I do, right?
[00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:11.820]   Oh, what a day, we have to drag our body,
[00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:14.060]   you know, away from the mattress, right?
[00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:16.100]   To wake up, early wake-up.
[00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:19.440]   But hey, if you're taking care of the young kids,
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:23.140]   children to love, praise God.
[00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:26.900]   Throwing tire in bed, it sucks.
[00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:29.480]   But thank God I'm still alive.
[00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:33.900]   And by the way, ties an offering, right?
[00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:37.040]   One-tenth of our income goes into offering.
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:42.880]   Um, it feels burdensome.
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:44.520]   Yeah, I must say that, you know,
[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:46.320]   I'm a Christian for many, many years.
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:50.660]   I feel like ties and offering, yeah, right?
[00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:55.000]   Yeah, it would be heaven if there was no ties and offering.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.720]   However, gratefulness says,
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:03.000]   I do have the resources to bless other people, right?
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.600]   Last week we had the General Assembly
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:08.760]   and usually at the end of the year,
[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:10.880]   all the churches and most of the organizations
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:13.300]   are lacking some resources.
[00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:16.480]   We do, our church does, yeah.
[00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:18.720]   It's challenging this year, right?
[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:23.720]   Yesterday I was dining out in a restaurant with someone
[00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:26.720]   and then I paid the bill.
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:30.000]   $30 each person.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.920]   $30 a meal, right?
[00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:35.660]   That's crazy, I didn't have enough.
[00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:40.140]   I was still hungry, leaving the restaurant, right?
[00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:42.860]   So I paid $60, right?
[00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:44.620]   The biggest struggle I have these days,
[00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:46.640]   dining out, is the tips.
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:50.740]   Can I cut the tips, right?
[00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:52.880]   Life is hard.
[00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:56.740]   But gratitude says,
[00:32:56.740 --> 00:32:59.060]   we have the resources to bless other people.
[00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:01.620]   God is too good.
[00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:02.860]   God is too resourceful.
[00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:05.500]   God of blessing.
[00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:07.300]   Let's all pray.
[00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:13.540]   Father, thank you for being our God, our infinite God.
[00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:17.540]   And you are the God of blessings.
[00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:19.920]   You are the God full of resources.
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:22.260]   And you are infinite.
[00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:26.120]   And your love never exhausts.
[00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:29.860]   Your patience towards us never exhausts.
[00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:32.540]   Thank you for being our great God.
[00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:34.660]   Thank you for the fact that in Christ,
[00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:38.420]   we enjoy the unmerited,
[00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:39.760]   dismerited favor.
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:43.600]   That we are in Christ, no more condemnation.
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:46.620]   And in Christ, we have new life.
[00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:49.020]   Thank you for all the good things
[00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:51.460]   that you have showered upon us.
[00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:54.500]   Especially as we end our service with communion,
[00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:58.960]   we pick up the bread and the cup of grape juice
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:01.900]   to remember how great you are
[00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:03.360]   and your love is so great.
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:06.500]   Beyond our comprehension,
[00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:09.380]   yet becomes a reality in our life.
[00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:11.700]   Encourage us and give us hope.
[00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:16.700]   Give us this new strength to live for you,
[00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:18.660]   to serve you.
[00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:19.560]   In Christ, we pray.
