1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,960
 Alright guys, welcome, and I want you to,

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,560
 let's see, connect with your neighbor,

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,400
 one of your neighbors, alright?

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,720
 I have a question for you, I have a question for you.

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,160
 You have to give a quick answer to your neighbor, okay?

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,600
 What is the most, think of the most embarrassing moment

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,720
 in your life, embarrassing moment in your life, alright?

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,400
 Can you talk to your friend about it?

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,880
 What is that?

10
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,240
 What happened?

11
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,520
 The most embarrassing, most shameful moment

12
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,200
 that you can think of, alright?

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,280
 Can you think of any?

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,240
 There has to be an embarrassing moment in your life, right?

15
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:43,080
 So I want you to think of the most embarrassing moment.

16
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,680
 Most embarrassing moment.

17
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,360
 Now you don't have to go into details,

18
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,960
 but you can just, you know, tell them the basics,

19
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,720
 the basic information.

20
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,680
 Most embarrassing moment.

21
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,440
 (audience chattering)

22
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:19,840
 Alright, so let's see.

23
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,200
 Let me tell you one of the most embarrassing moments

24
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,620
 I ever had, is that many, many years ago,

25
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:33,400
 I officiate a funeral for someone who passed away.

26
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,760
 Alright, it's someone's father, alright, someone's father.

27
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,640
 So I officiate the funeral,

28
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,040
 and I actually know the deceased personally.

29
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,360
 So he passed away, and I officiate the funeral,

30
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,080
 and a couple months later,

31
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,520
 I met the daughter of the deceased,

32
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,920
 daughter of the father who passed away.

33
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,800
 And then we were chit-chatting,

34
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,000
 and I asked the daughter, I asked,

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,240
 "Hey, how's your father?"

36
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,480
 (laughing)

37
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:08,040
 And then she replied,

38
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,880
 "Well, you officiate the funeral of my father."

39
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,000
 I was so embarrassed, you know,

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,480
 because I officiate a lot of funerals, right?

41
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,920
 'Cause I can't keep track, I can't keep track.

42
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,080
 So that's one of the most embarrassing moments in my life.

43
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,720
 So maybe you find your own moments, right?

44
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,640
 But today's passage is about a shameful moment,

45
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:40,480
 a moment of embarrassment, a moment of shame, alright?

46
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,240
 So we are going through this series on Chosen,

47
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,800
 and one of the episode, episode five of season one,

48
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,720
 is actually called Wedding Gift, alright?

49
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,160
 Wedding Gift.

50
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,760
 And the story is very simple,

51
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,160
 because it follows chapter two of Gospel of John, alright?

52
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,760
 So Jesus and his disciples were invited to a wedding feast

53
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,600
 at a place called Cana in Galilee.

54
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,920
 It's a little town in Galilee,

55
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,080
 in the northern part of the country.

56
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,600
 So they went, and then the hosting family,

57
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:19,200
 the Bridegroom family, prepare a big banquet, right?

58
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,960
 And at the end, all the wine has been used up.

59
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,920
 And that means a major disaster,

60
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,840
 or major social shame of, you know, Jesus' day.

61
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,560
 And then Mary, the mother of Jesus,

62
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,520
 comes and asks Jesus to help out, alright?

63
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:44,480
 And you know the story, Jesus turn water into wine, right?

64
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,080
 And then saving the honor of the family,

65
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,840
 turning shame into honor.

66
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,440
 So that's how the story goes.

67
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,400
 It's a very familiar story,

68
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,880
 and perhaps it's one of the beloved stories from the Gospel,

69
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,360
 one of the miracles that Jesus has done.

70
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,320
 And it talks about Jesus and his disciples

71
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,760
 going into, joining a wedding banquet,

72
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,760
 and let's dive in and see what this story is all about,

73
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,760
 and how does it relate to you and to me.

74
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,080
 John chapter two, verse one.

75
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,840
 "The next day, there was a wedding celebration

76
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,560
 "in the village of Cana in Galilee.

77
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,240
 "And the mother of Jesus was there,

78
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,920
 "and Jesus and the disciples were invited

79
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,800
 "to the celebration, to the wedding feast."

80
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,600
 Now, Jewish weddings in those days, or even in today,

81
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,880
 were very important occasions, right?

82
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,960
 Well, actually, that applies to all culture,

83
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,960
 across the cultures.

84
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,360
 If you've been to a wedding banquet, you dress up, right?

85
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:51,700
 Hopefully you don't wear flip-flops, right?

86
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,400
 You dress up, and then one of the most important thing

87
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,040
 you bring with you to a wedding feast,

88
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,520
 or a wedding banquet, is what?

89
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,880
 Money, yes, yes.

90
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,160
 You gotta give some money, right?

91
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,200
 You gotta give some gifts.

92
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,640
 As a token of honor to the hosting family.

93
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,520
 And it was a very important social occasion.

94
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,000
 And often in those days, in Jesus' day,

95
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,680
 the whole community and the whole village is being invited.

96
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,400
 And of course, the extended family,

97
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,800
 or friends of extended family, were invited.

98
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,360
 So it's not surprising that Jesus

99
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,280
 and the mother of Jesus, Mary, and his disciples

100
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,320
 were also invited to celebrate.

101
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,680
 So they went to Cana.

102
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,520
 And then, if you go to Israel,

103
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,800
 there's a little town called Kefa Cana.

104
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,040
 Kefa Cana is a small village.

105
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,920
 It's still keeping the name in biblical time.

106
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,160
 It's called Cana, right?

107
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,760
 And there's an ancient church there,

108
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,240
 and some people would go to the church

109
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,240
 and read the story, chapter two of 1 John.

110
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:06,280
 But in order to understand the magnitude of this story,

111
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,080
 we need to understand the biblical culture.

112
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,920
 In Bible times, culture is often called

113
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,920
 honor and shame culture.

114
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,920
 Honor and shame culture.

115
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,120
 Now, what is this?

116
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,120
 On the right, you see some words like glory,

117
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,880
 honor, good name.

118
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,000
 Now, these are the things that people are striving for.

119
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,600
 These are the things that people are trying to protect

120
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,720
 and to defend.

121
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,440
 Defend your own glory, defend your own good name,

122
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,520
 your own reputation, and that is very important.

123
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,920
 And for many of us who are Asians, who are Chinese,

124
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,800
 we do understand this kind of culture

125
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,600
 because we have this faith culture, right?

126
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,400
 And we wanna save faith all the time, right?

127
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:00,400
 To people, Caucasian, Caucasian culture,

128
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,560
 or the American culture,

129
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,760
 sometimes they go to,

130
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,000
 we enjoy a meal together.

131
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 At the end of the meal,

132
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,800
 they don't understand there is something called

133
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,080
 fighting to pay the bill.

134
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:22,360
 We will do our best to pay the bill, right?

135
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,200
 And why is that?

136
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,840
 You know, other cultures would not understand

137
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,080
 what is going on here, right?

138
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,980
 Why do you have to fight for paying the bill, right?

139
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,800
 Because paying the bill in the Asian culture,

140
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,800
 in the Chinese tradition, means honor and faith, right?

141
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,800
 You earn your respect and you save your faith

142
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,280
 by I pay the bill, right?

143
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,060
 So you owe me, right?

144
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,440
 I know a lot of people don't do this these days.

145
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,500
 Yeah, which is, it can be good, right?

146
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,560
 But we are fighting for social honor.

147
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,720
 And that is what this culture is all about.

148
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,640
 It's very, very interesting

149
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,160
 because you are fighting for something

150
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,640
 that is not tangible.

151
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:15,120
 You cannot touch it, you cannot grab it,

152
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,600
 but it's so real.

153
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,940
 It's honor and shame.

154
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:23,300
 So honor and shame is kind of like a social credit rating.

155
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,920
 Here, the diagram I show you.

156
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,060
 When you get more likes on your TikTok,

157
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:33,140
 on your Instagram, on your social media,

158
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,860
 you have more social currency.

159
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:40,860
 So honor can be thought of as social credit rating.

160
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,520
 If you get more likes, if you get more praises,

161
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,020
 then you get better ratings.

162
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:50,360
 And you get more currency, social currency,

163
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,340
 in your society, in your group.

164
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,980
 And you are better.

165
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,300
 And what is more important to observe in Biblical culture

166
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,980
 is that social honor is a group thing.

167
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,000
 It's a group thing.

168
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,920
 It's not individualistic value.

169
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,860
 Now, in American culture, in the Western culture,

170
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:12,640
 or Westernized areas,

171
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,720
 the culture is more individualistic.

172
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,360
 So we talk about honor, good name,

173
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,640
 and reputation is just about me, right?

174
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,240
 Mark Chan has a good reputation.

175
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:29,060
 And the reputation is pretty much individualistic, personal.

176
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,060
 It's a personal currency.

177
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,740
 People don't care whether my son or my daughter

178
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,460
 has the same reputation, right?

179
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:40,060
 Because we are very individualized.

180
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,820
 But in Biblical times, in Biblical culture,

181
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,900
 honor and shame is a group thing

182
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:49,460
 because you don't represent yourself only.

183
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,260
 You represent a group,

184
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:56,300
 a big group, your family, your extended family,

185
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,400
 your uncles, your aunties,

186
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:03,800
 your cousins, your niece, your close friends.

187
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,580
 So when you have honor, when you have a good name,

188
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,060
 when you have good reputation,

189
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,800
 your whole tribe will have honor.

190
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:17,700
 But if you lose it, when you are being shamed,

191
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,460
 your whole family, including yourself,

192
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,460
 will face social stigma.

193
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:25,100
 Now that's how it goes.

194
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,740
 So you have to understand the magnitude of this story

195
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,460
 in Gospel of John chapter two.

196
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:32,900
 You have to understand this cultural background.

197
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,100
 What is going on?

198
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,180
 What is the big deal?

199
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:39,740
 In Jewish culture, banquet is the most important occasion

200
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:43,980
 you can show off and you can defend the honor

201
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,100
 of your family, of your tribe.

202
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,680
 Some of the families in Jesus' time,

203
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,440
 they would actually invest all of their energy

204
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:59,240
 and all of their money, all of their resources

205
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,400
 in order to make the banquets look good

206
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,280
 and all the guests are being entertained.

207
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:10,080
 And of course, wine is indispensable in those days.

208
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,880
 Even today, we go to a banquet.

209
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,560
 We want to open bar.

210
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,920
 Hallelujah, we will have open bar.

211
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,960
 People can drink all they want, right?

212
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,200
 And that's honor, right?

213
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,600
 The hosting family would like to offer

214
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,320
 something like that, right?

215
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,480
 The more you offer, the more lavish your banquet is,

216
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:34,560
 you know, you get more social currency.

217
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,840
 So some of the families, even small families,

218
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,000
 they would use up or they even take on a loan

219
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,160
 in order to set up a very, very nice and lavish banquet.

220
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:49,320
 And sometimes the feast can go on for seven days, right?

221
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,040
 Seven days.

222
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,760
 Today, when you go to a wedding banquet,

223
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,480
 it's probably just one evening, right?

224
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,040
 But there is some Asian culture, like Vietnamese culture,

225
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,920
 they still do this, you know?

226
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,040
 They have a whole week of feast and invite all the friends

227
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:12,200
 and all their related to come to enjoy the meal, right?

228
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,720
 So this is the Jewish culture.

229
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,720
 So in the story, when the wine supply went out,

230
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,040
 it means a social disaster.

231
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:26,240
 Now I had you in the beginning to think about

232
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,880
 a moment of embarrassment, right?

233
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,040
 Now those moment, I hope, were not disasters, right?

234
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,160
 We're still alive, right?

235
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,160
 So it was not disasters.

236
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,160
 But in those days, if you fail in your wedding banquet,

237
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,280
 it means social disaster.

238
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:51,280
 And the worst form of social shame will happen to you

239
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,440
 because your name will be smeared for decades to come,

240
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,600
 for decades to come.

241
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,960
 So Mary, the mother of Jesus, came in

242
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,360
 and asked Jesus to help out.

243
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,280
 And ask him, you have to help them.

244
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,640
 You have to help them, not only we solve the issue

245
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:17,720
 of the lack of wine, but to save the honor of the family,

246
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,640
 to defend the honor of the family.

247
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:25,680
 It was a very, very bad situation.

248
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,720
 And Mary, as the mother of Jesus,

249
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,640
 and you know Jesus, how old was he?

250
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:34,720
 He's already over 30 years old, right?

251
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,800
 So as you know, if you're a mother

252
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,640
 or you're a sibling of someone,

253
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,000
 you observe someone for decades,

254
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,320
 and you know this guy is special, right?

255
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,000
 Maybe he could do magic or something like that.

256
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,520
 So mother of Jesus, Mary came,

257
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:55,360
 and I think she knows that her son is special,

258
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,680
 and he can do something about it.

259
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,280
 How to do it, what to do, she doesn't know.

260
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:08,040
 But she just trusts that her son, Jesus,

261
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:12,200
 has the ability to save the family in this situation.

262
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,640
 And Jesus respond by saying,

263
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,240
 this is very interesting reply.

264
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:25,680
 He said in verse four, "Dear woman, that is not our problem."

265
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,180
 Jesus replied, "My time has not yet come."

266
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,480
 Now, dear woman is actually a very polite way

267
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,360
 of addressing a woman or a mother, all right?

268
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,280
 So there's nothing wrong with that, all right?

269
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,080
 So we don't do that, right?

270
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,960
 I don't call my mom dear woman, what's up, right?

271
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,800
 We don't do that.

272
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,480
 But in those days, you know, it's just a normal title, right?

273
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,140
 But Jesus' reply is interesting

274
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:57,000
 in that it's being highlighted here.

275
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,240
 "My time has not yet come."

276
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,760
 What does it mean, right?

277
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,680
 "My time has not yet come."

278
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,840
 Now, this phrase, Jesus said, "My time is not here yet."

279
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,160
 "My time has not arrived yet."

280
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,640
 "My time has not yet come."

281
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,760
 Something like that, similar phrases,

282
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,080
 occur many, many times in the Gospel of John.

283
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,920
 And it shows up frequently in the Gospel.

284
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,800
 And Jesus often say, "My time is not here yet."

285
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,560
 And what does he mean?

286
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,720
 He said, "My time, the time of mine, is the hour,

287
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,880
 "is the time that Jesus will display all the glory of God."

288
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,560
 The whole glory of God, he will display,

289
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,760
 he will show the whole glory of God.

290
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,600
 And that is the time he's referring to.

291
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:51,280
 And here is the, in the early years of his ministry,

292
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,320
 and Jesus, of course, would say,

293
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,040
 "Hey, my time is not here yet.

294
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,480
 "I'm not ready to show all the glory of God at this point."

295
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,520
 Because if Jesus displays the whole glory of God

296
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,680
 in a perfect way, in an immature time,

297
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:11,680
 people would have misunderstood why Jesus came, right?

298
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:17,800
 People would be expecting someone who can be their leader,

299
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,120
 right, to solve their political problem,

300
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,960
 or solve their personal problem.

301
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,360
 But that's not why Jesus came, right?

302
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,600
 That's not the real glory of God.

303
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,160
 So it is in this context that Jesus said,

304
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,400
 "My time has not yet come."

305
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:38,080
 But I think when he said that,

306
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:45,600
 Jesus already knows what to do in this situation in Cana,

307
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,520
 trying to save the honor, or defend the honor of the family.

308
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,400
 He already knows what to do,

309
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:55,480
 because he understand the level, or the magnitude,

310
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,840
 of social disaster for the family.

311
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,560
 And that's why the mother said,

312
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,760
 "Hey, whatever Jesus tells you,

313
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,040
 "tells his servant, you do it, okay?"

314
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,360
 So we come to verse six.

315
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:14,720
 "Standing nearby were six stone water jars

316
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,720
 "used for Jewish ceremonial washing.

317
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,560
 "Each could hold 20 to 30 gallons,

318
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,800
 "and Jesus told the servants, 'Fill the jars with water.'

319
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,160
 "When the jars had been filled, Jesus said,

320
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,680
 "'Now dip some out and take it

321
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,560
 "'to the master of the ceremonies.'

322
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:34,480
 "So the servants followed his instructions."

323
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,760
 So Jesus knew what to do.

324
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,680
 Now what is going on here is that

325
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,440
 in many of the Jewish households,

326
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,840
 you will find jars like that.

327
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,520
 It's about this size, this high.

328
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,360
 This tall.

329
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,560
 And they're stone jars, and they would hold water.

330
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,800
 Hold water for what?

331
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,960
 Because water is a very, very valuable thing in Israel,

332
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:06,120
 because they all depend on rainwater.

333
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,360
 So they gotta have a lot of containers

334
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,960
 to contain usable water, right?

335
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,880
 So these jars were commonly used

336
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,800
 by Jewish families in Jesus' day to hold water

337
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,840
 and for purpose of purification.

338
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,640
 Now you understand in Jesus' day,

339
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,560
 Orthodox Jews were cleaning freaks.

340
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:33,240
 They loved to clean.

341
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,480
 They loved to purify themselves.

342
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,720
 And it's not a matter of hygiene.

343
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,040
 You know, it's not because of germs,

344
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,600
 those that we have to wash our hands.

345
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,760
 It's ritual cleansing that is their most concerned.

346
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,800
 They're most concerned about.

347
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:51,320
 Ritual purity is a very, very important value,

348
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:55,320
 because you have to make sure you are ritually pure,

349
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,960
 you're ritually cleansed,

350
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,040
 when you partake important occasions,

351
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:05,040
 like having a dinner.

352
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,480
 You gotta wash your hands before you're having food.

353
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,720
 Now again, it's not hygiene.

354
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,120
 It's about ritual, right?

355
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,320
 It's a religious thing.

356
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,520
 Or you go to the temple, you go to a synagogue

357
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,360
 to pray or to worship.

358
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:24,320
 You gotta make sure you are cleansed.

359
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:29,480
 So they have all sorts of ritual cleansing mechanism

360
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:33,200
 to make sure that they can stand in the presence of God

361
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,880
 and they will not lose their place.

362
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,760
 So here is the background of the story.

363
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,680
 There are six jars of this stone vessel, right?

364
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:47,440
 Now why six?

365
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:53,320
 In the Bible, perfect number is seven, right?

366
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,880
 I know in your culture, it may be eight, right?

367
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,800
 In your license plate, it may be whatever, eight, eight,

368
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,720
 eight, right?

369
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,080
 More eight, better, right?

370
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,080
 The more, the better.

371
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,840
 But in Hebrew culture, the perfect number is seven, right?

372
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,240
 Perfect number is seven.

373
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:11,280
 So only six jars here and that implies imperfection.

374
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,680
 And what kind of imperfection is trying to imply here?

375
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,720
 In the Gospel of John, it's always trying to tell us

376
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,880
 the traditional value or traditional way of life, Judaism,

377
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:26,080
 the Jewish way of life is not enough.

378
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,960
 It's not perfect.

379
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,080
 Now in this situation, there is a social disaster, right?

380
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,200
 There's social shame being involved here.

381
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,360
 And you can see six jars of, six stone jars filled with water

382
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:46,160
 cannot save this family from social shame.

383
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,580
 Cannot turn shame into glory.

384
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:54,120
 Only when Jesus comes and he can do something about it.

385
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,800
 So Jesus had the servants fill the jars with water

386
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,960
 and then he turned water into the best wine, right?

387
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,640
 Best wine.

388
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,800
 And how did Jesus do that?

389
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:11,680
 Well, the Bible doesn't say.

390
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,440
 What mechanism did he use, right?

391
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:19,360
 We don't know because the Bible is not so much interest

392
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,080
 in the mechanism of miracle.

393
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,560
 The Bible is more concerned about the effect of the miracle.

394
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,920
 The effect of the action of Jesus.

395
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,400
 What does it accomplish?

396
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,240
 What did Jesus accomplish through the miracle?

397
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,760
 As you can tell from the story,

398
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,440
 from verses nine and following, as we close this story,

399
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,240
 it says, "When the master of ceremonies tasted the water

400
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:51,160
 "that is now best wine," indeed, best wine,

401
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,320
 "not knowing where it had come from."

402
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,440
 Though of course the servants knew.

403
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,080
 He called the bridegroom over and he said,

404
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,400
 "Posts always serve the best wine first."

405
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,000
 You know, because the banquet is so long, right?

406
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,240
 So many days.

407
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,760
 So they usually serve the best wine in the beginning.

408
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,600
 And then when people get drunk, right,

409
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,000
 they can't tell whether it's beer or wine

410
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,080
 or bad wine or good wine.

411
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,040
 At the end of the banquet, they cannot tell.

412
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,880
 When everyone has had a lot to drink,

413
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,400
 he brings out the less expensive wine.

414
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,320
 However, you have kept the best wine until now.

415
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:37,280
 Verse 11, "The miraculous sign at Cana in Galilee

416
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,040
 "was the first time Jesus revealed his glory

417
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:43,560
 "and his disciples believed in him."

418
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:47,720
 Now this interesting miracle shows the glory of Jesus.

419
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:53,720
 Part of his glory, not the full glory of God

420
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:57,160
 being displayed here, but his miracle

421
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:00,320
 saves the family from shame, disaster,

422
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,800
 to honor and glory.

423
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:08,680
 And that is the first miracle recorded by John.

424
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,760
 And the miracle tells what Jesus does

425
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,760
 in the lives of the people.

426
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,600
 And often we find ourselves in situation of embarrassment.

427
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,840
 We find situation of shame.

428
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:26,000
 But Jesus is able to save us from shame.

429
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,560
 Now you think about it, this story is being recorded

430
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,840
 and being included in the gospel.

431
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,800
 It's very meaningful.

432
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,840
 Because that is what the gospel of Jesus is all about.

433
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:42,240
 To save us from shame and embarrassment.

434
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,760
 Save us from shame into glory.

435
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:48,680
 Now let me close by reminding you

436
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,920
 what the gospel is all about.

437
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,680
 If you read the Bible from the first page,

438
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:57,840
 almost to the end, read the whole Bible through and through,

439
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,800
 you will see a lot of examples,

440
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:07,160
 a lot of lives of people that have been saved by God,

441
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:10,160
 saved from shame to glory.

442
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:15,360
 Let me give you some examples.

443
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,560
 Adam, the first man, when he sinned against God,

444
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,720
 when he rebelled against God,

445
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,000
 he was hiding from God, right?

446
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,880
 And he discovered that he was naked.

447
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,960
 It's a metaphorical way to describe shame, right?

448
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,160
 Guilt.

449
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:38,200
 And Adam, a sinful Adam, was shame covered, right?

450
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:44,600
 But God made a garment to cover his shame, his guilt.

451
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:51,680
 The Israelites in Egypt, they were in a shameful situation.

452
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,520
 They were being enslaved.

453
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,680
 But God saved them by grace out of Egypt, the Exodus.

454
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:01,400
 And Rahab, you remember the Israelites,

455
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,720
 after 40 years of wandering in the desert,

456
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,880
 and they came into the land of promise,

457
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:13,200
 and they came to Jericho,

458
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,440
 and they found this woman called Rahab.

459
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,880
 And Rahab was a prostitute,

460
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,880
 and he was doomed to destruction.

461
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,120
 But she turned to Yahweh, the true God,

462
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:30,360
 and she was saved from shame to honor.

463
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:36,280
 And Ruth, you know, the great-grandmother of King David,

464
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:41,520
 she was originally a foreigner, a Moabite,

465
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:46,080
 someone despised by the Israelites' society

466
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,640
 because they are just foreigner, Moabites.

467
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,160
 She was a widow, so, so shame.

468
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:57,040
 But she was redeemed, being included

469
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,200
 into genealogy of King David,

470
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,360
 and indeed, the genealogy of Jesus, from shame to honor.

471
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:09,920
 The Jews who went to exile in the Babylonian period,

472
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:13,680
 they returned from exile, and God saved them,

473
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,400
 again, from shame to glory.

474
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,560
 Now to the New Testament, Peter, the head of the disciples,

475
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,880
 the leader of the disciples,

476
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,800
 three times he denied Jesus, right?

477
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:33,800
 He was being shamed, failed, but Jesus came back.

478
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:38,440
 He rose from the dead,

479
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:42,160
 and he came to Peter and restored him.

480
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:45,400
 Even our Lord Jesus, he suffered shame,

481
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:49,560
 but honored by God's glory.

482
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:54,120
 Now, as I remind you, Good Friday is approaching.

483
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,680
 Easter is approaching.

484
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,440
 So often when we think of Good Friday,

485
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,200
 Jesus being crucified on the cross,

486
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,120
 we think of something physically painful.

487
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,800
 Of course, it was painful, extremely painful.

488
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,840
 But the cross, crucifixion, is not just about pain.

489
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,240
 It's about shame.

490
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,440
 That's why victims of crucifixion

491
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:21,840
 is always being crucified, being displayed

492
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,760
 in a public way, right?

493
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,600
 On the street.

494
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,440
 But our Lord Jesus suffered shame,

495
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,640
 but honored by God's glory.

496
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:37,520
 He died in shame, but he rose in glory

497
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,680
 and seated at the right hand of the Father.

498
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,200
 And that is the essence of the gospel,

499
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,000
 turning our shame into glory.

500
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,040
 And that is only available in Jesus Christ.

501
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:53,200
 We were sinners, but we are now forgiven

502
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,080
 because of what Jesus has done for us.

503
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,320
 We may have loads of guilt in our life.

504
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:02,920
 We feel ourself unworthy.

505
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,360
 We question our own self-worth.

506
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:09,160
 We look in the mirror and we always think

507
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:13,400
 we are not worthy or we're worth less than other people.

508
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,360
 Right?

509
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,040
 Physically or even our own life.

510
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,080
 We just cannot compare with other people

511
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,240
 and feel kind of shameful.

512
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,840
 But lo and behold, the gospel tells us

513
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,080
 Jesus raised us with Jesus.

514
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:33,880
 Jesus raised us from death, from shame.

515
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,400
 And we stand totally righteous before God.

516
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,600
 And that is the gospel.

517
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,360
 We may feel unworthy.

518
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,720
 We may feel sin-loaded.

519
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:52,800
 But Jesus came to forgive all of our sins.

520
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,160
 And that is the freedom of the gospel.

521
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,000
 Right?

522
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,920
 Praise God.

523
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,920
 Let's all pray together.

524
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,960
 And come before God.

525
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,800
 Yeah, we know we have been shamed.

526
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:08,040
 And sometimes we shame ourselves.

527
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:08,880
 Right?

528
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,240
 We feel unworthy.

529
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,360
 Yet, at the foot of the cross,

530
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,360
 we are accepted, redeemed, and totally forgiven.

531
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,640
 Let's all pray together.

532
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:26,120
 Father, we want to give you thanks.

533
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:31,200
 For Jesus, your son, has died on the cross

534
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,520
 to pay the price

535
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:37,320
 in forgiving all of our sins.

536
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,480
 Father, thank you.

537
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,960
 Thank you for saving us from sin, from guilt,

538
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,480
 from shame, from unworthiness.

539
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:50,000
 And now we are your glorious sons and daughters

540
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,320
 standing righteous before you.

541
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:57,040
 Only because Jesus has paid the price,

542
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,360
 paid for our debt,

543
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,360
 and suffered our shame.

544
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,280
 You turn us from shame to glory,

545
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,840
 from dust to glory.

546
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,320
 And thank you for your love.

547
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,560
 May our lives be encouraged and transformed

548
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,880
 by your gospel,

549
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:20,600
 by what Jesus has done for us on the cross.

550
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,040
 And thank you.

551
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,200
 In Christ's name, we pray.

552
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,680
 All right, thank God for seeing all of you.

553
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,800
 And next week, we're gonna worship together.

554
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:34,720
 And I know there's some freshmen out there, right?

555
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,560
 Yeah.

556
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:39,760
 And enjoy our time of worship, fellowship together.

557
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,600
 All right, God bless.
