[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.880]   Good morning, UV.
[00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.880]   It is good to be able to worship with you this morning.
[00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.960]   And as Pastor Mark say, it's good to see some old faces back
[00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.280]   and also some new faces as well this morning.
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.280]   So welcome and thank you for joining us.
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.240]   So what are some of the hardest things
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.600]   that you have been asked to do before?
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.760]   Or if you think about it,
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.800]   what are some of the most challenging tasks
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.040]   that you have gone through?
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.120]   As I reflect on my personal experience,
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.560]   I think they usually fall under a few categories.
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.640]   Some of these things are hard
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.520]   because they test our human limits
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.440]   and they push us to our very edge,
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.100]   intellectually, emotionally, or physically.
[00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.080]   This October, I will be running
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.800]   the Chicago Marathon as well.
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.480]   And even though I'm looking forward to it,
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.040]   there's also part of me that is somewhat nervous about it
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.440]   because I know that in order for me
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.760]   to finish these 26.2 miles,
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.140]   it will push me to my very limit.
[00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.840]   And on the other hand,
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.120]   some of the things are challenging
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.640]   because they require us to face our own fears.
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.040]   Think of extreme activities like skydiving,
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.280]   bungee jumping,
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.760]   or even small things like catching a cockroach or a spider.
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.320]   Right?
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.760]   And then there are certain things
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.040]   that are hard and challenging
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.880]   because of what they require from us
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.620]   to sacrifice our own preference.
[00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.920]   So the passage that we will be looking at today
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.960]   contains one of the most radical teachings
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.460]   and challenging commands from Jesus himself.
[00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.880]   It is difficult and challenging
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.360]   not because it pushes to our limits
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.840]   or it requires us to face our fears,
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.120]   but it is difficult because in order to do
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.880]   what Jesus has told us to do here,
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.500]   it requires us to completely deny ourself
[00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.320]   and our own self-interest.
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.880]   To put it another way,
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.400]   if we're not willing to give up our own pride,
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.280]   our preference, our convenience,
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.380]   our comfort, or the illusion of control that we have,
[00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.960]   this command from Jesus will almost be impossible
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.040]   for us to live out.
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.200]   So if you have your Bible with you,
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.800]   let's turn with me to Matthew chapter five.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.280]   We're gonna look from verse 43 to 48 today.
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.960]   So Matthew chapter five, 43 to 48.
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.200]   But before we dive into God's word,
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.840]   let's pray that his spirit will be with us
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.160]   as we open up his words.
[00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.680]   Father, we thank you that we're able
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.800]   to come into your house this morning
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.840]   to lift up our praise to worship you.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.340]   And as we open up your words now,
[00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.360]   I just ask that your Holy Spirit will be with us.
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.840]   I ask that your words
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.740]   will not just be knowledge for us,
[00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.040]   but it will be truth that will be able
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.220]   to transform our life,
[00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.080]   so that we're able to live in a way
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.000]   that brings honors and glory to you.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.400]   Amen.
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.340]   So, Matthew chapter five, verse 43.
[00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.180]   You have heard that it was said,
[00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.620]   love your neighbor and hate your enemy.
[00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.940]   But I tell you, love your enemies
[00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.840]   and pray for those who persecute you,
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.000]   that you may be children of your Father in heaven.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.520]   He causes his son to rise on the evil
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.100]   and the good,
[00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.660]   and sends rain to the righteous and the unrighteous.
[00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.160]   If you love those who love you,
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.220]   what reward will you get?
[00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.500]   Are not even the tax collectors doing that?
[00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.160]   And if you greet only your own people,
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.480]   what are you doing more than others?
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.260]   Do not even the pagans do that.
[00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:25.000]   Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.020]   This is the word of God.
[00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.680]   So today, we actually come to the end of Matthew chapter five
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.380]   and our passage today serve as sort of a conclusion
[00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.140]   to this first major sections in the Sermon on the Mount,
[00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.820]   where we look at the relationship of the Old Testament law
[00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.200]   to the new covenant of Jesus.
[00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.400]   And if you can recall, we begin this section
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.840]   by looking at what a truly blessed life is.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.560]   And we come to this truth that
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.120]   because Jesus has fulfilled the law and the prophet,
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.200]   to enter into his kingdom
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.240]   and to experience this truly blessed life,
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.180]   it doesn't depend on our own righteousness,
[00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.680]   but the righteousness of Jesus alone.
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.240]   And right after that,
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.700]   we look at a series of case studies on how Jesus,
[00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.640]   now being the definite interpreter of the law,
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.600]   redefines what true righteousness mean
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.600]   in his kingdom of heaven,
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.140]   in contrast to the righteousness according to the Pharisees,
[00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.040]   the teachers of the laws,
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.620]   or the Jewish religion or Jewish tradition.
[00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.240]   In the past couple months,
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.040]   we have looked at anger and murder,
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.480]   lust and adultery,
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.560]   divorce,
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.540]   making oath,
[00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.320]   and also the law of retribution.
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.840]   And how each and every time,
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.240]   Jesus shows us his better way and his greater righteousness
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.280]   that points back to God's original intention
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.460]   behind this law.
[00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.600]   If you remember, he always introduced them by saying,
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:05.600]   "You have heard that it was said, but I tell you this."
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.400]   So our passage this morning is actually the sixth
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.840]   and also the final examples
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.500]   that will pretty much sum up these entire sections.
[00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:15.940]   So for my sermon this morning,
[00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.100]   we will first look at the command from Jesus,
[00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.660]   and then we'll look at the reason behind his command,
[00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.260]   and then we will end with the ultimate goal.
[00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:29.860]   So the command, the reason, and the goal.
[00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.100]   So let's look at the first part, the command.
[00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:36.180]   Verse 43.
[00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.140]   You have heard that it was said,
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.040]   love your neighbor and hate your enemy.
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.520]   But I tell you, love your enemies
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.080]   and pray for those who persecute you.
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:50.160]   So once again, Jesus begins his teaching with this formula.
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.020]   You have heard that it was said.
[00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:56.520]   And the first half of this quote, to love your neighbor,
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.280]   actually comes from Leviticus 19.18.
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:04.180]   And alongside Deuteronomy 6.5, which is the Shema,
[00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:06.860]   to love your Lord your God with all your heart,
[00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.640]   with all your soul, with all your strength.
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:13.200]   Jesus, he sums up the entire Old Testament law
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.200]   with these two commandments later in the book of Matthew.
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:22.260]   As for the second half of this quote, hate your enemies,
[00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:26.040]   the origin of this second half is a little more ambiguous.
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:30.080]   In the book of Deuteronomy, as the people of Israel
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:33.280]   are about to enter into the promised land,
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.440]   the Lord gave them this instruction
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:38.280]   to drive out all the enemies or the inhabitants
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:39.980]   of the land of Canaan,
[00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:43.360]   and pretty much devote these people to destruction.
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.480]   And so this quote, to hate your enemy,
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.360]   may be an inference that is drawn
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.320]   from those passage in Deuteronomy.
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:53.840]   On the other hand, this idea of hating your enemy
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.980]   may also come as a logical conclusion
[00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:59.100]   from the command to love your neighbor.
[00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:03.600]   In Leviticus 19, when the Lord commanded the Israelites
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.840]   to love their neighbor, the neighbor there
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:10.800]   was clearly referring to a fellow Israelites.
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.320]   And so when it comes to Jesus' day,
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.400]   some of the Jewish people, they take this command
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.020]   and draw the conclusion that, okay,
[00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:21.640]   if we are only called to love our neighbors,
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.860]   that probably means we can hate our enemies.
[00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:28.640]   So do you see how twisted our human heart can be
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:32.280]   when we take a positive command from God
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.360]   to love our neighbor,
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.880]   and pretty much turn it into a license to hate?
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:42.120]   So how does Jesus address this false narrative
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.280]   and misunderstanding?
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:50.080]   Verse 44, "But I tell you, love your enemies
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:53.560]   "and pray for those who persecute you."
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:56.240]   So Jesus couldn't be any more clearer here,
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.200]   but to most of Jesus' Jewish audience at that time,
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.280]   this probably comes as quite a shocking command.
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.840]   And even for most of us today,
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:09.580]   I would assume that this is still quite a radical command
[00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:11.880]   and a tall task for us, right,
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.120]   to actually love our enemies.
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:18.080]   And one thing to clarify here,
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.480]   when we hear the word love,
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:23.840]   what are some of the things that come to your mind?
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.300]   I feel like in our current day and age,
[00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:28.880]   this word love has become like a catch-all phrase
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:32.200]   for all sorts of different ideas and different feelings
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.920]   and different thoughts, right?
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:38.040]   You might say, "Oh, I love pineapple on my pizza."
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.640]   Or you say, "Oh, I love the Chicago Bears.
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.800]   "I hope they do well this season."
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:46.200]   Or you might say to your significant others, "I love you."
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.980]   Or you say to God, "God, I love you."
[00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:51.460]   Do you notice the issues here?
[00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:54.180]   The word love has been used
[00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:57.160]   in such a wide range of applications
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.920]   that it has lost its significance
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:01.800]   when it comes to the way that Jesus
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.560]   and the Bible talks about love.
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:08.360]   And so when Jesus give us the command to love your enemy,
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.300]   what kind of love is he referring to?
[00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:12.360]   Is it the kind of love
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:15.400]   that you like to have pineapple on your pizza
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:18.580]   or the love that you have for your significant others?
[00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:25.000]   Well, love in the sense that Jesus talks about
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.520]   is not just about having a passion for something
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:31.840]   or a deep affection for someone
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:35.200]   because those feelings will fade over time, right?
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:40.720]   Yes, it is true that love includes all of those feelings,
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:45.720]   but more importantly, love is about action and commitment.
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:49.840]   And love entails accountability and responsibility.
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:52.480]   So let me read a passage from 1 John
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:56.400]   that will help us better understand what love is
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.360]   according to Jesus.
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:01.080]   So 1 John 3, 16.
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.840]   "This is how we know what love is.
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:07.200]   "Jesus Christ laid down his life for us,
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.940]   "and we ought to lay down our lives
[00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:11.000]   "for our brothers and sisters.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.600]   "If anyone has material possessions
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:17.440]   "and sees a brother or sister in need
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.460]   "but has no pity on them,
[00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:22.260]   "how can the love of God be in that person?
[00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:27.980]   "Dear children, let us not love with words or speech,
[00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:30.940]   "but with actions and in truth."
[00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:35.620]   So church, love is more than just the feelings.
[00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:38.180]   I hope that doesn't come as a surprise for you,
[00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:42.340]   but it is also about actions and truth.
[00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:45.020]   This kind of love is generous,
[00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:47.500]   yet costly at the same time
[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:51.780]   because it requires us to lay down our own kingdom
[00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:54.680]   and commit to seeking the good of others.
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:58.300]   In other words, this is a love
[00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:01.580]   that is shaped after Jesus and his cross.
[00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:03.480]   This is a kind of cruciform love.
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:07.520]   And this cruciform love model after Jesus
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:10.620]   is being lived out when we, as his followers,
[00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:13.620]   are able to actively love our enemies
[00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:16.900]   and genuinely pray for those who are hostile
[00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:18.620]   or unkind to us.
[00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:21.180]   And in the Greek grammar,
[00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:24.900]   both of the verb to love and to pray
[00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:28.980]   stress that this command is to be lived out now
[00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:31.780]   and not just towards a singular enemy,
[00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:35.000]   but to all who we consider as enemies.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:41.380]   So is loving our enemies easy?
[00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:42.380]   Of course not.
[00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:45.460]   And is responding to kindness
[00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:48.340]   towards those who are hostile towards us
[00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:49.580]   a challenging task?
[00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:53.260]   Of course it is.
[00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:57.620]   This is because in our fallen and unglorified state,
[00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:00.580]   we all have an inward curse towards ourself,
[00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:03.100]   as St. Augustine has pointed out.
[00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:08.060]   That is the tendency to always focus inward on ourself,
[00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:11.060]   on our needs, on our desires,
[00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:14.460]   rather than on God and other people.
[00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:17.160]   So of course, to love our enemies
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.360]   and pray for those who persecute us
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.340]   is not going to come easy
[00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:24.060]   because it requires us to act in a way
[00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:27.940]   that is contrary to our human nature, corrupted by sin.
[00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:32.680]   But why does Jesus command us to do so right here?
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:35.580]   And even more, to use this command
[00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:38.060]   as a summary to his entire teaching
[00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:39.820]   regarding the better righteousness
[00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:42.740]   that is required to enter into his kingdom.
[00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:46.640]   So let us look at the why behind this command now.
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.800]   (silence)
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:57.460]   Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you
[00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:01.620]   in order that you may be children of your Father in heaven.
[00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:05.460]   He causes his son to rise on the evil and the good
[00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:09.540]   and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.
[00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:12.540]   So what is the reason behind Jesus' command
[00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:14.460]   to love our enemies?
[00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:18.220]   It is to imitate the character of our heavenly Father,
[00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:21.340]   who is gracious and compassionate,
[00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:25.780]   slow to anger and abounding in steadfast and loyal love.
[00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:30.460]   To love our enemies and pray for those who persecute us
[00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:33.340]   shows that we don't belong to this world,
[00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:37.320]   but we belong to another kingdom that is above.
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:43.300]   And moreover, God himself also loves impartially
[00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:47.620]   by bestowing his blessings on both the evil and the good,
[00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:51.180]   the righteous and the unrighteous.
[00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:57.040]   So yes, while loving our enemies is not easy,
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:02.040]   we are able to love radically because God loved us first,
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:04.420]   regardless of our actions.
[00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:07.380]   Paul in Romans 5 said this,
[00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:12.380]   "Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous person,
[00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:14.080]   "though for a good person,
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.620]   "someone might possibly dare to die.
[00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:21.900]   "But God demonstrate his own love for us in this.
[00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:26.060]   "While we were still sinners, Christ died for us."
[00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:28.740]   Did you catch that?
[00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:34.260]   While we were still sinners and enemies of God,
[00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:38.080]   Jesus Christ, the son of God, died for all of us.
[00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:42.460]   And so as God's people, we don't have the excuse
[00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:46.380]   to not love in the way that God loves us
[00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:49.720]   and loves in the way that reflects our heavenly father.
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:53.700]   Think of the most evil person
[00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:55.800]   that you can think of in your life,
[00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:59.340]   or someone that you would consider as your worst enemies.
[00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:03.220]   And guess what?
[00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:06.420]   He or she is still made in the image of God
[00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:09.460]   and deeply loved by God, our heavenly father.
[00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:12.180]   So again, as God's people,
[00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:16.580]   we are to reflect this loving character of our father,
[00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:19.660]   even towards those that we rather
[00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:21.340]   would have nothing to do with.
[00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:23.780]   Right?
[00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:29.220]   And then Jesus tries to bring his point home
[00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:33.780]   by using two rhetorical questions in verse 46 and 47.
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.420]   So if you are not familiar
[00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:38.640]   with what rhetorical questions are,
[00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:41.800]   these are questions posed usually to provoke thoughts
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:45.120]   rather than to actually get a response.
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:47.840]   And rhetorical questions,
[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:51.800]   they have the functions of drawing attention to something
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.160]   or highlighting a point.
[00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:56.040]   So with these two rhetorical questions,
[00:16:56.040 --> 00:17:00.280]   Jesus is trying to draw his audience to his point.
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:01.800]   So verse 46,
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:05.600]   if you love those who love you,
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:07.620]   what reward will you get?
[00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:10.060]   Are not even the tax collectors doing that?
[00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:14.000]   So a little context about the tax collectors.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.920]   Tax collectors during Jesus' times
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:18.880]   are being viewed as traitors,
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:23.020]   and they're people that are being despised by the Jews.
[00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:24.920]   So the tax collectors,
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:26.720]   they're usually Jewish people
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:29.320]   who works for the Roman government
[00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:31.400]   to collect taxes from their own people.
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.800]   And the common practice for these tax collectors
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:36.520]   is they're actually allowed to collect
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:39.000]   more than that is required,
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.440]   and then they can just pocket
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:42.880]   the rest of the money for themself.
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:44.840]   And so these Jewish tax collectors,
[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:46.920]   they pretty much build their wealth
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:50.500]   by quote-unquote daylight robbing their own people,
[00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:53.760]   and that is why they're being despised by the Jews as well.
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:57.680]   And so what Jesus is trying to say here is this.
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:01.760]   Even the tax collectors whom all of you despise
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:04.800]   can reciprocate love to their friends.
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.880]   There's nothing to brag about it
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:09.000]   if you, as my followers,
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.600]   are able to love those who only love you back.
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:16.280]   And then Jesus continues, verse 47.
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:18.760]   And if you greet only your own people,
[00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:20.960]   what are you doing more than the others?
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:22.760]   Do not even the pagans do that?
[00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:26.840]   And so here from 46 to 47,
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:29.760]   Jesus moves from within the Jewish community
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:32.760]   to those who are outside the Jewish community now,
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:36.400]   and he used the Gentiles or the pagans as the examples.
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.000]   And greetings in that culture
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.020]   is closely tied to someone's social status as well.
[00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:45.080]   So especially for those who hold
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:47.840]   a higher social status in a society,
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.120]   they like to exchange greetings with other people
[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:53.720]   so that they can hear other people calling them their title
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:56.160]   or kind of like highlighting their status, right?
[00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:59.880]   Again, the point that Jesus is trying to make is this.
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:02.480]   If the pagans or the Gentiles
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:07.480]   in which you Jewish people consider as inferior to you all,
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.840]   they are able to reciprocate the greetings
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:11.480]   that come from their own people.
[00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:15.480]   You all, as my disciples,
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:18.280]   you should be able to do much better.
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:21.680]   You should be able to show the same respect and honor
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:24.840]   to other people, including your enemies.
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:27.200]   (smacks lips)
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.560]   So at this point,
[00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:32.300]   we have gone through all six of these case studies
[00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:35.600]   or examples on what true righteousness is
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:37.720]   according to Jesus, right?
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:41.640]   And each and every time we see how Jesus redefines
[00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:45.400]   what true righteousness is compared to the law
[00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:48.140]   on how it was being understood by the Jewish people.
[00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:51.840]   And so what is the purpose of Jesus' teachings here
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:53.280]   in revealing the heart of God
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:56.360]   behind all these laws and commandment?
[00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:58.400]   What is the ultimate goal that Jesus has?
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:01.220]   Let us look at verse 48 here.
[00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:08.600]   "Be perfect therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect."
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:13.520]   Here, we see Jesus refers to the heavenly Father once again
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:17.340]   as the model for all of us to follow,
[00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:20.580]   recalling His command earlier to love our enemies
[00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:22.980]   and pray for those who persecute us
[00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:26.040]   in order that we can be children of our heavenly Father.
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:31.560]   On the surface level, this call to be perfect
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:35.880]   sounds kind of like a commandment that is almost impossible
[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:38.480]   for us to achieve on this side of heaven, right?
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:42.600]   However, the word perfect here,
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:45.560]   instead of referring to absolute sinlessness
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:50.440]   or perfect in a way that is like blameless and never sin,
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:53.160]   the Greek word for perfect here, teleos,
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:56.040]   actually reflects more of the idea
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:58.700]   of wholeness or completeness.
[00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:02.440]   And besides, the idea of perfection
[00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:03.840]   that Jesus talks about here
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:06.560]   is actually more functional as well,
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:07.840]   rather than positional.
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:10.000]   What does that mean?
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.160]   So for example, if a thing is able to fulfill
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:15.840]   its intended purpose or function
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:18.580]   or reach its full development,
[00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:23.080]   it can be considered as perfect or teleos in that sense.
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:28.080]   So if a puppy is able to grow to its full-grown stature,
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:31.580]   it is considered as teleos.
[00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:35.420]   Or if this wireless microphone is able to function
[00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:37.720]   in the way that it is supposed to function
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:40.020]   and that it is created to function,
[00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:43.800]   it can be considered as teleos and perfect as well.
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:48.280]   And when it comes to us as human,
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:49.600]   this begs the question,
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:53.940]   what purpose are we as humans created for?
[00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:57.800]   As you all know, we as human,
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:00.480]   we are made in the image of God.
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:04.640]   And as image bearer and ambassador of God's kingdom,
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:08.800]   we are to reflect the character of our heavenly father
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:11.160]   and represent him in this world,
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:13.160]   just as a diplomatic ambassador
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:15.260]   will represent his or her country, right?
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:19.080]   And as we have seen in our passage,
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:23.840]   our heavenly father is one who loves impartially
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:28.000]   by making his son rise to both the good and the evil
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.880]   and causing rain to fall on both the righteous
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:31.980]   and the unrighteous.
[00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:35.280]   And in Romans 5, we see that he is a God
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:38.360]   who loves radically and generously
[00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:43.280]   by sending his own son to die in our place for our good.
[00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:50.320]   All this while we're still sinners and enemies of the cross.
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:55.280]   So when we are able to reproduce this kind of life
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:59.120]   that fully exemplifies the character of our heavenly father,
[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:01.280]   one that is marked by radical,
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:04.520]   self-sacrificing, cruciform love,
[00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:07.760]   we fulfill the purpose in which we are made for.
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:10.520]   And therefore, we can be considered perfect
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:12.420]   or teleos in that sense.
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:16.940]   So to be perfect as our heavenly father is perfect
[00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:20.340]   means that conformity to the character of our God
[00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:25.020]   and the image of Christ should be the goal of our words,
[00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:29.180]   the goal of our actions, our thoughts,
[00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:32.820]   and the way we relate to those that are around us,
[00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:34.540]   friends and foes alike.
[00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:40.020]   So if you're taking notes, you can write this down.
[00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:44.560]   The point of all of this is as the children of God,
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:47.480]   we are called to a lifelong journey
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:51.300]   of becoming more and more like our heavenly father.
[00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:55.280]   Notice that this is not an instantaneous thing,
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:57.800]   that when we put our faith in Jesus,
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:00.920]   we instantly become like our heavenly father.
[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:02.620]   But this is a lifelong journey.
[00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:07.360]   And this includes the way we relate to other people
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:09.000]   made in his image.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.480]   If you recall our passage on anger and contempt,
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:14.560]   as well as on adultery and lust.
[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:19.400]   And this also includes the way we view marriage and divorce,
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:24.880]   the way we use our words, whether we speak truthfully,
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:28.720]   the way we respond to evil,
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:34.360]   and ultimately, in the way we love other people,
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:37.840]   especially those that we consider as our enemies.
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:42.240]   And church, this is the surpassing righteousness
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:44.520]   that Jesus is referring to,
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:46.860]   one that is in perfect alignment
[00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:48.960]   with the heart of our heavenly father.
[00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:53.080]   So again, as the children of God,
[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:55.600]   our goal on this side of heaven
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:58.200]   is to continually work towards becoming
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:01.300]   more and more like our heavenly father.
[00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:08.080]   So I just want to end with this story.
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:11.240]   So last Sunday, after our general assembly,
[00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:12.960]   if you were here, you might remember
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:15.880]   that there was just a huge thunderstorm, right?
[00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:18.400]   So after that, I offered to drive
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:21.940]   one of the members from UV home.
[00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:24.520]   But sometime between dropping him off
[00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:26.680]   and getting home myself,
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:30.420]   I think my car probably ran over some nail at some point.
[00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:34.040]   Because later that evening, when I was driving again,
[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:36.360]   I started to notice some weird noise
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:39.360]   coming out from behind my car.
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:41.520]   And when I stopped and take a look,
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:43.360]   this is what I see.
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.000]   I had a flat tire.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.280]   And at that point, I was only about 10 minutes
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:50.800]   away from home, so I'm like,
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:54.400]   okay, I'm not gonna call a tow truck or trip away
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.120]   because it might take them a while.
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:57.960]   And I'm so close to home,
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:01.300]   I'm just gonna drive home with this flat tire.
[00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:05.420]   But as I was driving, the noise just keep getting
[00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:08.840]   weirder and weirder and louder and louder.
[00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:12.560]   And me personally, I also became more and more frustrated.
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:14.440]   And in my mind, I was like,
[00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:16.560]   whoever is responsible for that nail
[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:19.160]   like dropping on the street, like screw you.
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:20.420]   I hope you had a bad day.
[00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:25.440]   Monday morning came, I brought my car to the shop
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:27.160]   to get it fixed.
[00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:28.800]   And the first thing in the morning,
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:30.320]   like the very first thing in the morning,
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:33.320]   so that I can pretty much spend the rest of my day
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:36.060]   to have some like focus time to prepare
[00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:37.200]   for my sermon today.
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:41.440]   But as I read through this passage from Matthew five,
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:44.020]   with the frustration that I had
[00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:47.100]   towards the flat tire situation still fresh in my mind,
[00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:50.500]   this word really just stood out to me,
[00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:54.360]   to love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:58.560]   And even though this is just such a small incident,
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:01.600]   I realized that for me to love and pray for whoever
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:03.880]   that is responsible for that nail,
[00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:05.680]   it doesn't come natural to me.
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:10.680]   I have to kind of like, in some ways, like humble myself
[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:13.040]   and come before the Lord.
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:16.000]   It's like, okay, Lord, like that is not the way
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.680]   I should respond yesterday.
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:21.680]   And it takes a lot of intentionality out of me as well.
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:26.000]   So this call from Jesus to be perfect
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.520]   as our heavenly father is perfect,
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:31.080]   requires a lot of intentionality,
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:32.500]   as well as discipline.
[00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:35.620]   To understand our father's heart,
[00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:37.300]   we need to spend time with him.
[00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:40.980]   We need to immerse ourself in his words.
[00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:45.380]   And to become more like our father in heaven,
[00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:48.640]   we need to allow the Holy Spirit to work in our hearts
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:51.900]   and transform us from the inside out.
[00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:55.400]   The righteousness of Jesus
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:59.160]   is not about outward behavioral management,
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:02.000]   but it comes from a heart that is truly transformed
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.600]   by Jesus and his gospel.
[00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:07.760]   And this is a process that will last until the day
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:10.480]   that we're able to meet Jesus face-to-face.
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:14.600]   So it requires a posture of constant obedience
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:16.920]   and a process of constant surrendering
[00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:18.240]   in our day-to-day life.
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:22.280]   So I want to leave with these questions
[00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:23.640]   for us to reflect on.
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:28.240]   Who are some people whom you would consider
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:29.960]   as your enemies?
[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:32.540]   Or who are some people who have wronged you?
[00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:37.140]   And in light of our passage this morning,
[00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:39.800]   how can you show the love of Christ to them
[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:42.900]   in a way that reflect the love you have received
[00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:44.240]   from our heavenly father?
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:47.960]   So I'll have Amanda come up to
[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:50.760]   play some background music
[00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:52.600]   and just take some time to reflect on it,
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:55.820]   and I will end this with a prayer in a couple of minutes.
[00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:58.400]   (gentle music)
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:01.820]   (gentle music continues)
[00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:05.240]   (gentle music continues)
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:08.660]   (gentle music continues)
[00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:12.080]   (gentle music continues)
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:15.500]   (gentle music continues)
[00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:18.920]   (gentle music continues)
[00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:22.340]   (gentle music continues)
[00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:25.760]   (gentle music continues)
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:45.260]   (baby crying)
[00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:48.680]   (gentle music continues)
[00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:52.100]   (gentle music continues)
[00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:55.520]   (gentle music continues)
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:58.940]   (gentle music continues)
[00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:02.360]   (gentle music continues)
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:28.660]   (thunder rumbling)
[00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:32.080]   (gentle music continues)
[00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:45.080]   Heavenly father,
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:50.800]   we thank you that while we were still sinners,
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:53.760]   while we were still enemies,
[00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:57.360]   you sent your son, Jesus Christ,
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:00.360]   to die on our behalf for our good.
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:05.600]   Help us, father, to be people
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:09.100]   that reflects your loving character to those around us.
[00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:13.700]   Help us to become people that love in a way
[00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:17.760]   that we're willing to sacrifice our own preference,
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:21.020]   our own comforts, our own conveniences.
[00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:26.240]   Help us to love in a way that when the world see us,
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:29.340]   that they will know that we belong to you,
[00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:32.440]   that we can bring glory and honor to your name.
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:36.940]   So again, father, thank you for your word this morning.
[00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:39.120]   We pray this in your son's name, amen.
[00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:44.560]   All right, thank you for joining us this morning.
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:47.320]   We will have some refreshment outside,
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:51.180]   so I encourage you all to stay after our service
[00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:54.240]   and just hang out, get to know some new people,
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:57.300]   and yeah, enjoy fellowship with one another.
[00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:59.360]   All right, go in peace, UV, your love.
