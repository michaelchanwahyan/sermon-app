[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040]   - Good morning, everyone.
[00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.880]   Well, I've been sick for a few days,
[00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.240]   so I've been suffering too.
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.080]   But that's okay, yeah.
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.880]   It's the last day of 2023.
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.080]   Today's the last day, as Jinfan said.
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.960]   This is, I think this is the best way
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.120]   we can conclude this year,
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.500]   end with the Lord's Day on Sunday.
[00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.840]   As we go from one year to the next,
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.480]   we will think about New Year resolutions, right?
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.320]   - Yes.
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.140]   - We all do, right?
[00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.980]   - Yes.
[00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.760]   - So what do you have in mind?
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.800]   Maybe physical exercise, learn something new,
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.040]   or maybe financial planning and all that.
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.080]   Maybe for those who go to school,
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.280]   probably you have some new plannings as well.
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.280]   Maybe for questions,
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.160]   sometimes we talk about reading the Bible together.
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.480]   Have we done the Bible reading last year?
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.320]   - Yes.
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.160]   - We finished it, right?
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.680]   No, I didn't finish it, I didn't join it.
[00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.520]   - Some of them.
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.560]   - Some of them, right?
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.640]   Well, give them a hand, yeah, give them a hand.
[00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.000]   Yeah, very good, very good.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.480]   Usually churches do is to have some big sign
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.760]   or big banner saying,
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.480]   "New Year, we're gonna do this or do that," right?
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.640]   "We're gonna expand our church,
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.080]   "and we're gonna grow together,"
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.880]   and something like that.
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.000]   Today, I want to do something a little bit different.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.400]   I want to tell you how life transformation work.
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.700]   Because as we set the New Year goals,
[00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.800]   as we set the New Year resolutions,
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.600]   or think about stuff like that,
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.560]   not only we need to set goals,
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.520]   but we need to understand how we reach the goal
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.240]   and how life change works.
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.400]   So my sermon title is Atomic Wisdom.
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.600]   Now, atomic does not mean destructive.
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.280]   Okay, I know there's atomic bomb,
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.280]   but it means tiny and insignificant, atomic particle,
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.840]   something really, really small.
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.280]   And I borrowed this title from a bestseller
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.680]   called "Atomic Habits" by James Clear.
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.080]   And this bestseller is recommended to me this year
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.080]   by actually Amanda, recommend me to read this book.
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.000]   And I find it's very insightful book.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   And the thesis of the book is success,
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.240]   all kinds of success, okay?
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.480]   Whether you're in school, whether you're in career,
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.360]   whether you're just doing exercise,
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.760]   just trying to be strong, all kinds of success
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.400]   is a product of daily, tiny habits,
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.400]   not a once in a lifetime action, you know?
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.400]   All kinds of changes, all kinds of positive changes
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.000]   have to be done in tiny little steps.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.320]   And everyone can do that, and that's the good news.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.680]   Now, this book is packed with insights
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.520]   from behavioral psychology.
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.120]   You know, behavioral psychologists observe the human nature,
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.760]   observe how we work, right, how we behave.
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.760]   And then they summarize the psychological dynamic.
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.600]   And as I read this book,
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.160]   I instantly, I thought of wisdom literature in the Bible.
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.000]   You know wisdom literature?
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.680]   How do you find the wisdom literature in the Bible?
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.400]   It's right in the middle, right?
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.160]   Some of the Psalms and Proverbs, Ecclesiastes,
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.880]   and the Book of Job, and those are wisdom literatures.
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.000]   It's always, wisdom literature has a feature,
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.480]   it is always short and clever sayings, tiny sayings.
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.480]   And it seems to instill us with tiny little wisdom
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.400]   here and there, and tell you some general truth
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.520]   about human nature, general truth about
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.080]   living a life of wisdom, living a life that is successful.
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.880]   Actually, in the Bible,
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.200]   wisdom is defined as practical skill.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.520]   If you have wisdom, you live skillfully.
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.080]   You live skillfully to the life God has given you.
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.720]   So at times in wisdom literature in the Bible,
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.480]   observing human nature, and try to summarize it
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.820]   and teach us some of the general truths.
[00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.700]   So this sermon, I'm going to do some integration.
[00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.720]   I'm gonna go for some of the insights
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.640]   from behavioral psychology, and then we'll go into
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.720]   some of the passages from the Book of Proverbs,
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.400]   wisdom literature.
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.540]   So here, I want you to understand how life change works.
[00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.000]   All right, so whatever you have
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.120]   for your New Year resolutions, all right?
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.360]   If you don't have any New Year resolutions,
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.520]   this is time to think about it, okay?
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.240]   Time to think about it.
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.360]   But if you have New Year resolutions, how does it work?
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.640]   What are the principles that we can bring
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.080]   about changes in our lives?
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.000]   So here we go.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.600]   First principle is the 1% power.
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.820]   1% power.
[00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:18.720]   That you do something tiny on a daily basis,
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.160]   even if this is 1%, and it's seemingly not obvious,
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.880]   the result will be exceptional.
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.360]   Now, so often in any goal we are pursuing,
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.360]   we attempt to set up some of the,
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.720]   some high and unrealistic expectations, right?
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.620]   Like I'm gonna read the whole Bible in two months.
[00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.680]   Okay, good luck to you, all right?
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.240]   You're not gonna happen, right?
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.340]   It's not gonna happen.
[00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:50.720]   If you set the goal, like next year, 2024,
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.180]   you're going to read the entire New Testament in one year,
[00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.320]   that may be more realistic, right?
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.320]   But sometimes when we set up a New Year goal,
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.880]   we have some unrealistic expectations,
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.420]   and it will require exceptional willpower.
[00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.960]   That's why we don't set New Year goals anymore,
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.600]   because we find ourselves failing all the time, right?
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.120]   You don't wanna fail, that's why you don't wanna set goals,
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.240]   right?
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.040]   That's kind of pessimistic, right?
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.040]   It's kind of sad.
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:27.120]   But this book says all kinds of changes happen atomically.
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.840]   Small, tiny changes.
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.400]   And far too often, tiny improvement
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.240]   will create long-term change.
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.160]   And that's how life change works.
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.080]   So think about daily habit.
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:48.600]   Daily, what can you do with just 1% effort, right?
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.560]   There's a chart in the book, I find it very insightful,
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.840]   talking about behavioral psychology.
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:55.880]   When you think of growth,
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.760]   we often think in a straight line, right?
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.160]   Linear progression, that's the red line right there.
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.800]   But actually, life change happens in the curve.
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.440]   In the curve.
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.760]   Notice the beginning of the curve.
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:14.200]   The progress is not obvious.
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:18.160]   And the author named the first phase,
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.000]   you know, it's not obvious in terms of the result.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.760]   You don't see a lot of increase,
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:26.600]   you don't see a lot of obvious improvement yet.
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.920]   That, the yellow part, the author says,
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:32.840]   James Clear says, is the value of disappointment.
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.080]   Because you have done so much, right?
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.920]   And there's no result.
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.680]   And people usually give up at this point.
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.920]   So the encouragement is, if we do the 1%,
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.800]   which everyone can do, right?
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:46.980]   And you persist.
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:53.040]   And then, exponentially, changes will happen.
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:58.520]   So if you do 1% improvement for 365 days,
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:03.520]   the result at the end is 37.78 times better.
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.440]   Right?
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.680]   Isn't that cool?
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:11.380]   If you do just 1% every single day, 365 days,
[00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:16.380]   you will get the improvement result for 37 times.
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:21.920]   But if you do 1% decline, or you do nothing about it,
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.360]   or you keep on your bad habits,
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:29.360]   1% declines for 365 days, your result is close to zero.
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.640]   There's no improvement at all.
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:37.900]   Now, you can talk about any kind of result,
[00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:39.640]   or any kind of goal.
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:44.640]   Relationship, family, career, learning a new skill,
[00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:49.380]   emotional health, spiritual life, spiritual health.
[00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:53.220]   If you do negative talk all the time, right?
[00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:58.220]   You will have the graph, have the line at the bottom.
[00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:03.800]   You will decline, or you will see zero changes in your life.
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:09.180]   But if you do tiny habit, 1%, for 365 days,
[00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:11.960]   you will see a lot of improvements.
[00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:15.420]   Now that makes me think of wisdom literature,
[00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:18.700]   because all this wisdom sayings in the Bible,
[00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.420]   especially in the book of Proverbs,
[00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:24.580]   are usually one verse with two sub-verses,
[00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:26.140]   two parallel statements.
[00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:29.300]   Some of the wisdom sayings are two verses
[00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:33.320]   with parallel statements, but they are repetitive.
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.780]   They are tiny little statement, little and often.
[00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:39.100]   That is the spirit right there.
[00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:42.340]   Proverbs 1.7, that's the beginning of book of Proverbs.
[00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:46.340]   The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge,
[00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:50.940]   but fools despise wisdom and discipline.
[00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:55.320]   The fear of the Lord is the beginning, right?
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.140]   The beginning, remember the beginning part
[00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:00.340]   of the life change curve.
[00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:04.840]   It doesn't see a lot of improvement, right?
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:08.100]   At least in the beginning, but it's so important.
[00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:11.580]   Now Proverbs doesn't do big talk.
[00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:13.460]   He always do small talks.
[00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:16.640]   Talking about beginning here.
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:20.340]   Talking about you persist from the beginning,
[00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:23.860]   then you will see along the line, 1%,
[00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:28.860]   remember 365 days you see potential changes, right?
[00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:33.620]   Three, 30 some times changes.
[00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:38.580]   Now some of the couples who got married in this church
[00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:41.860]   went through the premarital counseling with me.
[00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:46.660]   And the premarital counseling, I have about 10 sessions,
[00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:49.140]   and I always end with this one.
[00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:53.020]   It's a book called Love List.
[00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:56.660]   Now this book, we read this book,
[00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:00.020]   my wife and I read this book in our 10th anniversary,
[00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:01.360]   some years ago, right?
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:04.880]   So we went on a short vacation and we pick a book
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:06.240]   and we read together, right?
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.340]   How romantic is that?
[00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:08.700]   (audience laughing)
[00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:09.940]   So we read the book together.
[00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:13.100]   It's a tiny, tiny book called Love List.
[00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:18.100]   And it's a very interesting book and it's very insightful.
[00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:21.540]   Because people always think that a great relationship
[00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:26.460]   requires a lot of energy, requires a lot of expectations.
[00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:29.500]   Right, you gotta set a very, very high standard.
[00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:31.340]   You gotta do tons of things
[00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:34.900]   in order to have a mature, good relationship.
[00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:36.840]   The book says no.
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.340]   It doesn't work that way.
[00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:41.700]   Have you think about it?
[00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:42.920]   Think about it.
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.340]   It doesn't work that way.
[00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:46.540]   A successful relationship, a good relationship,
[00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:48.860]   doesn't work that way.
[00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:53.060]   It works because there are tiny, daily habits
[00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:55.500]   the couples or the people in the relationship
[00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:57.340]   are committed to do.
[00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:59.180]   And everyone can do it.
[00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:02.680]   And at the end of the book it says,
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.900]   once a day you do two things.
[00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:07.320]   Once a week you do two things.
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:09.620]   Once in six months you do two things.
[00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:11.540]   Once in a year you do two things.
[00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:13.560]   How many things you have to do?
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:14.640]   Eight, right?
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:17.400]   Only eight things.
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:21.400]   And once a day it says take time to touch.
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:25.660]   So, like for the couple, you take time to touch.
[00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:28.000]   If only for a minute, right?
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.960]   So in my household we express the touch
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.880]   by patting on the head.
[00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:39.020]   So I pat on the head of my wife, of my children.
[00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:42.400]   Yeah, you know, don't attack me, okay?
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.140]   It's like a dog, right?
[00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:45.320]   It's kind of cute, right?
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:50.040]   So what I do every single day is that I take the time,
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:53.040]   whether she's doing dishes or whatever,
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:56.100]   I go over there and, you know,
[00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:59.100]   I give her a touch for one minute.
[00:12:59.100 --> 00:12:59.920]   That's it.
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:04.860]   The second thing I do daily is to find something
[00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:07.440]   that make us both laugh, right?
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:11.700]   Life is stressful.
[00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:13.980]   You want your family, you want your relationship
[00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:16.720]   to be joyful, then you have to find something
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:20.800]   every single day that make you both laugh, right?
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.620]   Now that's easy to do, right?
[00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:28.200]   Scrolling on the phone and I saw some TikTok video.
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.520]   It's hilarious.
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:31.080]   I show it to her, right?
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.260]   She doesn't laugh, I laugh, right?
[00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:34.820]   That's okay, right?
[00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:37.180]   And that's what we do every single day.
[00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:39.880]   Once a day, we do two habits.
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:43.900]   Now again, the essence is it's the tiny habit
[00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:47.400]   that can change a lot of different things.
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:51.660]   Little and often, that is the key.
[00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:55.160]   Some of you know that I took a PhD seminar
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:58.020]   the middle of this year.
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:02.100]   This is the toughest class I've ever had.
[00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:06.260]   Not only me, but other students taking the class with me.
[00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.880]   They all think this is the toughest class
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:11.620]   in the entire degree.
[00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:17.480]   The class is advanced Hebrew grammar.
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:20.360]   Sounds fun, right?
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.780]   Sounds really fun, right?
[00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:24.280]   Advanced Hebrew grammar, right?
[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:28.460]   So in order to pass this class, you have to pass a test,
[00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:31.720]   which is a biblical Hebrew vocabulary test.
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:34.960]   And it tests you for 100 random words,
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:42.320]   any word that appears in the Bible more than 50 times.
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:43.280]   All right?
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:46.120]   And the test will pick some of the random words
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:48.560]   and then list them out in Hebrew,
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:51.300]   and then you have to give a translation in English.
[00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:53.800]   And in order to pass the exam,
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:57.820]   you have to get 87 over 100.
[00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:01.740]   87, it's not 50.
[00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:03.560]   I heard it wrong.
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:04.560]   No, it's 87.
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:08.100]   And half of our class failed.
[00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:11.680]   Half of our class succeeded.
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:14.020]   It was kind of scary, right?
[00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:19.660]   So before the class, I took about two months.
[00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:22.000]   Actually, I delayed my start.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.460]   I end up like five weeks before the class, before the exam.
[00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:27.040]   So what did I do?
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:29.200]   I simply used my downtime.
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:34.520]   You watch TV, there's commercial, right?
[00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:36.120]   Three minutes or four minutes.
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:39.360]   And then I go into the vocabulary book,
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:42.840]   and then I try to memorize them, right?
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:45.200]   I try to connect them and try to memorize it.
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:48.840]   And then there's sometimes downtime, right?
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:51.060]   When we have conversations together.
[00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:54.120]   I'll scroll up, open the book in my phone,
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:57.320]   and then I'll review the vocabularies.
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:59.120]   And that's what I do.
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.480]   And there are some other students
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:05.180]   who try to cram all these words into their brain
[00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:08.400]   one night or two nights, right?
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.980]   It's not going to work, right?
[00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:13.040]   So I passed the class.
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:15.380]   I passed the vocabulary test.
[00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:16.220]   What did I do?
[00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:18.320]   I did nothing significant.
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.520]   It's little and often, right?
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:23.700]   Most of you who are students, this is what you do, right?
[00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:24.900]   This is what you do.
[00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:27.560]   I remember I took Chemistry 101.
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:32.620]   There were 10 exams in the entire semester.
[00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:36.020]   I failed the first one because I missed the exam day.
[00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:38.780]   I show up on class, it was an exam day.
[00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:40.520]   I had nothing in my brain.
[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:43.240]   So I failed the first test.
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:46.040]   And there are nine more tests to go.
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:47.880]   And what did I do?
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:48.920]   I made up my mind.
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:53.080]   I commit myself to be successful in this course
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.840]   because I don't want to retake it, right?
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.900]   It's gonna cost a lot of money.
[00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:57.880]   So what did I do?
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:02.060]   Every single class, right after we are dismissed,
[00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:06.420]   I go to the library and I review for one hour, right?
[00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:09.160]   Now, so often we attempted to think,
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.020]   "Okay, maybe we should go home, right?
[00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:14.240]   "If I go home, I get four hours to study, right?
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:16.240]   "And do you want four hours to study
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:17.400]   "or one hour to study?"
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:20.720]   Of course you want four hours, right?
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:23.680]   But what I did was I go to the library
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:27.720]   right after the class, while the material is still fresh,
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:31.040]   I'll review it only for one hour or so.
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:32.760]   And then I'll go home.
[00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:37.140]   And then I ace every single test, all nine of them.
[00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:40.040]   And then I got an A at the end.
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:44.960]   Again, it's the tiny changes, insignificant habits
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:48.460]   that would pave the path for fruitfulness.
[00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:53.780]   This is what we do for spiritual life as well, right?
[00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:57.340]   Proverbs 9, 10, "The fear of the Lord
[00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:58.880]   "is the beginning of wisdom.
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:02.400]   "Knowledge of the Holy One is understanding."
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:03.980]   You see the parallels here?
[00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:06.060]   What is the fear of the Lord?
[00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:09.100]   The fear of the Lord is that you fear God
[00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:12.120]   and you relate to God in a proper way.
[00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:15.400]   And that is the real knowledge of the Holy One.
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:19.760]   You know God and you fear Him and you are related to Him,
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:23.680]   you have a right relationship with God, your Creator.
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:26.600]   That is the foundation of small things.
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:29.680]   Small habits will go a long way.
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:32.160]   Now I want to test you.
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.500]   How many of you do push-ups?
[00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:37.480]   How many of you?
[00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:38.920]   How many push-ups can you do?
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:41.920]   How many?
[00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:42.960]   25?
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:45.220]   I do 40 push-ups every single day.
[00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:48.840]   It's not much.
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:52.080]   How did I begin?
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.200]   I begin with 10, right?
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:59.200]   And I add one the next day, I add five next week, right?
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:03.840]   And now I do 40 push-ups every single day, right?
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:07.500]   It's just my way to strengthen myself.
[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:09.080]   How about plank?
[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:10.740]   How many of you do plank?
[00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:12.940]   And how long do you do?
[00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:17.180]   I do four minute plank every single day.
[00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:19.500]   How did I start?
[00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:21.740]   I start one minute, right?
[00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:25.420]   And then one minute and 15 second, one minute and 30 second,
[00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:28.020]   two minute, three minute, and four minute, right?
[00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:31.860]   And my goal next year is five minutes, right?
[00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:32.980]   Now how do we do that?
[00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:36.500]   Small, tiny habit of 1% power.
[00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:40.940]   This goes the same way for our Bible reading
[00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:44.640]   and our daily prayer life, right?
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:48.300]   It doesn't have to be huge, significant change.
[00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:53.080]   It's not a massive action that God is calling for.
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:57.300]   It's just tiny, little habit that will change you,
[00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:00.180]   that will effect life changes.
[00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:02.460]   So 1% power, that's the first principle.
[00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:04.140]   The second principle is incentives
[00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:06.380]   and this incentive are effective.
[00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:09.780]   The behavioral psychologists find out
[00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:14.340]   if there's pain involved, if there's suffering involved,
[00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:17.060]   people are more likely to follow through,
[00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:18.940]   especially financial pain.
[00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:23.540]   That's why people pay money to go to gym, right?
[00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:28.900]   That's why you go to exercise class and you pay, right?
[00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:31.620]   After you pay the amount,
[00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:34.740]   there's more likelihood for you to go.
[00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:38.620]   The more likelihood you keep on doing physical exercise.
[00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:42.860]   When money is involved, the psychologist tells us
[00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:46.700]   your chances of success increase by three times.
[00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:50.940]   You pay to go to school, right?
[00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:56.580]   You better go to school because you pay for it, right?
[00:20:56.580 --> 00:21:01.420]   There's a website called stick.com
[00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:03.620]   and you sign up, you set up your goal
[00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:07.060]   and it will ask you to pay money
[00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:12.860]   to something that you hate, like an anti-charity, right?
[00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:15.740]   For those of you who don't support Trump,
[00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:18.180]   you donate to Trump.
[00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:20.020]   If you fail in your goal,
[00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:21.860]   if you fail to do your daily exercise
[00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:23.860]   or fail to meet your goal,
[00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:27.740]   you're gonna donate money to Trump that you hate, right?
[00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:31.140]   For those of you who hate Biden, you can choose Biden.
[00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:35.580]   And then when you meet your goal, you report it
[00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:39.020]   and then you stop the payment for your credit card, right?
[00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:41.140]   Money is involved.
[00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:43.460]   If you do that or you don't,
[00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:45.460]   you will kind of lose money
[00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:48.300]   and you better work on it, right?
[00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:51.580]   That's how it works.
[00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:55.100]   There's reward and disincentive.
[00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:58.220]   If there's incentive in your life-changing goals
[00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:02.140]   or new US solutions, the psychology is applied.
[00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:05.300]   The rate of success is better
[00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:07.860]   if there's incentive or disincentive.
[00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:10.060]   That's the same way in wisdom literature.
[00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:14.860]   It says one man gives freely if someone is generous to give,
[00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:17.860]   yet gains even more.
[00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:21.980]   Another withholds and comes to poverty.
[00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:24.220]   A generous man will prosper.
[00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:28.660]   He who refreshes others will himself be refreshed.
[00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:30.820]   What is the incentive here?
[00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:32.740]   What is the reward here?
[00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:36.060]   The Bible says that if you honor your wealth,
[00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:40.940]   you honor God with your money, you will increase.
[00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:44.380]   You will benefit others and you will benefit yourself.
[00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:46.100]   That is what Jesus said.
[00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:49.300]   You lay up treasures in heaven, not on earth.
[00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:52.780]   And then your reward will be heavenly, right?
[00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:54.540]   If you will believe in the gospel,
[00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:57.460]   you believe in eternal life, right?
[00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:00.020]   The reward is eternal.
[00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:01.900]   The reward is there.
[00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:05.700]   So once you think about, okay, I need to do maybe New Year.
[00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:11.180]   One of my resolutions is to be faithful in tithes and offering,
[00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:13.660]   to be generous, right?
[00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:18.100]   Not to hold tight to the wealth God has given to me,
[00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:20.380]   but to benefit other people,
[00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:24.900]   to give it, to support the ministry or support the church
[00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:28.140]   or support the cause that is heavenly,
[00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:30.060]   that is gospel related.
[00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:32.740]   You need to understand there's reward
[00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:35.500]   and the reward will be great.
[00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:37.940]   There is incentive there.
[00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:42.420]   But if you do not want to do that, if you withhold,
[00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:44.820]   then there's this incentive.
[00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:49.020]   Your life becomes poor, right?
[00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:51.260]   It's always needy.
[00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:54.860]   If you practice generosity, then God will honor you,
[00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:55.980]   He will bless you,
[00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:59.420]   He will continue to make your life rich.
[00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:02.260]   That is the incentive and disincentive there.
[00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:04.460]   So think about your New Year resolutions.
[00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:08.220]   What are the incentives or what are the disincentive, right?
[00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:10.940]   Yeah, one of the disincentive I can think of,
[00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:12.940]   if you want to read the Bible next year,
[00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:17.820]   if you fail your goal, you sign up stick.com
[00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:19.500]   and you give me $500,
[00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:23.740]   that would be a great motivation for you, right?
[00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:27.020]   Because you don't want the $500 to go into my pocket, right?
[00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:30.500]   And I promise you, if you fail in your goal,
[00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:33.300]   you give me $500 at the end of the year,
[00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:35.020]   I'm gonna keep it for you.
[00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:37.580]   I won't use it, I won't spend it,
[00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:39.340]   and then the following year, if you meet your goal,
[00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:41.540]   I'll give it back, right?
[00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:44.940]   And those kind of incentives or disincentives,
[00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:47.380]   you can think of in your New Year resolutions,
[00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:48.740]   and that is wisdom.
[00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:52.820]   Number three, specifics are better.
[00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:54.820]   Now the wisdom literature
[00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:58.420]   use a lot of different illustrations to talk about wisdom,
[00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:02.580]   usually animals and creatures on Earth.
[00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:04.980]   Sometimes these creatures don't seem to be strong,
[00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:09.100]   don't seem to be wise, but the observers,
[00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:12.740]   you know, wisdom teacher are good observers.
[00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:14.500]   They observe the creation,
[00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:17.660]   they observe how the creatures work, right?
[00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:20.860]   And then they learn lessons of wisdom.
[00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:22.820]   They learn how to be wise.
[00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:27.340]   Chapter six, it says, "Go to the end,
[00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:31.420]   "use lucker, consider the ways and be wise."
[00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:34.460]   They don't have commander, they don't have ruler,
[00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:39.460]   they don't have king, yet they store provisions in summer,
[00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:43.580]   and gather the food at harvest,
[00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:46.740]   at the right time, specific time, right?
[00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:48.340]   And that is wisdom.
[00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:51.380]   And psychologist tells us the more specific your goals are,
[00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:54.660]   the likelihood the success will be.
[00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:59.420]   If your goals are general, you know, non-specific,
[00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:03.460]   you are planning to fail.
[00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:09.580]   And there's a study done in UK on physical exercise.
[00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:12.140]   So they divide the people into two groups.
[00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:16.660]   First group, group A, is that people who are committed
[00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:19.660]   to do exercise on a daily basis,
[00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:21.820]   and they do the checkbox, okay?
[00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:25.460]   I'm gonna commit to do pushup, do crunches,
[00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:28.460]   do plank, walk a little bit, right?
[00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:31.260]   They check the checkbox.
[00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:32.820]   That's group A.
[00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:34.780]   And they follow through,
[00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:39.780]   and the success rate for this group, group one, is 35%.
[00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:44.820]   Group B, they also do the checkbox,
[00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:48.300]   but they write specifics to their goals.
[00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:53.300]   Like time of the day, day of the week that they do exercise,
[00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:57.900]   and how long exactly, how many minutes that they going to do.
[00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:01.300]   20 minutes they gonna check, and then write it down.
[00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:03.900]   And they specify the exact time, place,
[00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:08.500]   where, when to do the goal.
[00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:12.500]   And the success rate is 91%.
[00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:15.620]   Three times higher.
[00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:18.780]   So the more specific that you go,
[00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:21.700]   the more successful you will be, right?
[00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:24.060]   Your goals will be achieved,
[00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:27.860]   and the likelihood to have result is higher.
[00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:29.580]   Let's say you wanna commit yourself
[00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:34.660]   to restructure your worship life, okay?
[00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:36.460]   Every single week, the Lord's Day,
[00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:39.540]   you're gonna come here and worship, right?
[00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:41.740]   And that's a very, very good goal, right?
[00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:43.820]   That's a very good goal, because as the people of God,
[00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:45.780]   we need to worship Him, right?
[00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:49.300]   The day of Sabbath, or day of celebrations,
[00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:53.180]   day of worship, we set aside time for God, right?
[00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:54.020]   Every single week.
[00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:56.620]   That's a good goal, but it's very general.
[00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:58.980]   To be more specific, you should say,
[00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:01.940]   I'm gonna commit myself to worship God
[00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:06.660]   every single Sunday, and I'm gonna come here
[00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:10.220]   at 11.16 in the morning.
[00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:13.460]   By 11.16, my butt is here.
[00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:18.620]   And I'm gonna sit at the same place every single week.
[00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:23.260]   The when and where are specified,
[00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:25.860]   and the rate of success is higher.
[00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:30.940]   That, the same way goes for any kind of goal.
[00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:33.220]   Your physical health, emotional health,
[00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:35.020]   or even your spiritual health.
[00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:37.980]   That's how it works.
[00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:40.580]   And then another principle, number four,
[00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:42.980]   and that's the last one I'll continue next week.
[00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:45.980]   Is community influences you.
[00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:49.900]   It has power to impact you.
[00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:51.940]   The people that you hang out with,
[00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:56.260]   the people that you build friendship with,
[00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:58.500]   the people who are part of your family
[00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:02.460]   will have impact on you, and the impact is significant.
[00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:05.900]   Proverbs says the same thing, 13.20.
[00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:09.100]   Whoever walks with the wise becomes wise.
[00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:15.020]   And the friends or the companion of fools will suffer harm.
[00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:19.200]   If you wanna experience destruction,
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:20.620]   you hang out with the fools.
[00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:23.340]   If you want to have wisdom,
[00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:25.100]   if you wanna have successful life,
[00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:30.900]   you walk with other who are wise as well.
[00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:33.180]   And there's a study on the effect of people
[00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:35.700]   on one's behavior.
[00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:38.100]   You know, how people around them behave
[00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:41.460]   will affect that specific person.
[00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:43.420]   So that study is very interesting.
[00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:48.420]   They send out actors, actresses, to the buffet line.
[00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:52.980]   You know, you go to a buffet restaurant,
[00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:56.020]   and you pick up some food, right, on your plate,
[00:29:56.020 --> 00:30:01.020]   and the actors are being taught to go into the buffet line,
[00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:05.380]   and they pile up all kinds of food on the plate.
[00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:08.620]   You know, the more they get, the better, right?
[00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:12.540]   So the actors act that way in order to influence
[00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:14.420]   those who are not acting.
[00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:17.340]   You know, the typical restaurant customers,
[00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:21.500]   they're trying to line up at the buffet to get their food.
[00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:26.500]   And they wanna see how this will influence the next person,
[00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:30.740]   and how much food they will get, right?
[00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:31.580]   It's very interesting.
[00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:36.580]   The result is, the result for men and women are different.
[00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:41.940]   Men has no impact.
[00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:47.740]   For women, because the next person is piling up more food,
[00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:51.700]   the women are more likely to get more food.
[00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:58.300]   The point is, your community works.
[00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:02.260]   You gather, you study the Bible with other people,
[00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:05.180]   you join a class for exercise,
[00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:10.180]   you go to a fellowship group, you study in the library,
[00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:13.580]   the environment, other people will have impact on you.
[00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:16.180]   So in order to increase the rate of success,
[00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:18.740]   you have to find the right community.
[00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:20.960]   You cannot do solo.
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:25.380]   Let's say you wanna improve your academic study.
[00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:27.340]   What is the best way?
[00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:33.340]   For me, if I study at home, it would not be helpful for me,
[00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:36.380]   because my wife doesn't study.
[00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:39.380]   She's listening to music and watching TV show.
[00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:42.820]   Huge distractions, right?
[00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:44.020]   Huge temptations.
[00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:47.620]   I have to go away from her, right?
[00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:51.620]   I have to go somewhere that is fruitful
[00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:56.900]   for my study, like library, right?
[00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:59.740]   Or be myself, be by myself.
[00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:04.020]   So the whole point is, you have to find friends
[00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:08.660]   and people who can influence you positively, right?
[00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:12.380]   So there are more insights I can share,
[00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:15.280]   or more wisdom I can share, and that will be next week.
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:17.600]   But today, I would like to conclude
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:21.020]   with some of the suggestions I have.
[00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:25.560]   It's for the new year, 2024, new year.
[00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:27.460]   I'll suggest three areas you should think
[00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:32.380]   about new year resolutions, new year goals for you.
[00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:33.860]   First is spiritual health.
[00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:38.420]   How important that is, very, very important.
[00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:42.720]   It's very important you will take time
[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:45.660]   to read the word of God, right?
[00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:47.900]   Not just reading more of the Bible,
[00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:50.900]   it's learning how to read better,
[00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:53.960]   how to be a good reader of scripture,
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:58.900]   praying, prayer life, it's part of our spiritual health.
[00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:01.660]   Right, we receive the word of God
[00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:06.100]   through reading scripture, we talk to God
[00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:08.820]   in our daily prayer, right?
[00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:11.300]   And part of the good things about going to fellowship
[00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:12.900]   is that we can pray together.
[00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:17.220]   And by praying together, somebody is praying,
[00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:19.480]   people around you are praying,
[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:22.420]   and it will influence you, impact you to pray.
[00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:24.840]   Worship is part of it.
[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:30.600]   Take time that is set apart for worshiping God
[00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:34.760]   to come in person, right, if possible.
[00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:36.620]   Come in person and worship God.
[00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:40.720]   Spiritual health, you know, you need to set some goals,
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:42.920]   or maybe you should read a spiritual book,
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:46.720]   a Christian book, a good book
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:50.020]   that will help you grow spiritually.
[00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:54.040]   2024, maybe you should pick one of the good books out there,
[00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:57.280]   right, in the library, or you want some recommendation
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:58.960]   I can give to you.
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:00.800]   In the morning service, I talk about this,
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:03.720]   and right after, a couple of people talk to me,
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:05.920]   "Hey, can you recommend one or two
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:09.700]   "for me to read through in 2024?"
[00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:13.060]   Spiritual health, emotional health.
[00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:18.160]   New year, 2024, it just dawned on me this year
[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:23.160]   that the emotional life for every single one of us
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:25.780]   is so important.
[00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:28.720]   How do we manage different emotions?
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:31.140]   How do we manage them well?
[00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:33.200]   I'll have more to talk about next week,
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:36.460]   but this is something for you to think about.
[00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:39.400]   You know, your emotional health impacts
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:42.000]   your spiritual relationship with God,
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.800]   and your spiritual relationship with God
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:45.640]   impact your emotional life as well.
[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:51.240]   And number three is physical health, physical health.
[00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:54.060]   You wanna be stronger and stronger, right?
[00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:59.280]   And live a healthy lifestyle, right?
[00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:03.160]   Stay strong and stay healthy, right?
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:05.640]   Set some goals for yourself, right?
[00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:10.640]   And then remember, 1% is powerful, right?
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:14.160]   Do tiny little changes, little and often,
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:15.400]   and then at the end of the year,
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:20.400]   you get results 30-some percent of 30-some times results.
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:23.120]   And let's do that.
[00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:25.280]   And my final prayer for you,
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:27.440]   and we're gonna pray together,
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:31.960]   is that dear God, as this year comes to an end,
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:37.360]   help me to know what I need to get rid of
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:40.140]   in order to have more room for you,
[00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:42.100]   for what you have in store for my life.
[00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:44.760]   Let's all pray together.
[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:49.680]   Father, we wanna give you thanks
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:52.360]   because in this entire year,
[00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:57.120]   from the beginning to the end to today, you are faithful.
[00:35:57.120 --> 00:36:03.120]   Yes, we go through our life journey with ups and downs,
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:05.200]   and with all these turns and twists,
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:09.880]   but we continue to acknowledge that you are faithful.
[00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:11.360]   You're faithful to us,
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:13.960]   and thank you for your loving kindness.
[00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:16.500]   In the next year, in the new year to come,
[00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:20.080]   we know we are not in control,
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:22.980]   but we do know that we need to make room for you,
[00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:27.420]   for your blessing, for your grace,
[00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:30.040]   for your work in our lives.
[00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:32.480]   And I pray that you will continue to help us
[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:35.280]   to be obedient, to be open,
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:38.280]   to listen to your voice,
[00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:41.480]   so that in the next year, 2024,
[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:44.540]   we look forward to walking with you,
[00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:48.240]   to experience you, to go deeper with you,
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:51.980]   to get to know you better, get to know you more.
[00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:56.560]   Help us to rebuild, reestablish
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:37:00.400]   some of the tiny daily habits,
[00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:01.900]   habits that are life-changing,
[00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:07.180]   habits that are seemingly tiny and insignificant,
[00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:10.660]   but will make our life fruitful.
[00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:14.860]   And I pray that we'll read your scripture more,
[00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:17.940]   pray to you more, and worship you more, and give more.
[00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:21.120]   And I pray that you'll grant us wisdom
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:22.780]   to manage our emotions.
[00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:28.720]   Help us to go to you when we are in need.
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:34.380]   And Father, we commit our whole body into your hand,
[00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:36.800]   knowing that our physical health
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:39.420]   will impact every single area,
[00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:44.160]   our emotional life, our spiritual health, and vice versa.
[00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:48.760]   And I pray that we'll grow holistically.
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:55.000]   So we put our hope in you, knowing that in year 24,
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.860]   you have so much in store for us,
[00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:00.300]   because you are our good God.
[00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:04.780]   I pray that we'll experience your love and your grace.
[00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:07.840]   And help our church to grow together,
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:10.060]   so that we will honor you,
[00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:13.500]   and proclaim your name in Christ, in praise.
[00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:17.860]   Well, God bless you, and see you next year.
[00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:19.860]   (claps)
