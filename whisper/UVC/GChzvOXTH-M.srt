1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
 - You know, one of the things, good morning everyone.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,000
 My name is Tommy Lee and I get a chance to lead

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,120
 this wonderful organization, Resource Global

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,500
 and the Growth Center and we get a chance to partner

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,660
 with Pastor Mark and his church.

6
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,320
 I love the humility of Pastor Mark

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,640
 and I love how even simple things of just coordinating

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,120
 some of these setups here on Sunday morning

9
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,560
 is something that I've learned from Mark as well too.

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,080
 Thank you James and you know,

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,400
 it's my first time meeting James in person.

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,080
 I got a chance to meet Phoebe also in person.

13
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,360
 Our whole life these days is online.

14
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,880
 Our whole life is on Zoom and everything like that

15
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,840
 so when you get a chance to meet each other in person,

16
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,160
 it is a joy.

17
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,080
 I will probably say James is, when we chat with him,

18
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,360
 he had graduated from Moody Bible Institute in Chicago

19
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,520
 and now he works in the marketplace.

20
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,720
 And I think all of us in this day and age,

21
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,960
 this is the world of the modern day pastor,

22
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,120
 don't you think?

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,280
 And a lot of times there will still be a need

24
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,280
 of the full-time pastors, there will still be a good chunk

25
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,800
 of those who are full-time pastoral ministry

26
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,840
 who went to seminary and are doing that full-time

27
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,160
 as a vocation.

28
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,200
 But more and more as I encounter leaders

29
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,280
 from different parts of the world,

30
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,520
 they're wearing different hats.

31
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,640
 They're your bi-vocational pastor,

32
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,260
 whether or not their church won't be able to afford them

33
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,920
 in the full-time salary, so they're doing that

34
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,440
 and then from that point on, they're doing a job

35
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,200
 or there are different business leaders out there

36
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,760
 who are working in the area of finance or accounting

37
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,240
 or tech, but they love the church.

38
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,880
 And so they're doing that full-time and then on the weekends

39
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,560
 or on the time, they're working.

40
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,560
 There's this one friend I have, Shundren Thomas.

41
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,000
 Shundren is the president

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,640
 of Northern Trust Asset Management.

43
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,640
 Shundren is so successful in the area of private equity,

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,600
 but yet on the weekends, he's the associate pastor

45
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,160
 of his dad's church.

46
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,400
 There's another guy, Dr. Nicholas Pierce.

47
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,440
 He is a MBA, executive MBA professor

48
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,720
 at Northwestern University.

49
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,840
 He does a great job in the area of education,

50
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,400
 but yet on the weekends, he's the associate pastor

51
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,240
 of his church.

52
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,200
 We're seeing that more and more as well too

53
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,160
 and that's why a lot of times with the Growth Center,

54
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,640
 I get a chance to partner with Pastor Mark

55
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,280
 and do all of these wonderful things

56
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,520
 that you guys are doing.

57
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,960
 Hey, let me just, before we dive into our sermon today,

58
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,760
 two, couple of things I did wanna share with you

59
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,600
 as well too.

60
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,800
 Let's bring up the first couple slides here.

61
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,900
 Next slide here.

62
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,240
 We are starting a certificate.

63
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,840
 I went to, for me, I spent 10 years building cell towers.

64
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,760
 That was my job, those big telecommunications tower.

65
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,820
 That was what I did for 10 years.

66
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:54,440
 But during the evening, I went to seminary

67
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:59,320
 and it was three grueling years of evening classes.

68
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,800
 I walked away from seminary realizing

69
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,840
 that sometimes a seminary is not something

70
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,280
 that people can afford.

71
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,020
 It's not even something people can have time for.

72
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,600
 So what are some of the core classes that you need

73
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,960
 from some of the key teachers, whether it's Bible,

74
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:20,080
 theology, but leadership, culture, justice,

75
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,760
 integration, faith, and work that you need

76
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,520
 that allows you to really be able to gain the knowledge

77
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,000
 and education that you need.

78
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,740
 So we've actually created a nine-month cohort program.

79
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,660
 If some of you guys who are listening

80
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,860
 or sitting here who are interested,

81
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,960
 I'll send you more information that Pastor Mark

82
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,960
 to send over to you once a week for nine months

83
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,840
 and you could decide, hey, I wanna do month one,

84
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,320
 but I don't wanna do month two.

85
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,900
 I could do month four taught by some practitioners,

86
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,080
 marketplace leaders.

87
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,000
 You have people like Ashundra Toms who I was talking with,

88
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,920
 Jillian Anderson who works at Gallup.

89
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,560
 Her job is working with Southwest Airlines

90
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,340
 in the area of Strength Finders.

91
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,840
 You have Pastor Albert Tate who does a great job

92
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,120
 of expository preaching in LA.

93
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,920
 Andy Crouch who wrote the wonderful book,

94
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,360
 "Culture, Making, and Power," and he does a great job

95
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,480
 talking about the role of Christians integrating in culture.

96
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,680
 Or Dr. Crawford Luritz who teaches a wonderful class

97
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,240
 in leadership that he taught over at Trinity,

98
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,360
 "Leadership as an Identity."

99
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,360
 Another one, next slide as well too,

100
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,520
 that I wanna point out is Mr. Dave Evans.

101
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,160
 If you have ever never talked to Mr. Dave Evans,

102
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,680
 he worked for Steve Jobs many years ago,

103
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,780
 created the mouse for Apple.

104
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,120
 Now he teaches at Stanford University

105
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,520
 called "Designing Your Life," a wonderful class

106
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,520
 that is always filled with people as well too.

107
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,440
 All talking about design thinking,

108
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,120
 how God uses design thinking to really be able

109
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,240
 to help you process the calling in your life.

110
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,120
 So that is it.

111
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,000
 I will send you guys more information.

112
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,600
 Let's go, actually, let's hold off on all the slides.

113
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,480
 Two other things as well too.

114
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:06,480
 Is number one, and again, ministry has changed, doesn't it?

115
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,160
 And so I think a lot of times one of the things

116
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,260
 I've also been wondering, and I love what Urban Voice

117
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:14,380
 is doing with your church, I've been wondering, Mark,

118
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:18,800
 how do you plant churches in the meta universe?

119
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,240
 We've now done it over in Zoom, and we're getting used to it

120
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,000
 but around the world with government restrictions,

121
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,280
 access, whatever it is, Roblox has become

122
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:35,280
 one of the most popular platforms in all of the world.

123
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,120
 I sat down with a private equity analyst

124
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,360
 who studies all of the Asia markets,

125
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,840
 and she says, Tommy, you need to look at how ministry

126
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,840
 interacts with the world of Roblox in the meta world.

127
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,220
 Because a lot of times Katy Perry just did a live concert

128
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:00,460
 there and had over three million people attend.

129
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:04,220
 Another individual on Fortnite, Travis Scott,

130
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:09,160
 had a live concert there and had 30 million people attend.

131
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,340
 Another individual over in Bellevue in Seattle,

132
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:17,300
 or in the Washington area, created a youth ministry.

133
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:22,300
 He draws 40,000 youth from around the world

134
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,060
 for this youth ministry.

135
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:27,100
 And so as a result, as we begin to look at ministry,

136
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,140
 what are some of the creative ways,

137
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:33,200
 because the traditional church model is decreasing.

138
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,200
 A lot of the American churches,

139
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,260
 I speak mostly for American church,

140
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:40,560
 their decline are coming from the younger people

141
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,440
 who are disengaged or frustrated with where the church is.

142
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,880
 So a couple of thoughts as well too,

143
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,040
 but look, it is always in ties in with our sermon

144
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,880
 as well too.

145
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,480
 All of us are anointed by God to do something unique.

146
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,820
 All of us are called by God to contribute to this world.

147
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:01,040
 How that looks like for each one of us

148
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,400
 is gonna be a little bit different.

149
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,000
 Today is a part two of our sermon called Anointed by God.

150
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,960
 We're looking at a popular story that all of us,

151
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,680
 whether you're sitting here or you're sitting at home

152
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,360
 watching this, is a story of David and Goliath.

153
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,120
 A story that all of us have always been familiar with.

154
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,380
 Besides the crucifixion, besides the birth of Jesus,

155
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:26,960
 David and Goliath is a story that we've grown up hearing.

156
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,400
 The story of the little boy with the slingshot

157
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:34,400
 who takes on the nine foot giant in Goliath and wins.

158
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,520
 And later on becomes the king of Israel.

159
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,040
 We love that story.

160
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,320
 It has a great happy ending.

161
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,880
 But within that story, there are some unique things

162
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:50,880
 that God teaches us and how God anoints a young boy.

163
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,120
 And through that journey, he allows him to have

164
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,720
 one turning point in his life

165
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,400
 that changes the course of his life.

166
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,200
 He is anointed by God.

167
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,720
 And we talked about part one two months ago.

168
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,800
 It may seem like eternity, part one two months ago.

169
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,360
 And today we're gonna talk about part two

170
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,000
 of anointed by God.

171
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,440
 Some of the things, just to refresh your memory

172
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,680
 of what we talked about part one

173
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,220
 and we'll go on to part two.

174
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,480
 I talked about three things,

175
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,140
 six insights on being anointed by God.

176
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,040
 Two months ago we talked about the first three.

177
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,760
 So let me just review it.

178
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,000
 Number one, when God looks at the heart,

179
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,680
 when God anoints a leader,

180
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,940
 he looks at the heart of the individual

181
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,440
 versus the outer appearance.

182
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,560
 When God anoints a leader,

183
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,600
 he looks at the heart of the individual

184
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,200
 versus the outer appearance.

185
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,520
 And we talked about the story of Saul.

186
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,680
 If you guys all remember Saul,

187
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,280
 Saul was a man from Benjamin.

188
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,760
 Benjamin had a wonderful reputation.

189
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,960
 Benjamin was the elite of all of the tribes.

190
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,600
 Benjamin was a very wealthy tribe.

191
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,880
 That's where Saul came from.

192
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,160
 And Saul came from an extremely wealthy family,

193
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,520
 an extremely powerful family,

194
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:14,380
 and now he was brought in and selected as king.

195
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:17,700
 But sometimes having the outer appearance, right,

196
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,140
 doesn't qualify you to be king.

197
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:23,020
 Having the talents, having the smarts,

198
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:26,320
 having the wealth by appearance alone,

199
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,500
 outer appearance, does not qualify you for leadership.

200
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,380
 And as a result, through a series of mistakes

201
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:38,380
 that Saul makes, disqualifies him for leadership.

202
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:41,940
 And so then God sends Samuel the prophet

203
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:46,460
 over to Bethlehem to meet Jesse and his family.

204
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,340
 And he says, "Jesse, there when you meet this guy,

205
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,800
 "a Bethlehemite by the name of Jesse,

206
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,540
 "you will find your first king."

207
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,780
 And there Jesse goes, and the story goes,

208
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,340
 some of you guys, he brings all of his son,

209
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:02,700
 Jesse calls all of his son, the first three oldest boys,

210
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,700
 and the first one is Eliab, and he looks at Eliab,

211
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,940
 he is the oldest, he is the strongest of all of the boys,

212
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:13,940
 and Samuel says to him, "Surely, surely, that is the king."

213
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:18,260
 And God reminds him, says to Samuel,

214
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,680
 "Do not look on his appearance,

215
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,160
 "or on the height of his stature,

216
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,280
 "because I have rejected him.

217
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,780
 "For the Lord sees not as man sees.

218
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,820
 "Man looks on the outward appearance,

219
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,020
 "but the Lord looks on the heart."

220
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:36,700
 And so Eliab was in it.

221
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:40,340
 And remember, later on, Eliab becomes very key in the story.

222
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:44,380
 And he looks at his second son, that was in it as well too.

223
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,780
 And he goes for the third son, that was in it.

224
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:50,560
 And Samuel then says, "Jesse, is there anyone else?

225
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,080
 "Oh, I forgot, there's David, the young boy

226
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,000
 "who's out in the shepherd field, call him."

227
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:01,300
 And there God, Samuel anoints him as the king.

228
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:06,300
 Story goes on, sometime later on, a battle takes place.

229
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:10,460
 And this battle takes place in the Valley of Eliab,

230
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:13,460
 between the Philistines and the Israelites.

231
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,940
 One of the things, if you guys remember,

232
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,320
 that I talked about, the differences

233
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,740
 between the Philistines and the Israelites,

234
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,460
 and we're gonna talk a little bit about

235
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:23,940
 why Eliab was so important in today.

236
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:27,280
 But look, the Philistines were coastal people.

237
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,540
 The Philistines were sophisticated cultural people.

238
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:35,040
 The Philistines learned how to use iron for weapons

239
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,540
 and tools and maintain monopoly on the markets.

240
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,460
 They were masters at working with iron.

241
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:44,160
 As a result, they had the technology and tools

242
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,200
 to make them one of the strongest,

243
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,420
 one of the most elite tribes at that time.

244
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,820
 They could make shields, they could make swords,

245
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:55,260
 they could make spears, they could make armor, everything.

246
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,620
 Compare that to the Israelites.

247
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:03,300
 The Israelites were primitive in comparison.

248
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,980
 They were not a professional army.

249
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:08,700
 They were shepherds and farmers.

250
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,240
 They had outdated weapons.

251
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,560
 Probably the only two that had even any armors

252
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,040
 or shields or swords was Saul, their leader, their king,

253
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,160
 and Jonathan, their son.

254
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,440
 That's it.

255
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,820
 So you're having a ragtag bunch of guys

256
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:30,820
 who were farmers and shepherds against this group,

257
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,660
 and the odds were great.

258
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,780
 Why Eliab, as you said?

259
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:36,780
 Guys, if you get a chance,

260
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,580
 take a look at this particular map,

261
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:42,240
 and you'll see, next slide, right there.

262
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,980
 Look at where Gath is.

263
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:48,280
 Look at where Azekah is in Soko.

264
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,220
 That right there is the Valley of Elah.

265
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:54,740
 If you look at north, what do you see there?

266
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,580
 It leads to a lot of things.

267
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:00,760
 The richness of the Jordanian Valley.

268
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,260
 Thank you, guys.

269
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:06,420
 And the reason why is where Israelite was positioned

270
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:10,460
 led to a passageway into the Jordanian Valley

271
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,420
 into much riches.

272
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:15,540
 And so the Philistines had to defeat the Israelites

273
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:19,560
 and get rid of them in order to gain access

274
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,960
 into this passageway.

275
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,000
 They were standing in their way.

276
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,360
 And so they brought all of their armies

277
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,400
 from Gath over to the Valley Elah.

278
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,160
 And this is why they were so weak.

279
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,080
 They were so weak.

280
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,960
 The Israelites were so weak.

281
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,560
 The Philistines are looking at it and says,

282
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,120
 you know what, they're not worth our time.

283
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,600
 We're not gonna get our guys into battle

284
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,800
 and try to fight them.

285
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,800
 Let's just get it easy.

286
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,300
 So they called in their big giant Goliath

287
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:50,040
 and say, Goliath, we're gonna call, bring you in.

288
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,300
 And Israelites, bring in your best champion,

289
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,400
 which was supposed to be Saul.

290
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,560
 And we're gonna have a duel.

291
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,280
 Whoever wins gets access.

292
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,480
 If we win, Israelites, we'll go away.

293
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,760
 But if you lose, you go away and we take over.

294
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,200
 Easy.

295
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,160
 So for 40 days, this happens,

296
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,440
 which leads us to the second point.

297
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:16,280
 That you never know when God is calling.

298
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,040
 Because if the first point that we had

299
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,120
 is that when God anoints a leader,

300
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,040
 he looks at the heart of the individual

301
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,040
 versus the outer appearance.

302
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,800
 The second point is this one.

303
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,120
 You never know when God will come calling.

304
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,940
 Here is David who just got anointed by God

305
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,960
 as the next king.

306
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,160
 Samuel whispers to him, you're gonna be the next king.

307
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,000
 And what happens?

308
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,560
 Does David then become the next king?

309
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,900
 No, he goes back to the field.

310
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,060
 He becomes a shepherd boy.

311
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,820
 And then Jesse comes calling him and says,

312
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,100
 hey, come here, come here.

313
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,500
 I need you to bring food to your brothers.

314
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,960
 And from that point on, bring these 10 cheeses

315
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,100
 to the commander and their thousands.

316
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,500
 Bring some food to your brothers, make sure they're well.

317
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,180
 And bring some token from them.

318
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:05,500
 You never know when God is calling you

319
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,860
 to do something amazing in your life.

320
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,280
 So God looks at the outer appearances.

321
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,140
 But yet God calls you.

322
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,860
 We look at the story of Nehemiah at age 60 something, right?

323
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,780
 He's a cupbearer to the king.

324
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:21,860
 And now he's called because he has a burden

325
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,380
 to rebuild the walls of Israel.

326
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:27,380
 Peter, James, and John are fishermen.

327
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:32,380
 God calls them to take up and leave their job as fishermen

328
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,380
 and to come and follow me.

329
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:37,220
 But then we also see Zacchaeus, don't we?

330
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,940
 Zacchaeus is a tax collector,

331
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:43,260
 not just any tax collector, but the chief tax collector.

332
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,600
 And somehow or another he encounters Jesus

333
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,900
 because there's something about his life

334
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,260
 that he doesn't like to see.

335
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,420
 And what happens with Zacchaeus?

336
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,900
 God calls and says, Zacchaeus,

337
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,660
 I need to spend time in your home.

338
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:59,740
 But yet he doesn't call him into full-time ministry.

339
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:02,140
 He doesn't call him just like he calls James

340
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,480
 and John and Peter to pick up everything and follow.

341
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,560
 Matthew calls him as a tax collector,

342
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,680
 pick up everything, follow him.

343
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,880
 But Zacchaeus is different.

344
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,640
 Zacchaeus, I need you to go back

345
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,180
 and become the tax collector again.

346
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:18,840
 But I want you to be a better version of the tax collector.

347
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,740
 You never know when God is calling.

348
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:24,060
 You never know what he's calling you to do.

349
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:28,100
 And that calling may not sometimes be vocational ministry.

350
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,780
 Maybe you're calling like I was talking with James.

351
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,920
 Graduate from seminary

352
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,900
 and now work in the corporate marketplace,

353
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:38,020
 but still using his skills as a worship leader,

354
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:41,300
 a wonderful worship leader, and in ministry as well too.

355
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,180
 It all looks differently as well too.

356
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,340
 For me, I grew up, I worked 10 years

357
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,780
 in the corporate world building cell towers.

358
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,580
 I always thought I was supposed to be a minister.

359
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,500
 I thought I was supposed to be a pastor.

360
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,040
 After three years, I realized,

361
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,860
 God, you're not calling me to be a pastor.

362
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:58,220
 That is not what I'm called to do.

363
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,140
 Worked at Moody Bible Institute as seminary

364
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,700
 for a number of years under the president.

365
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,420
 I thought that was it.

366
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:06,620
 After three years, that ended, and God closed that door.

367
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,460
 And now for the last 12 years,

368
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,820
 I get a chance to run multiple organizations,

369
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:14,060
 not one, but two, four, five organizations,

370
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:17,740
 because I realized God had wired me differently.

371
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,020
 That the traditional way of doing church

372
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:22,420
 was not what my calling was.

373
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,580
 But I get a chance to work with marketplace leaders.

374
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:27,660
 I get a chance to launch new organizations.

375
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,900
 That's what God was calling to do.

376
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,700
 You never know what God is calling.

377
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,180
 You're always sitting there looking and seeing

378
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:37,020
 and asking God to really work in your life.

379
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,140
 And the third thing, the anointed leader

380
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,540
 will be criticized by others.

381
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,380
 That you won't make everyone happy,

382
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:46,220
 and your goal is not to strive to make everyone happy,

383
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,020
 because we saw the story of Eliab,

384
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:51,580
 where when he sees David, Eliab, the oldest brother,

385
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,820
 he sees David and says, why have you come down?

386
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:58,620
 With whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness?

387
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:02,060
 That God's anointed can be criticized

388
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:05,540
 because we're never gonna meet everyone's expectations.

389
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,620
 There are things that we do or don't do

390
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,140
 that's not gonna make everyone happy.

391
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,500
 We're gonna not meet the expectations

392
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,060
 that people have of us.

393
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:17,260
 And so God's anointed needs to learn how to,

394
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:20,540
 as we talked about, needs to be thick-skinned.

395
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:24,460
 You can't take things personally.

396
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,860
 You have to learn to hear what people have to say,

397
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,480
 learn to listen to feedback,

398
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,380
 but you have to be thick-skinned

399
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,660
 and continue to strive to do what is best

400
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,080
 to honor the Lord in everything that you do.

401
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,080
 And there it goes to verse 34.

402
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,580
 But David said to Saul in verse 34

403
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:46,820
 in 1 Samuel chapter 17, in verse 34,

404
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,940
 in the story of David and Goliath,

405
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:52,840
 David said to Saul, as soon as he volunteers

406
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,300
 to kill Goliath, Saul says, what in the world are you?

407
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,240
 Who are you again?

408
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,080
 You're this tiny little shepherd boy

409
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,900
 coming to bring cheese to his brothers.

410
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,300
 But David said to Saul,

411
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:11,240
 your servant, in chapter 17, verse 34,

412
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,440
 your servant used to keep sheep for his father.

413
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,940
 And when there came a lion or a bear

414
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,740
 and took a lamb from the flock,

415
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,620
 I went after him and struck him

416
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:27,380
 and delivered it out of his mouth.

417
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:30,980
 And if he rose against me, I caught him by his beard

418
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,800
 and struck him and killed him.

419
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:37,220
 Your servant has struck down both lions and bears,

420
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,620
 and this uncircumcised Philistine

421
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,460
 shall be like one of them,

422
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:45,100
 for he has defied the armies of the living God.

423
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,620
 And David said, the Lord who delivered me

424
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:51,900
 from the pawl of the lion and from the pawl of the bear

425
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,300
 will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.

426
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:59,220
 And Saul said to David, go and the Lord be with you.

427
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,580
 Which goes to my fourth point.

428
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:06,580
 God uses your past to prepare you for the future.

429
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:13,280
 God uses your past to prepare you for the future.

430
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,280
 Why do I say this?

431
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:20,700
 Some of us are always in the midst of looking

432
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:24,380
 to see what God is doing, what God is calling us to do.

433
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,500
 We're anxious.

434
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,140
 Across the board, when I travel,

435
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:31,060
 I get a chance to travel to Southeast Asia, Nairobi,

436
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:33,440
 I hear the same thing from young leaders,

437
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,820
 especially those in their mid-20s and their mid-30s.

438
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,580
 They always say to me, Tommy,

439
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:40,020
 I wanna know what God is calling me to do.

440
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:43,260
 I just wanna know what God is calling me to do.

441
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,460
 And one of the things I've always had to tell them,

442
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:48,800
 I said, you gotta learn to be patient in this sense.

443
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:53,100
 That sometimes God doesn't tell you what to do.

444
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,500
 God, sometimes God leaves you in limbo

445
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:00,180
 because remember, you are on a journey

446
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,260
 that he wants you to be.

447
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,980
 And so as a result, he wants you to learn to be faithful

448
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:09,180
 to where he has placed you right now.

449
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:14,640
 And he uses that experience to prepare you

450
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,780
 for something that he wants you to do.

451
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:20,940
 I say this, we look at scripture, Nicodemus, right?

452
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,660
 Nicodemus was in his mid-60s before what?

453
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:27,260
 Before God says, I need you to build this wall for Jerusalem

454
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,460
 but what was Nicodemus doing this whole time?

455
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,980
 He was a faithful what?

456
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:35,140
 Cupbearer to the king.

457
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,540
 He served the king faithfully.

458
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:40,460
 He did his job well.

459
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:43,380
 He was a great employee.

460
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:46,460
 And when he finally got that burden to rebuild the wall,

461
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,340
 what happens?

462
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:53,220
 His boss, the king, who Nicodemus served faithfully well,

463
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:58,580
 was his first and only donor, funded his entire project,

464
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:01,200
 gave him the vacation days and the time off

465
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,420
 to go and do his job because what?

466
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:07,540
 He was a great employee.

467
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:10,100
 When I graduated from Washington University in St. Louis,

468
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,140
 I graduated with a business degree.

469
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,780
 And there I was looking for a job

470
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,100
 and I got hired in my job

471
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,980
 and it was a company by the name of American Tower

472
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,380
 and they built cell towers for a living.

473
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,860
 And I thought, great, I come from a Ivy League school,

474
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:25,780
 Washington University in St. Louis.

475
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,700
 What is my job?

476
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,940
 Am I gonna oversee a team?

477
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,420
 Am I gonna oversee projects?

478
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,260
 Tell me what it is.

479
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,240
 They said, yes, your first job.

480
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,060
 You see all those files that we just got?

481
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,720
 Verizon Wireless, at that point in time,

482
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,720
 we acquired 200 towers and all of their documents,

483
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,820
 all of their files in one room,

484
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:47,420
 unorganized construction drawings,

485
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:50,220
 all of this random drawings.

486
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,620
 You see that?

487
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,220
 Organize that room.

488
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,420
 What?

489
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:57,060
 I just graduated from university.

490
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,620
 I graduated with a management degree.

491
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,060
 You want me to do what?

492
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:03,620
 Lord, what are you calling me to do?

493
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:06,900
 What can I learn from this?

494
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,120
 So I said, Lord, if you would put me in here,

495
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,460
 I'm gonna do the best job I could possibly do.

496
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,540
 And I organized that file room pretty well.

497
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:18,420
 But more so, I learned how to be organized.

498
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,940
 I learned the discipline of spotting

499
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:24,340
 and creating structures that I never learned before,

500
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,820
 day in and day out.

501
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:29,180
 For over six months, I did that.

502
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:33,420
 And so after I did that, my boss said to me,

503
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:36,380
 you did great, now I need you to do something different.

504
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:39,340
 I need you to create a system to scan everything.

505
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,180
 Really?

506
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,980
 I gotta scan everything?

507
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,180
 Back then we had scanners and we had to take card copies

508
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,940
 and sit there and scan it.

509
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:48,580
 And so I did that for another four months.

510
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:51,100
 Oh, God, I look back now, it's 12 years later.

511
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:57,020
 God used that time in my life to create me a discipline,

512
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,380
 to be organized.

513
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:03,040
 He helped me to spot how to create patterns,

514
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,900
 how to organize different things,

515
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,580
 how to organize different projects,

516
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:09,940
 how to really be able to use Excel, all of that.

517
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:13,820
 To this day, I still use that.

518
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,860
 One of the things that people tell me all the time,

519
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:18,620
 they say, Tommy, you organize your team so well

520
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:21,100
 and you are able to keep in line everything.

521
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:24,500
 How do you manage so many different projects?

522
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:28,860
 And I think back to all those months

523
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:32,700
 of being in a file room, learning grudgingly

524
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,740
 and saying, Lord, if you've placed me,

525
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:37,980
 or how can I be faithful to where you have placed me

526
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:38,900
 in my life?

527
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,900
 You never know.

528
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,260
 We sit there and we grumble.

529
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,500
 This is, we're above this.

530
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,860
 No, where has God placed you?

531
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,060
 How can we be faithful?

532
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:51,300
 How do we continue to be a good witness,

533
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:54,180
 to honor and faithful to where he has placed us

534
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,260
 in whatever job?

535
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,620
 Because you may be sitting here right now,

536
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:01,020
 watching this, you're saying, I can't stand my job.

537
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,660
 I can't stand my boss.

538
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,820
 I hate everything that I'm doing.

539
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:07,460
 What is God teaching you?

540
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:11,060
 Why does he have you right there?

541
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:15,100
 Why is that so important during this first time?

542
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:18,340
 What is he showing you?

543
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:22,660
 God uses your past to prepare you in the future.

544
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:25,740
 One little thing, I get a chance to work

545
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,780
 with young leaders around the world,

546
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:30,220
 especially Indonesia, I love Indonesia.

547
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,900
 I get a chance to work with these young leaders

548
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,780
 who are now starting businesses

549
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:38,820
 and they're growing in massive, not only wealth,

550
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,660
 but power that will influence their city.

551
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,380
 They're running family businesses

552
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:47,140
 and what they call unicorn companies that are growing big.

553
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:49,580
 And I get a chance in the honor of serving

554
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:52,100
 and working alongside with them to integrate their faith

555
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,100
 in everything that they do.

556
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,140
 But you know why I'm doing that so well,

557
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,900
 or I've gotten a chance to work?

558
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:02,260
 Because I sat in a church in Chinatown, Chicago

559
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:07,260
 for 18 years, working with youth in high school and college.

560
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,820
 And I learned how to work with them

561
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:12,620
 because during those 18 years in that private

562
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:15,340
 with those 100, 200 students that came in

563
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,180
 and out every single year,

564
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,340
 I learned what it meant to be a leader.

565
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:22,580
 I learned what it meant to work with developing leaders,

566
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,060
 working with younger leaders,

567
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,900
 what it meant to work with volunteers,

568
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,380
 what it meant to plan games,

569
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,740
 what it meant to plan events,

570
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:31,940
 to sit there and plan, all of those things

571
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:34,340
 led me to what I am doing now.

572
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:38,100
 You never know, you never know.

573
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,620
 God has powerful plans,

574
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,420
 and here's my encouragement for those who are watching,

575
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,340
 God has powerful plans in your life.

576
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:48,540
 But he may not have revealed it to you right now.

577
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,500
 So are you faithful to where he has placed you

578
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,300
 at that moment because God uses your past

579
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:57,780
 to prepare you for the future.

580
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:03,460
 Second thing is in 1 Samuel 17, 38 through 40,

581
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:06,340
 then Saul called David with his armor.

582
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:08,380
 He put a helmet of bronze on his head

583
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:10,900
 and clothed them with a coat of mail.

584
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,180
 And David strapped his sword over his armor,

585
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:16,220
 he tried it, and he tried in vain to go

586
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:18,580
 for he had not tested them.

587
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:21,300
 Then David said to Saul, "I cannot go with these,

588
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:24,060
 "for I have not tested them."

589
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,660
 So he put them off, then he took his hand,

590
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:29,700
 took his staff in his hand,

591
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:33,660
 and chose five smooth stones from the brook

592
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,620
 and put them in the shepherd's pouch.

593
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:39,740
 His sling was his hand and he approached the Philistine.

594
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:40,700
 Let me show you another picture.

595
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,140
 Let's show the last slide over there

596
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,940
 of what that sling looked like, that slingshot.

597
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:49,380
 Right there, that's what the slingshot did look at.

598
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,980
 Couple things.

599
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:55,980
 Ironically, Saul chooses to give David his armor

600
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:58,100
 and sword and everything like that.

601
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,540
 Here's why.

602
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:03,860
 Let me read to you, Judges 20, verses 15 through 17.

603
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:06,500
 Judges 20, 15 through 17.

604
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:11,500
 The people of Benjamin, remember which tribe Saul was in,

605
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:15,280
 the people of Benjamin mustered out of their cities

606
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:20,280
 on that day 26,000 men who drew the sword

607
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:23,460
 besides the inhabitants of Gibeah

608
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:26,060
 who mustered 700 chosen men.

609
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:31,060
 Among all those were 700 chosen men from Benjamin

610
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,620
 who were left-handed.

611
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:39,620
 Everyone could sling a stone at a hair and not miss.

612
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:45,500
 The tribe of Benjamin were experts at the slingshot.

613
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,060
 Ironic, isn't it?

614
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:51,100
 That Saul, where is he from?

615
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,700
 The tribe of what?

616
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,860
 Benjamin.

617
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:57,780
 The very tribe who knew how to use a slingshot,

618
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,120
 they used it in battle.

619
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,520
 They were skilled marksmen with the slingshot.

620
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:06,800
 He gives David a sword and a shield, armor, all of that.

621
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,440
 David puts on him.

622
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,440
 Does it work?

623
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,200
 Lesson here is this.

624
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:16,800
 What works for others may not necessarily work for you.

625
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,120
 What advice people give you, what they tell you to do

626
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,360
 may not necessarily work for you.

627
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:26,000
 And does that mean as leaders we sit there

628
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,240
 and we don't listen because hey,

629
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,080
 we're gonna do it our way?

630
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,320
 No, you listen.

631
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,240
 One of the best things, qualities about leadership

632
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,600
 is you're listening to people.

633
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,720
 You're always trying to improve yourself.

634
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,560
 You're always trying to be the best version

635
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,020
 that God calls you to be.

636
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:42,500
 But in the midst of that, always knowing that sometimes

637
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:47,280
 the answers that they give you, it may not work for you.

638
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,120
 That's how it works.

639
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,480
 Let me give you an example.

640
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:54,480
 My mother is trained in Hong Kong as a teacher.

641
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,600
 And she has a very, very stern way of teaching.

642
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,440
 Growing up, we always had to get straight A's.

643
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,200
 And she had a chopstick on her finger

644
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,700
 that if we got a math problem wrong,

645
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,680
 that chopstick went on her finger.

646
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,200
 If we got a spelling word wrong,

647
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,240
 we had to sit there and write it out 100 times.

648
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,960
 Well, and she's always reminding us,

649
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,640
 you have to get straight A's, education, education,

650
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,080
 all that you do.

651
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,880
 Well, now I have a daughter and she's seven years old.

652
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,560
 Well, she goes to my mom's school over here in Bridgeport,

653
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,000
 here in Chicago.

654
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,100
 My mom takes her way because that's her way

655
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,880
 of doing education, that she believes

656
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,360
 is work on straight A's.

657
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,380
 And she tries to use this on my daughter.

658
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:35,920
 Not to say it doesn't work,

659
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,400
 but I keep telling my mom all the time,

660
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,900
 you have to understand that getting straight A's

661
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,640
 is not always the end all.

662
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,800
 Just driving, studying without interaction

663
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,280
 is not always the end all.

664
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,520
 But in her mind, no, no, no, this is the best.

665
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,680
 You have to study all the time.

666
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,400
 To the point, my daughter doesn't like going to her house

667
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,560
 anymore because my mom is at the same school.

668
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,920
 She picks her up and she sits there

669
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,880
 and she makes her study from three o'clock

670
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,280
 all the way to five and then when she wants her

671
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,760
 to go to her house on Sundays to do homework,

672
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,000
 what do you think is gonna happen with my daughter?

673
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,320
 She cries every single time she has to go

674
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,760
 to her grandmother's house because she doesn't wanna go.

675
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,160
 And I keep telling my mom, maybe you need to lighten up.

676
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,160
 No, no, you need to make them study all the time.

677
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,860
 It's gonna look different, folks.

678
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:28,420
 What worked for them may not necessarily work for you.

679
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:31,740
 And so as a leader, hear from people.

680
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,940
 Listen to what people have to say.

681
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:38,980
 But you gotta figure out, is it gonna work for me?

682
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,660
 Is it gonna work for me?

683
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:42,940
 In all of the leadership that you have.

684
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:46,280
 As a leader, those who are anointed by God,

685
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:49,300
 you're gonna hear advice from problems,

686
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,340
 you're gonna hear solutions to the problems

687
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:53,880
 that you deal with all of the time.

688
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,980
 And some of them, listen to it.

689
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,220
 Some of them, will it work?

690
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,460
 Probably not.

691
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,280
 You gotta figure out that decision.

692
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,260
 But as leaders, on the other flip chart,

693
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:08,260
 if you have a team, don't insist that your way works.

694
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,020
 Don't insist that your way works.

695
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,780
 What works for others may not work for you.

696
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:15,700
 Your job as a leader, for God's anointing,

697
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,040
 God has given you people to shepherd

698
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,780
 to help them find their voice,

699
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:23,420
 to help them learn how to think.

700
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,740
 I work for one ministry leader,

701
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:30,740
 and Caucasian guy, older guy, his way was always the best.

702
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,320
 His style was always the best.

703
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,900
 You couldn't make the decision unless you do it,

704
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,300
 run it by him for him to give you the okay.

705
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:41,700
 That way worked for him, probably for a period of time.

706
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,660
 Doesn't work for everyone.

707
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:47,300
 What works for others may not necessarily work for you.

708
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,820
 And the last one I want to look at,

709
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:54,100
 is the battle goes on, David takes a slingshot,

710
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,820
 from afar, he defeats Goliath.

711
00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:01,220
 And David said to the Philistine, right before that,

712
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:04,840
 you come to me with a sword and with a spear,

713
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,360
 and with a javelin, nine foot tall Goliath.

714
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:13,600
 But I come to you in the name of the Lord of hosts,

715
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,660
 the God of the armies of Israel,

716
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:19,020
 whom you have defied.

717
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:23,860
 God uses your past to prepare you for the future.

718
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:28,580
 What works for others may not work for you.

719
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,920
 We have to understand that.

720
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:34,920
 And thirdly, the Lord's anointed is a concern

721
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,620
 about upholding the glory of God,

722
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:43,500
 and honoring God and he or she goes out before the Lord,

723
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:46,120
 in everything they do.

724
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,160
 You're a steward of who God is.

725
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:54,400
 You're a steward of what God is calling you to be.

726
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,640
 Your life is no longer yours.

727
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:00,640
 I pick on James because I see him right in front of me.

728
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,600
 James who's at Moody Bible Institute,

729
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,940
 that life isn't his.

730
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:08,140
 His calling to work in the marketplace,

731
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:10,720
 that life and that calling isn't his.

732
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,080
 It's a calling that God says,

733
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,240
 that God, what do you want me to do?

734
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,880
 I graduate from a seminary,

735
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,920
 but Lord, what is it that you want me to do?

736
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,520
 His life is coming before the Lord with an open hand

737
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,680
 to say, Lord, my life is yours.

738
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:24,680
 I give it to you.

739
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:29,320
 But that decision has to come early on, doesn't it?

740
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,760
 Again, going back to Indonesia,

741
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,480
 one of the, I get a chance,

742
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,640
 one of this 24 year old individuals,

743
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,120
 I had a chance to sit down and talk with him,

744
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,200
 I had a mentor who sat with him.

745
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:41,440
 He had started and he had invested $10,000

746
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,520
 and he got an investment of $10,000 to work on a startup.

747
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,480
 Well, that startup grew,

748
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,240
 that he sold his business for $132 million.

749
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,840
 But one of the things that we talked to him about

750
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,040
 before he did this startup,

751
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,000
 and I said, so and so,

752
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,640
 whose life does it belong to?

753
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,680
 Whose life do you belong to?

754
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,880
 Because if that life is the Lord's,

755
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,160
 then you gotta make a decision right now,

756
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,580
 what you're gonna do with that money

757
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:13,520
 before your company goes really successful

758
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,400
 and you make tons of money.

759
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,320
 Because when you make that decision,

760
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,400
 once you become rich,

761
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,360
 you won't make that decision.

762
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:25,120
 You're gonna have to make that decision early on,

763
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,320
 before you become wealthy,

764
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,000
 before you get that job,

765
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,580
 before, whose life do you belong to?

766
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,960
 Because when we're right in that mist,

767
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,960
 it's not gonna be very good.

768
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,320
 And we're gonna make decisions that benefit us.

769
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,800
 I share this with you because for many of us,

770
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,520
 money is a huge issue, isn't it?

771
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,180
 We worry about money.

772
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,400
 We like that life.

773
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,840
 My wife and I, early on,

774
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,080
 when we first started Resource Global,

775
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,520
 we had no money.

776
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,000
 I still remember the early days of Resource Global

777
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,320
 when we first started 12 years ago.

778
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,520
 I sat there, I had maxed out my credit cards,

779
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,560
 not very good for a startup.

780
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:09,560
 I had my last amount of $200 left to get a hotel,

781
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:14,720
 to meet with the donor, all of those different things.

782
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,880
 But my wife and I said,

783
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,920
 can we live on one salary?

784
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:24,500
 And can we always use that rest of the salary that we have

785
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:28,920
 to glorify the Lord in everything that we do?

786
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,440
 To continue to support it for ministry initiatives

787
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:35,720
 because Lord, that money is not ours.

788
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:39,000
 We're a steward of the money and the time and gifts

789
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,520
 that He has given us.

790
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,480
 Fast forward 12 years later,

791
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,120
 I've gotten doing pretty well financially.

792
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,480
 This organization has grown to a point where it was zero

793
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:52,920
 and now it's about $1,000,001.5 million.

794
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,240
 Things are going well.

795
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,200
 My wife is doing well at work as a teacher.

796
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,600
 Her salary continues to increase.

797
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,880
 Does our giving change?

798
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,320
 The answer is no.

799
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:06,040
 We're still committed, doing the same thing.

800
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,760
 And I'm not standing here bragging about it.

801
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,740
 It's a commitment that we have to make.

802
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:13,520
 It's a commitment that all of us have to make in our lives.

803
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,760
 Whose life do we belong to?

804
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,960
 And that our life belongs to the Lord.

805
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,440
 And if the Lord calls us that it's about others first

806
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,340
 and never ours, then it makes it easy.

807
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,480
 That the Lord's anointed, as David talks about,

808
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:28,200
 is concerned about upholding the glory of God

809
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,040
 and honoring the God, that I come to you

810
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,600
 in the name of the Lord, the host,

811
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,440
 the God of the armies of Israel,

812
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,480
 whom you have defied, and Lord,

813
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,320
 you are calling me to do this.

814
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,580
 So the answer makes it easy.

815
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:45,880
 That the money that I have is not mine,

816
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,840
 but rather it's yours.

817
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,620
 And so when Mark and church is so gracious

818
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:53,740
 to give me an honorarium every single time I speak,

819
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,120
 the answer is simple.

820
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,480
 Mark, you use it back for your church

821
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,520
 because this money is not mine.

822
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:03,280
 I do it out of humbleness because of what you have provided

823
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,560
 for me in the cross.

824
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,560
 This person needs help, great.

825
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,000
 This money isn't mine, Lord.

826
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:13,720
 And the Lord blesses me, probably not in financial ways,

827
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,180
 but in ways that I can't even imagine.

828
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:20,240
 Whose life do you belong to?
