[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840]   On this Christmas Sunday, I'm sure if you reveal what has happened to you this year,
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:12.000]   it's going to be probably a very busy day for you, very busy year for you.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:23.840]   [Chinese]
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.760]   Perhaps this year has been a very, very tough year for you.
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.320]   [Cantonese]
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.360]   For many of us at UV, it has been a challenging year.
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:45.040]   You know, we have families dealing with sickness, dealing with death and crisis and difficulties,
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.560]   and our ministries are also tackling with different challenges, and in general,
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.920]   I think there are so many stresses in our life.
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:22.960]   [Cantonese]
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.360]   So I pray that the songs that we offer to you, the song that we are going to sing,
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:38.320]   the Christmas songs, the baptism testimony, the candle lighting ceremony that we're going to do
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.040]   later, will all remind you the real meaning of Christmas.
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:02:12.960]   [Cantonese]
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.160]   Let me read this passage on screen.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.080]   It is taken from the Bible, the Gospel of Luke, from chapter 2.
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.120]   [Cantonese]
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:33.760]   Here, the angelic choir is announcing the good news, the good news of the birth of our Savior,
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.840]   to the shepherds in the field in Bethlehem, the very good news of the birth of our Savior,
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.560]   Jesus Christ.
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:03:02.960]   [Cantonese]
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:09.280]   Suddenly, the angel was joined by the vast host of other angels, the armies of heaven.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.800]   They praised God and they say, "Glory to God in highest heaven,
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.280]   peace on earth to those with whom God is pleased."
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:34.480]   [Cantonese]
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:44.080]   Now, one of the Christmas traditions many Americans would do is to watch some movie,
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.120]   some Christmas movie.
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:57.920]   [Cantonese]
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.840]   And I don't know if you do that or not.
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.280]   [Cantonese]
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.720]   But, you know, many of the families, American families, will be watching
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.520]   Charlie Brown Christmas this season.
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:23.120]   [Cantonese]
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.320]   How many of you have watched this before?
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.200]   Charlie Brown Christmas?
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.760]   Raise your hand.
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.840]   Only a handful, okay?
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:30.560]   Only a handful.
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:37.600]   [Cantonese]
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.960]   All right, so in this movie, Charlie Brown, the main character,
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.040]   is doing his best to organize a Christmas play with the kids.
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:57.040]   [Cantonese]
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:06.560]   But as you can tell, Charlie Brown is trying to organize this play with other kids and
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.680]   kids are not listening to you, right?
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.800]   They run around and no one in the story is listening to Charlie Brown.
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.920]   And everyone starts to criticize Charlie Brown for his, you know,
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.680]   lack of organization or lack of leadership.
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:31.760]   So Charlie was very frustrated and nobody understands the real meaning of Christmas.
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.600]   So at the end, Charlie Brown almost gave up.
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:48.400]   [Cantonese]
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.960]   And by the way, we have some kids joining us today, which is great, right?
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:53.520]   This is great.
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.920]   They're noisy, they're running around, they're joyful and they want to express themselves.
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:03.120]   So as the story goes, Charlie Brown was very frustrated.
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:16.560]   [Cantonese]
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:21.360]   However, at the end, as the story goes, with all the chaos with the kids,
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:27.440]   Charlie Brown has a very wise friend called Ninus.
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:34.320]   So Ninus steps in and Ninus has always been a timid, shy, and, you know,
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:39.280]   less than confident character, less than confident kid in the story.
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:51.280]   [Cantonese]
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:07:00.960]   And that's why you, whenever you see Ninus in Charlie Brown stories or movies,
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:06.880]   Ninus has always has a security blanket in his hand.
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:14.240]   Okay, ring the bell, remind of this character, always has a security blanket in his hand.
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:23.040]   But, Ninus volunteered himself to tell the story of the Bible and the true meaning of Christmas
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.000]   under the spotlight.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:08:02.880]   [Cantonese]
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:04.560]   Do you want to watch this movie?
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.880]   [Cantonese]
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:09.760]   Okay, I'll let you watch two minutes.
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:13.760]   [Cantonese]
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:24.160]   Okay, so we're going to watch two minutes of the most, most spectacular moment in this entire movie.
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:34.160]   [Cantonese]
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:35.360]   What about Charlie Brown?
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:42.720]   Do you enjoy the movie?
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:43.200]   Two minutes.
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.600]   [Cantonese]
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:51.040]   Now, I want to tell you guys, there's one little detail, one little detail in this clip,
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.720]   most of the people missed.
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:58.640]   [Cantonese]
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:05.840]   And that one little detail is that right in the middle of Ninus telling the story of Christmas
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:10.880]   from the Bible, telling other people the real meaning of Christmas, a child is born.
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:17.120]   You see, Ninus actually dropped his security blanket.
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:33.840]   [Cantonese]
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:36.640]   Now, I'm sure we all have our security blankets.
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:42.160]   [Cantonese]
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:51.120]   Things that give you peace, things that give you security, things that give you confidence.
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:10:03.840]   [Cantonese]
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:14.400]   Maybe our bank account, the money that we have, our friends, our career, our identity,
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.040]   or some sort of certainty in our future.
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:31.040]   [Cantonese]
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:42.080]   And we all try to grab that thing, you know, or some things that will give us everlasting peace,
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:47.280]   to give us a little bit more peace, a little bit more, you know, confidence.
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:55.280]   But as you know, in reality, those things do not last.
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:58.880]   They often disappoint us.
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:15.840]   [Cantonese]
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:22.000]   Maybe health, maybe our well-being, maybe our future, our security, whatever that is,
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.240]   your security blanket.
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:36.720]   [Cantonese]
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:40.560]   And I want to tell you, you know, they often disappoint us.
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:44.560]   Nothing can be guaranteed.
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:50.800]   [Cantonese]
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:55.520]   Now, what Christmas is all about is a different kind of peace.
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:58.160]   It's a different kind of peace.
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:01.360]   It's a true, everlasting peace.
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.960]   It's peace with God our Father.
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:19.840]   [Cantonese]
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:30.080]   Peace in times of chaos, peace in times of difficulty, peace in times of challenge,
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:33.440]   knowing that God is with us.
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:37.440]   God is always with us in Jesus Christ.
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:49.440]   [Cantonese]
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:55.040]   And that is the everlasting peace.
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:13:01.040]   [Cantonese]
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:02.320]   The real meaning of Christmas.
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:12.880]   Glory to God in the highest heaven and peace on earth to those with whom God is pleased.
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:20.160]   [Cantonese]
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:28.000]   And the people that God is pleased with are those who have put their faith in Christ Jesus.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:38.800]   [Cantonese]
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:43.520]   So how can we receive the gift of God in Christ Jesus?
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:48.640]   [Cantonese]
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:52.080]   Well, first thing we have to do is to let go.
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:57.600]   If you want to receive a gift, you have to receive it with open hands.
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:06.000]   But if we are holding on to our security blankets, our stuff, you know, our hands are not open
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:11.040]   and our hearts are not open, then we cannot receive the gift of God.
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:19.040]   [Cantonese]
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:25.600]   [Cantonese]
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:51.600]   [Cantonese]
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.200]   So how can you receive the gift of God?
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:15:00.960]   Only by your hands not holding on to your security blankets.
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:14.160]   [Cantonese]
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:19.120]   How can we experience the gift of God if our hearts are filled with overwhelm
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:24.000]   with our stuff and our idols, our work, our overwhelmingly busy schedule?
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.800]   We etch out God in our life.
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:32.320]   The only way we can receive the gift of God is that we let go of this stuff.
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:42.160]   And with an open heart, we come to God and say, "Thank you for giving me the very son of yours."
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:48.160]   [Cantonese]
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:56.560]   [Cantonese]
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:02.400]   So at the end, I want to invite you, all of you, to take this moment,
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:10.240]   take this very moment to reconnect, to reconnect with God.
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:17.840]   God who created you, God who loves you, God who is always with you.
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:28.400]   [Cantonese]
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:36.400]   [Cantonese]
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:42.400]   [Cantonese]
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:58.400]   [Cantonese]
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:03.280]   Now let me read this prayer first before we recite it together.
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:08.800]   So I want to invite you to recite it with, you know, with your words or with your heart.
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:30.800]   [Cantonese]
[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:32.800]   Dear Lord Jesus, the prayer says,
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:36.800]   I ask you to grant me peace.
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:42.800]   Peace in my heart when I feel, when it feels like the world all around us spins out of control.
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:46.800]   Help me stay focused on you.
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:50.800]   The son of God, born in a humble manger.
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:56.800]   I come to you, God, with an open heart.
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:00.800]   I know my need for your grace and your forgiveness.
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:04.800]   I ask you to be my savior and my Lord.
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:08.800]   Cleanse me from my sins and make me new today.
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:12.800]   Fill me with your peace and guide me in your way.
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.800]   In Jesus' name.
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:20.800]   [Cantonese]
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:26.800]   [Cantonese]
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:32.800]   [Cantonese]
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:38.800]   [Cantonese]
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:44.800]   [Cantonese]
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:50.800]   [Cantonese]
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:19:02.800]   [Cantonese]
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:08.800]   Let's end today's service with the lighting ceremony.
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:12.800]   We're going to pass the flame to the candles.
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:16.800]   But we want to end and conclude with this prayer.
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:20.800]   Well, let's do it in English first.
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:24.800]   If you want to join me, go ahead, all right?
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.800]   But you can pray in your heart as well.
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:28.800]   Let's do that.
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:32.800]   Dear Lord Jesus, I ask you to grant me peace.
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:38.800]   Peace in my heart when it feels like the world all around us spins out of control.
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:40.800]   Help me stay focused on you.
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:43.800]   The son of God, born in a humble manger.
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.800]   I come to you with a humble heart.
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:49.800]   I know my need for your grace and forgiveness.
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:52.800]   I ask you to be my savior and Lord.
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:56.800]   Cleanse me from my sins and make me new.
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.800]   Fill me with your peace.
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:00.800]   Guide me in your way.
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:01.800]   In Jesus' name.
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:03.800]   Amen.
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:11.800]   [Cantonese]
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:38.800]   [Cantonese]
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:40.800]   Let's all pray together.
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.800]   [Cantonese]
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:45.800]   Lord Jesus, this is our prayer.
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:48.800]   And our prayer is to make room for you.
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:53.800]   [Cantonese]
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:21:00.800]   And we invite Jesus to come into our lives to be our savior anew.
