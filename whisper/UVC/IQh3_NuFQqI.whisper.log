[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   [music]
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.360]   Hello everyone! I'm Miss Rebecca.
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.440]   Welcome back to Family Sunday School.
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.760]   This week is the fifth episode.
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.680]   Do you remember what we talked about in the fourth episode?
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.080]   Yes, we get to know a lot of different animals
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.880]   and make a lot of different sounds.
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.880]   But what's the most important thing?
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.880]   The dog!
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.880]   What is Peter doing?
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.880]   Yes, he is rejecting Jesus.
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.880]   Did you notice that I'm wearing different glasses?
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.880]   Do you remember?
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.880]   In the last episode, I asked my parents to read other Bible verses.
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.880]   I asked them to see if they could relate to the story I told.
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.880]   Why do we need to see so many different verses?
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.880]   So that we can see them from different angles.
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.880]   For example, I'm wearing these glasses.
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.880]   I'm a little blurred when I'm looking at things.
[00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:07.880]   Why?
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.880]   Because of the eyebrows, the nose, and the nose.
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.880]   But if I wear glasses or wear clothes,
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.880]   will it be more clear?
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.880]   I'm wearing these glasses, but they are a little dirty.
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.880]   I can't see very clearly.
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.880]   I change my clothes, but I can see different things.
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.880]   This pair of glasses is so clear.
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.880]   When we turn our glasses, we can see different things.
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.880]   Sometimes it's a little blurry, sometimes it's clearer.
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.880]   Or something is magnified.
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.880]   Because there are many different glasses for different purposes.
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:56.880]   For example, when parents or elders are reading,
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.880]   they are a little blurry.
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.880]   They can't read when they are close to reading.
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.880]   But with glasses, they can read.
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.880]   So, we magnify.
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:06.880]   Right?
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.880]   So, today, let's see if you really read other Bible verses.
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.880]   Did you find anything?
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.880]   Any new discoveries?
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.880]   Tell me.
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.880]   No?
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:26.880]   No?
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.880]   No?
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:28.880]   No?
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:29.880]   It's okay.
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:30.880]   I read it too.
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.880]   But, Miss Rebecca has a lot of different Bible verses.
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:34.880]   Right?
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.880]   When Miss Rebecca didn't talk about it in the last episode,
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.880]   she didn't mention one thing.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.880]   She didn't mention the cock-a-doodle-doo.
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.880]   Peter looked at Jesus.
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:48.880]   Jesus looked at Peter.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.880]   Oh, he really did it.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.880]   Miss Rebecca didn't mention it.
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:53.880]   How?
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.880]   In that book?
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.880]   This book also mentions it.
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.880]   This book also mentions it.
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.880]   What does it say?
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.880]   Peter cried and ran away.
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.880]   He wept and fled the courtyard.
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.880]   He cried and ran away.
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.880]   So, when he left the courtyard,
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:27.880]   he didn't know what happened.
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.880]   So, this is one thing.
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:30.880]   He left.
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:31.880]   Right?
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.880]   Who did it?
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.880]   John!
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:35.880]   Right.
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:36.880]   There's one more thing.
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.880]   Miss Rebecca found it in other Bible verses.
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:40.880]   Do you remember?
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.880]   There were three times when people asked Peter,
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.880]   "Do you know Jesus?"
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.880]   "No, I don't know him."
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.880]   "I don't know what you're talking about."
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:51.880]   Right?
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:52.880]   There were two ladies.
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:53.880]   One lady asked,
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.880]   "You seem to be with him."
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:56.880]   "No, not me."
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.880]   "No, you really seem to be with him."
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:01.880]   The second lady said,
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.880]   "No, I don't know what you're talking about."
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.880]   Then, a little further away,
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.880]   there was a man.
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.880]   He said, "No, I heard your accent."
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:15.880]   "Accent" means "accent."
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.880]   Sometimes, when we come from different places,
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.880]   we have different accents.
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:20.880]   Even though we're speaking English,
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.880]   when we use English with different accents,
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.880]   we'll know where we're from.
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:27.880]   Right?
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:28.880]   So, he heard her say,
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.880]   "No, you're from Galilee."
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.880]   Because in Galilee,
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.880]   the way they speak and their accents are a little different.
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.880]   They can hear.
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:39.880]   Right?
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.880]   Ms. Birkin didn't mention that.
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.880]   So, there are many hints
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:46.880]   to let them know that
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.880]   Peter is with Jesus,
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.880]   but Peter is a pharaoh.
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.880]   What will we talk about in this episode?
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.880]   Jesus went in.
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.880]   He went into his house
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.880]   with the elders.
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:09.880]   These elders are the highest leaders of the Jews.
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.880]   Do you know that?
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:12.880]   When they went in,
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.880]   they had to judge him.
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:15.880]   Judge him.
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:16.880]   Trial him.
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.880]   See what crimes he committed.
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.880]   Those who arrested him
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.880]   thought he committed all kinds of crimes.
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.880]   But is it true?
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.880]   Today, we'll see
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:34.880]   what happens when Jesus is judged.
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.880]   But before we start,
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:38.880]   what do we do?
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.880]   Of course, we play a game.
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:42.880]   Okay.
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.880]   Let's play a game.
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.880]   Get ready.
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.880]   I have a musical instrument.
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.880]   I will play this musical instrument.
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.880]   This is called a xylophone.
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.880]   In Chinese, it's called a wood instrument.
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.880]   In the past, it was made of wood.
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.880]   It made different sounds.
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.880]   This one is made of iron.
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:07.880]   When I play,
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.880]   you have to throw the ball.
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.880]   You can find a ball or a toy.
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.880]   You can find a leaf.
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.880]   I play and you throw.
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:18.880]   You don't have to follow the order.
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.880]   Throw to the person you want to throw.
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:21.880]   Throw again.
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:27.880]   The object is to not hit the ball.
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.880]   I play the wood instrument.
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:31.880]   After the music,
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.880]   whoever holds the ball is out.
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.880]   Okay?
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.880]   We'll do four rounds.
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:38.880]   I'll do four rounds.
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.880]   I don't know how many people are there.
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.880]   Let's start.
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:43.880]   Here we go.
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:07:08.880]   [xylophone playing]
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:09.880]   Done!
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.880]   Whoever holds the hot potato
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.880]   is out of the round.
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.880]   Okay, next round.
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:18.880]   Ready?
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.880]   You can switch places.
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:21.880]   You can take it away.
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:22.880]   You can do whatever you want.
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.880]   Okay, second round.
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.880]   Here we go.
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:45.880]   [xylophone playing]
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:46.880]   Done!
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:47.880]   Okay.
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.880]   Who got it?
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.880]   What do you do if you get the hot potato?
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:52.880]   Yes, you're out.
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:53.880]   Sorry.
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.880]   You can continue next time.
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:56.880]   Okay?
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:57.880]   It's not a game.
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.880]   Sometimes we win, sometimes we lose.
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:04.880]   [speaking in Chinese]
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:05.880]   Okay.
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:06.880]   [speaking in Chinese]
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:09.880]   Round number three.
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:26.880]   [xylophone playing]
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:27.880]   All done!
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:36.880]   [speaking in Chinese]
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:37.880]   Okay.
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:46.880]   [speaking in Chinese]
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:47.880]   Ready?
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:48.880]   Let's go.
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:09:08.880]   [xylophone playing]
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:09.880]   All done!
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:10.880]   Okay.
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.880]   [speaking in Chinese]
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:14.880]   Okay.
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:15.880]   Last one standing.
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:16.880]   Winner.
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.880]   [speaking in Chinese]
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:20.880]   Okay.
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.880]   [speaking in Chinese]
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:49.880]   All right.
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.880]   Have fun!
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:56.880]   [speaking in Chinese]
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:00.880]   Bible story time!
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.880]   [speaking in Chinese]
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.880]   Bible story time.
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.880]   [speaking in Chinese]
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:29.880]   [speaking in Chinese]
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:51.880]   [speaking in Chinese]
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:11:20.880]   [speaking in Chinese]
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:30.880]   [speaking in Chinese]
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:40.880]   [speaking in Chinese]
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:50.880]   [speaking in Chinese]
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:53.880]   [speaking in Chinese]
