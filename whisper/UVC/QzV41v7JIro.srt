1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
 Alright, today we're going to work through the Apostle's Creed and we come to the third

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,560
 section of the Creed.

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:13,000
 As I said, this is a road map of what Christianity is all about.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,760
 If you've ever been wondering, okay, what Christians should believe and what the Bible

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,400
 says about the Christian faith, this is a good road map.

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:26,000
 Twelve articles, twelve statements, English and Chinese I'm giving to you.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 And we have talked about I believe in God, the God who exists.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,960
 We don't believe in the existence of God.

9
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,680
 That's not what the church is all about.

10
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,720
 That's not what the Bible is all about.

11
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:44,640
 It's about the God who exists and the God who relates to us, God who loves us, God who

12
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,640
 cares for us.

13
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,560
 Alright, so we believe in God, that's the first article.

14
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,200
 And then the second section is about Jesus Christ.

15
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:56,080
 There's a whole second section about what He did in history, what He did in our lives,

16
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,160
 right, to save us from sin.

17
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,560
 And He is now reigning, seated at the right hand of the Father.

18
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:07,080
 And then the third section, the yellow section, we have been working through since last Sunday.

19
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,920
 And we believe in the Holy Spirit, the triune God being with us.

20
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,520
 And then today we're going to work through the other two articles, the Holy Universal

21
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,600
 Church and then I believe in the Communion of Saints.

22
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,920
 Very interesting statement, Holy Universal Church.

23
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:32,020
 Now if you know a little bit about Latin, behind the word universal, it was Catholic.

24
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:37,440
 So there are different translations of the Apostles' Creed that says, "I believe in the

25
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,040
 Holy Catholic Church."

26
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,800
 Now Catholic does not mean Roman Catholicism, does not mean the Roman Catholic Church.

27
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,360
 Catholic is an old word.

28
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,200
 It means universal.

29
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,820
 It means worldwide.

30
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:56,360
 It means there is something about the Church, God's community, that extends beyond time

31
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,680
 and generation and geography.

32
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:04,840
 And we are all bound together as one family, one Church, capital C, Church.

33
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,040
 Holy Catholic Church, Universal Church, right?

34
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:15,280
 I wonder if you have a thought about there is a special relationship between Christians,

35
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,720
 between those who believe in God, those who profess the name of Jesus.

36
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:27,040
 There is something special connection about, you know, believers in Christ.

37
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:36,080
 Two years ago when the pandemic began, we, you know, full scale, we go online.

38
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:45,600
 And I find it very interesting and largely inspiring to be able to connect with a lot

39
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:51,080
 of different people around the world through the online streaming and online Zoom meeting

40
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,080
 and all that stuff.

41
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,080
 As you know, our YouTube channel was very small.

42
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,000
 It was under 1,000 subscribers.

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 And because of the pandemic, now we have, what's the newest number?

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 13K?

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 Something like that.

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Yeah.

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,960
 So, we have a lot of connections with other people, you know, from Asia, from West Coast

48
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,400
 and East Coast, even from UK.

49
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:22,080
 I just got to know someone from UK a couple of weeks ago, and she was attending my class

50
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,600
 online.

51
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:34,440
 And then we were connecting and I understand more about her career, what she has been doing

52
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:39,400
 and she understands more about our church.

53
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:45,600
 In any case, I think there's a special connection that we have as brothers and sisters.

54
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:52,320
 The most common titles, most common labels for believers in the Bible from Old Testament

55
00:03:52,320 --> 00:04:00,160
 to the New Testament is brothers and sisters, family, right?

56
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,000
 And that's what this article is all about.

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,480
 I believe in the Holy Universal Church.

58
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:10,400
 And I think one of the passages that talks about the unity of believers that extends

59
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,400
 beyond time and geography is Psalm 133.

60
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,400
 Psalm 133.

61
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,880
 Let's read verse 1.

62
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,880
 Psalm 133.

63
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,680
 A song of essence of David.

64
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:31,280
 How good and pleasant it is when brothers, of course, including sisters, living together

65
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,920
 in unity, dwelling together in unity.

66
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:44,720
 There is something good about believers getting ready and gathering together, like what we

67
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,800
 do today, singing together, worshipping God together, praying together, caring for one

68
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,320
 another, like what we do in the afternoon.

69
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,680
 We have the family gathering, the general assembly to take care of some of the businesses

70
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,520
 and some of the things that are happening in the church.

71
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,560
 And we got a photo booth back there.

72
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,880
 Thanks to the team who put this up and we can take some pictures for memories.

73
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:16,880
 You know, it's all about the family and brothers and sisters living together, dwelling together.

74
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,760
 That is something good in the sight of God.

75
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:27,240
 When God sees God's people getting ready, getting together to worship, to have fellowship

76
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:33,040
 together, there is something good about just the gathering.

77
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:44,880
 Well, according to the words of Moses in Deuteronomy, he says there are three times in a year that

78
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:51,080
 the people of God, especially their representatives, the males, back in the ancient society, it

79
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,120
 was the male dominant or patriarchal society.

80
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,200
 Of course, that includes the whole family, right?

81
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:01,120
 But the head of the family is the patriarch, is the male.

82
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:09,080
 So three times in a year, all your males should appear before the Lord your God in the place

83
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,160
 where He chooses.

84
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:17,400
 There were three times, the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which is in our calendar, April or

85
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:24,880
 May, the Passover, the Good Friday and Easter season.

86
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,880
 That's the first time.

87
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:33,200
 Second time, 49 days, seven weeks later, the Feast of the Weeks, the Pentecost.

88
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,560
 About May or June, they need to go to Jerusalem again.

89
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,760
 And then the third time is the Feast of Sukkot, the Tabernacle, the Booths.

90
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:47,600
 It was about the fourth time, September or October.

91
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:55,920
 They shall appear before the Lord to worship, to take the pilgrimage from where they live

92
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:00,880
 to the place God has chosen, which is Jerusalem.

93
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:06,200
 And they shall not appear before the Lord empty-handed because they are coming to worship.

94
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,720
 Three times in a year.

95
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:15,680
 Now you can imagine in the old days when you had no iPhones, no GPS, no cars, and nothing

96
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,680
 like that.

97
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:23,160
 If you live in Galilee, which is in the north, you see the little freshwater lake up in the

98
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:28,000
 north where the beginning point of the arrow is.

99
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,920
 If you live there, you have to travel three times a year to Jerusalem.

100
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,880
 That is about 90 miles of distance.

101
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:42,560
 In the old days, the average walking speed of a human, guess what it is?

102
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,360
 How many miles per hour can you walk?

103
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,360
 Average?

104
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,360
 Three, right?

105
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,360
 Yeah.

106
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,040
 Well, give or take two or three, right?

107
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,160
 Two or three miles per hour.

108
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,440
 And you have to walk 90 miles.

109
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,880
 How many days would that take?

110
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:05,200
 That is about, if I'm right, about, I'm math, five to six days.

111
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,000
 Eight hours a day you just keep walking, right?

112
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,960
 Keep walking and keep walking until you reach your destination, Jerusalem.

113
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,200
 It takes about six or even seven days.

114
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:21,720
 And think about how much preparation one has to make to worship God to come to Jerusalem,

115
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,720
 right?

116
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,160
 It takes intentional sacrifice of time and energy and all this, of tons of preparation

117
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,320
 to be in the presence of God, right?

118
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:43,000
 I believe this passage talks about the people of God need to appear before the Lord in Jerusalem.

119
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,720
 It's a reminder for us.

120
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:53,360
 You know, today, as we come before a corporate worship, together, we need to prepare ourselves

121
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,440
 as well, right?

122
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,080
 Even in our modern days, when we prepare for a trip, right?

123
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,640
 I'm leaving for Tennessee for a family trip tomorrow.

124
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,400
 Guess how much preparation there is, right?

125
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,040
 Guess how much preparation there is.

126
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:17,760
 The end of August, next month, I'm leading about 10 people to visit the land of Israel

127
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,760
 to study together.

128
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:23,720
 And guess how much intentional preparation we have to make, right?

129
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:31,480
 A couple of days ago, I received two SIM cards from a company where I need to rent two local

130
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:37,400
 phones in order to have better communication in Israel.

131
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:41,040
 And we make months of preparation.

132
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,760
 Think about what Deuteronomy says.

133
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,040
 Think about what Psalm says.

134
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,760
 We have to prepare ourselves to worship.

135
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,720
 Now, notice the title of the Psalm, 133.

136
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,840
 The Psalms of Ascent.

137
00:09:54,840 --> 00:10:01,240
 There are 15 Psalms that has the same title, Psalm of Ascent.

138
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,360
 Psalm of Ascent means rising up, going up, right?

139
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,360
 Going up.

140
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:13,920
 It comes from the word even Israeli Jews today would use, aliyah.

141
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,040
 When they say aliyah, they talk about an immigration process.

142
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,960
 Most Jews or Israelis, they are living outside of the land of Israel.

143
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,640
 They live in diaspora in Europe or in America.

144
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:34,360
 If they decide to immigrate to the land of Israel, the modern nation of Israel, the whole

145
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,560
 process of immigration is called aliyah.

146
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,480
 Now, what does it mean?

147
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,040
 Ascent means going up.

148
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,360
 Aliyah means going up, right?

149
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,800
 And why?

150
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:51,000
 If you check the geography of the land of Israel, Jerusalem is in the mountain area.

151
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,720
 It is more than 2,000 feet above sea level.

152
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,560
 So wherever you come in, north, south, east, or west, you always go up.

153
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,640
 You always go aliyah.

154
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:09,160
 Even today when they immigrate to the nation of Israel, they are going through aliyah.

155
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,720
 Have you done your aliyah yet?

156
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,720
 Something like that.

157
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,240
 This is a beautiful picture of what worship is all about.

158
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,080
 Going up, looking up.

159
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,760
 You come here, you don't just look at each other horizontally.

160
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,640
 It's a vertical relationship.

161
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:31,600
 There are many different images of Christian journey or Christian life you find in the

162
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,320
 Old Testament or especially in the New Testament.

163
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,080
 You can find the image of disciple.

164
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,800
 The word disciple means student, right?

165
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,880
 It's a lifelong learning process.

166
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,120
 You can find the image of temple.

167
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,760
 The Christians are together like stones.

168
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,160
 We are living stones.

169
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,800
 We are building a temple where God will dwell in the midst of us.

170
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:59,720
 There are different kinds of images, but I think one of the most neglected images that

171
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:04,440
 a Christian life is all about is the word pilgrimage.

172
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,440
 Pilgrimage.

173
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,960
 It's a journey.

174
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,960
 It's aliyah.

175
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:13,440
 It's going up to somewhere.

176
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:21,040
 It is going to a certain end point or destination.

177
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:29,000
 That may be new to you, but I think Psalm 133 is a song of a sense, one of the fifteen.

178
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:36,640
 It's reminding you and me that worshipping God, relating to God is a journey.

179
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,640
 It's an aliyah.

180
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,640
 It's a pilgrimage.

181
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:47,120
 You are going somewhere and the pilgrimage, the journey is a sacred journey.

182
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,800
 Verse 2, it says, "It is like when people coming together to Jerusalem, worshipping

183
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,400
 together, brothers and sisters."

184
00:12:54,400 --> 00:13:03,120
 Verse 2, it says, "It is like good oil, precious oil poured on the head and running down the

185
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:09,880
 beer of Aaron down upon the opening or the collar of his robes."

186
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,880
 Yikes.

187
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,840
 I don't think it's a beautiful picture.

188
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:20,120
 So you can imagine oil coming down here and then there's a long beer.

189
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:24,920
 I think it's pretty ugly for us as modern people.

190
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:31,560
 But in the ancient time, when they think about Aaron being anointed with so much oil and

191
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:38,960
 good oil, good precious olive oils, pure oil, they are thinking of the anointing of the

192
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,640
 high priest.

193
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:46,320
 The high priest is the representative of all of Israel, all the people of God.

194
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,200
 And the high priest will go into the holy of holies of the temple of Jerusalem once

195
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,880
 a year, only one time a year.

196
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:58,200
 And he is allowed to go into the holy of holies to worship God.

197
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:06,440
 And he, Aaron, the high priest, is actually the representation of every single Israelite.

198
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:11,760
 Every single brother and sister is all upon the high priest.

199
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:20,680
 So anointing him, meaning this is the most sacred climax of the worship life of the whole

200
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:25,000
 nation, of the whole people of God.

201
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:33,520
 When the high priest being anointed, meaning that we can come before the presence of God.

202
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:39,000
 We can come before God himself and we can worship him.

203
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:47,280
 When Aaron enters the holy of holies, the whole people of God enters with him, go into

204
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,440
 the temple.

205
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,920
 And please notice that.

206
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,880
 It's always corporate.

207
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,280
 Worship is always collective.

208
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:03,480
 In the Bible, from the first book, Genesis, all the way to the last book of the New Testament,

209
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:09,400
 Revelation, when it talks about worship, it's not just about singing.

210
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,400
 It's not just about gathering.

211
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,280
 It's a collective experience.

212
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,560
 It's a corporate thing to do.

213
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:19,040
 It's never your own, your individualistic exercise.

214
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:26,280
 Now of course you can worship God with your guitar, you can sing to God in your bedroom,

215
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,240
 you can do it by yourself.

216
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,400
 That is of course authentic worship, right?

217
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,880
 You can do it yourself.

218
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:39,680
 But when the Bible talks about worship, it's often referred to as something corporate,

219
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,480
 something we can see each other, to come together.

220
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:47,680
 And that is what true worship is all about.

221
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:54,280
 Now I think one of the cultural scripts of our days, cultural scripts, what I mean, cultural

222
00:15:54,280 --> 00:16:03,760
 scripts meaning our culture has different grand narratives, grand ideologies, grand

223
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,440
 ideas.

224
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,240
 The ideas are so much affecting how we think and how we act.

225
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:18,320
 But I think one of the cultural scripts today, which is also a cultural right, is that you

226
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,080
 are on your own.

227
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:26,680
 And you can define yourself and you are not related to anyone.

228
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:33,120
 You decide for yourself, your future, your career, your identity, or what not.

229
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,440
 You can do it yourself.

230
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,800
 It's all DIY, right?

231
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,440
 It's one of our cultural scripts in America.

232
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,800
 Individualism.

233
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,960
 Who is going to define you?

234
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:52,160
 Who is going to define your identity?

235
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,240
 You, the person in the mirror.

236
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,440
 That is one of the cultural rights.

237
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:03,040
 You singular can change the world.

238
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:11,040
 A couple of months ago I attended a graduation ceremony.

239
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,720
 It was not too long ago.

240
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:21,120
 I pay attention to the speech being said there, although nobody paid attention to that.

241
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,000
 But I pay attention to what the speaker is talking about.

242
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:35,120
 In the commencement speech, playing the whole entire cultural script, "Graduates, you are

243
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,480
 important.

244
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,040
 You can change the world.

245
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,480
 Graduates, you are good.

246
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,000
 You can change the world all by yourself.

247
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 Individualistic."

248
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,160
 It's one of our cultural scripts.

249
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:55,800
 Some years ago, actually some decades ago, Mother Teresa was being interviewed by a British

250
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:03,000
 journalist called Malcolm McElrich.

251
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:10,280
 Now in the entire interview, it was done in 1968.

252
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:15,400
 And because of that interview, Mother Teresa became internationally known by many other

253
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,400
 people.

254
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,960
 It was only because of that interview.

255
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,160
 Everybody after that knows Mother Teresa.

256
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,840
 And in their conversation, in the interview, it's very interesting.

257
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,000
 There was one point.

258
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:38,840
 Mother Teresa said to Malcolm, "Malcolm claimed to be a Christian, but he was never willing

259
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,700
 to join the church.

260
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:44,660
 But he says he's a Christian."

261
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:53,160
 So Mother Teresa said to Malcolm, she said, "Malcolm, you're a good man.

262
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:57,560
 Why don't you go all the way and become a church member?"

263
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:06,160
 And then Malcolm replied, he said, "Well, to answer you, Mother, I guess God sees that

264
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,560
 I am a good man.

265
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:14,840
 And God needs some good men outside of the church as well as inside of the church."

266
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:21,620
 And to that, Mother Teresa replied with three words, three English words.

267
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,780
 And guess what they are?

268
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:28,820
 Mother Teresa said, "No, he doesn't."

269
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:32,500
 And to that, Malcolm could not reply anymore.

270
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:40,080
 And in his autobiography, Malcolm writes, "I could not answer that argument, so I became

271
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,080
 a church member."

272
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:47,560
 No, you are not the most important person in the world.

273
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,320
 We are not.

274
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,560
 God is.

275
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,140
 God is most important.

276
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,660
 And we are His servants.

277
00:19:55,660 --> 00:20:02,460
 And God doesn't call us to be successful.

278
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:05,360
 God calls us to be faithful.

279
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:10,080
 Faithful with our time and our gift, our talents, our treasure.

280
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,440
 That's all God asks us to do.

281
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,020
 We are not the most important people in the world.

282
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:27,560
 But when God sees His people, He sees a family, a church, a family.

283
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:39,200
 Verse 3, "When God's people together, worshipping Him, it is as if the dew of Hermon, which

284
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:47,280
 is the highest mountain in Israel, the dew, the moisture, falling on Mount Zion, which

285
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,040
 is Jerusalem.

286
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:55,240
 For there the Lord bestows His blessing, even life forevermore."

287
00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:04,520
 Dew of Hermon is the cold moisture, the highest mountain, 9,000 feet above sea level.

288
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,240
 Snow-capped mountain.

289
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:14,120
 Moisture coming down to bless the land so that the land will have life, especially in

290
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:18,800
 summer months, about April to September.

291
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,600
 There's no rain in the land of Israel.

292
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,560
 It's so dry and so hot.

293
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,840
 There's no rain during the summer months.

294
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:34,000
 And in order to survive those months, you need the dew of Hermon.

295
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:42,680
 The morning dew, the mist, the hazy thin moisture that we see early morning, every early morning

296
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,600
 before sunrise.

297
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:50,840
 It is life being sustained by the moisture.

298
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,760
 So you see the metaphor here.

299
00:21:52,760 --> 00:22:00,280
 When the people of God gather together to worship Him, collectively, cooperatively,

300
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:05,040
 it is like life we can experience.

301
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:09,400
 Again you believe in Jesus Christ, you become a Christian, right?

302
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,880
 And you have eternal life, right?

303
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:18,280
 So often we mistakenly thought that the eternal life can be experienced individualistically.

304
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,560
 No, the Bible says no.

305
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,080
 The Apostles' Creed says no.

306
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:31,000
 We can only experience eternal life, the fullness, when the people of God gather together, sisters

307
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,440
 and brothers, getting ready to worship God.

308
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:39,680
 And that is the beautiful picture about corporate worship.

309
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:47,800
 I think the pandemic has done quite a bit damage to Christian life, to church life,

310
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,920
 to our own life.

311
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:54,440
 Because it forces us to isolate ourselves, right?

312
00:22:54,440 --> 00:23:02,720
 To go through, I mean to abide with the culture script of individualism.

313
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,520
 That we are okay as long as we are on our own.

314
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,920
 No, the Bible says no.

315
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:19,560
 We are being created as someone connected with the bigger family, a bigger church.

316
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:32,560
 I understand in this generation, many organized religious institutions fell, leaders fell.

317
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:37,040
 I have talked about it in the previous sermon.

318
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:43,800
 Please don't put your faith in any human beings, myself included.

319
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,400
 We are all broken.

320
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:49,200
 We need to be redeemed, every one of us.

321
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,080
 I like what Martin Luther said.

322
00:23:52,080 --> 00:24:04,560
 He said, "Every Christian is 100% sane, being redeemed by God, forgiven by God.

323
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:07,880
 But he is also 100% sinner."

324
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:14,560
 We are all broken and we need the redemption of Jesus Christ offered by the cross.

325
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,840
 We need the gospel, all of us.

326
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,720
 We need the gospel.

327
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,800
 We need the new life, the eternal life of God.

328
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:28,200
 So don't put your faith in human beings.

329
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:35,400
 And don't put your faith, by all means, in any organization, any religious institution.

330
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,320
 They are broken as well.

331
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:41,200
 They are broken as broken as we are.

332
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,640
 Put your faith in God.

333
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:47,840
 Put your faith in Jesus Christ.

334
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,720
 So back to the beautiful picture of corporate worship.

335
00:24:52,720 --> 00:25:01,400
 I think the Psalms invites us to re-imagine, to re-envision what worship is all about.

336
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,040
 What life in God is all about.

337
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:11,440
 When God's people getting ready together, right, to worship God together.

338
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,800
 Ask yourself next time you go to worship.

339
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:18,000
 Ask yourself next week when you come in, alright.

340
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,920
 How do you get ready?

341
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:24,880
 Your body, your mind, and your spirit, right.

342
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:31,400
 Even I as a pastor, sometimes I go to another church to worship because of traveling.

343
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:35,120
 I go to another church to attend the worship service.

344
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:40,200
 I always ask myself before I step into the worship service, before the service starts.

345
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,320
 I always pray a simple prayer.

346
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:46,360
 I pray to God, "Prepare my heart.

347
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,000
 Prepare my mind.

348
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,040
 Prepare my body so that I can meet God in His presence.

349
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:57,240
 I can worship with other believers."

350
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:03,080
 When I read the Bible together, when I think about faith, think about this, you know, God

351
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,720
 thing, right.

352
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:14,480
 Over and over again I want God to shape my mind, right, and shape my heart.

353
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,080
 You know, this psalm is telling us we are coming together as a community.

354
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:23,240
 We are never isolated individuals.

355
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:28,680
 Come together as one people, living together, worshipping God together.

356
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:32,040
 And of course now our high priest is our Lord Jesus Christ.

357
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:36,360
 He is the perfect high priest and He offered Himself as the perfect sacrifice.

358
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:43,400
 To the holy of holies, in Jesus, in Christ, we can come before the very presence of God.

359
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:53,160
 And we can come before God and when we worship Him together, God sees something good in us.

360
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:58,680
 There is something pleasant in His sight.

361
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,000
 Let's all pray together.

362
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,480
 Father, we give You thanks because You are our good God.

363
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:15,480
 And thank You for Your grace that formed this community, formed Your church, formed Your

364
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:19,800
 community that is to worship.

365
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:27,520
 And we pray that we never lose sight of the fact that we are worshipping You as one people.

366
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:35,000
 We are worshipping You in Christ and with other sisters and brothers.

367
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,360
 And thank You for the opportunity, for the blessing that we can experience when we worship

368
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,960
 You together.

369
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:46,360
 And pray that You will continue to help us and remind us to prepare our hearts and our

370
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:53,440
 mind and our body so that we can worship You and the worship act itself is pleasing and

371
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,280
 is good in Your sight.

372
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:02,240
 And thank You that we can be Your children, Your sons and daughters.

373
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,240
 In Christ's name we pray.

374
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:03,240
 Amen.

375
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:03,740
 Amen.

376
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:13,740
