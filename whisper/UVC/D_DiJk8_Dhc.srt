1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
 But we will continue our theme of worship and let's continue to survey what the Bible

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,240
 has to say about worship.

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,780
 And I told you from the beginning to the end it's all about worship because God is going

4
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:18,920
 to dwell in the midst of us, dwell in the midst of the people and He want us to have

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,360
 fellowship with Him.

6
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:26,880
 So from the Garden of Eden to Tabernacle to today it is the Temple.

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:34,320
 And when the Israelites settled down in the land of Canaan in the Promised Land, they

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:41,820
 have King David had Jerusalem to be the capital of the small nation.

9
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:48,220
 And then God told Solomon to build the first temple.

10
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:54,040
 And there was so much details in the Bible from the book of First Kings and talking about

11
00:00:54,040 --> 00:01:00,440
 the details of the building of the temple and we're going to spend some more time in

12
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,280
 the first 11 chapters of First Kings.

13
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:09,000
 So we have the Bible turn to First Kings chapter 1 to 11.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 How about that?

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 Okay 1 to 11.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,560
 There were tons of things, details about the reign of Solomon from First Kings chapter

17
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,560
 1 to 11.

18
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,320
 Now let me ask you this question.

19
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,600
 Okay what does a good king need to rule a nation?

20
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,800
 If you are the king, alright, or queen, alright, if you need to rule the nation, rule over

21
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,640
 the people, what do you need?

22
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,120
 What do you need?

23
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:44,880
 The Bible is trying to present to us King Solomon and everything that he needs to rule

24
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,880
 the nations.

25
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,880
 Alright?

26
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:55,800
 So how about if you're a king, you need wisdom to rule the people, right?

27
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,000
 Get it?

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,480
 And you need wisdom to judge, you need wisdom to manage your country and that is what God

29
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,720
 has given to Solomon.

30
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,840
 Okay?

31
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,120
 So let's take a quick survey of how the Bible describes King Solomon and then finally he

32
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,120
 builds a temple.

33
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,560
 Alright, First Kings chapter 4, 30.

34
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:25,240
 His wisdom, God has given him, exceeded that of all the wise men of the east and the wise

35
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,640
 men of Egypt.

36
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,840
 His fame spread throughout all surrounding nations.

37
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:36,000
 Now if you understand, you know, kind of the Bible map, Israel is right at the center of

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 the ancient world.

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 Right?

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,080
 You've got Egypt, Babylon, Hittite, all the countries are surrounding Israel and Israel

41
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,720
 is right in the middle.

42
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:51,080
 And first verse 31 it says, the name or the fame of Solomon spread throughout all the

43
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,920
 surrounding nations.

44
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,720
 And he composed how many prophets and how many songs?

45
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,720
 3,001,005 songs.

46
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,720
 Right?

47
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,720
 So he's a songwriter.

48
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:13,040
 You know, Rachel told me, Taylor Swift composed all the songs for her new album, On the Row.

49
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,040
 Right?

50
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,040
 How crazy is that?

51
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,040
 Taylor Swift.

52
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,040
 Right?

53
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,040
 30 songs, like 30 songs.

54
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,640
 On the Row, when she was doing the ERA tour.

55
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,640
 That's crazy.

56
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,640
 Right?

57
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,880
 But Solomon composed 1,005 songs.

58
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,880
 Right?

59
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,640
 There was so much wisdom to this guy.

60
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:35,120
 Other than wisdom, what do you need to rule the nation?

61
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,520
 How about money?

62
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,520
 Right?

63
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,520
 And defense.

64
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,680
 Right?

65
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,800
 First King chapter 10, 26.

66
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,600
 Solomon built up a huge force of chariots and horses.

67
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,720
 He had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horses.

68
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:03,080
 And the king made silver as plentiful in Jerusalem as stone.

69
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:08,960
 Now if you have visited Jerusalem, you know stones are everywhere.

70
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:20,000
 Stone as pavement, stone hills, stone valley, because Jerusalem is in a mountainous area.

71
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,920
 But here Solomon made silver as plentiful in Jerusalem as stone.

72
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,920
 Right?

73
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:31,880
 You count how many stones, that's how much silver or gold he has.

74
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,920
 All right?

75
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,480
 And then military might.

76
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,480
 Right?

77
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,640
 12,000 horses.

78
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,040
 That means perfect number of horses.

79
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:44,920
 There's so much military defense Solomon has built up.

80
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,760
 And what else do you need to rule the nations?

81
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,520
 How about international relation?

82
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,520
 Right?

83
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,400
 Just like United States has a lot of different alliance around the world.

84
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,400
 Right?

85
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,640
 Solomon did have some alliance.

86
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,640
 11.3.

87
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:09,000
 He said Solomon has 700 wives of royal birth and 300 concubines.

88
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 How many of them?

89
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 1,000.

90
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 Right?

91
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 1,000 of them.

92
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 Right?

93
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 How many wives he had?

94
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 700 wives.

95
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,200
 Now we always come to some description like this.

96
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:26,880
 We always think, okay, it is about, you know, sexual desire.

97
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,880
 Right?

98
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,840
 Well, it's part of it.

99
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,440
 But the big part of it, why he has so many wives and queens?

100
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,480
 Because he is making diplomatic relationship with all the surrounding nations.

101
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,480
 Right?

102
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:47,200
 They send a daughter or queen to Solomon and marry to him.

103
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:51,720
 And that's how you build international relation in those days.

104
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,320
 However, it has a little note there.

105
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,560
 And these wives did turn his heart away from the Lord.

106
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,560
 Alright?

107
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,240
 So, you got wisdom, you got economic, military power, and then diplomacy.

108
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,360
 Right?

109
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:13,760
 And then in the Near East, all the kings, if they are good kings, they will build temple.

110
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,680
 They will build temples for their biggest God.

111
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,680
 Alright?

112
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,120
 So, that's what Solomon did.

113
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,280
 And God allowed him to do that.

114
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:27,000
 So, here 1st King chapter 6 verse 2.

115
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,120
 The temple that King Solomon built for the Lord was 60 cubits long.

116
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,680
 One cubit is about one and a half feet long.

117
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,080
 20 cubit wide and 30 cubit high.

118
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,520
 And it also said in verse 1, in what year?

119
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:50,000
 480 year after the Israelites had come out of Egypt.

120
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 So finally when Solomon built the temple, the Exodus is over.

121
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 Right?

122
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,360
 Remember the story of Exodus?

123
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,560
 The Israelites being saved by grace, by Yahweh, by God.

124
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,720
 And they crossed the Red Sea and came through the wilderness.

125
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,680
 And for so many years, finally they settled down in the Promised Land.

126
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,640
 And King David was made the king over all the 12 tribes.

127
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:19,080
 And he settled down in Jerusalem and make Jerusalem the capital.

128
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,720
 And his son Solomon finally built the temple.

129
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,440
 And here verse 1 of chapter 6.

130
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,800
 480 year after the Israelites had come out of Egypt.

131
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,800
 Finally they settled down in Jerusalem and Exodus is over.

132
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:44,720
 So as you can see, the Bible spends a lot of words to describe the reign of a king.

133
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,000
 And because the people in the Bible are in the king.

134
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,960
 The king represents them.

135
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,840
 The king, if it's a good king, then the people will be good.

136
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,840
 Right?

137
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:59,120
 If the king worship other gods, then all the people, because they are being represented

138
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:05,600
 and they are in the king, they will follow other gods as well.

139
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:16,160
 So after all these descriptions of Solomon, let us see how the Bible evaluate Solomon.

140
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,720
 And one of the places that we can go to is the book of Deuteronomy.

141
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,400
 The fifth book of the Bible.

142
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,320
 Because Deuteronomy is like a constitution for ancient Israel.

143
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:30,920
 And it lays out a lot of rules and regulations for the nation and for the king.

144
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:36,480
 And part of the passage here is, well by the way, this is the model of King Solomon's

145
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,160
 first temple.

146
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:46,560
 On the upper left is the city of David, which is on a small mountain ridge.

147
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,800
 And up there on top is the temple and the palace complex.

148
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,440
 That's the city of David.

149
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,640
 Zion, or Jerusalem.

150
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:03,080
 On the right is the model for first temple of Solomon.

151
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,640
 What is the shape of the temple?

152
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,320
 Rectangular, right?

153
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,000
 It's rectangular.

154
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,800
 And inside the rectangular, there's a square, right?

155
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,960
 Perfect square.

156
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,200
 That is the holy of holies.

157
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:22,160
 And on your lower left is the temple cross section, right?

158
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:27,200
 You see inside there's a square inside, the room inside.

159
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,520
 There's a couple of creatures guarding the holy of holies.

160
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,520
 Who are those guys?

161
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,520
 Cherubim, right?

162
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,520
 Cherubim.

163
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,920
 If you know nothing about the series, Cherubim is your guy.

164
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:48,000
 Anyways, we go to how the Torah, how the Bible evaluate a king.

165
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,440
 One of the passages, very important passage, is about kingship.

166
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,680
 Deuteronomy chapter 17.

167
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:02,680
 God told his people through Moses, he said, "You are about to enter the land the Lord

168
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,320
 your God is giving you.

169
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:10,640
 If this happens, which it did happen, be sure to select as king the man the Lord your God

170
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,640
 chooses."

171
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:20,960
 16, "The king must not build up a large stable of horses for himself.

172
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:26,320
 The king must not take many wives for himself because they will turn his heart away from

173
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,320
 the Lord.

174
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:34,200
 He must not accumulate large amounts of wealth in silver and gold for himself."

175
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,680
 That's interesting.

176
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,800
 That's the constitution of ancient Israel.

177
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:46,760
 It has so much to say about the king, right?

178
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:53,560
 When you elect a king, when he is going to rule, there are three dongs here, right?

179
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,600
 Can you see that?

180
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,760
 Do not build up your military might.

181
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,320
 Do not have many wives.

182
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,640
 It means international diplomacy.

183
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:11,400
 Do not accumulate a lot of gold and silver, right?

184
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:17,400
 That's what the king of Israel is set apart from other kings surrounding nations.

185
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,160
 Because he's going to depend on God, right?

186
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,440
 He's not going to have a lot of money accumulated for himself.

187
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:30,480
 Not a lot of military might for himself and diplomatic relationship for himself.

188
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,200
 Because he's going to trust God and God will protect him, right?

189
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,000
 God will protect his border.

190
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,640
 God will fight for his battle, right?

191
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,840
 Interesting if you compare this to King Solomon.

192
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:53,240
 King Solomon is doing contrary to the Torah.

193
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,880
 And what does the king have to do?

194
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:02,520
 It continues to say, "If the king sits on throne as king, the king must copy for himself

195
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:08,080
 this body of instruction, the Torah on the scroll in the presence of the priest.

196
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:14,200
 And he must always keep that copy with him and read it daily as long as he lives.

197
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:19,760
 That way he will learn to fear the Lord his God by obeying all the terms of the covenant.

198
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,920
 All the terms in the instructions and decrees, right?

199
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,960
 So that's so special about Israel's king.

200
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:31,520
 Is that he is not going to do what other pagan kings would do.

201
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,600
 He is going to trust in God and what does he have to do?

202
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,760
 He has to do Bible study.

203
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,320
 He has to study the word of God.

204
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,960
 He has to understand the will of God.

205
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:52,760
 He has to copy himself a scroll of Torah and he has to keep a copy for himself and read

206
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,320
 it daily as long as he lives.

207
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:05,080
 Because only by doing so, he is going to learn how to fear the Lord his God.

208
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:10,560
 And he continues to say, "This reading, regular reading, will prevent the king from

209
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:17,840
 being proud and acting as if he is above his brothers, his fellow citizens.

210
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:23,200
 It will also prevent him from turning away from these commands in the smallest way.

211
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:28,240
 It will ensure that he and his descendants will reign for many generations in Israel."

212
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,240
 Right?

213
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,000
 You know what the word of God will do in your life?

214
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:40,480
 If you read it continuously, obediently, trying to understand and listen to the voice of God

215
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:46,400
 and trying to understand the will of God and submit yourself in front of, before the word

216
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,760
 of God, the Bible will do something in your life.

217
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,760
 Right?

218
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,560
 It will make you less proud.

219
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,000
 It will make you humble.

220
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:02,760
 It will make you understand that your might and your resources are not from you.

221
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,240
 It's from God himself.

222
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:10,700
 It's from the God who has loved you, who has protected you.

223
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,400
 You read the word of God daily.

224
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,520
 You read the word of God continuously.

225
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,400
 It will have effect in your life.

226
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,400
 Right?

227
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:23,160
 That's why I want to encourage you to continue to read the word of God.

228
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,480
 So let's talk about the king of Israel.

229
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,840
 The top guy in the hierarchy.

230
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:36,760
 The Torah says you have to have the king make a copy and continuously obey the terms and

231
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:42,840
 obey the voice of God and to read it daily as long as he lives.

232
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,280
 And this will prevent him from being proud.

233
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:51,080
 It will make him humble and he will continue to fear God.

234
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,880
 And that is the blessing of Solomon.

235
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:01,480
 Solomon is being elected as the king of Israel and God gave him so much blessing, the wisdom,

236
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:05,960
 the power, the economic resources.

237
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,320
 That is the blessing he has.

238
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:14,640
 But as we continue to dig into the description in the Bible about Solomon, you find that

239
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:19,160
 this king's life is a tragedy.

240
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,260
 It's a tragedy.

241
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,400
 And what happened here?

242
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:31,560
 Now my first part of the sermon, I talk about the blessings that Solomon had.

243
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,560
 Right?

244
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:38,240
 And here is the second part, we're going to reflect on what is going on in his life.

245
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,120
 What went wrong?

246
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,200
 The tragedy in King Solomon.

247
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:50,560
 And let me remind you when we read the Bible, we read the Bible, we cannot know what the

248
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,480
 Bible means until we know how it means.

249
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:59,680
 That means you have to understand the design of the passages, design of the chapters.

250
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:06,120
 What different passages are being put together in such a way to communicate its meaning.

251
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:12,280
 So we have to understand how, you know, 1 Kings chapter 1 to 11, how it's being designed

252
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:19,320
 carefully in order to tell you what is going on in the life of King Solomon.

253
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:25,560
 Here let me show you the whole structure that is being suggested by some Bible students

254
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:33,400
 or Bible scholars, how the first 11 chapters talking about the reign of Solomon, the entire

255
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,720
 reign of Solomon is being captured in 11 chapters.

256
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:42,200
 First King chapter 1 to first King chapter 11.

257
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:47,880
 Now as you can see, this is a very common structure.

258
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,240
 We studied the Gospel of Mark, right?

259
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:55,380
 Remember in the Gospel of Mark, there were many sandwiches, right?

260
00:16:55,380 --> 00:17:02,840
 And the sandwiches, if you have a sandwich, the middle part is the content, right?

261
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,960
 It's the most important thing.

262
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:13,080
 And so often it goes with, like you talk about the Bible author, we talk about A, and then

263
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:18,780
 you talk about B, and then he'll come back to talk about A again, right?

264
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:22,920
 So it's A, B, A, a very simple sandwich structure.

265
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:27,820
 Here in first King chapter 1 to 11, it's a huge sandwich.

266
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:30,300
 It's a multi-layer sandwich.

267
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:35,520
 As you can see from chapter 1 to chapter 2, there was a prophet, Nathan.

268
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,940
 He intervenes with the succession of kingship.

269
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:43,780
 So in chapter 1 of first King, King David was going to die, right?

270
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:48,620
 He was totally disabled, dysfunctional to rule his nation.

271
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:53,840
 And then they were talking about who's going to succeed him on the throne.

272
00:17:53,840 --> 00:18:02,760
 That is A. And then B, Solomon's being elected, being anointed to be the king after David.

273
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:10,600
 And Yahweh, God eliminates all the threats to make sure Solomon's kingdom is secure.

274
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:17,640
 That's B. And then C is the early promise of God to Solomon.

275
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,220
 Giving him wisdom, giving him promises.

276
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:28,960
 And then part D, chapter 3, verse 16 to 4, 34.

277
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,820
 And you see Solomon receiving the blessing from God.

278
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:39,140
 He uses his gift for the people and judge them fairly in justice.

279
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:43,500
 And then part E is preparation for building the temple.

280
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,140
 Chapter 5, right?

281
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:48,140
 5, 1 to 18.

282
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:51,060
 And then F, he builds the temple.

283
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,060
 Chapter 6.

284
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:56,580
 And all those details and architectural details talking about the first temple, right?

285
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:01,220
 How long it is, how wide it is, how high it is, and all the gold and silver and all that

286
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,220
 stuff.

287
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:05,740
 And then you come to the middle part of the sandwich.

288
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:11,740
 Part G is that Solomon builds his palaces.

289
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:14,280
 His palace complex.

290
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:21,340
 We can call it rifle buildings because the palace is bigger than the temple.

291
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:27,980
 And then the biblical author, after talking about Solomon building rifle buildings, he

292
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:30,700
 comes back to talk about the temple, right?

293
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,460
 Do you see that?

294
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:41,940
 And then he talks about dedicating the temple, which is a pair with part E, E prime and E.

295
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:51,220
 And then D prime, D with apostrophe, Solomon uses his gift for himself now, right?

296
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:57,500
 And then part C, C prime, is his failure.

297
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:06,500
 And then lastly, B and A, talking about Yahweh, is going to raise up enemies to threaten his

298
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,500
 security.

299
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:15,740
 While at the beginning, God gives him peace, if he turns away from God, God is going to

300
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,820
 raise up enemies and troubles for him.

301
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:27,300
 And then finally, in chapter 11, another prophet comes in and determines who's going to succeed

302
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,740
 King Solomon.

303
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,700
 And the kingdom split into north and south.

304
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:36,820
 So as you can see, the Bible is trying to design in such a way to tell you what is going

305
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:37,820
 on here.

306
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:41,460
 And it has to do with the theme of worship.

307
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:52,140
 First you notice chapter 6, chapter 6, part F here, it details how Solomon built the temple.

308
00:20:52,140 --> 00:21:04,000
 Now logically, the story should go on to 713, because it talks about how he builds the temple,

309
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,260
 and then should continue to finish the account of building the temple.

310
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:14,980
 However, the author interrupts the flow of the story, and he's trying to tell you Solomon

311
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:18,500
 built his own palace, the rival buildings.

312
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:24,300
 Now let's take a look at the turning point of the entire story, which is part G right

313
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:29,060
 there, which is the end of chapter 6 and the beginning of chapter 7.

314
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,980
 Do you find it fun?

315
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:34,180
 I find it fun reading the Bible, right?

316
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:36,860
 It's not just giving you a straightforward account.

317
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:40,660
 It gives you spiritual meaning.

318
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:45,060
 When he talks about the story of Solomon, it's not just giving you, okay, it's not giving

319
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,580
 you a Wikipedia.

320
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:51,540
 It's giving you a theological meaning that you can think about.

321
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:56,900
 It's like a warning, or it's like a spiritual reminder to all of us.

322
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,060
 What does it mean when we worship God?

323
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:06,660
 Just like King Solomon, he was supposed to worship God by building the temple, but at

324
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:11,780
 some turning point, he changes.

325
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:12,780
 He changes.

326
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:16,460
 Now let's look at the turning point, which is the end of chapter 6 and the beginning

327
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,180
 of chapter 7.

328
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:22,020
 Well, by the way, this is this translation, all right?

329
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:29,140
 So as you can see, the turning point is Solomon is building his own palace complex for himself.

330
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:32,220
 Now here's the turning point.

331
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,940
 Pay attention.

332
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:36,100
 Chapter 6, 37.

333
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:42,420
 The foundation of the Lord's temple was laid in mid-spring in the month of Seth.

334
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:49,900
 During the fourth year of Solomon's reign, 38, the entire building was completed in every

335
00:22:49,900 --> 00:23:00,180
 detail by mid-autumn in the month of Bul, during the 11th year of his reign.

336
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:05,420
 So it took seven years for Solomon to build a temple for God.

337
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,100
 Chapter 7, verse 1.

338
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:11,380
 But Solomon also built a palace for himself.

339
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:15,180
 And it took him how long to build?

340
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:20,580
 It took him 13 years to complete the construction of his own palace.

341
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,580
 Right?

342
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:25,620
 Do you see what's going on here?

343
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:31,540
 He used seven years to build the temple for Yahweh, for God.

344
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:39,180
 And then now he built his own palace for his own, how many years did it take him to build?

345
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:42,260
 13 years, right?

346
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,860
 Almost twice as long.

347
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,540
 Almost twice as long.

348
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:50,540
 And here, the translation here, I want to emphasize one thing.

349
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:53,620
 Is that for himself, did you see that?

350
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,100
 For his own.

351
00:23:55,100 --> 00:24:02,220
 For his own enjoyment and for his own kingdom.

352
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,100
 His own security.

353
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:10,900
 So the palaces of Solomon is being built actually bigger than the temple.

354
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:17,540
 If you check the rest of chapter 7, it talks about five different palace buildings Solomon

355
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:20,220
 had built for himself.

356
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,940
 And they have different names.

357
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:29,060
 And you check the dimensions, the blueprint is actually bigger, much bigger than the temple

358
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,980
 of God.

359
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:35,500
 I think the message is pretty clear.

360
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:39,340
 That this is a matter of priority.

361
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:44,300
 When Solomon built a temple worshiping God, right?

362
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,500
 He was doing okay.

363
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:54,780
 But in the midst of it, all of a sudden, there was a turning point in his priority.

364
00:24:54,780 --> 00:25:01,220
 He put his own kingdom above God's kingdom.

365
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:09,460
 He puts the people's worship for him more important than the people's worship for God.

366
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,460
 Right?

367
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:13,260
 I think the lesson is clear.

368
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:19,860
 In the midst of worshiping God, building the temple, Solomon somehow shifted his focus

369
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:22,820
 from God to himself.

370
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:27,100
 There's competition of priority in our life, right?

371
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:31,500
 There's always competition of priority in our life.

372
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,500
 Always.

373
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,020
 In all life stages, right?

374
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:41,940
 When I was younger, when I was in my mid-20s, late-20s, I was building up my own career.

375
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:42,940
 Right?

376
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:46,780
 I mean, you can treat ministry as a career, right?

377
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:49,180
 Because I want to stand firm, right?

378
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:52,340
 I want to establish my ministry.

379
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:55,740
 And there's always competition of priority, right?

380
00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:03,140
 Sometimes I would devote too much energy in my own career, in my own ministry, more so

381
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:05,700
 than my personal relationship with God.

382
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,700
 Right?

383
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:11,980
 Now, at times, you know, I forgot to read the Bible.

384
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:15,260
 I forgot to meditate on the Word of God.

385
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:19,660
 I forgot to cultivate my relationship with God.

386
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:25,380
 And then, after I got married, you know, there were competition of priority, right?

387
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:29,500
 Because my wife would be the competition of my priority, right?

388
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,940
 She wants me to take care of her, right?

389
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:35,380
 And there's so many things to build up the family, right?

390
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:38,740
 And then, not to mention, when the kids come, right?

391
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:44,460
 Oh boy, they are the competitors of priority in my life, right?

392
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:49,600
 I have to take care of them almost 24/7, right?

393
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:54,580
 And there's always priority that is messing us up.

394
00:26:54,580 --> 00:27:02,060
 And I think there was a Reformation theologian about 500 years ago.

395
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:04,020
 His name is John Calvin.

396
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:10,460
 I think John Calvin said something in his big treaty on systematic theology.

397
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:18,500
 He says, "Humans, we are all manufacturers of idols."

398
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:22,340
 We manufacture idols, you know?

399
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:27,900
 When the Bible talks about idol, Baal, you know, Azshara, all those false gods, right?

400
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:31,140
 We always think that someone invented them, right?

401
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:37,540
 Someone put them in front of the people to deceive them and to distract them.

402
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:43,880
 But John Calvin says, "We are manufacturers of idols."

403
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:50,020
 If there's nothing that would distract us from the worship of God, we will invent something.

404
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,860
 We'll manufacture something.

405
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:58,220
 We'll make up something that will compete the priority of God, the place of God in our

406
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,060
 life, right?

407
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,420
 That's what idol means.

408
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:11,780
 Idol means someone or something that competes the first place of God in our life.

409
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:21,820
 And here, I think we should really think about what it is that is messing up our life.

410
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,500
 Our priority.

411
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,740
 And what is your priority?

412
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:34,300
 Do we really believe in God and believe that God is the best and God is worthy of my everything

413
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:37,140
 because God loves me so much?

414
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:41,260
 Because God blesses me abundantly, right?

415
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:44,660
 God provides for me.

416
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:47,780
 But do we really believe that God is good?

417
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:53,020
 Or we manufacture other idols that will satisfy our own needs?

418
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:59,380
 And perhaps if we ask the question, we really don't believe that God will provide.

419
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:05,820
 We always use our time of worship for idols, right?

420
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:10,740
 We always use our time to do something else because we really don't believe in the bottom

421
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,780
 of our heart.

422
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:20,940
 We don't believe that God is really helping me and providing for me so that I can put

423
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:26,300
 my focus on Him, right?

424
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:31,260
 Do we really believe that God is the one?

425
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,860
 God is the true God.

426
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,780
 And He is the true God.

427
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:37,980
 And He loves me so much and He provides for me.

428
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:42,860
 And that means He is worthy of my entire being.

429
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:46,500
 My worship.

430
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,660
 That's what happened to King Solomon.

431
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:57,660
 The turning point of his life is not simply just, he just, all of a sudden he wakes up

432
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:02,100
 a morning, one morning and he said, "Okay, I'm going to sin against God."

433
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,100
 No.

434
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:08,060
 He was building the temple, but at the same time there was a matter of priority messed

435
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:14,780
 up and he started to build his own palaces, build his own sense of security.

436
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:19,300
 It's the matter of my priority.

437
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:25,260
 Whether God takes the priority or my own things.

438
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:28,500
 Whether those things are good or not.

439
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:37,060
 Now talking about idol, now idols are not necessarily evil in their appearance.

440
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:43,300
 They can be good things in our life that will compete our priority for God.

441
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:52,420
 So as we end this message, I would like us to really reflect and think about what is

442
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,700
 your priority?

443
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,380
 Seriously, right?

444
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:59,780
 It's not what you say, it's how you live.

445
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:00,780
 Right?

446
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:07,260
 Because your behavior, your action, speak louder than your words.

447
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,260
 Right?

448
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:12,980
 We can sing songs and praise God and say that God is the true God and then go and praise

449
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,740
 Him and worship Him.

450
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:20,660
 However, we have to check our own actions because our actions always speak louder than

451
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,660
 our words.

452
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:26,540
 Priority, it's God's priority or your own kingdom.

453
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:35,540
 Now it can be a good thing if you're going to school, if you're building up your career.

454
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:39,340
 These are good things.

455
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:47,220
 You want to make enough income to accumulate wealth and your property to make sure that

456
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,420
 you're secure.

457
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,340
 Those are good things.

458
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:53,540
 You can be raising your own family.

459
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:56,420
 Those are really good things, beautiful things.

460
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,420
 It can be a hobby.

461
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,420
 Right?

462
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:04,940
 It can be a hobby, it can be anything in your life and don't get it wrong, those things

463
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:10,820
 are beautiful and good things and we are being called to manage the resources God has provided

464
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:11,820
 for us.

465
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:24,220
 However, if we are not careful, the idols will take over and will compete our priority.

466
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:32,860
 And all the blessings that God has given you and me will turn into tragedy.

467
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:35,380
 That's what happened to King Solomon.

468
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:38,460
 What a lesson to learn in terms of worship.

469
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,460
 Right?

470
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:42,900
 We're supposed to worship God, put God as number one.

471
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:50,500
 However, in the midst of it, he builds his own idols and palace complex for himself.

472
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:58,820
 Now as we end, let's continue to just bow before God.

473
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:03,940
 To understand, you know, God is the Lord of our lives.

474
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:04,940
 Right?

475
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:13,140
 There's one famous saying that says, "If Christ is not the Lord of all, he is not the

476
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:16,540
 Lord at all."

477
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:23,740
 In what part of your life is not giving up to God and God is not taking charge?

478
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:24,740
 Right?

479
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:28,940
 Let's entrust our lives into our loving God.

480
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:29,940
 Right?

481
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:32,940
 Let's all pray.

482
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:43,140
 Father, as we reflect, there are so many idols in our life that will distract us from following

483
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:47,500
 you, from worshiping you.

484
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:57,140
 It may be our career, it may be our future, it may be even our family.

485
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:08,820
 We try to accumulate wealth and goods and gold and silver so that we can feel secure.

486
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:15,480
 But in the midst of it, we forgot that you are our security.

487
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,900
 You deserve our full attention.

488
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:27,580
 So Father, I pray that you will forgive us and cleanse us because we are all sinners,

489
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,580
 we are all broken.

490
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:39,420
 We are all manufacturers of idols and those idols will compete our priority for you.

491
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:45,820
 So as we end this worship, let's pray that in this simple way, they will come before

492
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:46,820
 you.

493
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:55,980
 We recognize you are Lordship, recognize you are the King over all of us, all aspects

494
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:56,980
 in our lives.

495
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:05,340
 And Father, we come before you to entrust our own life, our whole life into your hand.

496
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:13,460
 And thank you for your Son, Jesus Christ, who died on the cross so that we can have

497
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,460
 new life.

498
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:20,540
 We can have eternal life, that you can dwell in our life.

499
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:23,860
 And you deserve our worship.

500
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:36,020
 I pray that you will humble all of us so we can give the worship of worth to your name.

501
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:40,980
 And how we live and how we work and how we manage our life will tell other people that

502
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:41,980
 God, you are great.

503
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:45,420
 God, you are the Lord.

504
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:51,340
 So may you continue to just cultivate our relationship with you, knowing that you are

505
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:55,340
 not our idol, but you are the Lord of our lives.

506
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:58,540
 You are the Lord of all.

507
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:07,180
 If there's anything that we struggle of letting go, to have you take control, ask that your

508
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:13,180
 Spirit will humble us, knowing that we owe everything to you.

509
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:20,180
 And thank you for being our loving God, God of blessing, God of provision.

510
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:27,500
 Continue to help us to increase our faith in you, to follow you, to worship you fully.

511
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:30,500
 In Christ's name we pray.

512
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:38,260
 God bless you and I hope that this message will remind you and to help you reflect on

513
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:40,540
 your relationship with God.

514
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:46,460
 For the rest of the week, God be with you and you go to your work and bear witness for

515
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,780
 the great name of God.

516
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:51,100
 And then come back next Sunday, we're going to serve God together.

517
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:54,300
 Remember next Sunday is the MSI outing, right?

518
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:57,260
 So we're going to begin at 10 o'clock.

519
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:00,180
 And there's a combined service and then we'll go to MSI and have some fun.

520
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,180
 Alright?

521
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:01,700
 God bless.
