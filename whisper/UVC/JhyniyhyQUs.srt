1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,680
 Thank you, James, and thank you, Jason, as well, for leading us in worship.

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:12,180
 I'm excited to be here and grateful to be here with you all, and always really enjoy

3
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:16,840
 being at UV, so glad that I get to be with you today.

4
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:23,300
 And as Jason was reminding us, we are headed into the holidays, and the first kind of American

5
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,400
 holiday we have this time of year is Thanksgiving, which is a great holiday.

6
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,720
 My daughter and I, as we were driving here, we were talking about the things we enjoy

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,720
 about Thanksgiving.

8
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:38,600
 And there's lots of obvious things, like the food, and spending time with family, those

9
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,900
 things are great.

10
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:46,720
 But it really is a good time for us to think about being grateful, and practicing giving

11
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,600
 thanks and practicing gratitude.

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,320
 So that's what we're going to talk about today.

13
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:56,240
 I thought since we're headed towards this time anyway, we should talk a little bit about

14
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:02,760
 what it means to be grateful and to cultivate gratitude in our hearts.

15
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,360
 And gratitude is really an important thing for us.

16
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,640
 It's a God-honoring value that Scripture commands in a lot of different places.

17
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,520
 The Scripture tells us to practice gratitude.

18
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,840
 First Thessalonians 5.18 says it real plainly, real clearly.

19
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,860
 It says, "Give thanks in all circumstances, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus

20
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:23,860
 for you."

21
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:26,500
 Can't get much more clear than that.

22
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,560
 Give thanks for everything in all circumstances.

23
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,200
 But even if that wasn't enough, just the command of Scripture, we know that practicing gratitude

24
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,440
 has a lot of obvious benefits in our lives.

25
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:44,560
 There's a lot of scientific studies have been done to show the benefits of gratitude.

26
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:51,320
 It improves our physical health, our psychological health, it strengthens our relationships,

27
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:56,960
 it helps us to be more resilient as people, it gives us a better view of ourselves, and

28
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,200
 it even helps us to sleep better.

29
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:05,280
 So there's all these reasons that we should be learning to be more grateful people.

30
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,600
 And yet, it's not necessarily something that is easy for us.

31
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,720
 A lot of us struggle to practice gratitude.

32
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,720
 I know I do.

33
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,240
 It's not something that we just naturally do.

34
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,120
 And I think the reason for that goes back to who we are as human beings.

35
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:26,120
 The fact that we're fallen, we're broken, we're flawed, and we live in this broken world.

36
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,760
 And so there are things in our world that disappoint us.

37
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,080
 And we disappoint ourselves.

38
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,840
 And things in life don't go how we want them to go.

39
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,540
 And because we're broken and flawed human beings, we're inherently selfish.

40
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:46,360
 We kind of know how we want life to go, and we want it to be focused on us and good for

41
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,520
 us.

42
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:53,640
 And when that doesn't happen, we are frustrated, or we're disappointed, or we're hurt, or we're

43
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,840
 confused, and it's hard for us to be grateful.

44
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,800
 That's one of the reasons that gratitude just doesn't naturally come out of us most of the

45
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,020
 time.

46
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:06,320
 And some people may, their personality, their gifting, maybe they're just more grateful

47
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,320
 than others.

48
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,180
 So if you're one of those people, that's beautiful, and that's fantastic.

49
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:15,640
 But for others, you may say, "Well, it's not easy for me, and I don't find myself being

50
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,840
 grateful very much.

51
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,040
 I don't even find myself saying thank you or things like that."

52
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,120
 I think for all of us, we can learn to be more grateful.

53
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,880
 Even if you're already a grateful person, there are more ways you could practice gratitude.

54
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:33,760
 But if you're someone who struggles with that, then certainly you could grow in that.

55
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,440
 And the point is that because it's not natural to us, we have to cultivate it.

56
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,120
 That's why we're talking about it today and saying cultivating gratitude, because it's

57
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,020
 not something that's just going to naturally spring up in our life.

58
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,360
 We have to cultivate it, just like you cultivate plants.

59
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,560
 You have to plant the seeds, you have to water and care for the plant and protect it from

60
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,980
 things that would damage it so that it will grow and bring fruit.

61
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,440
 And that's how gratitude is.

62
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,960
 We have to plant the seeds, we have to frequently water the plant and allow it to grow in our

63
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:11,160
 life and bring fruit of thanksgiving and gratefulness in our life.

64
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,800
 So we're going to look today at Psalm 100.

65
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:19,040
 It gives us a really beautiful template for thinking about gratitude.

66
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,840
 If you'd like to look at Psalm 100 in your Bible or your phone app, we're going to read

67
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,360
 through the entire Psalm, but don't be scared, it's only five verses.

68
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,640
 Some Psalms, if we were going to read through the whole thing, I would just read the Psalm

69
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,160
 and then we'd go home.

70
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,160
 But this one's short, so we can take it.

71
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:42,440
 This is Psalm 100, it says, "Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth.

72
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,500
 Serve the Lord with gladness.

73
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:49,820
 Come into his presence with singing, 'Know that the Lord, he is God.

74
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:53,200
 It is he who made us and we are his.

75
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,320
 We are his people and the sheep of his pasture.

76
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,040
 Enter his gates with thanksgiving and his courts with praise.

77
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,040
 Give thanks to him, bless his name.

78
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:10,800
 For the Lord is good, his steadfast love endures forever and his faithfulness to all generations."

79
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:19,800
 Now, hopefully, just reading that Psalm encourages us a little bit and fills us with a little

80
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,760
 bit of gratitude.

81
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:28,640
 But this Psalm has some really practical clues in it that help us think about how to cultivate

82
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:34,480
 gratitude in our own lives, how to grow gratitude in our lives.

83
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:40,280
 The first thing I want us to see is that we cultivate gratitude as we praise God for the

84
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,280
 wonders of his creation.

85
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:47,240
 We cultivate gratitude in our lives as we praise God for the wonders of his creation.

86
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,720
 You can see this in verse one.

87
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:58,000
 It talks about how the whole earth is making a joyful noise to the Lord.

88
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:06,160
 God's power and creativity, his wisdom, his care, his beauty, those things are displayed

89
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,400
 in nature and in the things that he has made.

90
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,880
 Verse three reminds us that he's the one who made us.

91
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,840
 He's the one who made our world.

92
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:22,440
 So that reminds us that we should experience some gratitude as we look at this amazing

93
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:27,600
 world that God has made and as we look at our own lives and the amazing things that

94
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,280
 God has done in our lives.

95
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:37,120
 Verse five reminds us of God's goodness displayed in his love for his people and throughout

96
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,120
 the generations of human history.

97
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,680
 And those are important things to think about.

98
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,520
 If we're having trouble being grateful, we say, "I really struggle with gratitude because

99
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,440
 I feel disappointed or I feel hurt or I feel confused about things in the world."

100
00:06:54,440 --> 00:07:01,040
 A great place to start is looking at the wonders of the world that God has made.

101
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:06,000
 Psalm 19 says that the heavens declare the glory of God and the sky above proclaims his

102
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,560
 handiwork day to day, pours out speech, and night to night reveals knowledge.

103
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,280
 There's no speech nor are there words whose voice is not heard.

104
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,400
 It's the first three verses of Psalm 19.

105
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,760
 And that passage reminds us that no matter where you are on the earth, no matter what

106
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:30,000
 your language or cultural background is, you can look at God's creation and experience

107
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:39,280
 the wonder of it and you can also understand that God is big and powerful and good and

108
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:45,360
 full of beauty and full of wisdom just by looking at God's creation.

109
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,880
 And that's a healthy thing for us to do.

110
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:54,160
 Honestly, I believe that if we can't acknowledge the goodness of God in creation, then we're

111
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,800
 really practicing ingratitude.

112
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,680
 We're really being ungrateful.

113
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:06,020
 If you think about someone giving a special and unique and valuable gift to someone else,

114
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:14,480
 if someone receives that gift and feels no gratefulness for it whatsoever, then they're

115
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,680
 practicing ingratitude, right?

116
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:23,160
 And God in the world that he has made has given us this amazing gift of beauty and of

117
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,520
 wonder and we need to acknowledge it.

118
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,200
 We need to acknowledge him.

119
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:38,160
 Romans 1 talks about this when it talks about how God has made plain himself in nature.

120
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:43,320
 Verse 21 in Romans chapter 1 says this, "For although they knew God, they did not honor

121
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,040
 him as God or give thanks to him."

122
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,160
 It's talking about people who looked at what God had made, they could see the reality of

123
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:58,280
 God through what he had made, but they chose not to acknowledge him or give thanks.

124
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,600
 And that's ungratefulness.

125
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,440
 And that's obviously not where we want to be.

126
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,400
 That's not what we want to live out and practice.

127
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,960
 We have to guard our hearts against this.

128
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,000
 And one of the ways that we guard our hearts against that is just by making sure that we're

129
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,800
 aware of how amazing God's world is and how beautiful it is and all the things that God

130
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,800
 has made.

131
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:25,840
 So there's different ways we can do this, obviously, but I kind of put it into categories

132
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,800
 as I was thinking about it.

133
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,880
 These are different ways that I see some of the wonder of God's creation.

134
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,720
 First of all, we see the aesthetic beauty of God's creation, right?

135
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,720
 And most of us are probably very familiar with that.

136
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,240
 That's when we look at something and we say, "That is beautiful."

137
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,000
 Maybe it's a sunset.

138
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,680
 Maybe it is where you go to the lakefront and we're looking out at the water.

139
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:53,200
 Maybe you get out of the city and spend some time in the mountains or you're in the forest

140
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,320
 and you just say, "Wow, this is beautiful."

141
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:02,500
 And when you experience that, the aesthetic beauty of what God has made, you should feel

142
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:06,220
 a sense of gratitude and say, "I'm grateful to God.

143
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,400
 Look at what he has done.

144
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:14,160
 This is just amazing and beautiful and totally gratuitous."

145
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,680
 That's one of the things I love about nature.

146
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,360
 God didn't have to make it that beautiful.

147
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,040
 God didn't have to make it that...

148
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,200
 I mean, it just does things to our heart and soul when we connect with it, when we see

149
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,920
 it, when we experience it.

150
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,920
 God didn't have to do that.

151
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,760
 He didn't have to use as many colors as he did.

152
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:37,280
 And yet he did that to display himself and to display his creativity and his wisdom and

153
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,800
 his power and his love for us.

154
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,820
 And so our heart should see that and respond and say, "God, I praise you.

155
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,460
 This is amazing.

156
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:52,060
 What a beautiful sight that I'm seeing or what a beautiful day it is."

157
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,060
 And Jason's right.

158
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:56,320
 We get a lot of winter in Chicago.

159
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,960
 But even that has its own beauty, right?

160
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,960
 Today is a nice day.

161
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,520
 It's cool and crisp out there, but it's still beautiful.

162
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,880
 The snowy days are beautiful in their own way.

163
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,760
 Then it gets kind of dirty after that.

164
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:14,920
 But we can enjoy God's beauty through nature.

165
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:19,520
 Even just looking out our window into the yard, we can enjoy that.

166
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:27,560
 The other way that I really try to reflect on God's goodness in creation is kind of maybe

167
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:33,000
 more from a scientific perspective, the scientific beauty that we see in creation.

168
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,440
 What I mean by that is if you start to think about the intricacy and the complexity of

169
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:45,200
 the world that God has made, if you learn a lot about the biology of our own bodies,

170
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,160
 you start to say, "Wow, this is really an amazingly intricate and complex thing that

171
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,280
 God has done in us."

172
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:59,360
 Or if you learn a lot about the universe and the cosmology of the universe kind of on a

173
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,200
 macro scale, it's amazing.

174
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,200
 It's mind-blowing.

175
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:10,040
 It's more than we can wrap our heads around, the power of God that's displayed in that.

176
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,920
 And those things, again, should cause us to say, "Wow, I'm grateful to God.

177
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:19,360
 I praise God because you didn't have to do this.

178
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,440
 You didn't have to show off like this.

179
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:27,640
 You didn't have to make it this great, and yet you did.

180
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,040
 And it's worthy of our praise.

181
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,960
 Our gratitude belongs to the Lord."

182
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:40,320
 Then the other category that's really big for me is we can really be in awe of the human

183
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,720
 beauty of creation.

184
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,120
 And I think that's significant.

185
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:51,280
 And I don't just mean human physical beauty, although God created that too.

186
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:59,080
 But I mean all the things that it means to be a human being that God made about us that

187
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,040
 we get to experience.

188
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:07,600
 The fact that we get to have friendships, we get to enjoy laughing together over something

189
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:16,120
 that's funny, we get to taste food together and enjoy that experience, we get to listen

190
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:25,040
 to music, and we get to have love and relationships where we can't really, as human beings, we

191
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:33,040
 can't really describe, even from kind of a scientific perspective, we can't really describe

192
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:40,400
 why love is such a big deal to us, why we feel the way we do about a family member or

193
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,400
 a close friend.

194
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,360
 Again, God didn't have to put that much beauty into us.

195
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,680
 He didn't have to give us those things, but he did.

196
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:58,920
 He gave us these friendships that we can't even really fully express and relationships

197
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:07,280
 with people that love us and that we love in ways that we were not even able to describe.

198
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,680
 God made something really beautiful when he made humans, and the Bible's clear about that.

199
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:18,800
 When God makes everything in the book of Genesis, humans, us, that was the masterpiece.

200
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,440
 It was the last thing and the best thing that God made.

201
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,880
 And we should be grateful for that.

202
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:31,680
 As we look around and we see people and we see the way that they love one another, we

203
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:37,280
 see the beautiful things that happen through relationships in our lives, we see the things

204
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,280
 that other people create and that other people do.

205
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:48,640
 We can be grateful to God for that wonder of his creation, the human element.

206
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:53,280
 It's something that we can be in awe of and we should be.

207
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:58,320
 The reality is, as we look at the wonder of what God has created, we start to sense our

208
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,400
 own smallness and it fills us with gratitude.

209
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,400
 Hopefully we've all experienced that on some level.

210
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:10,640
 If we haven't, then we're not looking, we're spending too much time looking at the sidewalk

211
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,240
 or something like that.

212
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:18,080
 But all of us should be looking at the world God has made and saying, "Wow, I'm grateful

213
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:23,160
 to see this and it gives me a sense of how small I am and my place in God's world and

214
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,080
 I'm grateful that I get to be here."

215
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:29,080
 That doesn't mean that there's not challenging things there are, and that doesn't mean there's

216
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:34,120
 not things that we see that are hurtful.

217
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:39,000
 There certainly are, but there are also things that we can see, even in difficult times in

218
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,680
 life that cause us to be grateful, that cause us to be grateful that we get to be in God's

219
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,680
 world.

220
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:52,600
 I remember one time when I was in college, I went to college in Hawaii and I was snorkeling

221
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,840
 on the big island of Hawaii, this place called Kealakakua Bay.

222
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:02,760
 I was pretty far out, it was a beautiful reef, probably about 20 feet deep, the water.

223
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,720
 And then the drop off was over there where it just dropped off, it got down to maybe

224
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,160
 30, 40 and then just dropped off into the dark blue water.

225
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,120
 If you've ever snorkeled in a place like that above the reef, the drop off is just really

226
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,380
 dark and you just can't see what's down there.

227
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:20,560
 So I was having a great time looking at all the fish and the reef and it was colorful

228
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,520
 and amazing.

229
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:27,520
 And I looked over to my left, I was kind of going this way, the beach was over here, drop

230
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,520
 off's over here.

231
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:34,920
 I look over, I see something moving over by the drop off, it's kind of silver.

232
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:41,560
 So I stop and observe for a minute and it's this big, it's coming up towards the reef

233
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,840
 so I can see it better and better as it's coming toward me.

234
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:52,200
 It's this big tiger shark, probably 18 to 20 feet long, huge shark.

235
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,960
 And the weirdest thing was what I remember feeling so distinctly in that moment.

236
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:00,440
 I had my fins on and I felt like, you know, when you have fins on you feel like you can

237
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,560
 move pretty good in the water.

238
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:08,400
 And I was just watching this thing cruising up and it didn't even look like it was moving

239
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,440
 its tail hardly and it was still moving like five times faster than me.

240
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:20,160
 And it wasn't even trying, it looked like it was drifting and it was moving so fast.

241
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:27,120
 And I just had this overwhelming feeling of being so vulnerable and out of my element

242
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:33,000
 because I felt how slow and incapable I was of going anywhere and I could see this giant

243
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,680
 shark like, it was easy for him to cruise through that water.

244
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:41,760
 And obviously I went into the beach and got out of the water.

245
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:47,680
 But it was one of those moments where I really felt my own smallness.

246
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:53,840
 And when we look at God's creation enough, we'll start to feel that and say, "Wow, I

247
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,800
 can feel my own smallness and it makes me so grateful that I get to be a part of this

248
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:05,720
 world that God has made and I get to experience it and I'm grateful for what he's done."

249
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:13,520
 Next thing we see here in Psalm 100 is the gratitude that we can have for God and the

250
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,620
 beauty of redemption.

251
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:22,040
 We cultivate gratitude as we praise God for the beauty of his redemption.

252
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:29,240
 In verses three, four, and five of this Psalm, we're reminded that God is good and loving.

253
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:34,000
 It tells us in verse three that he's the one who made us, we belong to him, we're his,

254
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,640
 we're his people, we're the sheep of his pasture.

255
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,800
 In verse five tells us that the Lord is good, his steadfast love endures forever, his faithfulness

256
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,960
 to all generations.

257
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,760
 God is full of care for his people.

258
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,400
 He's full of love and grace and mercy.

259
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:58,840
 God has done something in redeeming us that we, is beyond our capacity to describe and

260
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:06,160
 honestly beyond our capacity to really comprehend or even fully understand what we have received

261
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,920
 from God.

262
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:15,440
 But if we will begin to think about it and consider it and reflect on it, our hearts

263
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,580
 will begin to be full of gratefulness.

264
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:26,020
 Think about some of the things that it means for you, you personally, to be redeemed by

265
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,180
 Christ.

266
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:32,680
 God has forgiven your sin.

267
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:41,960
 He's covered your mistakes, those things in your past that you wish you could erase.

268
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,180
 God has covered those things.

269
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:47,760
 You may still have to deal with some of the consequences of them, but you have no guilt

270
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,480
 or shame from them.

271
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,160
 God has erased them.

272
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,760
 Ephesians one, verses seven and eight says this, "In him we have redemption through his

273
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:01,560
 blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses according to the riches of his grace, which he lavished

274
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,200
 upon us in all wisdom and insight."

275
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:09,040
 That's your story if you have a relationship with Jesus.

276
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:19,600
 All those things are forgiven through his grace and he has lavished his love on you.

277
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,360
 God has healed our hurts and scars.

278
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:26,600
 We know that because we live in this broken world, all of us are harmed by different things.

279
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,600
 We have traumas.

280
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,720
 We have all of these scars in our life.

281
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:36,760
 Through Christ, God can and does heal those things.

282
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:43,480
 God is at work helping us to be made whole, to restore us, to reconcile us to other people,

283
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,800
 to bring us back to health in our relationships.

284
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:51,160
 That's a beautiful thing that we can be grateful for.

285
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,240
 God's rescued us from sin and death.

286
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,120
 We don't have to be afraid of death.

287
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,360
 We don't have to be afraid of sin.

288
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,480
 Jesus defeated those things.

289
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,120
 God's promised us a beautiful future.

290
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:12,960
 First Peter one says this, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ according

291
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,600
 to his great mercy.

292
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:20,000
 He has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ

293
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,560
 from the dead to an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for

294
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,560
 you."

295
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:30,000
 That's your story through redemption.

296
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:37,880
 You have a living hope that cannot be touched by anything in this world.

297
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,320
 It will not be destroyed or diminished in any way.

298
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,840
 It's kept in heaven for you.

299
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,840
 That's your story because of redemption.

300
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,040
 God's given us a new start in life.

301
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:56,400
 That's one of my favorite parts of the gospel that we can be made into a new creation in

302
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,160
 Christ.

303
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:03,280
 We know that 2 Corinthians 5:17 talks about that, "Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he's

304
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,280
 a new creation.

305
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:08,560
 The old has passed away, behold the new has come."

306
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,720
 That's something to be grateful for.

307
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,800
 That's something to praise God for, something to give thanks for.

308
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:16,520
 We can be something new.

309
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,760
 God gives us peace and joy and hope.

310
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,560
 Romans 15, 13, I love this verse.

311
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:27,360
 It says, "May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing so that by

312
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:32,700
 the power of the Holy Spirit you may abound in hope."

313
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:37,640
 Those are some amazing promises, amazing promises.

314
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:48,040
 Type of stuff that we could jump and shout and yell on the street because of how powerful

315
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,040
 and beautiful that is.

316
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:54,160
 The type of stuff that we should certainly be grateful for.

317
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:59,360
 They come to us because of redemption, because of what Jesus has done in our lives.

318
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:04,280
 That's something that should, as we look at it, as we think about it, as we reflect on

319
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:07,200
 it, it should fill our hearts with gratitude.

320
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,960
 It's a way we can cultivate gratitude in our lives is looking at the redemption that God

321
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,960
 has given us.

322
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,600
 We need to focus on the beauty of what He has done for us.

323
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,640
 Sometimes when we think about scripture, we think about redemption in this grand narrative

324
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,920
 and God saving all people.

325
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,760
 That is true.

326
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,320
 That's the beautiful grand narrative of redemption.

327
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:33,720
 Redemption also has a personal narrative that God saved you.

328
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:38,520
 God's at work in your life and He's healing you from your hurt and from your past and

329
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:46,160
 He's making you a new creation and He's making you more like Jesus.

330
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:50,200
 So when you start to think about this and be grateful for it, don't just be grateful

331
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,080
 that God is saving people around the world.

332
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,980
 Yeah, be grateful for that.

333
00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:00,080
 But bring it home to your own heart and say, "I'm grateful that God saved me.

334
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,040
 I'm grateful that I'm not who I was.

335
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:07,760
 I'm grateful that even though I'm not yet who I want to be, that God is moving me towards

336
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,840
 that and He's doing something beautiful in my life."

337
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:18,000
 And you can be personally grateful for redemption.

338
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,380
 When I think of this, one of the illustrations I think of is like a really skillfully crafted

339
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:27,720
 work of art, if you think about something like that.

340
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:31,280
 Especially like if you think of a paint on canvas type of work of art.

341
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,560
 If you go down to the Art Institute, they have this giant, some of the Renaissance art

342
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:43,000
 are like huge, like 20 feet wide and 10 feet tall, huge, huge.

343
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,280
 You think about how long it would take to make a work of art like that, all the layers

344
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:52,280
 of paint that have to go on there, the type of vision that the artist has to have when

345
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:59,400
 they start to even know what they want to get onto the canvas, but then also the dedication

346
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:03,520
 they have to get it on there day after day for years they have to work on something like

347
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,600
 that.

348
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:11,240
 And you also have to know that even the most precise artist is going to make some mistakes

349
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,700
 and they're going to get some lines that are a little bit off.

350
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:19,040
 And so then they've got to go back and touch that up a little bit with another layer of

351
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,040
 paint.

352
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:29,360
 It's an amazing accomplishment to bring something like that to completion, a work of art like

353
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,360
 that.

354
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:37,160
 And yet that's what God is doing in our lives.

355
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:43,920
 God has this vision for your life that's not just a one week vision, it's, there's a Christian

356
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:47,040
 song from when I was in high school, I've always remembered this lyric, it says, "I

357
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,840
 have a plan for you, it will only take a lifetime to see through."

358
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:55,600
 That's God's vision, it's for your whole life.

359
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,840
 God sees the whole thing, he knows what he's doing in your life.

360
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:09,640
 He's putting on layer after layer of paint to craft you into who he wants you to be.

361
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:14,360
 And the whole time there's mistakes being made, right?

362
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,080
 Not by God, but by me.

363
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,640
 God doesn't make mistakes, but I do.

364
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,800
 I get outside the lines all the time.

365
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:26,960
 And God in his providence and his sovereignty and his grace and mercy and love, he finds

366
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:35,720
 ways to craft even my mistakes into something beautiful and something that's gonna be for

367
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,240
 my good and for his glory.

368
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:46,240
 But here's the crazy part, God's not just doing that for me, he's doing it for everyone

369
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,360
 in the world who has a relationship with Jesus.

370
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:54,760
 He's doing it for all these people at the same time.

371
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:58,000
 What an amazing thing it is.

372
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,240
 And when you stand in front of one of those giant works of art, for me, I'm always kind

373
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:08,880
 of in awe and I think, "Wow, whoever made this, like I said, I give glory to them for

374
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,880
 what they have done."

375
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:16,520
 And so when we look at God's work in redemption, we should stand back and say, "Wow, this is

376
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,520
 amazing.

377
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:24,080
 I can't even believe God is able to redeem all the mess in my heart, much less everybody

378
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,840
 else's heart, and then bring us together in all these different ways and then fix all

379
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,280
 of our mistakes even when we keep making them."

380
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:37,160
 And it brings glory to God because of what he's doing in redemption.

381
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,680
 So that's a great place to cultivate gratitude.

382
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:44,760
 Say, "I'm gonna grow gratitude in my life by thinking about what God's done for me,

383
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,760
 what he's doing in our world."

384
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:53,200
 And then the last big way I want us to think about cultivating gratitude is as we praise

385
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:58,680
 God for the majesty of who he is.

386
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:02,480
 You know, the first two, praising God and cultivating gratitude as we look at the wonders

387
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:07,960
 of his creation, as we look at the beauty of redemption, those things kind of have to

388
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,480
 do with God's work in our world.

389
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,520
 But here's the crazy thing.

390
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,680
 Scripture is really clear about this.

391
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:22,280
 God is worthy of praise even if he never did any of that, just because of who he is.

392
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:26,720
 And we can cultivate gratitude in that way as well, just because of who God is.

393
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:35,160
 Verse 3 here of Psalm 100 says, "Know that the Lord, he is God."

394
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:41,600
 Obviously there's other statements in that Psalm, but that statement is enough by itself.

395
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,680
 Know that the Lord, he is God.

396
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:51,360
 Even if there's nothing else, God is worthy of our praise because of who he is.

397
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,400
 Our gratitude belongs to him.

398
00:28:54,400 --> 00:29:02,480
 Jehovah, the word in verse 3 there, the Hebrew word for God, means the self-existent one

399
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:07,640
 or the eternal one or the existing one.

400
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:12,840
 That's the picture that we have of God in Scripture.

401
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,440
 Completely apart from the wonder of creation and the beauty of redemption, God is still

402
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,160
 worthy of our praise.

403
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:22,920
 And so when we contemplate who he is and reflect on who he is, our hearts should be full of

404
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,160
 gratitude.

405
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,400
 Think about some of the attributes of God that Scripture revealed.

406
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:34,440
 God's power, which is unlimited.

407
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,440
 God's goodness.

408
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:41,400
 It always blows my mind when I think about how powerful God is and yet he is also good.

409
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:49,360
 If God was powerful and not good, he would be completely terrifying.

410
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,880
 God is not just powerful, he's also good and he loves us.

411
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:59,320
 His wisdom and knowledge, Romans 11.33 says, "Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and

412
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:04,280
 knowledge of God, how unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways."

413
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:08,360
 God's wisdom and knowledge is completely beyond our comprehension.

414
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:14,720
 God's holiness, his love for us, Psalms 100 talks about it, verse 5, "The Lord is good,

415
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,600
 his steadfast love endures forever."

416
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:25,320
 God's love for us, his grace, his mercy, God's justice, God's sovereignty, God's immutability.

417
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:29,160
 That just means the fact that God doesn't change.

418
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:34,240
 He's so right that he never needs to change because he's not wrong and he's not going

419
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,240
 to be wrong.

420
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,880
 He never changes because he doesn't need to change.

421
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,680
 The eternal nature of God, he's always existed, his omnipresence, he's in every place, his

422
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:47,680
 transcendence, his infinitude, which is crazy because when you think about the attributes

423
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:51,840
 of God and all the things that make up who God is, he's just, he's loving, he's all these

424
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:56,640
 things, you have to also remember that not only is he those things but he is those things

425
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,800
 in infinity and he is the very definition of those things.

426
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,460
 We only know love because God is love.

427
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:08,000
 We only know justice because God is justice.

428
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,680
 We only know mercy and grace because God is mercy and grace.

429
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:18,540
 God's perfection, not only is he those things in infinitude but he is also those things

430
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:20,820
 in perfection.

431
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:23,560
 He is perfectly loving.

432
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,740
 He is perfectly just.

433
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,600
 He is perfectly holy.

434
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,440
 He is perfectly good.

435
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:38,920
 When we think about that stuff, we should say, "Wow, I want to praise God for who he

436
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,920
 is.

437
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,320
 I want to be grateful for who he is."

438
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:46,080
 And God is all these things completely by himself.

439
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:51,720
 He self-exists and is completely self-sufficient.

440
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:57,440
 Back to this three, verses 13 and 14, this is when Moses and God are having this conversation.

441
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,720
 God's come to Moses, said, "Hey, I want you to go to the people and go to Egypt and lead

442
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,880
 the people out of Egypt and I'm going to give you what to say."

443
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,720
 Moses is not wanting to do it so he's talking back.

444
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,360
 "Then Moses said to God, 'If I come to the people of Israel and say to them, 'The God

445
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,120
 of your fathers has sent me to you,' and they asked me, 'What is his name?

446
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,840
 What shall I say to them?'"

447
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:23,080
 Verse 14, "God said to Moses, 'I am who I am.'

448
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:27,360
 And he said, 'Say this to the people of Israel, 'I am has sent you.'"

449
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:37,080
 Now, it's not quite as powerful in English as it is in Hebrew, but verse 14, God is really

450
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,640
 letting Moses know in no uncertain terms.

451
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,520
 He's saying, "You want to know what my name is?

452
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,640
 You want to know who I am?

453
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,640
 You want to know who to announce?

454
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:55,120
 Announce the eternal, existent one, the one who has always existed and always will exist

455
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:04,880
 and who needs no one else and is totally self-sufficient and is without any degree of diminishment

456
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,880
 or need."

457
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:10,720
 That's what God's saying to Moses in that verse.

458
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,080
 "I am the existent one.

459
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,920
 I'm the one who has always been, always will be.

460
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,920
 I need nothing.

461
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,000
 Everything else came from me."

462
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 That's the God that we serve.

463
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,720
 That's the God of the Bible.

464
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:31,840
 And he's worthy of our praise and our thanksgiving and gratitude just because that's who he is.

465
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,320
 If you've ever been in a situation where you kind of experienced something that was really

466
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:42,520
 transcendent, gratitude was probably a part of that situation.

467
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:50,840
 I know in times of my life when I've experienced something transcendent, gratitude just comes

468
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,280
 from nowhere.

469
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:59,440
 One time when I was a youth pastor many years ago, I was in a service at a camp.

470
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:05,560
 The presence of the Lord was really present.

471
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,640
 We got done.

472
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,240
 We did worship at the end.

473
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,480
 It was time to go.

474
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,800
 I told everybody to be dismissed, to go back to the cabins because we were supposed to

475
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,320
 go to bed.

476
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,280
 And no one would leave the room because of God's presence.

477
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,720
 And so everybody stayed.

478
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:27,080
 So we started doing worship again and we just kept the service going and ended up being

479
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,600
 there much, much longer.

480
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,640
 And God was just working in powerful ways.

481
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,800
 Kids got saved that night, came to know Jesus.

482
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,320
 It was really a transcendent thing.

483
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,680
 It wasn't anything that I was doing or anybody else was doing.

484
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:40,320
 God was at work.

485
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:47,920
 And I was full of an overwhelming sense of gratitude just to be there, to be present.

486
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:52,920
 It's not a lot of transcendent experiences in my life.

487
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:57,920
 But another one that I can think of that's really powerful to me, every time one of our

488
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:05,080
 children has been born, I'm there with my wife and I see one of our children born, been

489
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,360
 there for all five of them.

490
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:15,440
 And I'm reflecting on just the promise and the potential of a human life and what it

491
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:20,480
 means that this new life is taking their first breath in the world.

492
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:25,480
 And I get to see it, get to see them take their first breath and then announce themselves

493
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:28,760
 with screaming and crying.

494
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:34,020
 And it's always like just a beautiful moment.

495
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:37,160
 And there's just emotion that I don't have to manufacture.

496
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:40,640
 It just is overwhelming.

497
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,640
 But there's also overwhelming gratitude.

498
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:51,720
 Because I'm so grateful for that moment, for that life, for what God is doing.

499
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:56,560
 And when we spend some time in God's presence and experience Him and start to see how transcendent

500
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,760
 He is, that's what happens.

501
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,400
 We don't have to try to make ourselves feel grateful.

502
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,520
 It just comes out.

503
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:09,080
 We're overwhelmed with gratitude for who God is.

504
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:15,200
 So I want to encourage us to seek to cultivate gratitude in our lives, to take our eyes as

505
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:21,840
 much as we can off of ourselves and put them on God and what He is doing.

506
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:26,400
 And there's a lot more ways that you can practice it, but I would encourage you, if you don't

507
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,240
 know where to start, start with these three things that we talked about today.

508
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:36,640
 Cultivate gratitude by praising God for the wonder of His creation.

509
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:43,200
 Cultivate gratitude by thanking God for the beauty of His redemption in your life.

510
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:48,320
 And cultivate gratitude just because God is.

511
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,760
 And He is so amazing and so transcendent.

512
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:57,520
 I'm going to close just by reading this psalm one more time and letting its words fill our

513
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,520
 hearts.

514
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:02,160
 "Make a joyful noise to the Lord all the earth.

515
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,360
 Serve the Lord with gladness.

516
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,440
 Come into His presence with singing.

517
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,560
 Know that the Lord, He is God.

518
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:10,840
 It is He who made us and we are His.

519
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:14,080
 We are His people and the sheep of His pasture.

520
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:17,200
 Enter His gates with thanksgiving and His courts with praise.

521
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,400
 Give thanks to Him.

522
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,520
 Bless His name for the Lord is good.

523
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:25,600
 His steadfast love endures forever and His faithfulness to all generations."

524
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,080
 Let's pray.

525
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:35,400
 God, we just want to thank You for who You are.

526
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,600
 We can't even describe it.

527
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:42,240
 We can't even express who You are, God.

528
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:51,120
 We are so small in Your presence and yet, as the word says, by Your mercy we're not

529
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,120
 consumed.

530
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:55,400
 You still love us.

531
00:37:55,400 --> 00:38:00,600
 And You choose to come and be involved in our lives.

532
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:05,840
 And God, we thank You for redemption.

533
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:09,960
 That even though we were broken, fallen sinners living in a broken, fallen world, You wrapped

534
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:17,080
 Yourself in our flesh and You loved us enough to come into our world and to begin to heal

535
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:21,640
 us one heart at a time and to reconcile us with You and to bring us into right relationship

536
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,640
 with our Creator.

537
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,920
 God, we thank You for that.

538
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,640
 We thank You for this beautiful world that You have given us and allow us to live in.

539
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:36,060
 And God, I pray for myself and for all of us, especially over the next few weeks as

540
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:40,560
 we have this time of thanksgiving, that You would help us to cultivate gratitude to begin

541
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:45,040
 to see how good You are in our lives.

542
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:49,240
 And even in the most difficult moments, You are still at work.
