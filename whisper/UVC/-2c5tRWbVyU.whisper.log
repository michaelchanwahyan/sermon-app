[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600]   right? Tommy, I don't know how you can do so much. We want to welcome Tommy. Let's welcome him.
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:13.920]   Well, thank you very much everyone. And Pastor Mark, it is great to be here with all of you guys
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.920]   this morning. And you know, I never thought I would be on this journey that God has called me
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.960]   on. And when I graduated from high school, my parents, many of you guys who are listening are
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:32.480]   Asian and Chinese. So my mom says to me, "Pick a goal. Doctor, engineer, or lawyer? Pick one."
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.480]   So I said, "Okay, I guess I really enjoy chemistry. I guess I'm going to be a doctor. I want to apply
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.760]   for Washington University in St. Louis." And got into their medical program, a seven-year medical
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.800]   program, right? And from that point on, after the first semester, I realized, man, God did not call
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.400]   me to be a doctor. I'm not sure if I enjoy doing that. And so as a result, I went to the business
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.280]   school at Washington University in St. Louis. Graduated from that. And then from that point,
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.200]   I built cell towers, telecommunications towers for about 12 years. But during that period of time,
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:10.240]   I'm at my church in Chinatown, where some of you guys were. And so I'm working with our high school
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.640]   and college students. And the big question I asked myself is, "Lord, are you calling me to go into
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.880]   full-time ministry?" And my thought was full-time ministry at that time was pastoral ministry,
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.920]   right? So now I'm taking classes at night at Moody Seminary here in Chicago. And so after I
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:37.600]   graduated, I went and worked in a church, a Korean church. I wanted something new of all places. And
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.120]   for about three years, I was a pastor. Realized, man, God did not call me to be a pastor. I'm not
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:50.000]   sure if I enjoy doing that. I just was not wired to do that. So then from that point, I went to
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.040]   work at a Bible school, Moody Bible Institute, where my title was special assistant to the
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:01.120]   president. I did major donors, Founders Week, and Pastors Conference. I realized the non-profit
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:08.000]   ministry is too slow for me. It's too hierarchy. It's too top-down. I'm not sure if I enjoy doing
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.880]   that. So now for the last 15 years, I get a chance, as Pastor Mark says, we started Resource
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:21.840]   Global that works with young Christian marketplace leaders in different global cities. We started in
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:30.080]   Jakarta, Indonesia. Then we went to Singapore and Chicago and Kuala Lumpur, Nairobi, Austin.
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:36.400]   From that point on, we're starting one in Los Angeles, in South Africa, here at Houston in
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.520]   Sydney in the next couple of years. And then from that point on, Northern Seminary called and says,
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.880]   "Can you do the same thing that you did at Resource Global with ministry leaders and pastors?"
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:53.600]   Because many of these pastors from around the world, ministry leaders, Christian lay leaders,
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.880]   cannot afford your full-time seminary that many American seminaries offer. So then we started
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.960]   doing that. I get a chance to now operate as the executive director of Together LA. We opened up a
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.000]   business in Indonesia called City Leadership Center. And so I get a chance to work with different
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.040]   other groups as well too. But the whole idea is, how has God trained and created you? And we're
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:24.000]   going to talk a little bit about that because all of us individually are designed uniquely by God.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.120]   Each one of us has a certain story that's unique to all of our lives. As you're sitting here
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:38.480]   listening to me right now, your story is unique. Your story is different. And God has made that
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.800]   story unique with all of the adventure, with the different chapters in your life.
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:50.320]   Now, where are we? Why are we calling us to go? What do we need to do? That becomes the question
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:58.560]   that all of us will have to ask. And if we could start off our sermon title today is "The Road
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:07.440]   Unknown." And we're going to take a look at Joshua chapter 3, verses 1 through 8. Joshua chapter 3,
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.240]   verses 1 through 8. And let me read that as well too.
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:17.920]   "Then Joshua rose early in the morning," I'm reading from the ESV, "and they set out from
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:23.840]   Shittim. And they being the Israelites came out to the Jordan, he and all of the people of Israel,
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.760]   and lodged there before they passed over. At the end of three days, the officers went through the
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:36.000]   camp and commanded the people, 'As soon as you see the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.120]   being carried by the Levitical priests, then you shall set out from your place and follow it.
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:49.360]   Yet there shall be a distance between you and it, about 2,000 cubits in length. Do not come near it,
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.800]   in order that you may know the way you shall go, for you have not passed this way before.'
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.480]   Then Joshua said to the people, 'Consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow the Lord will do
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:06.400]   wonders among you.' And Joshua said to the priests, 'Take up the Ark of the Covenant and pass out
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:11.440]   on before the people.' So they took up the Ark of the Covenant and went before the Lord.
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:17.520]   The Lord said to Joshua, 'Today I will begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel,
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:25.360]   that they may know that as I was with Moses, so I will be with you. And as for you, command the
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.320]   priests who bear the Ark of the Covenant, when you come to the brink of the waters of the Jordan,
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:39.200]   you shall stand still in the Jordan.'" We're going to look at five questions this morning
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:47.840]   that emerges out of these eight verses, questions that emerges that guides us as we look at these
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:54.400]   different verses. And we're going to see exactly what God is teaching us in this theme of the road
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:01.520]   unknown, because all of us who are sitting here will have to cross that road unknown. All of us
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:07.280]   sitting here will get to a point where you don't know what to do, where you're trying to figure
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:12.480]   out, "Lord, what is it that you're calling me to do? What is it that you want me to do to continue
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:17.520]   to follow you?" Five questions. Number one, first question is this, and I hope a lot of times, and
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:24.080]   Mark, a lot of times I am trying to figure out, here we go. Question number one, what happens
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:30.320]   to Joshua in chapter one that sets us up for what happens in chapter three? Chapter three,
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:36.480]   verse one begins with this word, "Then Joshua rose early in the morning, and they set out from
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:45.920]   Shittim." They rose early in the morning, and he knows that this day is there. After 40 years
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:52.160]   of living in the promised land, after their time in Egypt and slavery,
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:07:01.360]   it is now time to pack up. It is now time to go into this promised land.
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:07.280]   And so the question begins, what happens to Joshua in chapter one and two that sets us up for
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:12.400]   what happens in chapter three? If you remember what happens in chapter one, some of you guys
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:22.960]   have read this. He tells him at the beginning, verse two, "Moses, my servant is dead. Now therefore,
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:29.920]   arise, go over to Jordan, you and all of this people into the land that I am giving to them,
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:38.400]   to the people of Israel." God tells Joshua, "Joshua, your leader Moses, the guy who has been
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:47.280]   your mentor for so many years, the guy who led you guys out of slavery in Egypt, the guy who took
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:52.240]   you guys through the Red Sea and parted the Red Sea, you know that person? The one who brought
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:58.080]   you the Ten Commandments, who you thought was going to lead you to the promised land? Joshua,
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:06.960]   he's not going to be there. Moses, your leader is dead. It's on you now, Joshua. You're going to be
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:14.400]   the one that leads everyone there. You're going to be the one that will have to bring them to the
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:23.680]   promised land." And he says to this, "Only be strong and very courageous. Be strong because
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:29.600]   you're going to have to lead this group after 40 years in the wilderness to a place where they
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:35.920]   don't know. You have to be strong and very courageous. And how you're going to do that,
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:42.640]   you have to be careful to do according to all the law that Moses, my servant, commanded you.
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:49.200]   And you're going to be strong and successful when you do not turn from it to the right hand
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:55.840]   or to the left, that you may have good success wherever you go. Do not let the book of the law
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:03.360]   depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night so that you may be careful to do
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:12.400]   everything according to all that is written to it." Chapter one begins with the whole fact that,
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:17.920]   let's put the whole situation in reality. Moses, your leader. Moses, the guy you followed. Moses,
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:22.480]   the person you're looking to. He's dead. Let's just get that out of the way. Joshua, you're
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:28.880]   going to be the one that leads them to it. And Joshua, it is not going to be easy because later
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:34.720]   on he finds out in chapter two when he sends the spies over to Jericho, they're not welcoming them
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:40.880]   there. Those guys in Jericho, those guys in the promised land, they heard that the Israelites are
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:46.320]   coming. There's this God who brought them out of Egypt through the Red Sea. They've been living in
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:54.000]   the promised land, this wilderness for 40 years. And now they're about to cross the Jordan River
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.480]   and they're coming to the promised land. They're not just going to come over and say, "Here you go,
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:05.200]   everyone." They're going to try to get rid of you. You're going to take their home. And Joshua,
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:10.880]   it will not be easy. People are going to be complaining. People are going to be critical.
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:16.560]   You're not going to know what to do. You're going to be scared. So Joshua, my words to you is to be
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:24.160]   strong and very courageous. Very, very courageous. And how you're going to do that, we're going to
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:33.280]   talk more about that. Do not turn from the words of this mouth. To meditate on it day and night.
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:42.000]   And those are the words that Joshua hits. And we head into verse one. He rose early in the morning.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:50.800]   He knows what is at stake. And he sets out from Shittim. And he tells them,
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:56.560]   "And they came to the Jordan, he and all of the people at Israel."
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:59.840]   Today is a day which leads us to the second question.
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:09.120]   As the Israelites are going into packing up for the last time, ready to go to the promised land,
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:15.600]   what do you think was going through the minds of the Israelites as they were packing up for the
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:24.160]   final time in a home they lived with for 40 years? For 40 years they lived in this wilderness.
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:31.600]   For 40 years some of the kids were born in that wilderness. For 40 years they lived on this thing
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:38.320]   called manna, a rice little cake. For 40 years they lived on it. It's not the best, but they
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:46.320]   lived on it for 40 years. At night for 40 years a flame came in and gave them warmth and gave
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:56.560]   them light. For 40 years in the wilderness this is what happened. And after 40 years the day comes
[00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:04.000]   and now they are ready to pack up. What do you think went through their mind as they were packing
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:11.280]   up knowing that after 40 years in the home they lived in 40 years? It is now time to go. For some
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:16.080]   of you guys you've lived in the home for 10 years. You've lived in your parents' home for 20 years.
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:21.600]   Your parents, look my parents lived in Chinatown, Chicago. They've lived there for over 20 years.
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:26.960]   There's a lot of stuff if they have ever have to pack up and leave. I just moved in the house that
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:33.040]   I lived to within four years. There's a lot of stuff to pack. They now live, they are ready to
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:41.360]   leave a home they live for 40 years. It depends on who you ask, right? There are some, the older
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:48.000]   ones who came out of Egypt into the province land, they probably passed. Some of the younger guys
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:54.720]   like Joshua who are now older, they were probably in the prime of their life when they were in
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:13:01.840]   slavery in Egypt. They remember the slavery in Egypt. They remember packing up and leaving through
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:07.760]   the Red Sea. They remember all that. They remember the early days when Moses brought them there in
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:13.200]   the Ten Commandments. These guys were the prime in their life. They were the leaders. They were
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:21.520]   the warriors back in those days. They now are the elders of this group of the Israelites. A day
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:30.080]   they have been thinking about for 40 years. The day where God has promised them for 40 years
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:38.880]   is finally there. There is a little worry, but there is excitement. That's that group.
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:46.240]   You have some of those who were babies when they were just in Egypt. They don't remember anything
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:51.280]   about what happened in Egypt. They remember probably sitting on the cart and donkey going
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:57.600]   through the Red Sea, but for the majority of their homes, their type, they've lived in the wilderness.
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:04.000]   That has been their home. They are now your leaders. They're now your warriors. They're now
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.640]   in the prime of their life. They're worried because if there's battle, those guys are the
[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:14.480]   ones who will have to take care of everything. And so yes, they do remember a little bit.
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:20.880]   Moses is kind of, they kind of remember Moses, but we've already sent out two spies.
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:27.040]   They're coming to get us. So there's a little hesitation. Maybe the youngest ones, the ones
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:34.000]   who were born in the wilderness, who are just growing up right now, they're excited, but similar
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.920]   to their parents. Man, why can't we stay in the wilderness? Why can't we just stay where we are?
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:44.800]   You know, when we go to the promised land, they're going to try to kill us. They're not going to just
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:50.800]   turn over their home to us, their lands. Can we just stay in the wilderness? We're fine with
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:58.960]   there. We've been living there for 40 years. Depends on who you ask. There's so many different
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:05.040]   feelings that go, that are going through their mind, but you're not going out. It's a community,
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:13.600]   isn't it? And we find this even in church as well too. That as Christ followers, you are not alone.
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:19.200]   That even though I am speaking here and I'm just getting to know you, I don't know where some of
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:23.520]   you guys are watching from. It could be in Chicago. It could be other parts of the US. It could be
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:30.400]   parts of the other world. We don't know. But it's a community. With all of our differences in
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:38.560]   opinions, with all of our feelings, with all of our stories, our unique stories, we go together
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:46.720]   with our feelings, with our thoughts. And so it depends on who you ask with number two.
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:53.280]   There's anticipation. There's fear. There's wondering. There's excitement. There's,
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:59.520]   are you sure we should be doing that? All of this stuff. But we go forth as a community.
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:06.320]   And they came to the Jordan, he and all of the people in Israel, and lodged there
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:14.320]   for three days as they pass over. At the end of the three days, the officers went sent
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:19.280]   throughout the camp and commanded the people, which leads us to question number three.
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:25.440]   Why do you think Joshua had them camp out at the base of the Jordan River for three days?
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:30.160]   They packed up. Now they get to the Jordan River.
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:35.120]   Joshua, go do your thing and park the Jordan River. What are you going to do?
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:42.560]   I want you guys to sit there for three days. And I want you to stare at the Jordan River for three
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:47.920]   days. Do you know what's happening at the Jordan River during that time? Chapter three doesn't,
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:53.520]   you don't need to turn to it, but here's what happens in chapter three, verse 17.
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:17:02.480]   And it tells us about the Jordan River. Now the Jordan is overflowing all its banks
[00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:09.600]   during this time of harvest is what happens, it says in chapter verse 17.
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:19.520]   So Joshua, you are actually asking us to pack up, go to the Jordan River during this time of harvest
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:27.920]   in the middle when the waters are raging. And it's crazy. And you want us to cross the Jordan River
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:36.400]   during this time. And now for the next three days, we're staring at the Jordan River so we can see
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:42.320]   how high the rivers are, how raging the waters are and what we're going to do. Really?
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:49.280]   Why do you think Joshua had those guys camp out at the base of the Jordan River for three days?
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:18:00.480]   Here's what I'm going to say about this. Don't ever underestimate how God uses experiences
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:09.920]   in your life to show his faithfulness. Don't ever underestimate how God uses experience
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:17.920]   in your life to show his faithfulness. They sit there at the Jordan River,
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:23.680]   they're staring at the Jordan River for three days as the waters are raging.
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:29.760]   In order to show I'm going to do something work and I need you guys to see what you're going to
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:36.560]   deal with and what I'm going to do in your life. Because when you go to the Jordan River into this
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:43.520]   land that is unknown, you're going to have to grab upon these memories of how God has been faithful,
[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:51.840]   how I have been faithful to you in order to guide that every step of the way. Joshua teach them
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:57.120]   how to use the words of God, help them to meditate. But now I'm going to show them memories
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:06.800]   in order for me to show I am faithful. Do not underestimate how God uses memories in your life,
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:14.160]   situations in your life to prove how faithful he is to you. Let me tell you a quick story as well
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:19.200]   too, okay? And then we're going to go on to the next point. I stand here right now, if you notice
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:25.120]   to me I have a lot of different water. Three years ago the doctors told me that I was diagnosed with
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:31.600]   cancer in my sinus. That cancer was going to destroy everything inside of my nose and all of
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:39.360]   it inside my mouth. I stand here today with no saliva, little bit of taste buds, my hearing is
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:44.400]   down to 30% in my left ear, my ear is going bad, I'm down to about, eventually it's going to be
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:51.600]   down to 20-30%. I have tears in my eyes, I have no tears in my eyes, I live with headaches and
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:58.240]   pain throughout my body every single day. Two and a half years ago when I was going through my chemo
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:04.960]   radiation, the doctor says you're going to be in pain and I never understood that pain. And I lived
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:15.760]   in that pain by week five of the radiation. I lived with pain every single day. That pain didn't stop
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:21.680]   everyone. That pain affected the inside of my nose, the inside of my mouth, the outside of my
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:30.640]   skin on my neck and I lived with intense pain and that led on for four weeks. I lost 80 pounds
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:40.080]   during those weeks because I couldn't eat. Every day I sat in my home, every day for those four
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:49.040]   weeks I cried to the Lord, take away that pain. I can't deal with that pain anymore, take away that
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:56.880]   pain. And you know what happened? The pain never left, went away. God was quiet during that period
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:03.840]   of time. And you know what I had to depend on every single day? I had to always remember God's
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:09.680]   faithfulness to me during those years. All of the memories of how He was faithful, I had to remember
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:16.080]   and I had to remember the truth of the scriptures here in this world to guide me those four or five
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:21.040]   weeks. Because folks, there are times in your life you're going to go through trials, you're going to
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:25.760]   go through hard times, you're not going to know what to do. And you're going to have to cling upon
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:31.680]   the words because you can't trust your heart. Your heart's going to tell you, be angry. Why is God
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:37.280]   doing this to you? But you're going to have to trust upon those words and cling upon those words
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:42.480]   as truth. And you're going to have to cling upon those memories to guide you every step of those
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:47.280]   days. That's what you're going to do. And do not underestimate that God will use memories in your
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:54.800]   life to guide you every step of the way. And He says this in this wonderful things, as soon as you
[00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:59.840]   see the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God being carried out by the Levitical priests,
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:05.760]   then you shall set out from your place and follow it. And watch this, underline this,
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:14.640]   yet there shall be a distance between you and it about 2,000 cubits in length. Do not come near it.
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:21.920]   If you have an underlined pencil, highlight or highlight this. Do not come near it in order that
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:32.960]   you may know the way you shall go. For you have what? Not passed this way before. Underline it.
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:40.080]   Underline it. You've never passed this way before. You don't know. I know this.
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:46.560]   I've wrought, I gave you the promise of life. I've determined your path. I've shown you what
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:54.320]   you need to do. Follow the Ark of the Covenant. In our case, follow the Holy Spirit. When I came
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:23:01.680]   and died on the cross, I gave you a new life. I've given you the Holy Spirit. Follow the Holy Spirit
[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:07.920]   in your life. Let the words of Scripture guide you. Let the memories of those guide you. But
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:13.360]   follow the Holy Spirit and allow you to really be able to give you direction for you don't know
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:18.800]   where you are going because you've never been in this way before.
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:24.160]   This morning I get out of bed, I see this text. It is a pastor friend of mine.
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:32.160]   He's a young adult pastor, youth pastor with two little kids, two girls. One just born,
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:38.640]   about a year old. Another one about five years old. He tells me, "Tommy, my wife left us.
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:46.080]   She didn't want to live the pastor's wife life anymore. She picked up, left me with my two girls
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:51.840]   and moved to New York to do what she always dreamed about. I don't know what to do.
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:24:00.000]   I have one of our other co-workers who recently said to me, "Tommy, my dad has a spinal injury
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:07.920]   and he needs spine surgery. My mom has dementia and they both live with us. I also just want to
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:12.240]   let you know my husband and I have been trying to go to marriage counseling for the last six months.
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:18.960]   It's not working. We're thinking about separating but I can't separate because I've always been a
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:25.120]   stay-at-home mom until I started working part-time with you. I don't know if he divorces me and we
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:29.120]   separate. What am I going to do with money? How am I going to handle my parents? We have three kids
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:37.280]   in college. In this COVID season, some of you guys are dealing with loss of loved ones wherever you
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:43.280]   are. You're dealing in situations in many countries, maybe where you are, where it's not safe to be a
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:49.200]   Christ follower. You're dealing with loss of jobs or loss of incomes because of COVID. Your business
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:53.440]   is shutting down. You may be on the brink of being laid off. You're looking at your savings
[00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:59.440]   account. You're trying to figure out what to do. You're dealing with kids who are acting out. You're
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:05.040]   dealing. You just had a baby. You don't know what to do. You're arguing with your spouse. There are
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:10.160]   situations in your life where you don't know what to do because you've never gone this way before.
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:17.360]   And God is saying, "I understand. I've written your story. Your story is unique."
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:23.280]   Know I am part of that story. And as I led you to the promised land, Joshua, the same words that
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:29.040]   ring to Joshua, rings to us. Meditate on your words day and night. Do not allow the words that
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:34.800]   depart from your mouth. Remember the memories of you, but follow the ark of the covenant. Follow
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:40.480]   the Holy Spirit because you have not been this way before.
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:46.480]   Sorry about that. And next one, question five.
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:53.120]   But consecrate. Oops, sorry about that. Consecrate yourselves.
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:26:00.080]   I am so, I'm getting used to, Mark, sorry about this. I'm getting used to number five here.
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:05.680]   And then from that point on, it goes to this. Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow the Lord
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:15.520]   will do wonders among you. Consecrate yourselves for the Lord will do wonders among you. I'm going
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:19.680]   to send you on a journey. I'm going to send you through the promised land. After 40 years,
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:26.160]   I have a plan for you, says the Lord. Follow the ark of the covenant for you have never been this
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:37.440]   way before. But before you do, consecrate yourselves for tomorrow the Lord will do what?
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:44.640]   Wonders among you. And that will be my last point. And what does it mean by wonders? Let's take a
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:50.320]   look at chapter seven, right? Sometimes here's the thing I want to encourage you. You're sitting
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:54.800]   there, consecrate. What in the world does it mean, consecrate? If you have Google, just do Google,
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:27:01.120]   go to BibleGateway.com. And in the book of Joshua, just do the word consecrate and see
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:09.120]   exactly how it appears. So here's what it says in verse 13 of chapter seven, the word consecrate
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:15.760]   appears twice in Joshua. It appears in chapter three and now it appears in chapter seven.
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:23.840]   Here's what it says. Get up, consecrate the people and say, consecrate yourselves for tomorrow.
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:31.520]   For thus says the Lord God of Israel, there are devoted things in your midst, O Israel,
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:40.240]   that you cannot stand before your enemies until you take away the devoted things among you.
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:47.040]   Israelites, I'm going to do something powerful again for you. I'm going to lead you to the
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:51.760]   promised land, I'm going to write you a new story and there you will become one of the greatest
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:56.560]   nations. But it's not going to be easy. You're going to go into a period where it is the unknown
[00:27:56.560 --> 00:28:01.680]   and you're not going to know what to do. But I will be with you because I will give you the ark
[00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:07.600]   of the covenant. I will give you the Holy Spirit. But before you do, and I'm going to do wonderful
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:12.960]   things in your life, but before you do, you know what I'm going to ask you? I want you to
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:20.480]   consecrate yourselves. I want you to take the devoted things away in your life.
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:31.360]   Where's your heart? What are the things in your life that God says to you when he says to
[00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:40.480]   consecrate? As you are sitting here right now, what does he have you to consecrate? What needs,
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:44.160]   what are some of the devoted things in your life that you need to come
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:50.080]   and deal with the Lord? Because he's going to want to do wonderful things about you. He has a story
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:56.800]   for you. He has wonderful things. He has a life planned out to you. But he's asking you to
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:02.960]   consecrate your life. To take the things in your heart, the devoted things in your heart,
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:12.640]   and get rid of it. And for some of us, it may be our plans. It may be the things that we want in
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:18.960]   our life. The things that we inherit, our dreams, our goals. It may be that. For some of us, it may
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:23.120]   be guilt that you're dealing with. You're sitting here listening right now and you're just dealing
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:34.800]   with guilt. Some of you may be anger or jealousy. All of that. When God says to you, "Take out,
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:45.360]   consecrate yourselves." What is he saying to you? What is he asking you to give up and come before
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:52.400]   the Lord, the devoted things in your life, and bring out to him? Because he wants to do a wonderful
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:57.280]   thing in your life. He wants to do something that you can't even imagine. He wants to write a story
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:02.880]   in your life that's unique and do things and lead you on that journey. But before you do, what I
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:10.000]   need you to consecrate yourselves to take out the things in your life that will hinder my relationship
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:18.640]   with you. That becomes the whole gospel message, isn't it? That Jesus Christ, upon the death of
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:25.440]   his cross, dies for our sins. We live a matter of grace. It is not a matter by works. He promises you
[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:31.200]   that you have to come before the cross. Come before him and say, "Lord, I accept you into my life."
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:37.600]   And through that, he opens the door to a new journey. And he says to you, "Continue to follow
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:42.160]   the words I give you. Continue to follow the memories. Continue to follow the Holy Spirit I
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:51.600]   give you. But every single day, as I lead you on this unique journey to consecrate yourself, to
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:58.560]   sanctify yourself, to continue to cleanse yourself of your heart and the things that will bring
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:03.760]   a divide between me and you." And so that becomes the question for you.
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:09.440]   What do you need to do to do business with God to consecrate yourselves with him?
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:15.760]   Let's actually stick with four questions because we're out of time as well too. The role to know.
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:20.640]   What happens in Joshua chapter one that sets up for chapter three?
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:28.800]   You are my leader. Do not depart from the word that I meditate on day and night. That's number
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:35.760]   one. Number two, I'm going to give you memories to show you that I'm proving to be faithful. Do not
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:41.120]   ever underestimate how God is faithful in your life. Those memories, not only the word of God,
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:47.680]   but the memories. And he said, "Give you the Holy Spirit to guide you every step of the way."
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:56.800]   But we do it in community together. And that's what our calling is as Christ's fathers. And along the
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:07.680]   way, consecrate yourselves. For there are devoted things in your heart that will affect that I want
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:16.480]   you to do business with. Jesus is there always in all parts of your life, but he calls us to work
[00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:22.560]   and follow him in this journey, on this wonderful adventure that he is ready to leave you.
[00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:31.280]   And he calls you on that path. Let's pray. Father, thank you for your words.
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:39.040]   Thank you for your guidance. Thank you for how you speak to us each and every single day.
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:46.560]   Thank you for the journey you give us. Thank you for how you give us your word. You give us memories.
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:54.400]   You give us the Holy Spirit. But you challenge us to consecrate, to come and continue to do
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:33:01.360]   business with you. And so, Lord, I lift those things up to you, dear Father. And to pray for
[00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:06.960]   all of us who are listening, Lord, that we continue to hear your voice and follow you in this journey,
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:14.800]   that we come before you and lay it all at your feet. In Christ we pray.
