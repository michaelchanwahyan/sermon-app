[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.080]   - All right, thank you, Amir.
[00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:04.760]   And welcome all of you and happy Thanksgiving to you.
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.320]   I know some of you are out of town
[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.240]   and you probably have some special plan.
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.760]   And today we are going to the luncheon.
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.800]   And so I will keep it really, really short.
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.840]   So we'll be out and be there by one o'clock
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.400]   and we're gonna have a good lunch together
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.680]   and play some games and get to know one another,
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.200]   connect with one another.
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.160]   And that's what Thanksgiving is all about
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.240]   because it's all about family and taking care
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.800]   of one another.
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.680]   Let's all pray together.
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.680]   And I got the news that Annie is in active labor right now.
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.400]   Yeah, so let's pray for her
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.680]   and pray for those who are out of town as well.
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.160]   Let's pray together.
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.800]   Father, give thanks, give thanks in good times
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.520]   and in bad times.
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.280]   And most of all, we want to give you thanks
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.240]   because of what you have done for us in Jesus Christ.
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.160]   And I pray that we will remember and be reminded
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.640]   you have given us the greatest gift of all,
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.600]   which is your son, Jesus Christ.
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.000]   Thank you for the salvation.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.240]   Thank you for the identity being your sons and daughters
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.200]   and the eternal life you have given to us.
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.640]   I pray for Annie, I pray for James, I pray for the baby.
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.120]   I pray that this time you will be with them
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.120]   and give strength to Annie as she is in active labor.
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.800]   And I pray that as this newborn baby comes,
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.560]   they will be ready and give them a sense of peace and love
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.560]   and to receive this new life in the family.
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.120]   I pray for those who are out of town
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.080]   and I pray that you will grant them safety.
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.120]   And in this week of Thanksgiving, be reminded
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.840]   that we do need to be grateful
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.640]   for all that you have given to us in Christ in prayer.
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.120]   Well, I have understood
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.400]   that Thanksgiving is actually a discipline.
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.720]   Thanksgiving is something that we have to do
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.640]   and we learn to do.
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.640]   And if you ask someone in the Bible
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.480]   or the apostles or the disciples,
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.200]   pastors in the Bible, in the New Testament,
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.200]   probably the one guy who can tell us so much
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.040]   about the meaning of true Thanksgiving is the apostle Paul.
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.960]   He was preaching the gospel and he was imprisoned in Rome
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.040]   for the sake of the gospel
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.600]   and he wrote this to the church in Ephesus.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.600]   He said, "Sing and make music in your heart to the Lord."
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.680]   Now again, to sing and make music is not an option.
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.080]   It's not something you can choose from the choices.
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.360]   It is a command.
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.960]   It is an imperative.
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.280]   It's telling you, you have to do it.
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.200]   Sing and make music in your heart to the Lord.
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.800]   Always giving thanks to God the Father for everything
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.960]   in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, Ephesians 5.
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.760]   Now think about it, always giving thanks for everything
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.440]   no matter what circumstances, good times or bad times.
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.960]   To Paul, the writer of this verse,
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.360]   Thanksgiving is not a once a year celebration
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.360]   but a daily reality, every single day,
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.360]   a daily discipline to cultivate a thankful attitude.
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.640]   And such an attitude will change our life view
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.640]   and make us joyful people in every situation.
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:51.640]   The worship leader remind us to reflect on this year,
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.080]   this past year, what had happened in your life
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.160]   and how would you conclude
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.000]   and how would you describe this past year, 2023.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.760]   To reflect upon it is to help us to find some compass,
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.240]   some direction in what God is doing in our lives.
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.440]   Thanksgiving reminds us that God is a God of blessing.
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:21.160]   God has blessed us and that's why Thanksgiving
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.160]   is one of the most important marks of Christian life.
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.040]   When we follow Jesus, we must not allow
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:35.040]   a spirit of ingratitude because it will harden your heart.
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.560]   It will chill your relationship with God and with others.
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.560]   Thank God for the blessing, material blessing,
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.840]   spiritual blessing for the people in your life.
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.360]   Most of all for Jesus in your life.
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.720]   You see the mind, our thinking is like the belly.
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.920]   We eat garbage in and garbage out.
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:05.080]   If we take on, we take in toxic substance,
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.680]   it will ruin our system, ruin our digestive system
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.240]   and indeed our whole body, our mind, our spirit.
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.920]   The same goes with our mind.
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.920]   If our thinking, if our thought life is filled with myself,
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.840]   my own interest, my own voice, my own want,
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.440]   your mind will deteriorate.
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.640]   It will, it will.
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.880]   'Cause it will turn you into bitter self,
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:42.880]   selfish self, dissatisfied, ungrateful heart
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.360]   who do harm to all of us.
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.480]   The only way to restore it is to regain
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.280]   the spirit of contentment.
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:59.200]   What we have right now is more than we need.
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.960]   Yes, there are some needs and there's some wants
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.840]   in our lives and we pray for them,
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.080]   but the spirit of contentment says,
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.400]   "Hey, what I have right now is enough."
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:18.400]   And that kind of spirit will be a good soil
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.840]   to yield joy and thankfulness.
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:29.440]   Today, I think we are often,
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:35.240]   so full of unthankfulness.
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.840]   It's too common of a spirit, right?
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:42.080]   Kids forget to thank their parents for all that they do.
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.000]   Common courtesy is hard to find.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.240]   We often take for granted for the things people do to us.
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.240]   People help us, we take it for granted.
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.520]   People are gracious to us, love us, we take it for granted.
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.440]   And above all, if we do that,
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.560]   we fail to thank God for His blessing.
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.080]   Ingratitude in the Bible is sin.
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.280]   Let's put it this way.
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.120]   Ingratitude is sin.
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:14.320]   As much as lying, stealing, immorality,
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.960]   any other sin condemned by the Bible.
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.920]   Ingratitude is one of them.
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:25.920]   So one of the Bible's warnings in the New Testament
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.840]   is found in Romans chapter one.
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.560]   It talks about those who don't know God,
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:38.600]   they knew God, but they neither glorify Him as God
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:43.560]   nor give thanks to Him.
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:47.000]   They forget about being thankful.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.880]   Those who don't know God, don't sense the existence of God,
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:58.120]   don't worship God, is marked by ungratefulness, ingratitude.
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.760]   Let me ask you this.
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:04.440]   What are you thankful for?
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.200]   What are you thankful for?
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.680]   If your mind goes blank,
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:14.280]   we probably have to cultivate that spirit again,
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.160]   the spirit of thankfulness.
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.200]   From one end to the other end of the Bible,
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.040]   we are commanded to be thankful.
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.040]   I know it's hard.
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.120]   When things don't go well,
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:29.560]   I speak from my personal experience.
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.600]   When things go well in my life,
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:35.320]   I am angry, you know.
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.360]   My family members can tell you.
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.640]   I'm an angry man.
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:41.000]   I complain.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.840]   But Thanksgiving reminds us,
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:48.840]   reminds me that this kind of spirit comes from my heart.
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:55.280]   I need to be constantly attuned to God.
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:01.200]   Psalm 147, saying to the Lord with thanksgiving,
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:05.600]   we are commanded to do that.
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:10.600]   Colossians 3, let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:15.240]   since as members of one body, the church,
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.160]   you were called to peace.
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.760]   But be thankful, right?
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.040]   Be thankful.
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.880]   It's not about being polite to God.
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.760]   It's about worship.
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:30.120]   Who is God in your life?
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:35.400]   If Jesus is God, if Jesus is the Lord,
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:39.160]   we give thanks, right?
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.560]   It's not about being nice.
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:45.040]   Thankfulness is a command
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:47.560]   and it's a mark of our spiritual life.
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.160]   But we have to learn.
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.880]   We have to cultivate it.
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.520]   In bad times, in good times,
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.680]   we learn and we discipline our mind.
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.360]   So what should we be thankful for?
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:01.120]   Let me close with a few things
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:05.760]   to remind us what we need to be thankful for.
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.280]   Number one, thank God for the material blessings
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:09.360]   that God gives you.
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:15.960]   Paycheck, material enjoyment, shelter, a job,
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:19.600]   even though it sucks, right?
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:20.920]   At times it sucks.
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:24.680]   But be thankful, be thankful.
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:28.680]   Physical health, right?
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.320]   Yeah, sometimes we have back pain
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.040]   and all these different problems.
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:34.640]   But be thankful.
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:38.960]   Second, thank God for the people in your life.
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:43.480]   Your family members, yeah, they suck sometimes.
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.400]   They suck sometimes, right?
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:50.280]   They get us angry, they agitate us, you know?
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:51.920]   And I agitate them.
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.560]   But be thankful for the people in your life.
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.840]   It's so easy to take people for granted,
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:01.280]   especially people who really care for us and pray for us.
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:06.160]   But we need to give thanks for all those around us.
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:09.720]   Our spouse, our children, our friends,
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.280]   our church members, relatives,
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:18.720]   anyone who come my way, surround me with care.
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:23.960]   Number three, give thanks in the midst of trials.
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:28.280]   We face different difficulties and sometimes trouble.
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:32.200]   And, you know, look at the news.
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:36.800]   This world is such a broken place.
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:40.600]   It's dangerous, it's painful.
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.000]   Because of all these difficulties and challenges
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.360]   in the world.
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:47.320]   Our personal life as well.
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:50.120]   But, you know, the Bible tells us,
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:53.000]   the letter of James, consider it pure joy,
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.720]   my brothers and sisters.
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.720]   Whenever you face trials of many kinds,
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:01.600]   be joyful.
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:02.840]   Why?
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:05.400]   Because you know that the testing of your faith
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:07.880]   develops something inside of you
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.760]   that can never be taken away.
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:15.760]   That is your character, your spiritual life.
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.160]   Perseverance, patience.
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.960]   How can you have perseverance?
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:28.000]   It has to be developed from trials and difficulties, right?
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:34.920]   Patience and all these virtues and fruit of the spirit.
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:39.920]   It has to be cultivated from times of trials.
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:41.920]   All the faithful men and women in the Bible
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:44.200]   have their own difficult times.
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.640]   Think with me.
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.440]   From the first book of the Bible, Genesis,
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:54.440]   Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Israel, Moses, David,
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:13:03.880]   even Jesus Christ our Lord, as the perfect son of God.
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:06.400]   He had his own troubles.
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:10.080]   He went through trials and difficulties.
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:14.480]   But he give thanks.
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.720]   Well, I don't know about you,
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:19.560]   what kind of trials you are going through,
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:22.200]   or maybe you're having good times of your life, right?
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:24.160]   You think about 2023.
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.840]   This is such a great year, right?
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:27.880]   How many of you think like that?
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.480]   2023 is a great life.
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.320]   Okay, great.
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:31.720]   We got one hand up.
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:32.560]   That's nice.
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:33.640]   Maybe you're envious.
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:37.280]   Think about 2023 to you.
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:42.120]   It may be difficult, or indeed it is difficult.
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:47.920]   Nevertheless, cultivate a spirit of thankfulness,
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:52.240]   even in the midst of heartaches and trials.
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.960]   Number four, that's the last one.
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:58.080]   Thank God, especially for his salvation in Jesus Christ.
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:00.480]   God has given us the greatest gift of all, his son.
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:03.800]   He died on the cross and rose again to give us hope,
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:05.080]   to give us eternal life,
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:06.760]   so that we can know God personally,
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:09.240]   and we can know the Father and spend eternity
[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.880]   with the Father in heaven.
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:13.280]   And the Bible tells us we are separated.
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:17.120]   We don't deserve this grace of God, because we have sinned.
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.480]   We are separated from God.
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:21.800]   We are enemies to God, but God loves us.
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:26.320]   He loves you, and he loves me so much
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:30.480]   that he, God, wants us to be part of his family.
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:33.760]   And he did it to save us,
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.200]   send his only son into the world to die for us
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.640]   as perfect sacrifice.
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:43.720]   Give thanks that Christ the Savior has come, right?
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:51.000]   Turn to him, turn to God with a simple prayer of repentance
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.680]   to say to God, "I'm sorry.
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:55.240]   I take things for granted.
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:58.000]   But here I am.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.280]   I want to recover that faith, that spirit of thankfulness.
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:07.720]   Thank God for what you have done for you and for me."
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:08.920]   Let's all pray together.
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:12.800]   Father, once again, we give you thanks.
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:18.080]   We're sorry we take too many things for granted,
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:20.520]   for the life that we have,
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:22.720]   for the people we have in our life,
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:28.680]   for school, for work, for family, for friends,
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:33.040]   and brother and sister in Christ, for our church.
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:35.920]   We complain too often.
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:40.040]   We come before you with a list of needs
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:44.240]   as if we are lacking in our life.
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:48.240]   Father, forgive us.
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:51.040]   And again, we kneel our mind,
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:54.000]   and we cultivate that spirit of thankfulness.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.800]   As we think about this whole year coming to the end,
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:00.440]   no matter if it was a good time
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:03.800]   or there were ups and downs,
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:05.640]   hills and valleys,
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:10.280]   we come before you and give you thanks.
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:12.120]   Thank you for being our God.
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:14.120]   Thank you for loving us in Jesus Christ.
[00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:19.040]   In your name, O the Son, we pray, amen.
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.600]   All right, off we go.
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.480]   We are going to the luncheon, all right?
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:26.760]   So be thankful, all right?
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:29.680]   So say hi to one another before we depart, okay?
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:31.880]   I wanna see you next week, next Sunday.
[00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:33.760]   Let's worship and serve God together.
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:43.760]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
