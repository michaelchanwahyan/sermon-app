1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,680
 Good morning family and welcome.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:07,480
 I'm really excited that we're opening God's Word again together this morning.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,280
 And this morning we're going to start looking at something new, a new study here for the

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,720
 next few weeks, and that is really looking at biblical examples of our response to God's

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:23,080
 goodness, our response as the people of God to God's goodness and God's work in our lives.

6
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,040
 And specifically this morning we're going to be focusing on gratefulness and on seeking

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,640
 to begin to have an attitude of gratefulness towards God.

8
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,280
 So I know this is going to be really good for me.

9
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,680
 Gratefulness is something that I always struggle with and something I need to focus on more.

10
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,680
 So I'm excited.

11
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,480
 I think it's going to be good for me and I pray that it'll be really good and encouraging

12
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,160
 for you as well.

13
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,840
 We're going to be looking in Exodus chapter 15 this morning.

14
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:55,600
 And Exodus chapter 15 is this song that's often called the Song of Moses and it's the

15
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:02,960
 song that the children of Israel composed basically extemporaneously on the spot, spontaneously,

16
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:09,500
 this song of praise and gratefulness to God just after they came through the Red Sea.

17
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:14,440
 So if you're not real familiar with this story, I'll kind of give a quick narrative of it,

18
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:19,960
 but you could look at these chapters in Exodus for yourself, especially chapter 14, which

19
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,000
 tells the story of the Red Sea.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,760
 But the preceding chapters in the book of Exodus are the story of the children of Israel

21
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,960
 being delivered by God from the land of Egypt.

22
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:36,280
 And if you remember that story, the children of Israel, the Hebrew people, the Jewish nation

23
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,400
 are in Egypt.

24
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:45,320
 They've been there for generations and over time, what was originally a friendly relationship

25
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,920
 with the Egyptians has become an oppressive one.

26
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,880
 And so Pharaoh has enslaved the Hebrew people.

27
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:59,120
 And so they're slaves in Egypt and they're forced to do really hard labor to build for

28
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,400
 the Egyptians.

29
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:05,000
 And also Pharaoh decides that he doesn't want their strength to grow, doesn't want their

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 nation to grow.

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,960
 And so he begins to kill their sons.

32
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,960
 And so it's a really, really terrible, oppressive situation, the children of Israel, the Hebrew

33
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,400
 people are in.

34
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:21,320
 They're God's people, but they're in a place of deep oppression and deep pain and deep

35
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:27,220
 hurt because they're enslaved and they're being treated unjustly in so many ways.

36
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:31,320
 And eventually God raises up Moses to be a deliverer to them.

37
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:36,320
 Moses goes and speaks to Pharaoh and tells Pharaoh that God wants Pharaoh to let his

38
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,880
 people go.

39
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,200
 And Pharaoh resists and says no.

40
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:46,840
 And so then Moses brings the plagues into Egypt, really God brings them into Egypt,

41
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:52,120
 but Moses is the messenger that continues to speak to Pharaoh and to the Egyptian leaders

42
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:57,760
 to tell them that God is bringing these plagues as a result of their rebellion against God

43
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,800
 and the fact that they won't let his people go.

44
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,440
 And so all these plagues come against Egypt.

45
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,640
 And again, if you're familiar with that story, you know what those are.

46
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,800
 If not, you can look at it and read it.

47
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,320
 But God does all these supernatural things basically.

48
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:15,720
 Some of them are very fearful and terrifying, but he does them to show the Egyptians his

49
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:22,160
 own power and to force Pharaoh to let the Hebrew nation go free.

50
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:28,520
 And so finally after the tenth plague, Pharaoh decides to let the Hebrews go and the entire

51
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,480
 Hebrew nation leaves Egypt and they go out into the wilderness.

52
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,480
 Well Pharaoh quickly changes his mind and says let's go get them.

53
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:44,320
 And at this time in world history, the Egyptian nation was really an empire, really a dynasty,

54
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:49,080
 and it was the most powerful empire on the face of the earth and they had the most powerful

55
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,080
 and fearsome army.

56
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:56,920
 And so Pharaoh says we are going to go and get the Hebrews and bring them back and put

57
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,000
 them back to work and enslave them once again for us.

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,640
 And he takes his enormous army to go get them.

59
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,960
 And as I said, this was the most fearsome army in the world and they had the best technology.

60
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:12,840
 They had chariots and other weapons of warfare that were the most advanced technological

61
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,400
 weapons that existed in the world at that time.

62
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:23,680
 And so this was a very scary army and by now the Israelites had journeyed down close to

63
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,040
 the Red Sea and that's where they were when the army of Pharaoh caught up with them.

64
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,640
 And God was leading them in a pillar of fire by night and a pillar of cloud by the day.

65
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:39,200
 So they are literally relying on God day by day for guidance and for leadership and for

66
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,480
 provision.

67
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,680
 Moses is leading them as a representative between the people and God, but God himself

68
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,920
 is leading them and protecting them.

69
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:51,600
 But when Pharaoh's giant army comes up behind them, they are terrified because they find

70
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:59,000
 themselves closed in with the sea on one side and this massive fearsome army with all of

71
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,720
 these weapons of warfare on the other.

72
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,920
 And they are afraid that they are just going to be destroyed and eradicated and killed

73
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,240
 and it seems like there is no way out.

74
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,120
 So they cry out to God for deliverance.

75
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:17,080
 God puts the thick cloud between his people and Pharaoh's army to keep Pharaoh's army

76
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:23,480
 away and then God begins to roll back the waters of the Red Sea.

77
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,000
 And as I said, this story is in Exodus 14.

78
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,200
 If you'd like to look at it, it's a really good story.

79
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,920
 God moves back the water so much that there are basically walls of water on each side

80
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:40,200
 with dry land in the middle and the Hebrew nation are able to walk across on dry land.

81
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,680
 And this is a large group of people by now.

82
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,560
 The Hebrew nation has grown very large and very strong during this time in Egypt and

83
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,980
 so it's a huge group of people.

84
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:51,920
 God holds back the waters long enough for them to get all the way across.

85
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,320
 It probably took all night for them to cross.

86
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:00,280
 And then God removes the cloud and the army of Pharaoh sees that the people are gone and

87
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:05,480
 sees the dry land in the middle of the sea and sees that they've been able to get out

88
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,440
 and decides, "Hey, we're going to pursue them."

89
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:13,040
 And begins to pursue and God lets back the water and the waters come rushing back in

90
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,040
 and destroy the army of Pharaoh.

91
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:22,320
 And so God in one miraculous event, he delivers his people and he destroys the enemy that

92
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,320
 are seeking to harm them and to kill them.

93
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:31,360
 So this is an absolutely amazing and miraculous event in the history of God's people.

94
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,040
 And immediately after this, when they're safe on the other side of the Red Sea, they begin

95
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,720
 to sing this song of praise.

96
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,460
 It's found in Exodus chapter 15.

97
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,460
 So let's read some of it.

98
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,880
 We're going to read the first 13 verses.

99
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,600
 It says this, "Then Moses and the people of Israel sang this song to the Lord, saying,

100
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,260
 'I will sing to the Lord, for he has triumphed gloriously.

101
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,960
 The horse and his rider he has thrown into the sea.

102
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,940
 The Lord is my strength and my song, and he has become my salvation.

103
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:02,920
 This is my God, and I will praise him, my Father's God, and I will exalt him.

104
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,200
 The Lord is a man of war.

105
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,720
 The Lord is his name.

106
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:11,040
 Pharaoh's chariots and his host he cast into the sea, and his chosen officers were sunk

107
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,260
 in the Red Sea.

108
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,360
 The floods covered them.

109
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,940
 They went down into the depths like a stone.

110
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:20,820
 Your right hand, O Lord, glorious in power, your right hand, O Lord, shatters the enemy.

111
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:24,400
 In the greatness of your majesty you overthrow your adversaries.

112
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,900
 You send out your fury.

113
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,680
 It consumes them like stubble.

114
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,580
 At the blast of your nostrils the waters piled up.

115
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,380
 The floods stood up in a heap.

116
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,960
 The deeps congealed in the heart of the sea.

117
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,820
 The enemy said, 'I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil.

118
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,860
 My desire shall have its fill of them.

119
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,140
 I will draw my sword.

120
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,420
 My hand shall destroy them.'

121
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,300
 You blew with your wind.

122
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,380
 The sea covered them.

123
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,660
 They sank like lead in the mighty waters.

124
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,860
 Who is like you, O Lord, among the gods?

125
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:57,020
 Who is like you, majestic in holiness, awesome in glorious deeds, doing wonders?

126
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,540
 You stretched out your right hand.

127
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,020
 The earth swallowed them.

128
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:04,220
 You have led in your steadfast love the people whom you have redeemed.

129
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:09,900
 You have guided them by your strength to your holy abode."

130
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:16,020
 And I think there's just so much powerful truth in this passage for us about how to

131
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:23,060
 be grateful and how to learn to celebrate and reflect on and appreciate the goodness

132
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,260
 of God in our lives.

133
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:31,420
 The first thing I want us to see here is that when we experience God's goodness in our life,

134
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:36,700
 when we go through something that causes us to reflect on God's goodness, we first of

135
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:40,220
 all need to really place our focus on God.

136
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,900
 I love that about this song.

137
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:46,900
 This is the song, like I said, it's often called the song of Moses, but this song doesn't

138
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,900
 talk about Moses at all.

139
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,860
 It doesn't talk about the Hebrew nation at all, really.

140
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:56,020
 I mean, it does some as their relationship to God, as the people of God, but it doesn't

141
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,700
 talk about them and their strength in any way.

142
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:02,780
 It just talks about God and how powerful He is.

143
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:08,100
 The focus in this is clearly on God because of the things that He has done.

144
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:13,540
 And I think that's a really instructive thought for us when we go through things in our life.

145
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:18,540
 A lot of times when something good happens and we experience God's goodness in some way,

146
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:23,620
 we begin to credit ourselves and we think, "Yeah, this happened because I did a great

147
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,620
 job.

148
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,620
 I figured something out.

149
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,620
 I tried harder.

150
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,620
 I worked harder.

151
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:30,220
 I am smarter than other people."

152
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:34,020
 We begin to credit ourselves or maybe we credit other humans around us and say, "Well, it

153
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:39,340
 happened because this person that's my friend or my family member or this person that I'm

154
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:43,380
 associated with in some way, they're really good at this."

155
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,100
 And that is true.

156
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,260
 God gifts us and He gifts the people around us.

157
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:53,820
 And it's certainly good for us to lift up the people around us and encourage them and

158
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,980
 cite their roles in any success that we might have.

159
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:01,380
 But we have to be honest and begin to credit God.

160
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:06,540
 In these verses you see again and again it talks about who is the strength in the song.

161
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,700
 That's the Lord.

162
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,300
 Who is the one who is worthy of praise?

163
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,300
 That's God.

164
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,300
 Who's the one who has triumphed?

165
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,520
 It's the Lord.

166
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:16,100
 Who is glorious in power and defeats the enemy?

167
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,700
 That's God and His right hand.

168
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:22,260
 The focus is clearly on God.

169
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:26,700
 And so many times when something good happens, when we get that promotion that we've been

170
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:33,260
 praying for, we do well in school and we finally graduate, or we get that degree that we've

171
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:38,620
 been working for for so long, or we graduate high school, or we get a new place to live,

172
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:43,340
 a new apartment or a new house, or we get a new car, you know, all those things that

173
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:46,420
 we pray and ask God for and we desire.

174
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:49,420
 And then God brings those things into our life.

175
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:54,620
 And then suddenly we just think that we did it ourselves and we forget to credit God and

176
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:59,300
 to begin to praise Him and to begin to focus on Him.

177
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:03,620
 And you know, what's even more sad than that is oftentimes good things happen and we simply

178
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,140
 don't consider God at all.

179
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,020
 Sometimes we just take things for granted.

180
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:11,340
 Like it's just a coincidence that something happened in our life.

181
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:15,380
 Like it's just a coincidence that that relationship in our life was restored.

182
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:20,340
 It's just a coincidence that our health was preserved in some way.

183
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:23,100
 We just act like all those things are coincidences.

184
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,940
 I think it's pretty clear when you look at Scripture and the way God cares for His people

185
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,420
 that that's not the case.

186
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:32,260
 God is at work and He is doing good things for His people.

187
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,700
 And so we need to recognize that.

188
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:38,340
 And we shouldn't just assume that everything's a coincidence or that it just worked out that

189
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:41,820
 way because, you know, we're a little bit better, a little bit smarter than someone

190
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,820
 else.

191
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:48,140
 We should say, "Hey, this good thing that happened in my life, this is because of God.

192
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,140
 And I believe that."

193
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,860
 Especially if it's something that we prayed and asked God for.

194
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:56,420
 How self-absorbed are we if we pray and ask God for something and then He provides it

195
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:00,740
 in our life and we turn around and never say thank you and we just act like, "Yeah, this

196
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:06,500
 was supposed to happen anyway," or, "I expected this because I'm so great."

197
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,620
 And we never give the credit that is due to God.

198
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:13,460
 We've got to learn to begin to do that more and more in our lives.

199
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:17,060
 And we've got to learn to just start to pay attention to God's work.

200
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:20,140
 Sometimes we're just ignorant of the fact that God is at work.

201
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:23,660
 We don't even see it because we're just not paying attention.

202
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:29,140
 Or sometimes even worse, we have an attitude of entitlement and maybe God does something

203
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:33,420
 really good in our lives and we just say, "Well, yeah, of course that's supposed to

204
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,420
 happen.

205
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,980
 You know, it's supposed to work out that way for me because I'm a good guy.

206
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:41,140
 I worked hard for this or this is what I deserve.

207
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,100
 And so of course I was going to get that."

208
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:48,180
 And again, in all those different ways and circumstances, we forget to focus on God.

209
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,500
 We forget to give Him credit for what He's doing.

210
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:55,100
 We forget to praise Him and to thank Him for all of the good things that He does in our

211
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,100
 life.

212
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:00,020
 And you know, another important thing that's really essential for us to do in order to

213
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:05,940
 be grateful is to begin to place our focus on God's work and on what God is doing in

214
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,180
 our lives.

215
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:11,860
 And this is huge, especially in the midst of times of life where we may not readily

216
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,020
 see the goodness of God.

217
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:17,980
 I understand that sometimes we say, "All right, I have no problem praising God and

218
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:21,900
 thanking God when God does something good in my life and when I can readily see God's

219
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,900
 goodness."

220
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:27,380
 And some of those examples I just gave and the last point are more examples of times

221
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,140
 that we can readily see God's goodness.

222
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:33,940
 When we get a promotion or we get a new car or when we graduate, it's a lot easier for

223
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,640
 all of us to say, "Wow, this is cool.

224
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,640
 This is good.

225
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,160
 I'm so grateful to God," when something is going well in our life.

226
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,760
 But the reality is even when things don't feel like they're going well in our life,

227
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:50,180
 God is at work and God is always at work for His glory and for our good in so many different

228
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,180
 ways.

229
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:56,460
 And so we've got to learn in all circumstances of life, especially those difficult circumstances,

230
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:02,040
 those trials, those challenges, those difficulties, we've got to learn to put our focus on God's

231
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,440
 work and to say, "What is God doing here?"

232
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:08,440
 And there are things going on in my life right now, even though it may not feel great, there

233
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:13,000
 are things going on that God is using and God is working and God is doing something

234
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,180
 and I can be grateful for that, even if the circumstance that I'm in the midst of doesn't

235
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,460
 feel great to me right now.

236
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,960
 We've got to put our focus on God's work.

237
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:28,520
 You know, we can do that by beginning to seek out areas of God's goodness in our lives.

238
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:32,880
 I think we see this in the passage that we read here in Exodus 15.

239
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,360
 Look at these verses where it talks about what God is doing.

240
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:41,840
 It's talking about how God is, verse 7, God is overthrowing the adversaries and verse

241
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:48,200
 8, it talks about God standing the waters up and in a heap, piling the waters up.

242
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:52,700
 And verse 9, it says, "The enemy said, 'I will pursue, I will overtake.'"

243
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:57,520
 This is not just some overly rosy picture of the goodness of God that just says, "Yeah,

244
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:01,120
 we were walking through the park and everything was great and everything was fantastic, so

245
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,840
 we're going to praise God."

246
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,560
 This passage is saying, "No, we thought we were going to die.

247
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,440
 The enemy was pursuing us and about to overtake us, and the enemy was saying that they were

248
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:17,360
 going to kill us with their sword and take the spoil, and that we were going to be destroyed."

249
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,380
 This passage makes it clear that this was a dark, challenging time.

250
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:26,120
 This was a time of real difficulty in the life of God's people.

251
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,260
 But even in the midst of that, God was at work.

252
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:35,040
 And so we can find those times and those places in our life where God is at work, even when

253
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,040
 it's challenging.

254
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,400
 We may have to search for it a little bit.

255
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,400
 We may have to seek it out and say, "Okay, the circumstances are tough right now, but

256
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,080
 I believe God is at work, and I'm going to look for the areas where God is at work in

257
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,080
 my life."

258
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:51,560
 And if we'll begin to seek those out, we will begin to find areas that God is working and

259
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,140
 we can begin to praise God for.

260
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:58,080
 Even when we're experiencing those trials and difficulties, we can be grateful.

261
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:02,000
 We can be grateful for God's presence.

262
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,680
 I've been through some difficult times in my life.

263
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:09,560
 My wife and I have been through some very difficult circumstances, and the loss of family

264
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:13,000
 members and different things that we've walked through, different challenges that we've walked

265
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,040
 through.

266
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:18,240
 And I can tell you, honestly, there's been a lot of times in the midst of those experiences

267
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,880
 where it didn't feel great to me, or it didn't feel great to my wife.

268
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,840
 And where we've gone through those times of saying, "Wow, this does not feel good right

269
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,840
 now."

270
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,760
 There have been times when we've said, "You know, pretty much none of what we're going

271
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,120
 through right now feels good.

272
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,760
 Nothing feels good right now."

273
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:39,000
 But even in those moments, we can be grateful for the presence of God and for the nearness

274
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 of God.

275
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,960
 And we can say, "You know what?

276
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:47,360
 Even though nothing feels good right now, and I'm discouraged, and I'm experiencing

277
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,240
 loss, and I'm experiencing grief, and I'm experiencing all of these challenging things,

278
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,600
 I'm so grateful that God is with me in this grief.

279
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,760
 I'm so grateful that God is with me in this loss.

280
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:03,440
 I'm so grateful that God is with me in this discouragement, in this setback, in this challenge."

281
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:09,880
 Because if God was not here, I would be completely alone, and I would be completely in the dark

282
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,040
 and lost on my own.

283
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:16,720
 So even if we're in the toughest moments of our life, and nothing feels good, and everything

284
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,400
 seems to be going wrong, I get it.

285
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,400
 That happens.

286
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,680
 That's real.

287
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:26,840
 And even in those moments, we can be grateful for the nearness of God, the presence of God

288
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,800
 that is with us, that sustains us.

289
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:34,440
 We can be grateful for God's people, even in those challenging times.

290
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,880
 God put us in this family called the church, and one of the things that we're supposed

291
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,360
 to do is love one another and care for one another, support each other, encourage one

292
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,080
 another, and hopefully we're doing that for each other.

293
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,840
 Hopefully there are people in your life who love you and who care for you and support

294
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,840
 you when you go through challenges, and you can be grateful for that.

295
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,440
 You can say, "God, I'm grateful for the people you've put in my life.

296
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:00,960
 Even during a time of illness or during a time of grief, I'm grateful that these people

297
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,960
 are here.

298
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:06,080
 I'm grateful that you're using them to encourage me and to build me up."

299
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,920
 We can be grateful for God's sanctifying work in our life.

300
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:15,280
 That word "sanctification" is just a church word that means that God is purifying us.

301
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,520
 He's changing us and making us more like Jesus.

302
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,920
 He's taking away some of those things, those impurities, those things that are not healthy

303
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,800
 for us, those bad habits, that selfishness.

304
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:29,520
 He's slowly taking that stuff out of our heart and out of our life and slowly turning us

305
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:34,440
 more and more like Jesus so that we can begin to truly love others and truly be unselfish

306
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,480
 and truly be focused on the right things in life.

307
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:45,400
 The honest reality is in my life and I think in the lives of most believers, that sanctifying

308
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,920
 process works best when we're going through some suffering.

309
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:56,000
 It's hard for us on a bright sunny day when everything is going our way to be unselfish

310
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,280
 and to be humble and to really care for others and to really focus on God because everything's

311
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,280
 great.

312
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:06,480
 But when we're going through something difficult, suddenly it's so much easier for us to see

313
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:12,320
 our need for God and to focus on Him and to be humble and to love and care for others.

314
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:17,480
 That sanctifying process a lot of times works best in times of struggle and in times of

315
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,080
 suffering and in times of trial.

316
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,280
 We can be thankful for that.

317
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,460
 When we're going through something difficult, we can say, "You know what?

318
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:29,520
 This doesn't feel good and I don't love being in this moment, but God, I'm so grateful that

319
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,640
 You're using it to work in me to make me more like Jesus, to strip away some of that unhealthy

320
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,080
 stuff, some of that stuff that causes me to be focused on myself, some of that stuff that

321
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:43,360
 causes me to be self-destructive in the choices I make or causes me to make choices that harm

322
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,360
 the people around me.

323
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:49,480
 God, I'm so grateful that You're changing me and taking that away and making me more

324
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,480
 like Christ."

325
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,200
 Because if you're going through a challenge, if you're going through a trial, if you're

326
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,280
 going through a difficulty and you're a follower of Jesus, then I guarantee you that God is

327
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:02,960
 using it in your life to try to get you closer to Him because that's what God does.

328
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,740
 We can be grateful for that sanctification that happens in difficult moments.

329
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,480
 We can be grateful for God's strength and grace.

330
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,320
 I don't know if you've ever gone through something challenging that you look back on and say,

331
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,160
 "I don't know how I got through that.

332
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,480
 I've had experiences like that."

333
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,880
 And the truth is that God gives supernatural strength and grace to His people when we go

334
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,440
 through really difficult times of challenge and of grief and when we're stretched to the

335
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,000
 limit and we just feel like, "I don't even know if I can make it."

336
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,800
 God is there with us in those moments and He carries us and He gives us strength and

337
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,920
 grace.

338
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,200
 And we can be grateful for that.

339
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,360
 We can say, "You know what?

340
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:44,620
 The challenge I'm encountering right now doesn't feel fantastic, but God is getting me through

341
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:48,520
 and I'm thankful for the strength and the grace that He's giving me, He's sustaining

342
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,520
 me with."

343
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,500
 And we can be grateful for that growth.

344
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:57,820
 God uses challenges and trials and afflictions to change us and to grow us.

345
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:03,300
 Just like you won't strengthen your muscles, your physical muscles, without kind of stretching

346
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,240
 them and straining them a little bit.

347
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:09,400
 That's literally what we do when we go work out at the gym or we work out hard in any

348
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:14,800
 other way, is we stretch and strain our muscles a little bit so that they'll become stronger.

349
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,480
 And God does the same thing with us spiritually.

350
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:21,080
 A lot of times He has to take us through something that stretches us and strains us a little

351
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:26,520
 bit in order to strengthen us so that we can grow and be stronger than we were before.

352
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,440
 And we can praise God for that.

353
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:32,720
 Even in a tough time, we can say, "God, I thank You and praise You that You stretched

354
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,800
 me, that You strained me, and that You're growing me."

355
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:38,920
 The next thing that I think is really important to help us begin to practice gratefulness

356
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:44,880
 in our response to God's work in our lives is to intentionally celebrate God's goodness.

357
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,920
 When God does something good and we begin to notice that, we begin to see God's work

358
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:54,840
 in our life, and we begin to see God's goodness in that work when we say, "Okay, I see God

359
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,400
 at work, even in my difficulties.

360
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,280
 And I'm paying attention and I've searched out for God's goodness.

361
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:04,480
 And I do see it, even in this difficult time, I can still see how God's working."

362
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,280
 Or maybe in this really good time, I can see how God's working.

363
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:12,240
 God blessed me and He brought this wonderful thing into my life, and I see God's goodness

364
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,240
 there.

365
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:19,520
 Once we see it, and once we see how God is working, we should begin to intentionally

366
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,720
 celebrate it and to say, "You know what?

367
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,920
 I'm not just going to notice it, I'm going to celebrate it.

368
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:30,160
 I'm going to begin to thank and praise God for His goodness."

369
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,520
 And you might say, "Well, what does that look like?

370
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,440
 What does it look like to thank and praise God for His goodness?"

371
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,520
 Exactly what it sounds like.

372
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,360
 You begin to thank God.

373
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,680
 You can thank God in your prayers, silently.

374
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:44,520
 You can thank God verbally and say, "God, I thank you for what you're doing in my life.

375
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,800
 God, I thank you for the way you've saved me, for the way you're changing me, for the

376
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,680
 way that you're growing me into a new creature in Christ.

377
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,560
 God, I thank you for the blessings that you've given me.

378
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:58,680
 I thank you for my family, for my community, for my church, for all these different things."

379
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,940
 That's what it sounds like, thanking God.

380
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:05,880
 And obviously we know that the church has a long and beautiful tradition of praising

381
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:11,800
 God in song, just like here in Exodus 15, where we lift our voices in song to thank

382
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,840
 God, to praise Him, to exalt Him, to talk about how good He is, how great He is, and

383
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,420
 how grateful we are for what He does in our lives.

384
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:23,120
 And that's a beautiful way to praise God, is to praise God in song.

385
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,720
 You can do that by yourself.

386
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,760
 You can do that in a church service with other believers.

387
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,800
 You can do it when you're driving in the car or when you're in the shower.

388
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,280
 You can sing anywhere and thank and praise God.

389
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:38,520
 And that's a good way to intentionally begin to celebrate God's goodness in your life.

390
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,240
 And so I hope that you're doing that.

391
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:46,680
 But you can also take a break from the busyness of life to celebrate and reflect and praise.

392
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,800
 And I think this is really important.

393
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,500
 Sometimes we do see God's goodness and we say, "Okay, that's something I know I need

394
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,940
 to praise God for."

395
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:57,920
 But our life is so busy that we just kind of go on by, and then a week and a month later,

396
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:01,720
 we've kind of forgotten about the good thing that God did.

397
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:06,240
 And we see this example throughout Scripture, and we see it clearly in the Old Testament.

398
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,960
 We see it clearly here in Exodus 15.

399
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:14,840
 They got a cross and they were safe, and the people who were trying to kill them were destroyed.

400
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,040
 They could no longer chase after them.

401
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:21,200
 And they didn't just say, "All right, on to the promised land, on to the next thing.

402
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,440
 Let's get to the next spot."

403
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,760
 They said, "No, we're going to stop.

404
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:28,880
 We're going to take a break, and we're going to sing and dance here on the shoreline and

405
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,520
 praise God for what He's done and for how He delivered us and for His goodness that's

406
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,920
 been at work in our lives."

407
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,560
 And like I said, we see that throughout the Old Testament.

408
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:41,600
 God clearly tells His people so many times to do that.

409
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,120
 I think we need to practice that.

410
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:48,640
 As modern believers, especially in the U.S., that is not something we practice well.

411
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,260
 Our lives are so busy, and it's all we can do just to find some time to get to church

412
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:56,200
 and to sing two or three songs.

413
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:01,360
 But we don't take breaks from the busyness of life to just praise God, to just reflect

414
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,920
 on how good He's been and to just thank Him for it.

415
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,920
 And we need to do that.

416
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,320
 And that's something we should practice.

417
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:11,480
 If you're a single person, you should practice that and say, "Hey, I'm going to take a break

418
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:17,680
 from my work schedule, from my friend relationships, so that I can just reflect on God's goodness

419
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,560
 and begin to praise Him for it."

420
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,760
 And you can do that with other people.

421
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,660
 You can do it with friends.

422
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,840
 You can do it in the company of others.

423
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,040
 But take a break.

424
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:30,800
 If you're a married person, especially if you have children, say, "Hey, we as a family,

425
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,360
 we're going to take a break because God did something big in our lives, and we want to

426
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,440
 stop and we want to celebrate it.

427
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,720
 Maybe it's just for a few hours.

428
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,760
 It's a special dinner.

429
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,520
 Maybe it's a half day or a day off."

430
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,320
 But take a break from the busyness of life and say, "You know what?

431
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,520
 I'm going to celebrate what God has done.

432
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,520
 I'm going to reflect on it.

433
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,520
 I'm going to think about it.

434
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,640
 I'm going to consider how good God has been in my life.

435
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,900
 And I'm going to talk about it.

436
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,360
 I'm going to praise Him.

437
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,920
 I'm going to thank Him for what He's done in my life."

438
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:05,720
 And you know, God has given us so many things in our life that sadly a lot of times, like

439
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,960
 I said, either we take for granted or we're just not grateful for.

440
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,400
 And all of us have things to thank God for.

441
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,960
 You may say, "Well, you know, life's been tough, and there's some things going on in

442
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,680
 my life that are challenging right now.

443
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,660
 And so it's hard for me to feel like praising God."

444
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:25,280
 But the reality is all of us have things that we can praise God for.

445
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:28,520
 So I want to think about a few of those things as we close out and just give us some reasons

446
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,840
 that we can praise God.

447
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:34,820
 You know, God has given all of us as humans special talents and gifts and abilities.

448
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:37,940
 And we can thank and praise God for those things.

449
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:40,400
 You have special talents and gifts and abilities.

450
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,440
 Maybe they're artistic.

451
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,680
 Maybe they're creative.

452
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,680
 Maybe they're music.

453
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,680
 Maybe they're analytical.

454
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,980
 Maybe they're scientific.

455
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:49,020
 Maybe they're kind of interpersonal.

456
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:52,560
 Maybe you're really good at relating to other people or you have a great sense of humor.

457
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:56,600
 Whatever those things are, you can thank and praise God for those.

458
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:01,960
 And it's easy for all of us to look at the talents and gifts that other people have and

459
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:06,320
 feel like we wish we were someone else and we wish we had their talents and forget about

460
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,320
 the beautiful talents and gifts that God has given us.

461
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:14,160
 So you can and should praise God for who He made you to be and all the talents and gifts

462
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,560
 that He's poured into your life.

463
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:19,220
 Another thing that all of us can praise God for right now is some of the freedoms that

464
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,860
 we enjoy in our country.

465
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:21,920
 Today is July 4th.

466
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:25,740
 It's a day that we celebrate the beginning of our country.

467
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:30,660
 And we can all thank and praise God for the freedoms that we enjoy in the United States.

468
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:34,380
 Obviously, our country is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination.

469
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,100
 There's still a lot of problems and a long way to go.

470
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:42,660
 But we do have a lot of freedoms here and people have a lot of good blessings in our

471
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,660
 nation.

472
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:46,500
 And I think that's something that we can praise God for and be grateful for.

473
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,540
 And we should praise God and be grateful for.

474
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:54,340
 We can be grateful for COVID-19 being on the decline here.

475
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,820
 I think that's something huge.

476
00:27:55,820 --> 00:28:00,380
 As I talked about earlier, there's so many things we take for granted that God does.

477
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:04,740
 And I think it's easy for us to forget that a year ago and a year and a half ago, we were

478
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:11,180
 really worried about this illness and that we were praying and crying out to God for

479
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:16,140
 deliverance that God would deliver us and deliver our families and deliver our communities.

480
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:19,620
 And God has answered those prayers in many ways.

481
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:23,020
 And I don't say that to diminish the fact that there's still sick people.

482
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,020
 I understand that.

483
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,620
 And we need to continue to pray for those people.

484
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:29,620
 And especially in other parts of the world where there's still higher levels of disease,

485
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:33,020
 we need to be praying for those places desperately.

486
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:39,500
 But we can also celebrate and thank God that He's brought about so much deliverance from

487
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:43,540
 this pandemic and that a lot of things are reopening and people are healthy and so many

488
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:47,460
 people have been able to take the vaccine and there's much less disease and much less

489
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,460
 death.

490
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,940
 Hey, we prayed and we asked for that.

491
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,060
 And God has answered that prayer.

492
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,620
 And we need to give credit to God.

493
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,820
 Obviously, God used a lot of humans to do that.

494
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:57,820
 And that's fine.

495
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:58,820
 We should thank them too.

496
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:03,980
 But we need to give credit to God and we need to praise Him for deliverance from this pandemic.

497
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:08,820
 Just like the children of Israel in Exodus here, we're praising God for deliverance from

498
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,560
 a fearful moment.

499
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,820
 We can praise God for deliverance from a fearful moment.

500
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,860
 We can praise God for the beautiful summer weather.

501
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:18,580
 I hope you've been enjoying the weather lately and getting outside.

502
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,620
 And that's something we can praise God for.

503
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:25,100
 We can praise God for the simple things like the fact that He gives us food and shelter

504
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:29,260
 and clothing and meets those basic daily needs in our life.

505
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:34,580
 We can thank God for a lot of other beautiful things that He pours into our life that are

506
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,500
 so enriching.

507
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:41,820
 We can thank God for life itself and for the beauty of being able to be alive and for the

508
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,140
 health that He gives us.

509
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,980
 We shouldn't take that for granted.

510
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:50,620
 The fact that God wakes us up every day and that we have a measure of health.

511
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:54,420
 Some of us may feel healthier than others, but all of us have some measure of health

512
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,540
 that God gives us.

513
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:59,180
 As long as we're here alive on this earth, we have some measure of health.

514
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,280
 And we should be thankful for that.

515
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:06,620
 We should be thankful for the beauty of family and of love and of relationships with other

516
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,780
 human beings that God has given us.

517
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:14,020
 That is something that enriches our life in an unspeakable way and something that is just

518
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:17,140
 so amazing to experience.

519
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:19,860
 And it's hard for us to describe.

520
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:23,180
 I can't describe the beauty of that as I speak about it right now.

521
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:28,660
 What the beauty of the relationships in my life, my marriage, my relationship to my wife,

522
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:32,980
 our relationship to our children and the love that we have for them and so many other friends

523
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:37,640
 and family members that we enjoy a relationship with.

524
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,640
 That's a beautiful thing.

525
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,500
 We can thank God for that.

526
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:44,540
 We can thank God for the community of the church that we spoke about earlier, that community

527
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:49,020
 of His people that He's placed us in where we love each other and care for each other.

528
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,740
 That's a beautiful thing.

529
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,020
 And we can thank God for that.

530
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,100
 We can thank God for the beauty of nature.

531
00:30:54,100 --> 00:31:00,380
 I am amazed by the beauty of nature and by the diversity and the creativity that is displayed

532
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:03,540
 and just all of the beautiful things God has made.

533
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,780
 I love to see it.

534
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:05,780
 I love the mountains.

535
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:09,300
 I love the ocean and kind of everything in between.

536
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:13,020
 And it just fills me with a sense of awe and gratefulness to God.

537
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:16,820
 I love to look up in the night sky and see the stars and just be filled with that sense

538
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:19,020
 of awe and gratefulness to God.

539
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:22,020
 God has put so much beauty in our world.

540
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,020
 And He didn't have to.

541
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:26,860
 He made it all gray and beige and really boring.

542
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:27,860
 But He didn't.

543
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,700
 He made it beautiful and amazing.

544
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,180
 And I'm so grateful for that.

545
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:36,180
 And we see so many beautiful things, even that God allows us as humans to make.

546
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:40,660
 We see artistry and creativity that humans express themselves.

547
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:42,380
 We can be grateful for that.

548
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:44,860
 We can be grateful for the beauty that we see.

549
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:49,460
 We can be grateful for culture and food and all the simple pleasures of life, sitting

550
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:55,220
 down with our family to enjoy a meal or to do something that is fun or listening to someone

551
00:31:55,220 --> 00:32:01,860
 tell a really good story or something that just causes us to laugh watching a child play

552
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:02,860
 or something like that.

553
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:07,060
 Those are all beautiful things that we should be grateful to God for.

554
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:14,180
 He's poured so many blessings into our lives, even in the small moments of life.

555
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:17,820
 And we often miss them because we're focused on what we don't have.

556
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,620
 We're focused on what we want.

557
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:24,060
 And we don't see all of the goodness that God has already put in our lives.

558
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:29,100
 And we should certainly be grateful for God's love for us and the way He loves every one

559
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:32,860
 of us made in His image and the way He sent Jesus to die for us.

560
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:37,940
 The salvation, the grace and mercy and forgiveness that God has extended to us, that because

561
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:41,060
 of Jesus we can be forgiven, we can be made clean.

562
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:44,300
 All the mistakes we've made can be forgotten and put behind us.

563
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:47,660
 Wow, that is something to praise God for.

564
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,460
 That's something to be thankful for.

565
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:56,020
 We can praise God for the rest of our lives and into eternity just for that alone.

566
00:32:56,020 --> 00:33:01,020
 There is so much to be thankful for in God's love for us and in the salvation that He's

567
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,540
 extended to us.

568
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:08,380
 We can be thankful for the nearness of God, as we spoke about earlier, in those trials

569
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:13,060
 and those difficulties that God is always present with us, even when life is challenging.

570
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:16,540
 And one of the things we can be thankful for is God's truth.

571
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:19,460
 You know, we just spent a year studying through the Sermon on the Mount and the values of

572
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,700
 the kingdom.

573
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,780
 I am so grateful for the values of the kingdom.

574
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:27,300
 I'm so grateful that God revealed His truth to us.

575
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:31,900
 Without it we would be lost and we'd be fumbling around in the dark and hurting ourselves and

576
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,140
 hurting everyone else.

577
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:38,140
 I'm so grateful for God's truth and that He's expressed it to us and He's told us how we

578
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:42,620
 can live and please Him and be in right relationship with Him and right relationship with others.

579
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:45,980
 I am so grateful for that.

580
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:49,620
 The point is, there are so many things that all of us can be grateful for.

581
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:53,420
 Even if in the moment things don't feel good and we think, "I don't know how much to be

582
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:55,420
 grateful for," we do.

583
00:33:55,420 --> 00:34:01,620
 And we've got to learn to begin to live out gratefulness and to practice it in our lives.

584
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:06,500
 This is a great start to begin by placing our focus on God, placing our focus on the

585
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:10,860
 work that He's doing in our lives and all the good things that He's doing, and being

586
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:16,500
 intentional about celebrating God's work and God's goodness in our lives, stopping our

587
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:20,740
 lives, taking a break from the business just to reflect and just to praise and to thank

588
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:22,980
 God for who He is.

589
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,380
 Let's pray.

590
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:29,260
 God, I thank You right now for Your goodness and Your greatness in our lives, God.

591
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:33,180
 You are so great and You're so powerful and so amazing.

592
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:37,380
 And we see that so clearly when we look at the world and we see the amazing beauty of

593
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:42,980
 nature, but we see it so clearly when we look at each other and see the amazing intricacy

594
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:49,100
 of the human life, not just of our human body, but of the human soul and our emotions and

595
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:52,300
 all of the depth and the layers of that, God.

596
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,660
 It's mind-blowing.

597
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:56,180
 That's such a beautiful thing, God.

598
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:59,620
 You are so great and so powerful to make all of that.

599
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:04,860
 And yet You are also so good and You love us and You've extended us forgiveness and

600
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:11,300
 salvation and You've sent Your Son incarnated into this world so that we could have relationship

601
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:17,220
 with You and You've taken on our flesh and gotten on our level and come into our world

602
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:21,580
 so that we can know You because You are so good, God.

603
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,900
 God, we praise You for that.

604
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,180
 We lift You up.

605
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:27,080
 We thank You, God.

606
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,260
 We haven't done anything.

607
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,540
 It's all You, God.

608
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:32,420
 And there is no one like You.

609
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:34,980
 There is no one like You in all of the universe, God.

610
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:38,540
 And we just want to profess and proclaim that today.

611
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:44,220
 And God, I pray that You'd help us to begin to reflect on and understand that and to think

612
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:49,260
 about it every day, to not take Your goodness for granted, but every day to be grateful

613
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:52,740
 and to be thankful and to intentionally celebrate how good You are, God.

614
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,740
 In Jesus' name, amen.

615
00:35:54,740 --> 00:36:04,740
