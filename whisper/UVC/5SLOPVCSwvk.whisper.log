[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   [no audio]
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   Well, good morning. I just want to start by saying how grateful I am to be here
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   and how grateful I am to you all for having me and my family here.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   We love Urban Voice and love the time that we've spent here, and being here today is really special for us.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   It feels like a little reunion seeing a lot of good friends again, so it's a blessing.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   And this time of year is a special time of year, time of year that I enjoy when we celebrate Christmas.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   I enjoy the get-togethers like today, the food, the decorations, all of those things.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   I even like the Christmas movies, all the good ones and the cheesy ones that are on TV all the time this year.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   But this morning I want us to think a little bit about the meaning of Christmas and what the heart of the meaning is.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Because Christmas is much more than just the gifts and the decorations and the lights and the time with family and friends.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Those things are wonderful, but the meaning is deeper than that.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   So let's look at a few verses in the book of Luke, chapter 2.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   We're going to read verses 8 to 14.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   These verses come from right after the birth of Jesus.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Jesus has just been born in Bethlehem in the stable.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   And the Bible tells us that there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   But the angel said to them, "Do not be afraid.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Today, in the town of David, a Savior has been born to you.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   He is Christ, the Lord.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   This will be a sign to you.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Suddenly, a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Praising God and saying, "Glory to God in the highest."
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   And on earth, peace to men, among whom his favor rests.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Now these verses tell us that the birth of Jesus was good news, really good news.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   In fact, verse 10 specifically tells us it was good news of great joy to all people.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   But why? Why was it such good news?
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Why was this such a special event?
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   To begin to answer that question,
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   we have to zoom out a little bit and consider the place of the Christmas story in human history.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   The Bible details to us God's work throughout history.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   And although the Bible contains many different stories,
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   it's really one big story.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   One grand narrative that runs from beginning to end.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   It has a lot of different climatic moments.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   And the Christmas story is a climatic moment in the Bible.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   But it's not the beginning of the story.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   And it's not the end of the story either.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   To start to grasp the importance of the birth of Jesus,
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   we need to go back to the beginning of the story
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   when God began to work with humans.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   The story of the Bible begins with the act of creation.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Now before creation there was God.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   The scripture tells us that he has always existed.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   He has no beginning or end. He is uncreated. He has always been.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   Earth did have a beginning and so did we.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   God spoke the earth into existence.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   He created out of nothing from the force of his power and wisdom.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   And he made everything on the earth including us.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   God created us and made us uniquely in his image.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   Nothing else that he made was made in his image.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   Humans are very special in that regard.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Now being made in his image means many beautiful things for us.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   But one thing that it means is that we are relational
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   beings.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   God created us for relationship.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   He created us for a right and healthy relationship to him.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   And for right and healthy relationships with one another.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   But not long after the moment of creation,
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   there was a problem.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   And it was us.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   See, we as humans have always thought we're a little bit smarter than God.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   And that we could really improve on the world he made if only we were in charge.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   And the very first man and woman decided they didn't want to let God be in control.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   They didn't want to follow his instructions.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   They felt like they could do better making their own choices.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   And so they chose to reject God.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   And to reject his instructions for life.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   And that was the first broken relationship.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   The first breakup that happened.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   And it wasn't God, it was us.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   We're the ones who said, "God, it's not me, it's you. It's your fault."
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   "I want to go my own way and do things on my own."
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   And ever since that moment throughout time,
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   all of us have made that same choice.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   All of us at some point have chosen to reject God.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   And to pursue our own comfort and our own ideas and what seems best to us.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   And that has led to all of the pain and the heartache of the human condition.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   Instead of choosing right relationship with God and each other,
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   we choose to please ourselves.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   And out of this comes selfishness,
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   and greed and lust and oppression, hatred, wars, jealousy, racism, lies, betrayal, theft,
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   the list goes on and on, all these things.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   And the reality is there's not any one of us who hasn't done that.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   Everyone in this room has at some point acted selfishly.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   Or done something to hurt another human.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   We've all done that, I certainly have.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   All of us have sinned and fallen short of what God wants us to be.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   But there's a glimmer of hope here.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   And that is that God wasn't okay with a broken relationship.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   God didn't want to leave it that way.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   So God had a plan from the very beginning.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   His plan was to restore and heal our relationship.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   To make things right.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   And to make a way for us to be forgiven.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   God's plan was to send us something.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   Or rather someone.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   God didn't choose to send us a letter or a text or a voicemail.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   Not an email or a DM or any other kind of message.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   God sent his only son.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   And that's who Jesus was.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   The son of God sent on a rescue mission.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   To heal and restore and ultimately save us.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   That's why in verse 10 the angel says the birth of Jesus is good news of great joy.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   Jesus was the first gift of the first Christmas.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   And God gave this gift to all of us.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   Every human that has ever lived or ever will live on the earth.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   God gave us this gift of his son.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   And through his son.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   The gift of relationship with our creator.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   But how is it that Jesus could rescue us?
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   And what was it about his birth that was so different than all the other births?
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   The Bible tells us that Jesus was and is someone very special.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   Because he was the son of God.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   He was fully God.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   And yet also fully human.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   The book of John chapter 1 tells us that Jesus is the word of God made flesh.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   The revealing of all that God is.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   That means all of God's justice, God's love, God's peace, and infinitely more than that
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   brought together into human flesh.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   Full of grace and truth.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   Jesus was Emmanuel.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   God with us.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   Notice in verse 14, the original language doesn't just communicate peace to us.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   It communicates peace among us.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   Jesus was the manifestation of God.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   Not just to show us who God is.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   But to be with us.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   To live among us.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   And to make us able to live with God.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   Jesus left the comfort of heaven to do this.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   He made himself subject to all the limitations and brokenness of humanity.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   So that he could rescue us.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   Because he was human.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   Jesus dealt with every struggle that we deal with.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   He became tired.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   He experienced hunger.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   He got cold.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   All of those things that happened to us.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   He was also tempted to reject God and sin just like we are.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   He was tempted to be angry.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   To be selfish.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   To lust.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   To seek revenge on those who had wronged him.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   He was tempted to be greedy and pursue his own comfort.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   He was tempted to be lazy and to be fearful and to give in to his fears.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   He was tempted to be consumed with anxiety and to be stressed and worried.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   All the things that challenge us and hurt us.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   He dealt with those same things.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   But in all those temptations he didn't sin.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   He didn't give in to any of those things.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   He loved and served and healed those that he met here on earth.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   And at the end of his life, he gave himself as a sacrifice for us.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   He died on a cross.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   Murdered in a way that he never deserved.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   So that he could win life for us.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   In a way that we never deserved.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   He traded his perfection for our brokenness.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   So that through him, we might find perfection and have our brokenness restored.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   His death in our place gave us an opportunity to know our creator.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   But he didn't stay dead.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   After three days he was gloriously resurrected.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   And he defeated death once for all.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   He opened a doorway to freedom.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   From sin and death.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   He opened a doorway to relationship with our creator.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   And he opened a doorway to heaven and eternal life for those who believe in him.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   That's why his birth was good news.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   It was the beginning of God's great rescue plan to restore us.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   The arrival of Jesus was the first step in our healing.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   And that brings us to another unique and powerful truth about the birth of Jesus.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   And that is the intentional nature of Jesus stepping into our world.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   He did it on purpose.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   Have you ever thought about the fact that Jesus actually chose where he would be born?
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   He's the only person in history who's been able to do that.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   If you could go back and choose your birth,
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   your family, where you would be born,
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   maybe there's something that you would change.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   But Jesus did have the opportunity to choose.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   He could have been born anywhere to any parents.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   But he chose to be born to an unknown, poor, and hard-working couple
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   from a tiny, struggling town in an oppressed country.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   When Jesus was born,
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   Rome ruled his homeland.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   A Caesar sat at the pinnacle of human power in Europe.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   And the Han Dynasty sat at the pinnacle of human power in Asia.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   There were kings throughout the world.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   Influential families,
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   wealthy clans,
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   people with palaces and grand estates.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   And riches and servants and animals.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   But Jesus didn't choose to be born there.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   He didn't choose to be born in a capital city.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   Or in a palace.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   He chose to be born in a country that was suffering under heavy oppression.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   He was born in a small town so full of travelers,
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   that his parents couldn't even find a decent room.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   He was born in a place where animals were kept.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   And his first bed was literally a feeding trough.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   This shows us clearly that Jesus
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   purposely entered into our brokenness.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   He didn't just barely approach us and hold his nose to get away from the stench.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   He didn't just come around the corners of our brokenness and mostly avoid it.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   He dove straight into the middle of our human mess.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   He saw us at our very worst.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   And he loved us there.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   And he knowingly walked straight into all of our chaos.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   And that's good news.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   That is such good news.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   Because we humans are still a mess.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   Our lives are still full of brokenness and chaos.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   We have struggle and hurt and pain.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   But Jesus showed us beyond a shadow of a doubt
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   that our brokenness doesn't keep him away.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   He's here to fix the worst that we could have to offer.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   There's nothing too broken that he can't fix.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   There's nothing or no one too dirty that he can't cleanse.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   There's no pain or hurt too deep that he can't heal.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   And there's nothing so dark that he cannot forgive it.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   And that is good news.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   News of great joy to all people.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   That's why the birth of Jesus was such a big deal.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   That's why heaven was celebrating that night.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   Stars were moving in the heavens.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   Angels were singing.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   That's why we still celebrate.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   Over 2,000 years later,
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   we still talk about that night and we sing about it.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   Because of what it meant.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   Jesus stepped into our brokenness to bring healing.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   Now there are just three points of application
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   I want us to think about as we close.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   First of all, perhaps there are some people here today
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   who don't have relationship with Jesus.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   Maybe you've never heard much of this story before.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   Maybe you always thought Christmas was just about Santa
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   and presents and ugly sweaters.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   [Laughter]
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   Maybe even Christmas is a difficult time for you,
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   something that you don't really like.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   That's okay.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   Maybe your life is messy.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   The good news for you
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   is that's why Jesus came.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   If you're experiencing brokenness
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   if there's difficulty in your relationship with family and friends
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   or in your marriage or your job
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   or your emotional or mental health
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   or your finances or you're trapped in some type of addiction or pain
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   the good news for you
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   is that Jesus has chosen to show up
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   right where you are
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   in the middle of all the pain and brokenness
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   and there's nothing he can't fix.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   If you're willing to believe on him
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   and follow him
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   then he'll begin to heal your mess
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   and bring you back into that healthy and right relationship with God
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   that you were created for.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   This is the good news for you.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   Jesus has seen you at your worst
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   and loved you.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   Call out to him for help
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   and if you're open to relationship with him
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   he's waiting with open arms for you.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   Second
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   maybe you're here today and you already have relationship with Jesus
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   maybe you've had that relationship for a short time or a long time
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   but there's still some mess in your life
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   just because we're a Christian, a follower of Jesus
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   doesn't mean everything is easy
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   we still struggle
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   and have pain and hurt
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   the good news for you
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   is that the same Jesus who saved you
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   wants to be at work in your life right now
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   redeeming the mess
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   fixing those broken things
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   healing you
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   turning the ashes of your failure and my failure into the beauties of his grace
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   if you're in that position this morning
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   maybe you're trying to hide some of those messy corners of your life in your heart
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   from Jesus
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   but if you're burdened and struggling
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   cast your cares on him
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   surrender to his work in your life
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   and ask him for healing
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   open every door of your heart to him
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   and invite him into those places of hurt and brokenness
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   and see what miracles he can work
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   with your heart and with your life
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   the third thing I want us to consider
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   is if you are a person who's a follower of Jesus
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   then I want to remind you
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   that Jesus has given us an example to follow
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   he left a place
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   of perfect comfort
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   and peace
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   and tranquility
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   to come here
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   to come to this
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   our brokenness
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   and he did it out of love
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   as his followers
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   he's called us to do the same
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   to carry his love
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   into the messy places around us
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   into the messy lives around us
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   into the places that are broken and chaotic and hurting
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   Jesus calls us to follow him in this way
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   he calls us
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   to help others
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   come into that right and healthy relationship with God
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   and that's also good news for us
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   as his followers
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   not only has he given us right relationship to God
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   but he's given us purpose
