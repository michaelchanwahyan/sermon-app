1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
 from the word of God.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,400
 - Thank you, James, thank you.

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,440
 Well, as you can see, I'm ready to fly,

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,480
 and the plane going to Israel for me

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,520
 is around five o'clock, I guess.

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,120
 I haven't checked, but we'll be there.

7
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,040
 And there was a connecting flight in Vienna,

8
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:22,920
 and we're gonna stay there, lay over for three, four hours,

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,880
 play some music in Vienna,

10
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,820
 and we're ready to go to Tel Aviv, all right?

11
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,840
 So yeah, thank you for praying for us,

12
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,060
 and I wanna say a note of thanks to the church

13
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,720
 and the leaders and the pastoral staff, especially,

14
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,320
 because all of the things that they are doing,

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,000
 trying to fill the gap while I'm gone,

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,160
 and it's very helpful,

17
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,320
 so that I can be sent to go to Israel

18
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,280
 to lead a group of people.

19
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,040
 And this round, we have 27 people in total.

20
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:00,040
 Only 10 people are from our church,

21
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:04,720
 and all the rest of the 17 are from Hong Kong, Canada,

22
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,380
 a lot of different places, yeah.

23
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,340
 Actually, a few of them already arrived,

24
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,000
 so thank God, all right?

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,680
 Thank God they already arrived safely, all right?

26
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,040
 I just got a text not too long ago.

27
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,000
 One of our members forgot to bring her credit card,

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,120
 and she had to go back home and grab the credit card

29
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,720
 before going to the airport.

30
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,040
 Yeah, that is very important.

31
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,960
 Trust me, going to Israel, you only need two things.

32
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,880
 One is the valid passport, US passport,

33
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,560
 valid US passport or visa,

34
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,800
 and second thing is a credit card, all right?

35
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,760
 That's all you need, all right?

36
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,200
 You don't have to bring anything, just two things, right?

37
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,240
 Just a passport and a valid credit card,

38
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,280
 and then you'll be good, yeah.

39
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,600
 And yeah, I'm looking forward to this trip,

40
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,920
 and by the way, I'm not a tour guide.

41
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,160
 I don't charge, I don't get any tips, you know?

42
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,120
 I don't live off--

43
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,720
 - You should.

44
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,560
 - I should, right?

45
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,480
 I should, yeah, I should, I know, but I don't take it.

46
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,320
 I don't take it.

47
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,160
 I do it for, you know, as a service,

48
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:11,040
 as a teaching service to other people.

49
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,080
 So God has blessed us with some resources,

50
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,600
 and we can share with some other sisters and brothers

51
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,040
 in Christ, some other people who are interested.

52
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,120
 In fact, this round, we have 27 people.

53
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,200
 One person is a non-Christian,

54
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,200
 and he's just interested to go to Israel, right?

55
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,740
 Who's not interested to go to Israel, right?

56
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,720
 Yeah, it's exotic, exotic place, yeah, exotic place.

57
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,480
 Yeah, it's gonna have a lot of fun.

58
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,680
 I'm gonna buy you something, okay?

59
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,920
 I'm gonna buy you some ajava hand cream, okay?

60
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,160
 So you come back Tuesdays, I'll have a big bottle

61
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,160
 of ajava dead sea, dead sea extract hand cream, all right?

62
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,200
 How about that?

63
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,120
 Anyone?

64
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,920
 No, you don't want it?

65
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,120
 Do you want it or not?

66
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,560
 All right, all right, okay, I'll bring you something.

67
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,120
 I'll bring you something, all right?

68
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,520
 I'll bring you something we can share, okay?

69
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,440
 Lotion is welcome, all right?

70
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:11,120
 Anyways, I may bring you a bottle of water,

71
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,080
 you know, holy water from Jordan River.

72
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,400
 How about that?

73
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,560
 So yeah, right?

74
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,760
 And we can take that in the chameleon, right?

75
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,960
 Everyone can take a sip.

76
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,240
 It's good for your health, yeah.

77
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:30,200
 Anyways, we'll continue with our topic on worship.

78
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,040
 We talked a little bit about worship last week

79
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,040
 when Brenda was here, Sun Music was here.

80
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,600
 And I think it's appropriate to continue to think

81
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,720
 about what worship is all about.

82
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,720
 And I think in our generation, worship is a lost art.

83
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,640
 You know, if you think about it,

84
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,520
 when you come to church to worship,

85
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,440
 when you come to worship today,

86
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,840
 what did you do to prepare yourself?

87
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,000
 What did you do to prepare yourself to worship?

88
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,060
 All right, talk to your neighbor.

89
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,600
 How did you prepare for today's worship?

90
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,000
 What did you do?

91
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,840
 What did you do?

92
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,240
 What did you do?

93
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,800
 What exactly did you do, you know, okay?

94
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:23,520
 Maybe a cup of coffee,

95
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,520
 maybe, did you brush your teeth?

96
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,760
 Yes, I hope so.

97
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:33,000
 You change, and you walk into a place of worship,

98
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,120
 and you wanna offer praises to God.

99
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,500
 And as I said, worship is a lost art today.

100
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,940
 We take things for granted.

101
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,800
 We often approach worship with a mindset

102
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,120
 that we don't need to prepare.

103
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,400
 There's nothing for us to do

104
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,580
 to prepare ourselves to worship.

105
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,080
 When we think of preparation,

106
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,320
 we think of someone else is doing the preparation, right?

107
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,080
 The worship band, the worship people,

108
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,620
 they gotta prepare, right?

109
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,300
 Did they practice?

110
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,760
 Well, you can tell, right?

111
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,220
 They did practice, right?

112
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,160
 Couple days ago, they practiced here,

113
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,960
 and that's why we have a worship set, right?

114
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,280
 And in the backstage, they got the lyrics on,

115
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,800
 they got the cameras on, they got everything,

116
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,800
 PowerPoint and stuff like that,

117
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,880
 and the temperature of the room is just

118
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,680
 to a comfort of my level.

119
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,780
 There are many things we can think about,

120
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,320
 preparation of worship, but so often,

121
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,240
 we shift the focus to someone else

122
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,120
 doing the preparation for us.

123
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,940
 And for us to come to worship,

124
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,940
 we often think that we don't need to do anything to worship.

125
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:43,280
 You need to understand, some of the ancient architecture,

126
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,280
 when the ancient people, they built a temple,

127
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,800
 a place of worship, a sacred place, or ancient church,

128
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,440
 they always have stairs going up to a temple

129
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,400
 or a church building.

130
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,440
 And so often, you realize the architecture

131
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,780
 is a little interesting, because the steps going up

132
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,000
 to the place of worship, the sacred place,

133
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,720
 is often uneven steps, some longer, some shorter,

134
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,080
 and then some longer, some shorter.

135
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,440
 What are they trying to do?

136
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,960
 They're actually trying to design the building

137
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,120
 in such a way that when people, worshipers,

138
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,000
 approach the sacred place, they will approach

139
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,980
 with care and slowly.

140
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:32,360
 And that's why the steps are uneven at times.

141
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,120
 Those are called processional steps.

142
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,660
 So you have to be careful.

143
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,920
 Not every step is even.

144
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:44,360
 And you have to take care when you go up to the temple

145
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,960
 or go up to a sacred place.

146
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,400
 It's a matter of preparation.

147
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:54,600
 I have been to Israel so many times, since 2008.

148
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,280
 Sometimes I go there two times a year,

149
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,600
 sometimes once a year.

150
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:04,280
 I was fascinated by another culture,

151
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,480
 not so Western culture,

152
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,280
 how they approach this sort of sacred place,

153
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,040
 worship place.

154
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,680
 I remember one time, I was, a couple years ago,

155
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,680
 before the pandemic, I took a sabbatical

156
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,400
 a couple weeks off from the church,

157
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,840
 and I went with my wife to Israel,

158
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,600
 and we were on the Temple Mount.

159
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,080
 You know the Temple Mount, the golden thing?

160
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,080
 The golden dome?

161
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,920
 The golden dome?

162
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,760
 Yeah, the Temple Mount.

163
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,840
 So we went up to the Temple Mount,

164
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,080
 and then, of course, it's a beautiful place, right?

165
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,180
 And then we were trying to take pictures,

166
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,640
 and my wife was next to me,

167
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,540
 and I put my hand on her shoulder,

168
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,240
 and then trying to take a selfie, right?

169
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,960
 And then the security guard hit my hand.

170
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,500
 And say, "You don't do this here."

171
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,340
 I said, "What?"

172
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:06,980
 He said, "You don't display affection or intimacy

173
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,260
 "on the Temple Mount."

174
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,660
 I said, "What?"

175
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,540
 You know, I've never been to Israel.

176
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:15,460
 It was our first time going together as a couple, right?

177
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,540
 I've never been to a person I can put my hand around, right?

178
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,340
 So I just want to seize the moment, right?

179
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:24,340
 So I just take a selfie, and hit my hand really hard,

180
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:28,300
 and then say, "Give me your camera, or give me your phone.

181
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,240
 "Delete that picture.

182
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,980
 "Delete it right here, delete the picture."

183
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:32,820
 I said, "What?

184
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,880
 "Okay, don't shoot me, all right?

185
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,900
 (audience laughing)

186
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,480
 "I'll delete that picture.

187
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,500
 "Too bad, right?"

188
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,540
 And there was another time,

189
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:42,420
 you know, I was doing some YouTube video and all that.

190
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:43,700
 I'm doing my selfie, right?

191
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,740
 I have my selfie stick,

192
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:48,020
 and just outside of an ancient church building,

193
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,580
 I'm trying to record what this is,

194
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,660
 and give a short introduction,

195
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,940
 and then slowly I walk from outside

196
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:58,540
 into the ancient church building.

197
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:01,980
 I walk in, and it was so quiet, because no one was there.

198
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:06,240
 And I keep filming, you know, the ceiling,

199
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,020
 and all the side wall, and the church environment.

200
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:15,260
 And then a monk came after me and hit my head.

201
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,340
 (audience laughing)

202
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,940
 Hit my head right here.

203
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,140
 I said, "What is going on?"

204
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:24,540
 He said, "You don't wear hat in the church, all right?

205
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,360
 "You take off your hat."

206
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,860
 I said, "Okay, man, what's the big deal, right?"

207
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,740
 It's very interesting, right?

208
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,460
 You go to a Christian church in Israel,

209
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:37,900
 you take off your hat,

210
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,500
 but you go to a synagogue,

211
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,720
 or Jewish, like Western Wall, Jewish sacred place,

212
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,420
 you have to put on your hat, or a kippur, right?

213
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,020
 The kippur, the Jewish, right?

214
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,000
 The Jewish man.

215
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,940
 You know, my point is,

216
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,660
 I'm just fascinated by, in other culture,

217
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:01,660
 how they prepare themselves to worship, right?

218
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,100
 Now, of course, this sort of things,

219
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:07,980
 we modern people, or Western people,

220
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,820
 we try to laugh at, right?

221
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,100
 "What's the big deal, right?

222
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:11,940
 "What's the big deal?

223
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,400
 "I can wear a tank top, right?

224
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,440
 "To the church, right?

225
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,280
 "Yeah, right?

226
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,640
 "It's democracy.

227
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,140
 "It's freedom."

228
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,420
 No, you don't do that, right?

229
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:26,420
 So, as I prepare the people, 27 of us, to go to Israel,

230
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:29,380
 we had some Zoom online sessions

231
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,900
 to prepare ourselves to go.

232
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:36,860
 And one of the most frequent asked questions is,

233
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,260
 you know, what to wear, right?

234
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,700
 What to wear?

235
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,320
 You know, like this, what I'm wearing,

236
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:48,320
 I can go to anywhere, sacred place, synagogue, churches,

237
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,700
 any place, I can go, right?

238
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,980
 But you can't wear tank top.

239
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:57,980
 You can wear shorts, go into a church or a synagogue.

240
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,860
 So, it's a matter of preparation, right?

241
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,460
 Sometimes we've lost that.

242
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,820
 We lost that kind of, you know,

243
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:08,460
 the art of preparing ourselves to worship.

244
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,980
 Now, if you think about preparing for worship,

245
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:16,840
 preparing ourselves to go into the presence of God,

246
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,380
 there are many scriptures you can think of.

247
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,900
 Probably you can think of what Jesus said

248
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,100
 in Sermon on the Mount.

249
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,860
 In the sermon, Jesus said,

250
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:31,340
 "Before you offer sacrifice in the temple,

251
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:36,340
 "you have to be in a reconciling with your neighbors."

252
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,580
 Right?

253
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:40,140
 You gotta do something to prepare yourselves.

254
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,260
 And one of the things you need to do

255
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,980
 is to be at peace with your neighbors,

256
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,220
 as much as possible, right?

257
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,440
 As much as possible.

258
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:52,780
 The best of your ability to keep peace with other people

259
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:55,220
 before you approach God to worship.

260
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,780
 Now, one of the Psalms,

261
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,460
 there are 150 Psalms in the Book of Psalms.

262
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:05,300
 One of the Psalms that taught us about worship is 95.

263
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,140
 Okay?

264
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:06,960
 Psalm 95.

265
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,220
 It's equally divided.

266
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:13,260
 Very short, 11 verses, Psalm.

267
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:16,100
 First half, one to seven.

268
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,220
 First half right here.

269
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:21,080
 It's about who to worship and why we worship.

270
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:26,320
 And the second half is about the voice of God, right?

271
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,980
 Now, for worship song, it's very typical.

272
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:34,480
 It's very typical to begin with some call to worship.

273
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,800
 Call to worship.

274
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,420
 Now, what call to worship means

275
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:40,420
 is that some sort of phrases or some things

276
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:44,680
 that the Psalmist singing

277
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:49,440
 or calling attention to the people of worship.

278
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,020
 Call for attention.

279
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,960
 It says what?

280
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:59,420
 Come, let us sing to the Lord.

281
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,800
 Let us shout joyfully to the rock of our salvation.

282
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,800
 Let us come to Him with thanksgiving.

283
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,740
 Let us sing Psalms of praise to Him.

284
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,580
 Can you trace how many,

285
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:13,480
 can you point out how many verbs there are?

286
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,840
 Come, right?

287
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,700
 Literally it means walk, right?

288
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,080
 Walk, physically you walk.

289
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,120
 You move yourself to some place.

290
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,240
 And then singing, shouting, right?

291
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,240
 Shouting in both Psalms is often victory, war cry.

292
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,600
 Victory.

293
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,900
 God is the victory.

294
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,200
 God has won the war for us.

295
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,680
 And it requires you to have some energy, right?

296
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,680
 Shout, right?

297
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,660
 It's an active verb.

298
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:49,200
 It's the active things that we do.

299
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,280
 And the call to worship so often

300
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,360
 will tell us why do we worship.

301
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,800
 The reasons for worship.

302
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,360
 Why do we come here?

303
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,840
 Have you ever asked yourself this question?

304
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,080
 Why do we come here, right?

305
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:01,920
 Why do we come?

306
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,000
 It's more than a routine.

307
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,140
 It's more than a spiritual habit

308
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,360
 that all Christians should have.

309
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,920
 It's so much more than a ritual that we do.

310
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:17,540
 It says we worship God who is great.

311
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,440
 And in fact, the greatest.

312
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,720
 For the Lord is the great God,

313
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,680
 great King above all gods.

314
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,440
 He is the greatest.

315
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,740
 He holds in his hands the depths of the earth,

316
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:32,800
 the highest of the mountains,

317
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,480
 the mightiest mountains,

318
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,640
 and the sea belongs to him,

319
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,200
 for he created it.

320
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,200
 His hands formed the dry land too.

321
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,480
 The depths of the earth,

322
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,840
 the lowest part of the world,

323
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,520
 which is the Dead Sea, by the way,

324
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,560
 in the land of Israel.

325
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,940
 And then the highest of the height, right?

326
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:57,880
 The highest mountain.

327
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,920
 And then the sea.

328
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:03,540
 So he's trying to capture the entire cosmos,

329
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,640
 which is under the creative power of God.

330
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,800
 The sea, in an Eastern culture,

331
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,760
 Oriental culture,

332
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,360
 is the untamable forces.

333
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,040
 When you think of sea, the ocean,

334
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,980
 it's always unconquerable.

335
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,540
 It's untamable by man, right?

336
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:25,360
 A couple days ago,

337
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,200
 a deep sea research company

338
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:34,200
 produced a 3D scan of the Titanic, right?

339
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,580
 The unsinkable vessel.

340
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:41,900
 What year did it sink into the ocean?

341
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,460
 Atlantic?

342
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,380
 1912.

343
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:47,980
 That's like more than 100 years ago, right?

344
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:51,980
 So this event, this tragedy,

345
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:56,980
 has fascinated many people for so many years.

346
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:00,540
 And finally, we got some 3D scans.

347
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:05,540
 I think the company captured about 700 images

348
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,080
 from a deep sea scan.

349
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,140
 And it took about 200 hours

350
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:14,740
 for computer to compile them

351
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:19,140
 and create it into a 3D scan.

352
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,400
 That is the Titanic.

353
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,200
 1912, right?

354
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,460
 It's haunting images

355
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,780
 at the depth of the ocean.

356
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:32,300
 With today's modern technologies,

357
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:36,740
 we still feel that the sea, the ocean,

358
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,580
 is untamable, right?

359
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,260
 It's just haunting images, right?

360
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,180
 Yeah, can you,

361
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:46,740
 just can't imagine if you suffer

362
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:50,320
 from this sort of tragedy, right?

363
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,140
 Crazy.

364
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,260
 And this is a haunting image.

365
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:58,380
 So much more realistic than this,

366
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,240
 Jack and Rose, yeah.

367
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:06,300
 My point is, the creation is untamable, right?

368
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,820
 For even for modern culture,

369
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,900
 or for the culture of the Bible,

370
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:15,500
 the sea, the oceans, the highest of the mountain,

371
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,900
 the depths of the earth,

372
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,420
 we cannot conquer it,

373
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:23,820
 but God holds it in His power, right?

374
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,420
 God holds it in His power.

375
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:30,220
 All the forces that threaten our well-being

376
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,420
 is all under God's power.

377
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:35,940
 I attended a few funerals recently.

378
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:40,940
 One is younger than me.

379
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:43,500
 The other one is older than me.

380
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:48,820
 Even today, with our modern technology, right?

381
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,420
 Healing takes time,

382
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:53,300
 and sometimes it doesn't happen, right?

383
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,860
 No matter how much money you have,

384
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,860
 how much technology you have,

385
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:00,260
 no, we feel, we still feel,

386
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:03,660
 or we have to face the final enemy,

387
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,460
 the forces of death, right?

388
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:12,180
 But the Psalm says, "God holds everything in His power,

389
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:15,860
 "and He has power over you, power over me."

390
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:20,340
 The Psalm talks about the power of God, the Creator.

391
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:25,340
 And to many people, and to maybe your theology,

392
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,260
 your understanding of God,

393
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:30,300
 is that, okay, this powerful man is like some old guy,

394
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,940
 some old white guy out there, right?

395
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,220
 It's distant from us, it's like an absentee father.

396
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,340
 He created the world, boom, okay, it's right there,

397
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,660
 and that machine will continue to work

398
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,820
 according to His physical principles and all that.

399
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,660
 And then God, where is God?

400
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,340
 You know, God has nothing to do with us.

401
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:48,500
 You know, kind of deistic, you know, deism.

402
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,500
 It's not atheism, but deism, right?

403
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:56,740
 Some sort of deistic concept of God, and He's not here.

404
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,220
 But the Psalm says otherwise.

405
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:02,780
 The Psalm says God has everything to do with us.

406
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:07,140
 Listen to what the Psalm says, verse six and seven.

407
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,780
 "Come, let us worship and bow down.

408
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:14,780
 "Let us kneel before the Lord, our Creator, our Creator,

409
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,180
 "for He is our God."

410
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,180
 We have a relationship with Him.

411
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,740
 And we are the people He watches over.

412
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,800
 He takes care of us.

413
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:28,300
 We are like flock under His care, right?

414
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,900
 Notice how the verbs of worship going from action verbs,

415
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:36,140
 shouting, making praises, and dancing and all that,

416
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:40,340
 and finally come to stillness, bowing down,

417
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:44,580
 kneeling before Him, right, on our knees.

418
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:47,500
 Number seven is a familiar picture, right?

419
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:52,500
 God is His shepherd, and we are His flock, His sheep.

420
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:57,100
 Now, again, most of us, modern readers of the Bible,

421
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:00,980
 we don't know how to appreciate this kind of imagery.

422
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:03,860
 We always think of sheep and lambs, right?

423
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,460
 What do you think of?

424
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,700
 Food on the table, right?

425
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,660
 Cook and done well, right?

426
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:13,100
 Right, in a pot, and then we can consume it.

427
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,660
 You know, in the Oriental or Palestinian culture,

428
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:20,660
 or nomadic culture, you rarely sacrifice a lamb, right?

429
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:23,020
 Just like you don't sacrifice a dog, right?

430
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,140
 You don't.

431
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,580
 You pet it, you take care of it, right?

432
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:30,820
 They don't, they don't sacrifice a lamb.

433
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,580
 Very rarely that happens.

434
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:37,460
 Maybe once a year, in Passover, right, with deep meaning.

435
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:42,420
 To the first audience, to the Oriental people,

436
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:47,300
 shepherd and sheep, it's a tight relationship, right?

437
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:52,140
 Shepherd and the sheep, because the sheep listens

438
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:55,240
 to the voice of the shepherd only.

439
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,300
 No one other than the shepherd.

440
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:02,140
 There was a news story some years ago.

441
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:07,140
 The Israeli army took over or captured some Palestinian lands

442
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:12,140
 and then they raided and they got all the properties

443
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:17,620
 they seized them, and one of those is a huge flock

444
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:20,580
 of sheep, hundreds of sheep.

445
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:25,580
 So the Israeli soldiers put all the sheep into the ranch.

446
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:30,580
 And how many of them?

447
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:35,680
 200 or 300 sheep in one ranch.

448
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:40,420
 And then a certain Palestinian shepherd came

449
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:43,540
 to the Israeli army and asked the soldier

450
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:47,220
 who's guarding the door of the ranch,

451
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,180
 and the shepherd said, "Can I have my sheep back?"

452
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:54,420
 And the Israeli soldier, "How many sheep do you have?"

453
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:58,060
 And the shepherd said, "I have 20, 25, 25 sheep

454
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:00,980
 "in the ranch."

455
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:03,020
 And this Israeli soldier, a young soldier,

456
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:07,220
 laughed at the Palestinian old guy, the shepherd,

457
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,820
 and said, "Well, you can try.

458
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,780
 "There are 300 sheep here.

459
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,220
 "Go ahead and find your own sheep.

460
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,420
 "Everyone looks the same, right?"

461
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:17,580
 And the shepherd walks to the door

462
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,220
 at the entrance of the ranch,

463
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:23,020
 and he started to raise his voice.

464
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:26,740
 It's like, "Come, come, come."

465
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,980
 Something like, "Yalla, yalla," right?

466
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,260
 You know what yalla is?

467
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:33,460
 Yalla is hurry up, Arabic, yeah.

468
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,300
 Yalla, yalla.

469
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,940
 And then, three, four minutes later,

470
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:42,380
 25 sheep came to the door,

471
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:48,060
 and the shepherd said, "These are my sheep."

472
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,180
 It's very interesting.

473
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,100
 All the rest of the sheep,

474
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:53,540
 they're just doing their dumb things.

475
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,700
 They don't listen to the voice of this shepherd,

476
00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:00,380
 but this 20-some sheep followed the voice of the shepherd.

477
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,880
 It's a true story.

478
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,300
 (stammering)

479
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:08,600
 The sheep will listen to the voice of the shepherd.

480
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,560
 Remember Jesus said that, right, John 10?

481
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,600
 "I am the good shepherd,

482
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,520
 "and the sheep listens to my voice."

483
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:22,320
 And that's why this image of shepherd and sheep

484
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,200
 is a tight relationship.

485
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,600
 It's a relational metaphor,

486
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:30,000
 and that's why at the end of verse seven,

487
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,340
 it goes into another theme,

488
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:37,440
 not unrelated, it's actually very related,

489
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,640
 talking about the voice of God.

490
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,680
 If only you would listen to the voice of God,

491
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,940
 His voice today.

492
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:47,160
 The Lord says, "Do not harden your hearts

493
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,320
 "as Israel did at Meribah,

494
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:54,480
 "as they did at Masar in the wilderness.

495
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,640
 "For there your ancestors, your fathers,

496
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,960
 "tested me and tried my patience,

497
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,440
 "even though they saw everything I did.

498
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,880
 "For 40 years, for one entire generation,

499
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,560
 "I was angry with them,

500
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:11,360
 "and I said, 'They are a people whose hearts are hardened,

501
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,580
 "'turns away from me.

502
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:16,280
 "'They refuse to do what I tell them to do.'

503
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:19,440
 "So in my anger, I told and oath,

504
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,480
 "'They will never enter my place of rest.'"

505
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,760
 Now in the beginning, I said Psalm 95 had two parts, right?

506
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,560
 It's actually a pretty strange psalm, right?

507
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,120
 If you write a worship song today,

508
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,840
 you probably would end your song,

509
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,280
 like the chorus or the ending, on a positive note, right?

510
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:42,360
 You kind of wrap around, going back to, you know,

511
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:47,040
 what you call it, tonic, right?

512
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:50,780
 Yeah, you always end the song nicely.

513
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,240
 Psalm 95 doesn't do that.

514
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:57,200
 It opens with a joyful sound, making noises.

515
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,280
 "Come on, guys, make some noises, shout for joy

516
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,880
 "for our maker is here, we're gonna worship him."

517
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,760
 But then the second half, the ending,

518
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:08,920
 ends with a serious warning, a serious lesson, right?

519
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:15,400
 We often don't think a song is a good vehicle of education.

520
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:19,720
 We don't do that because a song

521
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,840
 usually is three, five minutes long, it's very short.

522
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,600
 But it can be a powerful vehicle

523
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,920
 for the message of God.

524
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,760
 When we think of the Old Testament stories,

525
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:34,560
 or the entire Old Testament scripture,

526
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,640
 39 books, if I asked you what stories

527
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:43,840
 would tell you the tension between God and Israel,

528
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:50,160
 what are some of the stories?

529
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,320
 The stories in the wilderness,

530
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,640
 when God saves his people by grace,

531
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,320
 out of the land of slavery, out of the land of Egypt,

532
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,600
 and he walked with them and led them

533
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,920
 through the wilderness for so many years,

534
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,920
 but after they came out of Egypt,

535
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,600
 they complained and they grumbled against God,

536
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,880
 and they distrust what God is doing.

537
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:13,960
 And God is patient, God is always long-suffering.

538
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,920
 Those are the stories you can think of.

539
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,840
 And in fact, that's what Psalm 95 does,

540
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:25,000
 to bring us back to the history of God's patience.

541
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,400
 Now, so often we read through the Bible,

542
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,720
 we always get the impression,

543
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,240
 "Okay, God is so mean, right?

544
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,920
 "How can you have so mean of God, right?

545
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,760
 "And he doesn't like the people,

546
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,200
 "he yelled at the people," and all that, right?

547
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,320
 But if we read scripture like that,

548
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:46,960
 I think we are doing some selective reading,

549
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,120
 selective understanding.

550
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,280
 If you read the Bible, at least the Old Testament,

551
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,680
 or maybe you add the New Testament,

552
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,800
 the entire Bible, 66 books,

553
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:59,640
 you realize that the story is not about God's wrath,

554
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:04,120
 it's about God's grace, how God is so patient

555
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,640
 with those who are rebellious.

556
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,560
 We rebel against him all the time,

557
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,120
 but God is always patient, right?

558
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,200
 And Moses is always the mediator between the two, right?

559
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,520
 And God is always faithful.

560
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,920
 And that's what Psalm 95 wants to get at.

561
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:28,160
 It is one of the best psalms on worship.

562
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:33,400
 The ending of Psalm 95 does not cater to our preference.

563
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:39,080
 We always think, "Okay, we come to the face of God,

564
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:42,040
 "we come to worship God in the presence of God."

565
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:45,480
 When we worship, yeah, it has to be,

566
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,120
 but you come out of it, you come out of worship

567
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,120
 feeling peaceful, right?

568
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:54,680
 Feeling a little bit comfortable, right?

569
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,600
 That is our misunderstanding.

570
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,800
 Sometimes the best worship is that we come before God

571
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,300
 and we are warned.

572
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:07,440
 We receive a serious warning to our lives.

573
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:12,400
 But we stop listening, then we'll go astray, right?

574
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,480
 And we'll end up in curses, in death,

575
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,760
 and separation from God.

576
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,840
 Psalm 95, second half, the last half,

577
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:26,760
 is telling you, you must direct your attention

578
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:32,120
 to the voice of God, because God is a speaking God.

579
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:36,600
 God still speaks, speaks to your heart through the spirit,

580
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:41,000
 and speaks to you in warning and in teaching.

581
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,840
 If we refuse to accept or listen to the voice of God,

582
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,960
 then we suffer the consequence.

583
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,680
 But God is always the gracious one.

584
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,680
 He wants us to listen, right?

585
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:58,840
 Sometimes the best worship doesn't cater to our preferences.

586
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:03,780
 It caters to God's preferences.

587
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:09,200
 That your attention is always on God and on God alone,

588
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,800
 nothing else.

589
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:15,520
 God is God speaking to you, and you are ready to listen.

590
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,480
 Now C.S. Lewis says something really interesting

591
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:21,040
 and fun to say about all things, about all things.

592
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:25,000
 I really started to enjoy his writings.

593
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,160
 He compares true worship with a pair of good shoes.

594
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,000
 A pair of good shoes.

595
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,800
 Let me give you that quote.

596
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,300
 He said, "A good pair of shoes

597
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,980
 "are the ones you don't notice.

598
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:46,520
 "The perfect church worship service

599
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,860
 "would be one we were almost unaware of.

600
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:54,740
 "Our attention would have been on God alone."

601
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:57,380
 That makes sense.

602
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:00,840
 You're wearing a good pair of shoes now.

603
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,840
 Do you pay attention to them?

604
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,120
 No.

605
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:08,640
 A good shoe will not get your attention, right?

606
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,320
 But it will carry you through, right, while you're walking.

607
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,880
 But you don't pay attention to them

608
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,960
 because you're unaware of the existence of shoes.

609
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,000
 A true worship is kind of like that.

610
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,840
 Unaware of everything else, right?

611
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:31,540
 But we are fully aware of the presence of God.

612
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:35,700
 So I invite you today to polish your craft of worship.

613
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:41,620
 Psalm 95 is not written to clergy.

614
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,620
 It's not written to the worship band.

615
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:47,140
 It's not written to those who are in charge of the worship,

616
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:50,220
 the worship personnel, the religious workers

617
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,900
 who prepare the worship service.

618
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:55,180
 It's written to all the people of God.

619
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,840
 It's written to you.

620
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:01,100
 How do you craft your art of worship

621
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:04,440
 so that your worship is pleasing to God?

622
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:09,940
 How do you prepare your heart, right?

623
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:12,780
 You know, the most terrible sins

624
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:16,820
 that the Israelites committed in the wilderness

625
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:19,260
 were not breaking any laws.

626
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,860
 They were not doing horrible crimes.

627
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,180
 Do you get that?

628
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:26,640
 They never do really horrible things.

629
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,680
 They were not criminals.

630
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:32,000
 The most horrible thing, the most terrible thing

631
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,300
 that the Israelites, the people of God did

632
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:39,280
 was being hard-hearted, not willing to listen.

633
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,640
 They're not willing to open their hearts.

634
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,800
 So how do you prepare your hearts?

635
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,040
 How do you prepare your art of worship?

636
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:49,040
 It's to pray.

637
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,080
 Sometimes a simple prayer,

638
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:54,840
 to pray that the Spirit will speak to you, right?

639
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,880
 Even for myself, sometimes I attend worship service.

640
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,540
 Someone else is speaking, right?

641
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:04,740
 I pray that God will speak to me, right?

642
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:10,800
 That I will have a softened heart to come before Him,

643
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,960
 to acknowledge, to be totally aware of His presence.

644
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,160
 Let's all pray together.

645
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,240
 And I ask the worship band to come back up here

646
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,480
 and sing our last song.

647
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,640
 And let the song be our worshipful response to God.

648
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,960
 And most importantly, as Psalm 95 says,

649
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,960
 come before God with listening ears.

650
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:39,960
 Let our heart be open to Him.

651
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,320
 Let's all pray.

652
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:44,080
 Father, we give You thanks for the fact

653
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,800
 that You are worthy of our worship.

654
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,760
 Yes, You are worthy, because You are our Creator,

655
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,840
 our Redeemer.

656
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:55,240
 We praise You, we make song, we shout.

657
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,840
 For You, and joyfully we do so,

658
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:03,440
 because You are worthy of our praises.

659
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:08,520
 And yes, we ask that Your Spirit will open our hearts,

660
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,760
 humble us, so that we'll listen to You.

661
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:18,000
 Thank You for being our God, for Your love, for Your grace.

662
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,580
 In Christ, we pray.

663
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,100
 (upbeat music)
