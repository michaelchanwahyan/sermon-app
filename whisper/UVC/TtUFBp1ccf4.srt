1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Hey everyone, how's it going?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 How's it going?

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Good?

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 Alright, why don't we say hi to our neighbors?

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 And I want to thank Patrick for doing the announcement.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 We want more people to be part of it.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 And let's go around, look around and see your neighbor and say hi, okay?

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 (Translated)

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 Okay, we'll give her a high five or something.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 (Translated)

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Okay.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 Alright, so good to see you all.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 And perhaps you have been to church for years, for many, many years,

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 and perhaps you are new to the church.

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 And from time to time we need to make sure we understand what church is all about.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 (Translated)

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 So last week I was in Toronto and Montreal for a few days.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 And I paid a ticket to visit a church.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 And this is a 200 years old church, and a historic church called the Church of Notre Dame in Montreal.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 And it was a beautiful church, beautiful.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 And it's just a wonderful place to be.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 And I spent some time there and I was totally taken by all the stained glass and Gothic style building.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 And it was a beautiful church.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 (Translated)

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 So, you know, as you can see, if I can do it on PowerPoint,

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 and I was in the church, in this church, and I spent some time there and I asked the question,

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 "What is a church?"

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 And what is the church all about?

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 And to many people, to many of us, sometimes we got messed up

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 because we, sometimes we believe that the church is a place that we go to.

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 And that's why I want to ask the question, you know, "What is the church?"

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 You know, even though there's some truth to we go to church today, but what is the church?

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 (Translated)

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 So, this is a beautiful church, right?

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 (Translated)

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 And, but, you know, there's also a huge misunderstanding what the church is all about.

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 And, you know, the Bible says the church is not a place, the church is not a building.

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 And we have to ask, "What is the church in the Bible?"

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 (Translated)

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 In fact, the church is us, the people, the people of God.

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 (Translated)

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 So today, in this message, I want to emphasize three basic points in this sermon.

43
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 And the three basic points is all about how do we become the church.

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 (Translated)

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 And the first point is we are all sinners.

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 (Translated)

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 And we have been reading the book of Acts this year,

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 and it's clear from the book that the church is not a group of perfect people.

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 (Translated)

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 And you remember in chapter 2 of the book of Acts, Peter preached the first sermon,

51
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 and he pointed out that we are all sinners, and we sin against God,

52
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 and Jesus died on the cross for our sins, and He rose from the dead for all of us.

53
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 (Translated)

54
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 And then the people listened to Peter's first sermon, and their hearts were cut,

55
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 and they felt that they need to respond, and they asked Peter what they should do.

56
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 (Translated)

57
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 And then, you know, the people were being said that, Peter said,

58
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 "Repent and be baptized, and every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for the forgiveness of sins, of your sins."

59
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 (Translated)

60
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 And these are very bold statements, okay? And they confront us with two statements of truth.

61
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 (Translated)

62
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 The first one is we are all sinners, and the second one is only Jesus can save us.

63
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 (Translated)

64
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 Now, you have to understand, the church, even our church, is not a museum of saints.

65
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 The church is home for real people, and we have real problems, okay? We have real brokenness.

66
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 And we're not here because we got it all together, but because we know we can.

67
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 (Translated)

68
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 Now, imagine a hospital. Imagine a hospital. Have you been to a hospital?

69
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 That might not be a good thing, but, you know, the hospital is full of sick people,

70
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 and they want to get well, but, you know, the hospital is not for healthy people.

71
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 The church is kind of like a hospital.

72
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 (Translated)

73
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 And we are all forgiven, and we are all healed by the grace of God,

74
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 because of what Jesus has done for us on the cross.

75
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 And the one, the one condemned on the cross, Jesus himself, should have been you and me,

76
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 because we are sinners.

77
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 (Translated)

78
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 And the good news is, God healed all of our sins on Jesus on the cross, and all of our sins are crucified.

79
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 (Translated)

80
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 Now, the Bible is really clear on this.

81
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 The Bible, God loves us and sends his son to die on the cross, so that your sins,

82
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 every bit of your sin, will be forgiven.

83
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 (Translated)

84
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 So, that's the first truth, is that we are all sinners, we are all broken people.

85
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 And the second is, we are saved by the grace of God.

86
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 (Translated)

87
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 And this second truth, we have to note that, you know, many people think that,

88
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 "Okay, only if we try, only if I try harder, if I do more good things than bad things, then I'll be okay."

89
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 (Translated)

90
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 Now, the truth is, you know, sin is not a scale of balance.

91
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 It's a debt that we cannot pay, and even one sin makes us guilty before a holy, sinless, holy, infinite God.

92
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 (Translated)

93
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 Now, imagine an ocean, okay, endless ocean.

94
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 And you are in the sea, and the waves are high, and the current is very, very strong.

95
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 And you have no strength left, and there's no land in sight.

96
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 You are right in the middle of the ocean, and you cannot swim back, and you cannot save yourself.

97
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 (Translated)

98
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 Now, in this kind of situation, what you need is someone else, someone else to rescue you.

99
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 Now, sin is like that. Sin is like an ocean. It's like an endless ocean.

100
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 It pulls us away from God, from the land.

101
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 And there's no amount of effort, good deeds, or good religion, or self-improvement can bring us back to the shore.

102
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 Now, without a rescuer, we will drown to death.

103
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 (Translated)

104
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 In the book of Romans, chapter 3 here, it says,

105
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 "This righteousness, the righteousness from God, comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe."

106
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 And there is no difference, for all of us have sinned, and we fall short of the glory of God.

107
00:09:49,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 (Translated)

108
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 Now, we often have a misunderstanding here. We always think that what the Bible is all about,

109
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 and we think that the Bible is to tell us to be a better person.

110
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 In fact, the Bible never does that. The Bible never tells you to become a better person.

111
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 The Bible is not a self-help moral book.

112
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 (Translated)

113
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 Okay, say it with me. The Bible is never a self-improvement book. All right?

114
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 The Bible is never a self-improvement book, so that we can do better,

115
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 and we can reach out to this holy and infinite God.

116
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 (Translated)

117
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 The Bible, though, tells us that we can never be good enough,

118
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 and we may be better than someone else.

119
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 You know, look around your neighbor, and you may be better than your neighbor in some sense.

120
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 The Bible never tells us that. Okay?

121
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 Or you may say, you know, look at that person, look at this person.

122
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 You know, he's worse than me, and I'm glad I'm better.

123
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 (Translated)

124
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 The fact is, the Bible tells us we are all sinners. We fall short of the glory of God.

125
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 And we don't stand righteous before God.

126
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 And we stand, all of us, we stand condemned in the presence of God.

127
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 (Translated)

128
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 Now, we can never be good enough to meet God's standard,

129
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 and we cannot be good enough to stand in front of God.

130
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 Now, that is true, and that is also bad news, right?

131
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 (Translated)

132
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 It seems like drowning in the ocean, and there's no land inside,

133
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 and you can't reach the shore on your own.

134
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 (Translated)

135
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 So we have to ask the question, what can we do as sinners in front of God?

136
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 What can we do when we cannot save ourselves?

137
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 (Translated)

138
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 Now, that's all the bad news, but the good news comes from the Bible.

139
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 It says, "God came to save us."

140
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 God came to save us. Not we can save ourselves, but God came to save us,

141
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 and we are all saved by the grace of God alone.

142
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 (Translated)

143
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 So the third point here is that only Jesus can save us.

144
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 (Translated)

145
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 Now, in chapter 4 of the book of Acts, if you remember, or if you go back and check,

146
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 the religious leaders in Jerusalem, they crucify Jesus on the cross,

147
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 and they confront Peter about Peter's right to preach the gospel.

148
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 (Translated)

149
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 And Peter responds by saying this verse in chapter 4, verse 12.

150
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 It says, "Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven

151
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 given to mankind by which we must be saved."

152
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 (Translated)

153
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 Now, why only Jesus can save?

154
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 (Translated)

155
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 Because Jesus is the only one who lives a perfect and sinless life.

156
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 (Translated)

157
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 And Jesus is the only one who died as a substitute for our sins.

158
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 (Translated)

159
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 And third, Jesus is the only one who rose from the dead and defeated death for all of us.

160
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 (Translated)

161
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 Think about it. You know, there's no, there's none.

162
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 There's no leader in the world, in history.

163
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 There's no political leader or no philosophy.

164
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 No self-effort can deal with our sin.

165
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 (Translated)

166
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 Only Jesus can bridge the holy God, sinless God, and us broken sinners.

167
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 Only He can be the bridge, and only Jesus has the power to forgive

168
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 and to give us the life of God, the eternal life.

169
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 (Translated)

170
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 So we have to ask at the end of the sermon is to ask ourselves, "What must we do now?"

171
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 (Translated)

172
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 What must you do? What must we do?

173
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 The Bible tells us something very simple, but life-changing.

174
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 (Translated)

175
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 The Bible tells us at least three things.

176
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 First is to repent.

177
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 Which is turning away from our sin, our brokenness, by trusting in God Himself.

178
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 (Translated)

179
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 So the first step is to repent. Repent from our sin and our brokenness,

180
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 and make a U-turn back to God.

181
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 And secondly is to believe, which is trusting in Jesus Christ Himself,

182
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 alone as our Savior and our Lord.

183
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 (Translated)

184
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 And be baptized, that's the third step, which is a decoration,

185
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 a perfect decoration of our faith and our new life in Jesus.

186
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 (Translated)

187
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 Now, I don't know if you have been baptized or not, but you know, what is baptism?

188
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 So often we have some misunderstanding about what baptism is all about.

189
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 We think baptism is a graduation ceremony.

190
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 (Translated)

191
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 And we think that, okay, once we're baptized, we graduate, like graduating from school,

192
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 and we don't have to go back, and we upgrade or something.

193
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 (Translated)

194
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 Baptism, no, it's not like that. Baptism is not like graduation ceremony.

195
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 (Translated)

196
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 Baptism is a perfect decoration of our faith in Jesus.

197
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 (Translated)

198
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 Now, baptism means we say to the world that, yes, I'm a sinner, I'm broken,

199
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 but I have experienced the grace of God, and by the grace of God, I stand righteous before God.

200
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 (Translated)

201
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 When you believe in Jesus, your sins are forgiven, and we are given the new life, the eternal life.

202
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 (Translated)

203
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 And sometimes the Bible, especially the book of Acts, describes the eternal life as the gift of the Holy Spirit.

204
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 (Translated)

205
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 And the gift of the Holy Spirit was that it's actually God's own presence in our life,

206
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 and God is living with you, living in you.

207
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 (Translated)

208
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 Now, my final question is, if you have made Jesus your Savior and Lord,

209
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 you have accepted Jesus as your Lord, and it is time for you to restart your life, restart your commitment.

210
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 (Translated)

211
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 If you have never done that, and now is the time to turn to Jesus.

212
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 (Translated)

213
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 And on my last slide, there's a very simple prayer, and I hope that we can restart our life by trusting in Jesus.

214
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 (Translated)

215
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 And it's a very simple prayer.

216
00:18:50,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 It says, "Lord Jesus, I know I'm a sinner, and I cannot save myself.

217
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 I believe you died for my sins and rose again for me.

218
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 And I now turn from my sin and trust you as my Savior.

219
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 Forgive me and help me follow you the rest of my life.

220
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 Would that be your prayer today?

221
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 Would that be your prayer?

222
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 And we can pray this prayer and trust in God, trust in Jesus.

223
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 (Translated)

224
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 If you can, you can pray with your heart.

225
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 Or you can pray out loud with me.

226
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 Let me read this prayer again.

227
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 Lord Jesus, I know I'm a sinner.

228
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 I cannot save myself.

229
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 I believe you died for my sins and rose again.

230
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 I turn from my sin and trust you as my Savior.

231
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 Please forgive me and help me follow you the rest of my life.

232
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 Amen.

233
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 Let's pray.

234
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 Father, you heard our prayer.

235
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 And we want to trust in you.

236
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 And thank you for being our Lord and our Savior.

237
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 Thank you for dying for our sin on the cross.

238
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 And you rose from the death for all of us.

239
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 And help us to follow you.

240
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 Because you are the Lord of our life.

241
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 In Jesus' name we pray.

242
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 Amen.

243
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 Now, last note I want to give to you is that if you did pray this prayer,

244
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 and you have questions about faith, you have questions about the Bible,

245
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 you know, God, Jesus, you know, please stop by and talk to one of us, one of our staff.

246
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 (Speaking Chinese)

247
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 Okay, so we have a freshman out there,

248
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 and we want to thank the Brothers and Sisters for preparing that.

249
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 (Speaking Chinese)

250
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 Please spend some time to get to know one another.

251
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 (Speaking Chinese)

252
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 Alright, God bless you.

253
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 (Speaking Chinese)

254
00:21:42,000 --> 00:22:10,000

255
