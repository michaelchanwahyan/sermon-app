2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 Hello everyone, I'm Miss Rebecca.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 Welcome to Family Sunday School.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 This is the fourth episode.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 What did we talk about last time?

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 Remember?

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 We talked about Jesus being arrested.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 A very important distinction,

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 a very important difference is

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 being tied up and dragged away.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Or what?

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Jesus allowed them to drag him away.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Do you want to tie him up? No need.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Do you want to lock him up? No need.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 Do you want to drag him away? No need.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Jesus just followed them.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 I haven't mentioned this before.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 This is God's plan to save people.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 God said this plan must be fulfilled.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 So Jesus had to obey.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Jesus knew what was going to happen.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 So he just went with it.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 Remember?

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Last episode, the last Chinese time,

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 I gave you a challenge.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 Remember the challenge?

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 Because last time we talked about a lot of different things.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Angles.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 Right?

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 Different perspectives, different angles.

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 We looked at the story from different angles.

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Judas, John, Peter, Jesus.

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 Right?

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Does anyone remember the Chinese challenge?

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 Let me remind you.

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 We said that "角" can be used as "angle".

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 If triangle is "三角形",

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 then what is hexagon in Chinese?

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 Does anyone know?

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 Does anyone remember?

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 Have you talked to your family?

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 I'll break it down. Ready?

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 Triangle. "Tri" means "三",

44
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 "Angle" means "角",

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 "三角形" means "three-angle shape".

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 How many "角" are there in hexagon?

47
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 One, two, three, four, five, six.

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Right?

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 Six.

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 "六角形"

51
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 Right?

52
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 Hexagon.

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 "Hex" means "six", "hexagon".

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 Wow.

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Let's repeat the numbers.

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 If I say "octagon",

57
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 you will know, right?

58
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 Let's repeat the numbers.

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

60
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Backwards.

61
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 Countdown.

62
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.

63
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 What is "octagon"?

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 Let's talk about it in Chinese.

65
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 Hold the thought.

66
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 Okay.

67
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 In this episode, we will continue the story.

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 Jesus followed them to be taken away.

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 Where did he go?

70
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 What did he do?

71
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 Do you remember who was following them?

72
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 Who was secretly following them?

73
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Yes.

74
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 John and Peter.

75
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 John and Peter.

76
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 John and Peter.

77
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 Hmm.

78
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 Was it dangerous to follow them?

79
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 Was it dangerous for John and Peter?

80
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Hmm.

81
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Where did they take Jesus?

82
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 What happened to Jesus?

83
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 We, as modern Christians,

84
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 know a little bit about it.

85
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 Because we know what "Easter" means.

86
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 But at that moment,

87
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 John and Peter didn't know, right?

88
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 Hmm.

89
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 So today, we will continue the story.

90
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 Before we talk about the story,

91
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 we must play a game, right?

92
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 Mr. Becker loves playing games.

93
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 Okay.

94
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 Let's go.

95
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 The game we are playing this time is called "Name That Animal".

96
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 Guess what animal it is.

97
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 How to guess?

98
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 It's not based on eyes.

99
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 It's based on ears.

100
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 You have to listen to these sounds

101
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 to guess what animal it is.

102
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 Here it comes.

103
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 The first animal.

104
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 Or you can close your eyes.

105
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 Then you can hear these sounds clearly.

106
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 And you can guess what animal it is.

107
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 The first animal.

108
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 Who is it?

109
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 Guess.

110
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 Frog.

111
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 Here comes the next one.

112
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 The hint is,

113
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 "I am large and loud."

114
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 Hmm.

115
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 What is large and loud?

116
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 Let's listen.

117
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 [Name That Animal]

118
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 It's loud.

119
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 Can anyone guess what it is?

120
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 Elephant.

121
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 Elephant.

122
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 Can you hear the different sounds?

123
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 Of course the message is different.

124
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 What it wants to say.

125
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 What it wants to express is different.

126
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 Elephant.

127
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 Here comes the next one.

128
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 The hint is,

 "I am alarming."

130
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 Alarming is like an alarm clock.

131
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 It wakes us up.

132
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 It's loud.

133
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 Alarming.

134
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 Hmm.

135
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 Who has this animal?

136
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 Wake it up.

137
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000

153

 "I am cleaner than you may think."

 [Name That Bird]

162
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 Let's hear this sound.

163
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 Or,

164
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 "Has anyone been to the farm?"

165
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 You may have heard this sound.

166
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 [Name That Animal]

167
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 Do you know what animal it is?

168
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 We usually think it is dirty,

169
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 but it is actually a very clean animal.

170
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 Let's guess.

171
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000

172
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 [Name That Pig]

173
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 In the story,

174
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 we may say, "Oink, oink."

175
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 But actually, it sounds like this.

176
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 [Name That Pig]

177
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 Okay.

 Have you heard of it?

189
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 Is it familiar?

190
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 It is a cricket.

191

 [Name That Cricket]

192
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 You heard the sound.

193
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 It is not just one cricket,

194
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 but many crickets.

195
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 Let's talk.

196
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 I want you to think about

197
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 which animal will appear

198
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 in the next story.

199
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Please pay attention.

200
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 Okay.

201
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 Let's continue the story.

202
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 Peter and John follow Jesus.

203
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 What will happen?

204
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 They will take Jesus away.

205
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 They will find a way to take Jesus away.

206
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 They will find a way to take Jesus away.

207
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 John and Peter must follow Jesus.

208
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 Let's see what will happen.

209
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 Where will they follow Jesus?

210
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 They will go to a big temple.

211
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 In the past, religious leaders

212
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 would gather in a big place.

213
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 There are buildings,

214
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 and a small garden.

215
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 A woman sees him in the garden.

216
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 "Oh, you look so familiar.

217
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 You look like your friends in Jesus' story."

218
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 What will Peter say?

219
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 "We have said that

220
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 Peter will not deny Jesus,

221
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 no matter what."

222
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 "He said so."

223
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 What will Peter say?

224
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 "Yes, what Jesus said will happen,

225
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 will happen."

226
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 Peter said, "No, no, no, not me.

227
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 I don't know him.

228
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 Not me, not me.

229
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 I don't know him."

230
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 They went to another place.

231
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 It was cold outside.

232
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 It was dark.

233
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 They went to a fire to keep warm.

234
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 There was no heater in the past.

235
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 They cooked with fire.

236
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 They kept warm with fire.

237
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 They walked around.

238
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 Another woman came to Peter.

239
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 She asked him,

240
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 "Aren't you the one

241
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 who followed Jesus?"

242
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 "Do you know Jesus?"

243
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 "Hmm,

244
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 what do you think Peter will say?"

245
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 "He denied Jesus last time.

246
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 Will he do it again?"

247
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 "Yes," she said.

248
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 "Not me, not me, not me."

249
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 They walked away.

250
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 They saw many people were drunk.

251
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 They felt safe.

252
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 They went to the main hall.

253
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 They hid and covered themselves.

254
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 No one would notice.

255
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 They just stood there.

256
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 Who would know?

257
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 It was a big deal.

258
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 Among the men,

259
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 one said,

260
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 "Hey,

261
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 aren't you the one

262
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 who cut off the ear?"

263
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 "Yes, it's you.

264
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 You cut off the ear

265
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 of the man

266
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 who cut off the ear.

267
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 You are with Jesus.

268
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 It's you.

269
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 Don't deny it.

270
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 You are with Jesus.

271
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 Hey,

272
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 do you know

273
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 what Peter will say?"

274
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 "Who is it?

275
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 It's not me.

276
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 It's not me."

277
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 "Ah!"

278
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 "Uh-oh!

279
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 What happened?"

280
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 "The cock crowed."

281
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 "Oh!"

282
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 "It was that moment.

283
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 The moment of the cock crowing."

284
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 "Cuckoo!"

285
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 Peter stood up.

286
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 "Oh, Jesus said

287
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 the cock crowed before.

288
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 You will deny me.

289
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 Huh!"

290
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 Three times.

291
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 Did he deny Jesus three times?

292
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 One, the woman.

293
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 Two, the other woman.

294
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 Three, the man who cut off the ear.

295
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 Huh!

296
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 It was that moment again.

297
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 Cuckoo!

298
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 Jesus was inside.

299
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 He was inside the house.

300
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 He looked out of the window.

301
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 He was outside the house.

302
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 Peter heard the cock crow.

303
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 He looked at the window.

304
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 They were good friends.

305
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 They remembered the conversation.

306
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 They looked at each other.

307
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 Jesus was sad.

308
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 What did Peter feel?

309
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 He was sad and guilty.

310
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 Huh!

311
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 What Jesus said would happen,

312
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 we thought it would never happen.

313
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 We thought we were not like that.

314
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 We would not do that.

315
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 But Jesus said it would happen.

316
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 It would happen, right?

317
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 Huh!

318
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 I wonder how Peter feels now.

319
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 I want you to pause and discuss.

320
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 Why did Peter deny Jesus?

321
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 He loved Jesus and followed Jesus.

322
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 Why did people ask him

323
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 if he followed Jesus?

324
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 Did he cut off his ear?

325
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 Did he cut off his head?

326
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 Did he cut off his head?

327
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 No, no, no.

328
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 He obviously lied.

329
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 Why did he do that?

330
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 Huh!

331
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 I know, you know, Peter knows.

332
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 It's not good to lie.

333
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 It's not true, right?

334
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 Telling lies isn't good.

335
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 It's not honest.

336
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 But why did he do that?

337
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 Pause for a moment.

338
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 Think about it.

339
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 Discuss.

340
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 We will come back.

341
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 Okay?

342
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 Let's suppose something.

343
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 We might think,

344
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 Wow! Peter?

345
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 He's so bad.

346
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 He obviously loved Jesus.

347
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 Why did he deny Jesus?

348
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 I will bring you into a story.

349
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 See how you will feel later.

350
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 Or you will change your mind.

351
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 Let's see.

352
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 What if?

353
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 If?

354
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 If?

355
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 You see some kids

356
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 break a window while playing football.

357
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 Oh no!

358
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 The auntie at home

359
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 comes out and scolds them.

360
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 Who broke my window?

361
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 She sees your friend nearby.

362
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 Wow!

363
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 She accuses your friend.

364
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 She brings him back.

365
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 Scolds him.

366
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 And she asks his mom and dad

367
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 to clarify what happened.

368
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 Oh! Big trouble!

369
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 Right?

370
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 But your friend

371
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 has a big question mark.

372
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 Huh?

373
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 What happened?

374
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 Your friend doesn't know what happened.

375
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 But do you know what your friend is doing?

376
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 He is playing football with you.

377
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 But the ball you play with

378
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 and the ball that broke the window

379
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 are different.

380
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 Actually, they are not.

381
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 But why is the auntie

382
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 your friend?

383
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 Hmm...

384
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 How do you feel?

385
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 Wow!

386
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 She sees my friend.

387
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 Huh!

388
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 She scolds him.

389
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 I am so nervous.

390
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 Do you think you will say something?

391
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 If the auntie asks you

392
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 "Hey!

393
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 You play football with him, right?"

394
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 "Of course!"

395
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 "You broke the window."

396
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 "Do you know him?"

397
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 "Do you know that kid?"

398
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 "Do you play football with him?"

399
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 "What should I do?"

400
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 "Do you know what to do?"

401
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 Or maybe you are like Peter

402
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 who doesn't want to say anything

403
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 but you don't know him.

404
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 Actually,

405
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 Peter didn't expect

406
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 to deny Jesus.

407
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 We talked about this in the last supper.

408
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 He said he would never do that

409
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 because he thought

410
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 there was no reason

411
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 or situation

412
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 to deny Jesus.

413
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 But think about it.

414
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 Jesus was just arrested.

415
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 A lot of things happened, right?

416
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 Peter was so nervous

417
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 and scared.

418
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 It's like this story.

419
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 The adults asked him

420
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 "Hey!

421
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 Do you know that kid?"

422
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 "He broke the window."

423
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 "Are you with him?"

424
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 "Oh!"

425
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 Or maybe you would say

426
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 "No, no, I am not with him.

427
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 I don't know him. Bye bye."

428
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 Right?

429
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 It's possible, right?

430
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 So it could have been you too.

431
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 Actually, we could have also been Peter.

432
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 From this perspective,

433
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 it's also a perspective, right?

434
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 Actually, when we put ourselves

435
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 into the Bible story,

436
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 we will understand more

437
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 that these characters

438
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 are not just characters.

439
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 They are real people.

440
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 Real life, real people.

441
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 We can understand

442
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 and empathize.

443
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 We can imagine

444
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 and feel their feelings.

445
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 When we feel empathy,

446
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 we will understand more.

447
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 "Yes, Peter loves Jesus so much.

448
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 Of course, he won't deny it.

449
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 But compared to me,

450
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 I am also scared.

451
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 Why am I being pulled into this?

452
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 Or maybe I won't say it.

453
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 But I feel guilty inside.

454
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 Guilty, right?

455
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 So we can put ourselves

456
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 into the situation

457
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 and feel more of the other person's feelings.

458
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 Sometimes, when we lie,

459
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 we are protecting ourselves, right?

460
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 Who has done it?

461
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 I can be very honest.

462
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 Who has done something

463
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 that we are afraid of getting into trouble

464
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 and being recognized?

465
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 What will happen if we are recognized?

466
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 What will happen if we are not recognized?

467
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 When I was young,

468
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 I used to eat chocolate cake secretly.

469
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 My mom told me not to eat it.

470
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 After the party,

471
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 the guests ate it all.

472
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 I ate the leftovers.

473
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 But that box of cake

474
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 was really delicious.

475
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 But I told my mom,

476
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 I promised not to eat it.

477
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 I won't eat this cake.

478
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 I won't eat a single piece, mom.

479
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 Mom went out.

480
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 I and this box of cake

481
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 are very close, right?

482
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 I opened the box of cake.

483
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 I took a piece of cake from the back.

484
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 I closed the box.

485
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 I closed the box.

486
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 No one would know, right?

487
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 But it's not just once.

488
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 Wait a minute.

489
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 It's me and this box of cake.

490
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 The first piece was delicious.

491
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 I ate the second piece.

492
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 The third piece.

493
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 Mom came back.

494
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 She was going to take the cake out

495
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 and put it on a plate

496
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 for the guests to eat.

497
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 She opened the box of cake.

498
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 She put the cookies in the box.

499
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 She took more.

500
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 I was the third person.

501
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 She took out the first piece of cake

502
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 and put it on the plate.

503
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 She put the second piece of cake on the plate.

504
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 The third piece of cake.

505
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 This is the one I stole.

506
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 She stole the third piece of cake.

507
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 Uh-oh.

508
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 She saw it.

509
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 It was obviously a new one.

510
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 Why didn't she see a few pieces of cake?

511
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 What did she do?

512
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 She walked around.

513
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 She was busy.

514
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 She read books.

515
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 She drew.

516
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 She sat down and slept.

517
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 She did a lot of things.

518
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 Mom asked,

519
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 "Do you know where the cookies are?"

520
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 "I don't know."

521
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 "Why did you do that?"

522
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 "You knew. Why didn't you tell me?"

523
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 She asked again.

524
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 "But you were the only one at home with the cookies."

525
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 "Grandma was in the back garden."

526
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 "Grandma didn't like to eat. Where did the cookies go?"

527
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 "Uh-oh."

528
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 "Oh, no. What now?"

529
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 "I don't know."

530
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 She kept running away.

531
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 She looked for a place.

532
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 She pretended not to know.

533
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 She pretended not to see.

534
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 She asked again.

535
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 "Tell me honestly."

536
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 "Did you eat the cookies?"

537
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 "Oh, no."

538
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 "I was found out."

539
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 "I didn't steal them. I just ate them."

540
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 She said,

541
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 "You know there are a lot of cookies on your clothes, right?"

542
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 "I don't know about my face, but I feel very guilty."

543
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 "I feel so guilty."

544
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 Mom asked,

545
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 "You mean you opened the cookies without thinking,"

546
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 "put your hand in it without thinking,"

547
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 "and took the cookies out without thinking,"

548
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 "put the cookies in your mouth without thinking,"

549
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 "and chewed them without thinking,"

550
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 "and swallowed them without thinking?"

551
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 "Right?"

552
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 "Uh... yes."

553
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 "Isn't this story funny?"

554
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 "It's true."

555
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 "I'm the one who's telling the truth."

556
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 "I ate the cookies without thinking."

557
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 "But..."

558
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 "You asked me, 'Hey, Miss Rebecca, will you tell a lie?'"

559
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 "I said, 'No, no, no, no, no, no.'"

560
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 "I'm a very honest person. I'm very honest."

561
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 "But..."

562
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 "Sigh..."

563
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 "When I feel in trouble,"

564
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 "when I feel dangerous,"

565
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 "I might do it."

566
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 "Right?"

567
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 "Everyone does it, right?"

568
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 "Have you tried it?"

569
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 "You can be honest."

570
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 "You can pause and talk."

571
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 "You can be honest."

572
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 "Why?"

573
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 "Because God forgave us."

574
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 "We forgive others."

575
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 "Right?"

576
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 "God knows our hearts."

577
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 "God knows that when I was a kid,"

578
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 "I couldn't resist this delicious chocolate cake."

579
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 "It was so delicious."

580
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 "I didn't have junk food at home."

581
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 "A customer said, 'Wow, your chocolate chip cookie!'"

582
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 "I couldn't resist it. I ate it."

583
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 "He understood."

584
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 "I regretted it later."

585
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 "I told my mom, 'Sorry.'"

586
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 "Not only did I eat the cake, right?"

587
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 "I'm sorry."

588
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 "Not only did I eat it, I also lied."

589
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 "But after I told her, I felt much better."

590
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 "Do you think..."

591
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 "Jesus knows."

592
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 "I think my mom knows, too."

593
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 "I'm wearing a cake dress."

594
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 "She knows I did it."

595
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 "But she gave me a chance."

596
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 "Do you think Jesus can give you a chance?"

597
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 "Let's talk next time."

598
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 Chinese time.

599
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 What is our special animal today?

600
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 There are many animals in our show.

601
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 Is it a pig?

602
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 A elephant?

603
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 No?

604
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 Hmm...

605
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 A bat.

606
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 What is our special animal today?

607
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 A bat?

608
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 No, of course not.

609
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 It's a rooster.

610
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 Now,

611
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 "公雞" is "rooster" in English.

612
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 "母雞" is "hen" in Chinese.

613
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 Okay, Chinese time.

614
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 We remember that English has different names,

615
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 male and female.

616
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 Right?

617
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 But in Chinese,

618
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 we often add "公"

619
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 or "母"

620
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 or "那".

621
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 That's it.

622
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 Like "牛", "cow".

623
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 "母牛"

624
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 "母牛"

625
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 Oh!

626
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 Interesting.

627
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 "母" means "mother".

628
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 So, if you add "母" to "母"

629
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 it becomes a female animal.

630
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 Wow!

631
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 Then you don't have to remember so many things.

632
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 Right?

633
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 I know that

634
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 people often ask

635
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 "Is your dog male or female?"

636
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 "公" means "male".

637
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 Right.

638
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 "那" means "female".

639
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 Oh!

640
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 Also,

641
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 in the beginning of the Chinese time,

642
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 there was a challenge.

643
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 In the beginning of the intro,

644
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 I said that there was a challenge in Chinese time.

645
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 "Octagon"

646
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 What is it in Chinese?

647
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 What is a triangle?

648
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 Right.

649
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 What is a hexagon?

650
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 What is an octagon?

651
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

652
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 Octopus

653
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 "八爪魚"

654
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 What is an octagon?

655
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 Right. Octagon.

656
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 You got it!

657
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 OK. Let's go back to practice.

658
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 See what other animals can add "公"

659
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 and "母".

660
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 See you next time!

661
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 Bye!

662
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 Hello everyone!

663
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 I have taken out my Bible.

664
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 Here.

665
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 There is a Bible.

666
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 We are very familiar with the Bible

667
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 of our children.

668
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 This is the Bible.

669
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 Right?

670
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 This one.

671
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 This one.

672
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 It is in cartoon style.

673
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 It is for children.

674
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 A common theme in this Bible is that

675
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 the picture is usually very big.

676
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 The words are smaller.

677
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 The story is more like one, two, three pages.

678
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 Usually,

679
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 like this one

680
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 and this one,

681
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 each story is separate.

682
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 Especially,

683
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 like you said,

684
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 when Daniel and the lions

685
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 jump to the next story.

686
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 There are not many stories connected.

687
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 It is like a big story.

688
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 But actually,

689
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 the Bible is a big story.

690
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 The Old Testament and the New Testament are together.

691
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 This Bible story,

692
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 Jesus Storybook Bible,

693
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 is connected to a theme.

694
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 Each story of the Old Testament

695
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 and the New Testament

696
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 points to Jesus Christ.

697
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 So,

698
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 this is the major difference.

699
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 But the style is similar.

700
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 I want to talk to you about

701
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 the Bible of children.

702
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 There are many kinds.

703
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 But what do we want to pay attention to?

704
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 We want to pay attention to the illustration.

705
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 The text, the words,

706
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 the vocabulary.

707
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 How difficult is the word "born"?

708
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 Do children read it by themselves?

709
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 Or do adults read it?

710
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 We can also look at the storytelling.

711
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 How deep is it?

712
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 Are there details?

713
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 We know that there are.

714
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 This kind of Bible,

715
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 and our adult Bible,

716
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 adults' Bible has more details.

717
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 But there are also

718
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 other Bible for children

719
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 that have more details.

720
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 For example,

721
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 this series.

722
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 Each story is drawn out of a book.

723
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 The Last Stepper.

724
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 The Last Stepper.

725
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 Alone.

726
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 There are more than 20 pages.

727
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 So the story is more substantial.

728
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 They will think that

729
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 the story is really long.

730
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 So,

731
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 if you add them up,

732
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 it becomes a series.

733
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 Then,

734
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 why

735
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 if there are so many exposures,

736
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 children will know that there are many different perspectives.

737
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 Right?

738
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 They will appreciate it more.

739
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 You can also see that

740
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 this illustration is different from other illustrations.

741
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 The second kind is this one.

742
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 It's about facts.

743
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 This is graphic, infographic.

744
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 This is also like an encyclopedia.

745
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 Right?

746
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 You can see that the illustrations

747
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 are more realistic.

748
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 Right?

749
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 It really looks like a real person's handwriting.

750
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 Right?

751
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 The Bible says that

752
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 there is a river,

753
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 and there is a hill,

754
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 and there is a hill,

755
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 so there are many things happening.

756
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 You will know that it really happened.

757
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 Wow!

758
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 So many things,

759
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 plus the children,

760
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 make the Bible stories more profound.

761
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 They know that

762
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 just like adults,

763
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 if you continue to study the Bible,

764
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
 more exciting things will happen.

765
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 So we give them more exposure to

766
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 not just the stories,

767
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 but also the perspectives

768
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 of the stories, the telling,

769
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 and the art.

770
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 They will know that there are so many

771
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 ways to express

772
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 our knowledge of Jesus,

773
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 our knowledge of God.

774
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 It can be abstract,

775
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 abstract,

776
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 or realistic.

777
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 It can be like a real person's handwriting.

778
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 There is also a type of Bible

779
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 that looks like a comic book.

780
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 We see a lot of words in adult Bibles.

781
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 We imagine what we see.

782
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 We imagine what we see.

783
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 We have seen

784
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 painters who draw Jesus,

785
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 or paint with oil paint.

786
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 painters who draw Jesus,

787
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 or paint with oil paint.

788
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 But there is more than just this representation.

789
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 But there is more than just this representation.

790
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 You can use comic books

791
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 to represent Jesus.

792
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 The difference is that

793
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 you need to know that

794
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
 some things are taken for granted.

795
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 You may not know if Jesus really said

796
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 these words.

797
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 But the reference is in the Holy Bible.

798
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 But the reference is in the Holy Bible.

799
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 There is also this type of Bible.

800
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
 This is actually quite old.

801
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 This is also a comic book.

802
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 Look at this.

803
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 The picture is more realistic.

804
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 You can see every expression.

805
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
 As the story goes along,

806
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 the expression will be different.

807
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
 Why is this important?

808
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 Because in so many Bibles,

809
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 the children's understanding of the Bible

810
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 is deeper because

811
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
 there are different perspectives.

812
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
 There is a geographic perspective.

813
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 There is a geographic perspective.

814
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 It's like this book.

815
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 There is an emotional perspective.

816
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 You can see the emotional and

817
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
 psychological aspects of the Bible.

818
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 You can see the emotional aspects of the Bible.

819
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 You can feel the emotional aspects of the Bible.

820
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 Or you may like data.

821
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 Or you may like data.

822
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 Factual perspective.

823
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 Historical perspective.

824
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 There are also many different

825
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 perspectives and

826
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 different perspectives.

827
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 The more you think and

828
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 know, the deeper the understanding.

829
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
 There is a connection.

830
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 I have talked about many different

831
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 Bibles. Children's Bible.

832
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 I want you to

833
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 refer to

834
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 the version I talked about

835
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
 and

836
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
 the version in your

837
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 children's Bible.

838
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
 What is included?

839
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
 Look for the part

840
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 of Rooster.

841
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 Look for the part of

842
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 Peter denying Jesus.

843
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 Look at

844
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 which Bible has some things

845
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 which Bible has some things

846
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 and look at the illustrations.

847
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
 and look at the illustrations.

848
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
 So,

849
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 we talked about perspective in the last episode.

850
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
 This time,

851
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 there is more exposure.

852
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
 Actually,

853
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
 children know this story

854
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
 more deeply.

855
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 The more connection,

856
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
 the better.

857
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 The more connection,

858
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
 the deeper the understanding.

859
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 The more connection,

860
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 the better.

861
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 Story.

862
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 Look at different stories,

863
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 different Bibles, different illustrations.

864
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 Connecting.

865
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 Connecting your

866
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
 personal story.

867
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 Right?

868
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
 Have you ever lied?

869
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
 Have you ever denied someone?

870
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 Yes, you have.

871
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
 The connection

872
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
 between Peter and you

873
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 is deeper.

874
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
 OK.

875
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
 Challenge yourself to do this.

876
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
 Also, if your children

877
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
 like animals,

878
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 also like animals,

879
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
 you can play the game.

880
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
 Go to the Internet

881
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 and look for sound effects

882
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 or animal sounds.

883
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
 Play with your children.

884
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
 Guess which animal it is.

885
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
 Alright.

886
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 See you next time.

00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
