1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,200
 Alright, thanks Kelly.

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,880
 Did you get a bottle of the sauce?

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:05,920
 - I got it.

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,240
 - The XO sauce, right?

5
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,780
 Yeah, so it would be great, alright?

6
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:12,760
 So let's pray together.

7
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,280
 Father, we come before you knowing that

8
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,540
 you hear our prayers and you are with us.

9
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:20,280
 Whether we are going through up or down,

10
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,340
 you are still our God and you are indeed our same God.

11
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,780
 And yesterday, today, and tomorrow,

12
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,400
 our Lord Jesus Christ remains the same

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,880
 and he is our faithful God and our faithful friend.

14
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,720
 We uplift our burden, we come before you

15
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,200
 and open our hearts knowing that

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,960
 you are the God who hear our prayers.

17
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,760
 So we come before you to confess our sin,

18
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,320
 confess our shortcomings,

19
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,480
 knowing that we are weak without you

20
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,880
 and we need your grace.

21
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,900
 As we worship today, we come and ask

22
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,940
 for your grace to draw us near

23
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,160
 so that we get to know you more.

24
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,840
 Know what you desire and grant us

25
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,000
 the heart to follow you, to obey you.

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,500
 We pray for our city as the DNC is coming

27
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,680
 into the city, it's gonna be a lot of traffic

28
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,280
 and there are a lot of different voices and controversies.

29
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,840
 I pray for safety and peace for our city,

30
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,640
 for our neighbors, and I just wanna

31
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,500
 come before you in prayer as well

32
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,640
 as the election is coming.

33
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,280
 There are a lot of different controversies

34
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,280
 and a lot of issues for us to think about

35
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,760
 and may your church, may your people

36
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,920
 be desiring your kingdom because

37
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,120
 only your kingdom is eternal.

38
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,840
 No matter who we vote for, no matter which side

39
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,600
 are we on, we know that we need to stand

40
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,400
 for your kingdom, for only the kingdom

41
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,680
 of our Lord Jesus Christ stands forever.

42
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,440
 And that's why we continue to build this church.

43
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,000
 That's why we continue to serve you

44
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,740
 and come to worship you because your people

45
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,760
 will remain forever and your kingdom,

46
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,360
 your reign remains eternal.

47
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,360
 And help us to fix our eyes on you

48
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,480
 knowing that your reign and your kingship

49
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,400
 is forever and let us worship you

50
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,640
 and serve you forever in Christ's name, we pray.

51
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,000
 Well, if you have your Bible, turn me to

52
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,240
 the book of 1 Corinthians.

53
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,720
 We're going through this long series

54
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,020
 and today is the conclusion.

55
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:33,060
 This is the eighth week and we introduce

56
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,960
 this verse of the week and we remember

57
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,200
 last week I introduced this verse

58
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,720
 from the book of Romans, chapter 14, verse eight.

59
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,040
 And shall we read together?

60
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,320
 Romans, chapter 14, verse eight.

61
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,240
 All right, let's do it together in English.

62
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,000
 If we live, it is to honor the Lord

63
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,520
 and if we die, it is to honor the Lord.

64
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,160
 So whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord.

65
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,800
 That's the book of Romans, chapter 14, verse eight.

66
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,520
 So often we forget that our life belongs to God, right?

67
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,880
 You're redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ.

68
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,400
 We are all saved by the grace of Jesus Christ

69
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,220
 and our life and 24/7, all of our time,

70
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,120
 belong to God, right, and none other.

71
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,040
 He has the ultimate authority.

72
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,000
 He has the ultimate lordship and leadership in our life

73
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,320
 and we should yield to his leadership.

74
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,240
 Well, every time we struggle with some of the problems

75
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,480
 in our lives, we need to go to God.

76
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,580
 Every time we taste the grace of God, right,

77
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,680
 God answer our prayers and help us

78
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,320
 in every single different way,

79
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,720
 we need to come to thank God because our life

80
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,520
 belongs to him, as it says here.

81
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,840
 We belong to the Lord, right?

82
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,680
 And that's why we need to understand

83
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,080
 there are basics in our Christian life

84
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,640
 and we went through different elements of the basic,

85
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,320
 the habits, right, of Christian life.

86
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,320
 We talk about the Bible, we talk about we need

87
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,160
 to read the word of God, we need to pray

88
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,600
 and we need to build our church life.

89
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,720
 We need to get into the habit of stepping into

90
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,920
 and plug ourselves into a community

91
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,920
 and so we want to conclude this series by encouraging

92
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,600
 each and every one of us to serve,

93
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,400
 to use our spiritual gifts.

94
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,040
 We went through a little bit in Romans chapter 14

95
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:35,040
 but today we're going to focus on this topic of serving.

96
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,840
 As a member of a church, as brother and sister in Christ,

97
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,120
 we are called to plug into a local community,

98
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,120
 belong to the spiritual family and live together

99
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,880
 and build a church together.

100
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,880
 And we come to the book of 1 Corinthians

101
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,000
 and first of all, some of the background, okay?

102
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,640
 So a background about this book called 1 Corinthians.

103
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,560
 And we know from the book of Acts

104
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,200
 that Paul found this church.

105
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,360
 He planned this church.

106
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,480
 It was on his second missionary journey

107
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:12,240
 and it was about AD 48, 49 and he was in Corinth

108
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,720
 and if you read the story in the book of Acts,

109
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,240
 Paul actually preached the gospel

110
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,400
 and a few of the people from Corinth

111
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,160
 came to believe in Christ.

112
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,880
 And then secondly, we need to understand,

113
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,480
 Paul returned to his home base in Antioch

114
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,440
 in the east side, you see that?

115
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,280
 You see that?

116
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,880
 In the Mediterranean east coast,

117
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,520
 there's a port called Antioch

118
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,680
 and down there is Jerusalem, right?

119
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,200
 So there were few missionary trips

120
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,880
 that Paul and his coworkers made

121
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,760
 to preach the gospel to the west, all right?

122
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,080
 The first one, the second one,

123
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,720
 he found the church at Corinth

124
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,440
 and then in his third missionary journey,

125
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,360
 it was about AD 50s,

126
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,720
 he went to today's Turkey

127
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,600
 and he stayed at Ephesus for three years.

128
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:09,600
 And here in Ephesus, in today's western Turkey,

129
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,680
 he heard about the situation

130
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,320
 in the house churches of Corinth.

131
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,600
 And remember a few years before,

132
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,040
 Paul planned this church.

133
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,000
 Paul came to this place

134
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,440
 and create a church and started a church

135
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,560
 and the church continued to meet.

136
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,680
 And while Paul was in Ephesus

137
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,640
 in his third missionary journey,

138
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,200
 he heard about some of the issues and problems

139
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,800
 and conflicts within the house churches of Corinth.

140
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,880
 And that's why he wrote one of the letters,

141
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,800
 what we call now First Corinthians.

142
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,520
 And if you understand, you know, First Corinthians,

143
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,560
 you read the letter,

144
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,440
 you probably have some impression

145
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,160
 of what that letter is all about.

146
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,840
 Paul tackled a lot of problems of the church.

147
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,960
 I always think that, you know,

148
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,200
 if my church is not like Corinthian church,

149
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,680
 then, you know, I should thank God, right?

150
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,240
 Because Corinthian church is full of problems,

151
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,520
 full of divisions and full of tensions.

152
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:19,080
 And in this long letter, 16 chapters,

153
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:24,080
 Paul wrote from Ephesus and send the letter to Corinth

154
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,120
 and to teach the Christians there,

155
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,600
 teach the house churches there,

156
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,760
 how to be united, how to worship God

157
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,760
 and how to take care of some of the problems,

158
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,560
 moral problems or, you know,

159
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,560
 the divisive problems that they have.

160
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,360
 And we come to chapter 12.

161
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,120
 And chapter 12 talks about three things.

162
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:50,480
 I wanna focus on this, these three points today.

163
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:54,160
 And in chapter 12 of First Corinthians,

164
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,560
 Paul is saying God desires,

165
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,040
 God loves unity.

166
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,560
 God would like to see the church,

167
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,120
 the people in the church to be united,

168
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,160
 not separated, not divided.

169
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,600
 And that's the first main point.

170
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,440
 God loves unity.

171
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:19,000
 God also love diversity in the church.

172
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,920
 That's why every single member has his role, right?

173
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,320
 And thirdly, God orchestrates everything,

174
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,800
 everyone together.

175
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,800
 So let's take a look at the first point.

176
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,800
 God loves, God desires, God delights in unity.

177
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,120
 When people praise God together,

178
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,200
 when people serve one another together,

179
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,360
 when people learn to love one another

180
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,920
 and hang in there and to build a community together,

181
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,400
 God loves it, God loves unity.

182
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,560
 Chapter 12, verse 12.

183
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,160
 The human body, Paul says,

184
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:57,920
 he's using an analogy, a metaphor for the church.

185
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,440
 He says the human body has many parts,

186
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,480
 but the many parts make up one whole body.

187
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,320
 So it is with the body of Christ, the church.

188
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,640
 So he's using the analogy of human body, right?

189
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,800
 Think about your physical body, right?

190
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,800
 We have different parts, right?

191
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,800
 And this is a perfect analogy for church,

192
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,400
 for us, for urban voice, for our church.

193
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,200
 Verse 13, he says, some of us are Jews,

194
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,240
 some of us are Gentiles.

195
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,160
 So culturally, we're different.

196
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,920
 Some of them are Jews, some of them are Gentiles.

197
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,800
 And then some of them are slaves or bond servants,

198
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,880
 and some of them are free, free men, right?

199
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,320
 They are not slaves.

200
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,640
 They probably own slaves, right?

201
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,800
 And by the way, slavery in the first century

202
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,680
 is not the slavery in the recent history

203
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,360
 of the United States.

204
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,520
 It's quite different.

205
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,800
 In any case, some of them are slaves

206
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,000
 and some of them are free, all right?

207
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 So socioeconomic status, everyone is different, right?

208
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,240
 But they are put together in the church.

209
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,560
 But we have all been baptized into one body, the church,

210
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,560
 by one Holy Spirit, and we all share the same spirit.

211
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,880
 And Paul here want to emphasize the unity that we have.

212
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,960
 The unity that we have, that we are united together

213
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,840
 as sisters and brothers in Christ in the same church.

214
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,640
 It's not because we share the same interests

215
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,240
 or we share the same personality or background.

216
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,760
 He said we all share the same spirit, right?

217
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,520
 That's NLT, New Living Translation.

218
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,440
 You probably have a more literal translation

219
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,000
 that says we were all made to drink of one spirit.

220
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,240
 That's interesting, drinking the spirit, right?

221
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,840
 Because in the New Testament,

222
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,560
 spirit is often analogous to water.

223
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,600
 The spirit is like water.

224
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,560
 So we all made to drink one spirit.

225
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,480
 So the point is we all share one cup, right?

226
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,620
 We all share the same fountain.

227
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,960
 That is the Holy Spirit.

228
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,060
 When you became Christian,

229
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:15,740
 when you came to saving knowledge of Jesus Christ,

230
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:18,600
 you are sharing the spirit

231
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,440
 because the spirit immediately lives in you, right?

232
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,920
 Lives in you and lives in me

233
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,240
 if we call on the name of Christ.

234
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,920
 So we all share the same Holy Spirit.

235
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,560
 And the church is always one.

236
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,280
 And Paul is trying to emphasize this,

237
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:40,760
 although the church is made up of many different people,

238
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,320
 different walks of life,

239
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,040
 but we all share one thing in common.

240
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,600
 We belong to this one body, sharing one spirit.

241
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,120
 And God loves this

242
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,740
 because that's how God set it up, right?

243
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,920
 Sometimes we come to the church, we may complain.

244
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,080
 There are people who are unlike us, right?

245
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,040
 The people who are so different from us.

246
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:06,000
 And it takes time and it takes a lot of different trials

247
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,840
 and errors to relate to one another, right?

248
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,720
 To befriend with one another.

249
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,120
 And we don't like it, right?

250
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,440
 We always being drawn to the people

251
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,960
 who have the same chemistry, right?

252
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,360
 But that is not how God designed the church.

253
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,960
 God loves unity.

254
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,080
 And the unity is based on one thing,

255
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:31,040
 the body of Christ, the same spirit.

256
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,680
 God is delightful when he sees different people

257
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,200
 united in Christ in the spirit.

258
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,200
 And secondly, this chapter talks about diversity, right?

259
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,320
 Unity is not uniformity.

260
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,320
 Unity has a huge diversity in it.

261
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,160
 And Paul talks about it and try to unpack this truth for us.

262
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,780
 Verses 14 and following.

263
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:59,600
 Yes, the body, the human body has many different parts,

264
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,400
 not just one part.

265
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,040
 If the foot says, "I'm not part of the body

266
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,080
 "because I'm not a hand."

267
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,120
 That's interesting statement.

268
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,940
 You know, the foot is saying,

269
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,680
 "I'm not a hand so I'm not part of the body."

270
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,480
 That does not make the foot any less a part of the body.

271
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,640
 Verse 16, "And if the ear says,

272
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,760
 "I'm not part of the body because I'm not an eye."

273
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,620
 Would that make it any less a part of the body?

274
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,240
 Well, this is a rhetorical question, right?

275
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,960
 Of course not, right?

276
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:35,040
 If the whole body were an eye, how would you hear?

277
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,720
 If your whole body were an ear,

278
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,200
 how would you smell anything?

279
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,520
 So Paul's using the same metaphor

280
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:48,440
 and try to unpack body has many different parts, right?

281
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,920
 You have ears, you have nose, you have mouth,

282
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,760
 you have hands, you have feet, right?

283
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:57,680
 You know, a couple weeks ago I hurt my wrist

284
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,080
 because I was trying to fix some plumbing problem at home.

285
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,500
 And I was using the pipe wrench

286
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,080
 and tried to tighten the hose.

287
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,620
 And because Nathan was not helping me,

288
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:15,920
 so I was all by myself.

289
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,840
 I'm trying to tighten it because I hate plumbing.

290
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:23,660
 I hate doing water work because no matter what I do,

291
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,880
 it leaks, right?

292
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,000
 Water leaks and it's really frustrating.

293
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,960
 And that's why I hurt my wrist.

294
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,480
 And because I'm getting old,

295
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,840
 so it takes a long time for me to fully recover.

296
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,920
 I'm still kind of painful here.

297
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:41,040
 I need to see a physical therapist pretty soon.

298
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,200
 Yeah, right?

299
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,800
 (laughs)

300
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,320
 Anyways, if one body is not working,

301
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,160
 it really affects my whole body, right?

302
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,920
 So I mean, for the last two weeks,

303
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:58,320
 it's just irritating to me.

304
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,120
 You know, when I want to grab something,

305
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,160
 when I want to play guitar or something like that,

306
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,840
 I feel pain.

307
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,100
 Paul's using the same language here, right?

308
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,120
 Let's imagine for a moment,

309
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,080
 the foot says, "I'm not a hand,

310
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,040
 "I don't belong to this body."

311
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,960
 The foot says, "I'm not as useful as the hand."

312
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,800
 Right?

313
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,800
 The foot is probably looking at the hand.

314
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,800
 Hey, I'm not as functional as you are,

315
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,600
 'cause you use hands a lot, right?

316
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,960
 And the foot seems like being ignored.

317
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:32,160
 Now, we may feel these kinds of statements made by Paul

318
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,120
 hypothetical.

319
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,480
 They are not.

320
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:39,100
 Remember, I talked to you about the letter

321
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,020
 of 1 Corinthians.

322
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,940
 There are many different problems

323
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,180
 in this house churches in Corinth.

324
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,060
 And remember, the Corinthian house churches

325
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:51,620
 are suffering from many different internal problems.

326
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,460
 Well, it's like a body, you have different parts

327
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:56,220
 of having something wrong with it, right?

328
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:00,040
 Divisions, arguments, and people dislike each other.

329
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:04,580
 And Paul is not making some hypothetical situation here.

330
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:08,560
 He is actually probably tackling some real problems,

331
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,040
 because there are members in the church

332
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,760
 who really think that, you know, I'm not like him,

333
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,360
 you know, so I don't belong to this body, right?

334
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,760
 I don't have the same spiritual gifts,

335
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,720
 I don't have the same function, right?

336
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,320
 He's on the stage and I'm in the audience, right?

337
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,440
 So I don't belong to this body.

338
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,580
 I don't need to come, right?

339
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,520
 So people did think in such terms.

340
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,660
 Probably in today's language, probably you feel like,

341
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:40,960
 you know, I'm not a worship team member, right?

342
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,300
 So I'm not gifted in music.

343
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,900
 So I don't belong to this body.

344
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,900
 I don't belong to this worshiping community.

345
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,220
 I'm not gifted in, you know, working on

346
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,900
 or operating computers back there, you know.

347
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,000
 I don't know the sound equipment, right?

348
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,880
 I'm not very good at that.

349
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,180
 I'm very bad at that.

350
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,440
 So I don't belong to this church.

351
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,060
 I'm not a Bible study leader, I can't read Bible study,

352
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,540
 you know, I'm not educated enough,

353
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,640
 so I don't belong here.

354
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,060
 You know, this is a real situation Paul is trying to tackle.

355
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:13,060
 But Paul is trying to help us to see what God sees,

356
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:15,600
 not how you see things.

357
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:20,600
 Christians often compare ourselves to others, right?

358
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:25,140
 We naturally do that, right?

359
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,380
 And that's the culture of the world, right?

360
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,900
 That's the secular culture.

361
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:32,400
 We have to compare and contrast with one another,

362
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,660
 with other people.

363
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,860
 And we look at other people have different functions

364
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:40,460
 and we may have jealousy, we may have envy.

365
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:44,340
 But look at what Paul says here, verse 18.

366
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:48,100
 "But our bodies," we're turning to the same metaphor,

367
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,100
 "have many parts."

368
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:56,100
 God has put each part just where he wants it.

369
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:00,340
 How strange a body would be if it had only one part.

370
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:04,340
 Yes, there are many parts, but only one body.

371
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:08,700
 The eye can never say to the hand, "I don't need you."

372
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:13,300
 The head can never say to the feet, "I don't need you."

373
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,560
 Right?

374
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,000
 Simple enough, right?

375
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,140
 However, if we compare and contrast our own role

376
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:26,840
 with others, there can be two results.

377
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,100
 The first result is that the church will never grow.

378
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,160
 Right?

379
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,360
 The church will never grow.

380
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,060
 We come to the community and we compare and contrast.

381
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:39,520
 We look at each other, they're different, right?

382
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,500
 And they're a competition.

383
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,160
 They're comparison, right?

384
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,660
 You're more useful, I'm less useful.

385
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,860
 Or I'm more useful, you're less useful, right?

386
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:54,000
 The church will never grow the way God intends it to grow.

387
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,960
 That is, Paul is trying to say unity within diversity.

388
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,280
 God put us different ones together.

389
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,060
 It's like a body with many parts,

390
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,480
 many different functions, many different roles.

391
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,720
 Each of them is important.

392
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,420
 And none of us is unimportant.

393
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,320
 Right?

394
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:19,440
 So if we come here to compare and contrast all the time,

395
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,440
 there might be competition, maybe envy, maybe division.

396
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,400
 The first result is the church will never grow.

397
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,760
 The second result is that when you compare yourself

398
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,600
 with other people in terms of different functions,

399
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,860
 someone is more useful, someone less useful,

400
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,800
 you do not understand the heart of God.

401
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,960
 And that is the main point Paul is driving at.

402
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,020
 Notice verse 18 here.

403
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:47,480
 18, verse 18.

404
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,660
 The bodies are many parts, but who has put them together?

405
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,040
 God has put them together.

406
00:19:55,040 --> 00:20:00,040
 Not the pastor, not the leader, not you, and not me.

407
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,600
 And according to whose desire

408
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,760
 God put all these parts together?

409
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:09,040
 It's God himself, his desire.

410
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:13,080
 God wanted us to be like this,

411
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,920
 diverse as diverse it can be.

412
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,760
 It's the very desire of God himself to create us,

413
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,120
 create the church, and make us who we are,

414
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:27,120
 and put us together to become one body, one church.

415
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,960
 Now, God does not just delight in diversity.

416
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,360
 You know, God look at us, God look at the church.

417
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,080
 Man, God is delightful.

418
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,880
 It's united, he loves it.

419
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,120
 It's diverse, he loves it.

420
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:46,760
 Also, God is not just delightful

421
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,720
 with diversity in the church.

422
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,320
 God has special attention to those who are weaker.

423
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:57,160
 Verse 22 and following, Paul continues.

424
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:01,720
 In fact, some parts of the body that seem weakest

425
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:06,160
 and least important are actually the most necessary.

426
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:10,160
 And the parts we regard as less honorable

427
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,800
 are those we clothe with greatest care.

428
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,440
 So we carefully protect those parts

429
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,800
 that should not be seen.

430
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,800
 Verse 24, while the more honorable parts

431
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,640
 do not require this special care,

432
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,200
 so God has put the body together

433
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:30,120
 such that extra honor and care are given to those parts

434
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,680
 that have less dignity.

435
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:37,680
 This makes for harmony among the many members

436
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,960
 so that all the members care for each other.

437
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,360
 You see the point?

438
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,520
 There are some parts, just like our body,

439
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:48,480
 there are parts that are important but not visible, right?

440
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,640
 The lungs, the heart, internal organs,

441
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,800
 they are not visible,

442
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,760
 but they are so vital to the whole body.

443
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,400
 Same thing for the church.

444
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:05,400
 There are some members who are less honorable, so to speak,

445
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,760
 or less visible.

446
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,040
 They don't have the spotlight,

447
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:12,800
 but they are as important as others.

448
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:16,560
 And Paul even emphasized we should pay special attention

449
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,240
 to those who are so-called weaker.

450
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:23,000
 Verse 26 and following.

451
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 If one body part suffers, all the parts suffer with it.

452
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,840
 If one part is honored, all the parts are glad.

453
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,800
 All of you together are Christ's body,

454
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:40,040
 and each of you is a part of it, right?

455
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,320
 Now, who are the weaker members in the church in Corinth?

456
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:49,760
 I think most likely the weaker members

457
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,600
 are the least gifted.

458
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,720
 Remember we talked about worship before?

459
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,160
 We come to chapter 14 of 1 Corinthians

460
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,880
 and talk about the disorder they have

461
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,280
 when the Corinthian Christians gather together.

462
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:07,600
 And they privilege these spectacular gifts,

463
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,000
 like speaking in tongue.

464
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,720
 Those signs and wonders, right?

465
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,280
 Those great things, right?

466
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,640
 People can see it and they're so visible.

467
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:22,360
 And these people who have the spectacular gifts,

468
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,600
 they're privileged and they have more honors,

469
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,680
 they have more spotlight and enjoy more attention.

470
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:33,520
 And Paul is trying to subvert the order.

471
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,680
 He says in Christ in the church,

472
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,120
 the seemingly weaker members

473
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,120
 should be regarded as equally important.

474
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:44,640
 Special care needs to be given to them, right?

475
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,520
 The culture of the world is survival of the fittest,

476
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,200
 law of the jungle, right?

477
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,440
 If you're weaker, you stay low.

478
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,120
 Paul argues the other way.

479
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:00,080
 God sees things totally different from how we see it,

480
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,080
 totally different from the culture of the world.

481
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,800
 The least in the eyes of God,

482
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:09,840
 the least should be given honor, dignity, and value.

483
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:14,040
 I've been to church many, many years.

484
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,440
 I remember in my home church in California,

485
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,720
 when I was much younger,

486
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:24,480
 we were in this small church

487
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,920
 and we have a member, a young adult girl

488
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:33,760
 who came to church and eventually came to Christ.

489
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:38,720
 She was very, very shy, very, very timid.

490
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,160
 And she came to Christ and for years she remains that way,

491
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,320
 very, very passive, very, very timid

492
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,040
 because of her family background.

493
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,360
 But she continues to grow spiritually.

494
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,360
 So the Bible and pray and worship,

495
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:58,240
 and day after day we can see she becomes more confident,

496
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,200
 more confident.

497
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,560
 And along the way, we encourage her

498
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,680
 and pray for her to try different things

499
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:08,000
 and serve in different ministries.

500
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 And finally, I really remember she tried

501
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,480
 to lead Bible study.

502
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,480
 And so we had the preparation beforehand

503
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,600
 and she led Bible study.

504
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,360
 And after leading Bible study,

505
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,160
 she thanked all of us for the opportunity.

506
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:30,560
 And we rejoice, we rejoice, we were so happy

507
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,600
 because she was given the attention.

508
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:37,640
 She was given the nurturing.

509
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:42,640
 And it's just amazing how she gradually transformed.

510
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:47,680
 By the grace of God, she became more courageous.

511
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,160
 She is a good example of weaker

512
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,720
 and less honorable member in this passage.

513
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:58,000
 And we rejoice and increase the honor for her.

514
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,480
 So God loves diversity.

515
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:05,360
 Last point, God orchestrates everyone.

516
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,200
 God orchestrates all.

517
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,320
 How does he do that?

518
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,120
 The passage continues.

519
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,600
 Paul says, "Here are some of the parts

520
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,720
 "God has appointed for the church.

521
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:22,120
 "First, apostles, second, prophets, third, are teachers.

522
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,440
 "And then those who do miracles,

523
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,680
 "then who have the gift of healing,

524
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,440
 "those who can help others,

525
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,520
 "those who have the gift of leadership,

526
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,760
 "and those who speak in tongues,

527
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,200
 "speak in unknown languages."

528
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:40,840
 Now, God is the one who puts together

529
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:45,840
 a wide variety of gifts and skills and talents together.

530
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,120
 Now, here is a list of spiritual gifts.

531
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,960
 I don't know which one you identify more,

532
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,280
 but we need to remember this is not an exhaustive list

533
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,800
 of spiritual gifts God has gifted to church.

534
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,520
 There are other lists of spiritual gifts

535
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,760
 found in other New Testament letters.

536
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,680
 But the whole point is Paul is trying to argue

537
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:12,400
 with a list that God is the one, not us.

538
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,560
 God is the one who orchestrate everyone together, right?

539
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:21,560
 Some of us went to Six Facts last week, right?

540
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,560
 I went with them.

541
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:28,520
 The whole gang we have, I'm the oldest one.

542
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:33,680
 And I thought it would be the last Six Facts trip

543
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:37,160
 I ever had in my life, because I'm getting old, right?

544
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:40,000
 But after the trip, I think I could go again.

545
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,920
 Because I can withstand the excitement, right?

546
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,640
 So some of us went there,

547
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:52,280
 and one of my favorite rides is Max Force.

548
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,080
 It's called Max Force.

549
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,480
 And it was our last roller coaster ride.

550
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,080
 And it's very exciting, right?

551
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,600
 It's very exciting.

552
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,200
 I was very happy.

553
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,400
 I was very happy, because the Max Force,

554
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:10,240
 it goes from zero to 78 miles per hour in 1.8 seconds.

555
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,000
 Think about it.

556
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,920
 Within two seconds, you go from zero to 78 miles per hour.

557
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,820
 You drive on the freeway, on a highway, right?

558
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:27,300
 Yeah, that's about, you're speeding, 78 miles per hour.

559
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:30,360
 But from zero to 78, it's less than two seconds.

560
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,560
 It was just a joy ride for me.

561
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:37,320
 And we tried that, that's our last ride,

562
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,520
 because in the park, we can often hear

563
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,880
 the launch noise of the ride.

564
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,320
 And the Max Force is just so loud.

565
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,840
 When it was launched a couple years ago,

566
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,680
 it was too loud, and the whole Guinea area

567
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,120
 could hear the noise.

568
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,320
 And the engineers had to make some modifications

569
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,480
 to the launch system, and adding some barriers,

570
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,880
 and stuff like that.

571
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:06,660
 And you know the total cost for this ride is 15 million.

572
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:11,060
 15 million, oh my goodness, right?

573
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:16,040
 You think about such a huge and complex machine.

574
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,880
 There are many, many different parts.

575
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,560
 And they all have to work together

576
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:25,560
 in order to provide the ride for the visitors, right?

577
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:31,680
 If there's one part that's missing, malfunctioning,

578
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,680
 the whole ride cannot operate, right?

579
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,280
 In fact, we were standing there for almost an hour

580
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:41,040
 for this ride, because there were maintenance.

581
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,920
 I don't know what the engineer did,

582
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,140
 and what went wrong, right?

583
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:49,040
 So part of me is like complaining, right?

584
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,860
 And part of me is thankful, right?

585
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,840
 Because there are gifted engineers

586
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,080
 who check on the machine, right?

587
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,760
 Otherwise I would not be able to go home, right?

588
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,120
 So my only complaint is the entire joyride

589
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,700
 lasts less than one minute, right?

590
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:10,640
 But my point is this is a complex and huge machine,

591
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,480
 and every single part, nuts and bolts,

592
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,780
 need to work together.

593
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,460
 The church is the same way.

594
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:20,540
 The church is a beautiful, complex, complicated,

595
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:23,500
 united, and diverse organism.

596
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:28,320
 Our church is complicated.

597
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,620
 I think all churches are complicated, right?

598
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,840
 You deal with people, deal with sinners,

599
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:36,780
 deal with different kinds of members.

600
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:39,760
 There's always complexity, right?

601
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,720
 Dealing with relational conflict, or different interests.

602
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,680
 But it's beautiful.

603
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,560
 That's what God decides,

604
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,380
 and He orchestrates everything together.

605
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,900
 And Paul continues to end this chapter by saying,

606
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,100
 are we all apostles?

607
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,580
 Are we all prophets?

608
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,040
 Are we all teachers?

609
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,980
 Do we all have the power to do miracles,

610
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,500
 to pray for miracles?

611
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,240
 Do we all have the gift of healing?

612
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,740
 Those are the gifts the Corinthians yearn for.

613
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:12,240
 Speaking in tongues, speaking in unknown languages.

614
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,360
 Do we all have the ability to interpret unknown languages?

615
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,640
 Of course not, right?

616
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:21,260
 We're all different, and every one of us is unique.

617
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:24,820
 Verse 31, so you should earnestly desire

618
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:27,780
 the most helpful gifts.

619
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:31,140
 And now let me show you a way of life that is best of all.

620
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:37,620
 Paul is saying not all of us are not equally gifted,

621
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:40,020
 not gifted in the same way.

622
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:43,480
 But he says, however you're gifted,

623
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,040
 and for sure you're gifted in some way

624
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,340
 that you can use to build the body of Christ.

625
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:54,520
 Paul is saying there's the most excellent way,

626
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:59,280
 and the most excellent way is the next chapter,

627
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,200
 chapter 13.

628
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:07,000
 Remember chapter 13 is the most famous passage in the Bible,

629
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,840
 probably the most famous because in weddings,

630
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,560
 it's often used, you know, love is patient, love is kind,

631
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:16,240
 they love poem, 1 Corinthians 13.

632
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,840
 It's written right after this chapter,

633
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,960
 and that is the most excellent way, right?

634
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,700
 When you come, when you come to the church,

635
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,000
 you need to see what God desires,

636
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,040
 united body and diverse body,

637
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,760
 and God put everything together.

638
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,480
 Yes, you're not gifted the way I am.

639
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,680
 I'm not gifted the way you are,

640
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,640
 but no matter who you are, your presence,

641
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:49,040
 your bodily presence, your physical presence,

642
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:53,160
 your service, and your talents,

643
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:57,360
 you're using your talents to contribute

644
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,440
 to the community of the church.

645
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,860
 We are all equally important in Christ,

646
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:05,600
 and we are one body, amen?

647
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,360
 - Amen.

648
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,360
 - Let's end with our verse of the week, all right?

649
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:16,200
 And remind ourselves, how can we contribute

650
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,600
 to this body, to the body of Christ?

651
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,920
 1 Corinthians 13, 13.

652
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:26,160
 Now, this is after the love poem,

653
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,600
 love is patient, love is kind.

654
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:33,520
 And verse 13, it said, "Now these three remain,

655
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,240
 "faith, hope, and love,

656
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,280
 "and the greatest of these is love."

657
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:44,200
 Now, what is love in the biblical sense?

658
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,120
 It's to serve other people.

659
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,080
 Put other first, right?

660
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,640
 That is love.

661
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,660
 Love is not sentiment.

662
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,200
 Love is loyalty.

663
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:58,480
 Love is commitment, and commit to serve other people

664
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,440
 over ourselves.

665
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,720
 That is love.

666
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,680
 And now, these three remain, faith we have,

667
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:09,500
 hope that we have, love that we have.

668
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,240
 Paul says, "The greatest of these is love."

669
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:16,300
 Because without love, the church is not possible.

670
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:19,520
 Without love, brothers and sisters in Christ,

671
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,760
 we cannot relate to one another.

672
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,560
 The love of Christ, the love of God.

673
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,320
 Let's all pray.

674
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,240
 Father, increase our love.

675
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:32,700
 For we confess sometimes we are loveless.

676
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:38,660
 With our lips, we sing praises.

677
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:43,420
 With our lips, we pray and say that you are love.

678
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:47,140
 And we thank you for your love,

679
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:49,820
 for your redeeming love,

680
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,660
 saving us from sin and from death.

681
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:57,700
 But we confess so often we just don't have love in our heart

682
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:01,740
 because we don't understand your heart.

683
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:05,900
 And your heart is nothing but perfect love.

684
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:10,480
 You want to see, you yearn to see the church united,

685
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:15,620
 yet using our diverse gifts to serve one another,

686
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,460
 to relate to one another,

687
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,340
 to have fellowship with one another,

688
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,980
 to spend time with one another.

689
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:25,940
 Father, we come and confess our sins and our shortcoming.

690
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:30,220
 And we pray that you will cleanse us

691
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:32,520
 and to cleanse our community,

692
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:36,180
 help our community, our spiritual family,

693
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,420
 our church to grow in love.

694
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:43,940
 We bind us to serve one another just as you serve us.

695
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:48,340
 Renew our loyalty, renew our faithfulness

696
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:51,140
 so that we, as we serve one another,

697
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:53,100
 as we build this body together,

698
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,700
 we see your presence and we taste your love

699
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,740
 in Christ and pray.

700
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:02,740
 Well, God bless you all.

701
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:05,780
 And next week, we're gonna come together as one body

702
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:08,580
 to serve and to worship God together.

703
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:11,740
 Please continue to pray for our city this week.

704
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:15,020
 It's gonna be in chaos and yeah, stay away from downtown.

705
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:15,900
 If you live in downtown,

706
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,740
 I know you have some traffic problem maybe,

707
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:21,700
 but pray for our city, pray for our neighbors.

708
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,140
 All right, see you next week.
