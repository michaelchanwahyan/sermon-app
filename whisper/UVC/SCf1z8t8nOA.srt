1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
 - Good morning, everyone.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,880
 Well, I've been sick for a few days,

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,240
 so I've been suffering too.

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,080
 But that's okay, yeah.

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,880
 It's the last day of 2023.

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,080
 Today's the last day, as Jinfan said.

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,960
 This is, I think this is the best way

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,120
 we can conclude this year,

9
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,500
 end with the Lord's Day on Sunday.

10
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,840
 As we go from one year to the next,

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,480
 we will think about New Year resolutions, right?

12
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,320
 - Yes.

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,140
 - We all do, right?

14
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:31,980
 - Yes.

15
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,760
 - So what do you have in mind?

16
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,800
 Maybe physical exercise, learn something new,

17
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,040
 or maybe financial planning and all that.

18
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,080
 Maybe for those who go to school,

19
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,280
 probably you have some new plannings as well.

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,280
 Maybe for questions,

21
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,160
 sometimes we talk about reading the Bible together.

22
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,480
 Have we done the Bible reading last year?

23
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,320
 - Yes.

24
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,160
 - We finished it, right?

25
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,680
 No, I didn't finish it, I didn't join it.

26
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,520
 - Some of them.

27
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,560
 - Some of them, right?

28
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,640
 Well, give them a hand, yeah, give them a hand.

29
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,000
 Yeah, very good, very good.

30
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,480
 Usually churches do is to have some big sign

31
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,760
 or big banner saying,

32
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,480
 "New Year, we're gonna do this or do that," right?

33
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,640
 "We're gonna expand our church,

34
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,080
 "and we're gonna grow together,"

35
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,880
 and something like that.

36
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,000
 Today, I want to do something a little bit different.

37
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,400
 I want to tell you how life transformation work.

38
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,700
 Because as we set the New Year goals,

39
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,800
 as we set the New Year resolutions,

40
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,600
 or think about stuff like that,

41
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,560
 not only we need to set goals,

42
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,520
 but we need to understand how we reach the goal

43
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,240
 and how life change works.

44
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,400
 So my sermon title is Atomic Wisdom.

45
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,600
 Now, atomic does not mean destructive.

46
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,280
 Okay, I know there's atomic bomb,

47
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:57,280
 but it means tiny and insignificant, atomic particle,

48
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,840
 something really, really small.

49
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,280
 And I borrowed this title from a bestseller

50
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,680
 called "Atomic Habits" by James Clear.

51
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,080
 And this bestseller is recommended to me this year

52
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:16,080
 by actually Amanda, recommend me to read this book.

53
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,000
 And I find it's very insightful book.

54
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 And the thesis of the book is success,

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,240
 all kinds of success, okay?

56
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,480
 Whether you're in school, whether you're in career,

57
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,360
 whether you're just doing exercise,

58
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,760
 just trying to be strong, all kinds of success

59
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,400
 is a product of daily, tiny habits,

60
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,400
 not a once in a lifetime action, you know?

61
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:49,400
 All kinds of changes, all kinds of positive changes

62
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,000
 have to be done in tiny little steps.

63
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,320
 And everyone can do that, and that's the good news.

64
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,680
 Now, this book is packed with insights

65
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,520
 from behavioral psychology.

66
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:06,120
 You know, behavioral psychologists observe the human nature,

67
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,760
 observe how we work, right, how we behave.

68
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,760
 And then they summarize the psychological dynamic.

69
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,600
 And as I read this book,

70
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:22,160
 I instantly, I thought of wisdom literature in the Bible.

71
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,000
 You know wisdom literature?

72
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,680
 How do you find the wisdom literature in the Bible?

73
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,400
 It's right in the middle, right?

74
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,160
 Some of the Psalms and Proverbs, Ecclesiastes,

75
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,880
 and the Book of Job, and those are wisdom literatures.

76
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,000
 It's always, wisdom literature has a feature,

77
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,480
 it is always short and clever sayings, tiny sayings.

78
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,480
 And it seems to instill us with tiny little wisdom

79
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,400
 here and there, and tell you some general truth

80
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,520
 about human nature, general truth about

81
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:03,080
 living a life of wisdom, living a life that is successful.

82
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,880
 Actually, in the Bible,

83
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,200
 wisdom is defined as practical skill.

84
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,520
 If you have wisdom, you live skillfully.

85
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,080
 You live skillfully to the life God has given you.

86
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,720
 So at times in wisdom literature in the Bible,

87
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,480
 observing human nature, and try to summarize it

88
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,820
 and teach us some of the general truths.

89
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,700
 So this sermon, I'm going to do some integration.

90
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:32,720
 I'm gonna go for some of the insights

91
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,640
 from behavioral psychology, and then we'll go into

92
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,720
 some of the passages from the Book of Proverbs,

93
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,400
 wisdom literature.

94
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,540
 So here, I want you to understand how life change works.

95
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,000
 All right, so whatever you have

96
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,120
 for your New Year resolutions, all right?

97
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,360
 If you don't have any New Year resolutions,

98
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,520
 this is time to think about it, okay?

99
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,240
 Time to think about it.

100
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,360
 But if you have New Year resolutions, how does it work?

101
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,640
 What are the principles that we can bring

102
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,080
 about changes in our lives?

103
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,000
 So here we go.

104
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,600
 First principle is the 1% power.

105
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,820
 1% power.

106
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:18,720
 That you do something tiny on a daily basis,

107
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,160
 even if this is 1%, and it's seemingly not obvious,

108
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,880
 the result will be exceptional.

109
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,360
 Now, so often in any goal we are pursuing,

110
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:33,360
 we attempt to set up some of the,

111
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,720
 some high and unrealistic expectations, right?

112
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,620
 Like I'm gonna read the whole Bible in two months.

113
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,680
 Okay, good luck to you, all right?

114
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,240
 You're not gonna happen, right?

115
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,340
 It's not gonna happen.

116
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:50,720
 If you set the goal, like next year, 2024,

117
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,180
 you're going to read the entire New Testament in one year,

118
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,320
 that may be more realistic, right?

119
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,320
 But sometimes when we set up a New Year goal,

120
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,880
 we have some unrealistic expectations,

121
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,420
 and it will require exceptional willpower.

122
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:10,960
 That's why we don't set New Year goals anymore,

123
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,600
 because we find ourselves failing all the time, right?

124
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,120
 You don't wanna fail, that's why you don't wanna set goals,

125
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,240
 right?

126
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,040
 That's kind of pessimistic, right?

127
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,040
 It's kind of sad.

128
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:27,120
 But this book says all kinds of changes happen atomically.

129
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,840
 Small, tiny changes.

130
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,400
 And far too often, tiny improvement

131
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,240
 will create long-term change.

132
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,160
 And that's how life change works.

133
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,080
 So think about daily habit.

134
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:48,600
 Daily, what can you do with just 1% effort, right?

135
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,560
 There's a chart in the book, I find it very insightful,

136
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,840
 talking about behavioral psychology.

137
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,880
 When you think of growth,

138
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,760
 we often think in a straight line, right?

139
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:02,160
 Linear progression, that's the red line right there.

140
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,800
 But actually, life change happens in the curve.

141
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,440
 In the curve.

142
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,760
 Notice the beginning of the curve.

143
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,200
 The progress is not obvious.

144
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,160
 And the author named the first phase,

145
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,000
 you know, it's not obvious in terms of the result.

146
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,760
 You don't see a lot of increase,

147
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,600
 you don't see a lot of obvious improvement yet.

148
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,920
 That, the yellow part, the author says,

149
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,840
 James Clear says, is the value of disappointment.

150
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,080
 Because you have done so much, right?

151
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,920
 And there's no result.

152
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,680
 And people usually give up at this point.

153
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,920
 So the encouragement is, if we do the 1%,

154
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,800
 which everyone can do, right?

155
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,980
 And you persist.

156
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:53,040
 And then, exponentially, changes will happen.

157
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:58,520
 So if you do 1% improvement for 365 days,

158
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:03,520
 the result at the end is 37.78 times better.

159
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,440
 Right?

160
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,680
 Isn't that cool?

161
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,380
 If you do just 1% every single day, 365 days,

162
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:16,380
 you will get the improvement result for 37 times.

163
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:21,920
 But if you do 1% decline, or you do nothing about it,

164
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,360
 or you keep on your bad habits,

165
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:29,360
 1% declines for 365 days, your result is close to zero.

166
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,640
 There's no improvement at all.

167
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,900
 Now, you can talk about any kind of result,

168
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,640
 or any kind of goal.

169
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:44,640
 Relationship, family, career, learning a new skill,

170
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:49,380
 emotional health, spiritual life, spiritual health.

171
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:53,220
 If you do negative talk all the time, right?

172
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:58,220
 You will have the graph, have the line at the bottom.

173
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:03,800
 You will decline, or you will see zero changes in your life.

174
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:09,180
 But if you do tiny habit, 1%, for 365 days,

175
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,960
 you will see a lot of improvements.

176
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,420
 Now that makes me think of wisdom literature,

177
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:18,700
 because all this wisdom sayings in the Bible,

178
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,420
 especially in the book of Proverbs,

179
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:24,580
 are usually one verse with two sub-verses,

180
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,140
 two parallel statements.

181
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:29,300
 Some of the wisdom sayings are two verses

182
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:33,320
 with parallel statements, but they are repetitive.

183
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,780
 They are tiny little statement, little and often.

184
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,100
 That is the spirit right there.

185
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,340
 Proverbs 1.7, that's the beginning of book of Proverbs.

186
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:46,340
 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge,

187
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:50,940
 but fools despise wisdom and discipline.

188
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:55,320
 The fear of the Lord is the beginning, right?

189
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,140
 The beginning, remember the beginning part

190
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:00,340
 of the life change curve.

191
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:04,840
 It doesn't see a lot of improvement, right?

192
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,100
 At least in the beginning, but it's so important.

193
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,580
 Now Proverbs doesn't do big talk.

194
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,460
 He always do small talks.

195
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:16,640
 Talking about beginning here.

196
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,340
 Talking about you persist from the beginning,

197
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:23,860
 then you will see along the line, 1%,

198
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:28,860
 remember 365 days you see potential changes, right?

199
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:33,620
 Three, 30 some times changes.

200
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:38,580
 Now some of the couples who got married in this church

201
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,860
 went through the premarital counseling with me.

202
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:46,660
 And the premarital counseling, I have about 10 sessions,

203
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:49,140
 and I always end with this one.

204
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:53,020
 It's a book called Love List.

205
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:56,660
 Now this book, we read this book,

206
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:00,020
 my wife and I read this book in our 10th anniversary,

207
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,360
 some years ago, right?

208
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,880
 So we went on a short vacation and we pick a book

209
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,240
 and we read together, right?

210
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,340
 How romantic is that?

211
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:08,700
 (audience laughing)

212
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,940
 So we read the book together.

213
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:13,100
 It's a tiny, tiny book called Love List.

214
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:18,100
 And it's a very interesting book and it's very insightful.

215
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,540
 Because people always think that a great relationship

216
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:26,460
 requires a lot of energy, requires a lot of expectations.

217
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,500
 Right, you gotta set a very, very high standard.

218
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,340
 You gotta do tons of things

219
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:34,900
 in order to have a mature, good relationship.

220
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,840
 The book says no.

221
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,340
 It doesn't work that way.

222
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,700
 Have you think about it?

223
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,920
 Think about it.

224
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,340
 It doesn't work that way.

225
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,540
 A successful relationship, a good relationship,

226
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,860
 doesn't work that way.

227
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:53,060
 It works because there are tiny, daily habits

228
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:55,500
 the couples or the people in the relationship

229
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,340
 are committed to do.

230
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,180
 And everyone can do it.

231
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:02,680
 And at the end of the book it says,

232
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,900
 once a day you do two things.

233
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,320
 Once a week you do two things.

234
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,620
 Once in six months you do two things.

235
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,540
 Once in a year you do two things.

236
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,560
 How many things you have to do?

237
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,640
 Eight, right?

238
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,400
 Only eight things.

239
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:21,400
 And once a day it says take time to touch.

240
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:25,660
 So, like for the couple, you take time to touch.

241
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,000
 If only for a minute, right?

242
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,960
 So in my household we express the touch

243
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,880
 by patting on the head.

244
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:39,020
 So I pat on the head of my wife, of my children.

245
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:42,400
 Yeah, you know, don't attack me, okay?

246
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,140
 It's like a dog, right?

247
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,320
 It's kind of cute, right?

248
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:50,040
 So what I do every single day is that I take the time,

249
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,040
 whether she's doing dishes or whatever,

250
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,100
 I go over there and, you know,

251
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,100
 I give her a touch for one minute.

252
00:12:59,100 --> 00:12:59,920
 That's it.

253
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,860
 The second thing I do daily is to find something

254
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,440
 that make us both laugh, right?

255
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,700
 Life is stressful.

256
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,980
 You want your family, you want your relationship

257
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,720
 to be joyful, then you have to find something

258
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,800
 every single day that make you both laugh, right?

259
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,620
 Now that's easy to do, right?

260
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:28,200
 Scrolling on the phone and I saw some TikTok video.

261
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,520
 It's hilarious.

262
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,080
 I show it to her, right?

263
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,260
 She doesn't laugh, I laugh, right?

264
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,820
 That's okay, right?

265
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,180
 And that's what we do every single day.

266
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,880
 Once a day, we do two habits.

267
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,900
 Now again, the essence is it's the tiny habit

268
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:47,400
 that can change a lot of different things.

269
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:51,660
 Little and often, that is the key.

270
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:55,160
 Some of you know that I took a PhD seminar

271
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,020
 the middle of this year.

272
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,100
 This is the toughest class I've ever had.

273
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:06,260
 Not only me, but other students taking the class with me.

274
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:09,880
 They all think this is the toughest class

275
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,620
 in the entire degree.

276
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:17,480
 The class is advanced Hebrew grammar.

277
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,360
 Sounds fun, right?

278
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,780
 Sounds really fun, right?

279
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,280
 Advanced Hebrew grammar, right?

280
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:28,460
 So in order to pass this class, you have to pass a test,

281
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:31,720
 which is a biblical Hebrew vocabulary test.

282
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,960
 And it tests you for 100 random words,

283
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:42,320
 any word that appears in the Bible more than 50 times.

284
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,280
 All right?

285
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:46,120
 And the test will pick some of the random words

286
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,560
 and then list them out in Hebrew,

287
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,300
 and then you have to give a translation in English.

288
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,800
 And in order to pass the exam,

289
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,820
 you have to get 87 over 100.

290
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:01,740
 87, it's not 50.

291
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,560
 I heard it wrong.

292
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,560
 No, it's 87.

293
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,100
 And half of our class failed.

294
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,680
 Half of our class succeeded.

295
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,020
 It was kind of scary, right?

296
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:19,660
 So before the class, I took about two months.

297
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,000
 Actually, I delayed my start.

298
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,460
 I end up like five weeks before the class, before the exam.

299
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,040
 So what did I do?

300
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,200
 I simply used my downtime.

301
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:34,520
 You watch TV, there's commercial, right?

302
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,120
 Three minutes or four minutes.

303
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,360
 And then I go into the vocabulary book,

304
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,840
 and then I try to memorize them, right?

305
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,200
 I try to connect them and try to memorize it.

306
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,840
 And then there's sometimes downtime, right?

307
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,060
 When we have conversations together.

308
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:54,120
 I'll scroll up, open the book in my phone,

309
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,320
 and then I'll review the vocabularies.

310
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,120
 And that's what I do.

311
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,480
 And there are some other students

312
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,180
 who try to cram all these words into their brain

313
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:08,400
 one night or two nights, right?

314
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,980
 It's not going to work, right?

315
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,040
 So I passed the class.

316
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,380
 I passed the vocabulary test.

317
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,220
 What did I do?

318
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,320
 I did nothing significant.

319
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,520
 It's little and often, right?

320
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,700
 Most of you who are students, this is what you do, right?

321
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,900
 This is what you do.

322
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,560
 I remember I took Chemistry 101.

323
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:32,620
 There were 10 exams in the entire semester.

324
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:36,020
 I failed the first one because I missed the exam day.

325
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,780
 I show up on class, it was an exam day.

326
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,520
 I had nothing in my brain.

327
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,240
 So I failed the first test.

328
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,040
 And there are nine more tests to go.

329
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,880
 And what did I do?

330
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,920
 I made up my mind.

331
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:53,080
 I commit myself to be successful in this course

332
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,840
 because I don't want to retake it, right?

333
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,900
 It's gonna cost a lot of money.

334
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:57,880
 So what did I do?

335
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:02,060
 Every single class, right after we are dismissed,

336
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:06,420
 I go to the library and I review for one hour, right?

337
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:09,160
 Now, so often we attempted to think,

338
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,020
 "Okay, maybe we should go home, right?

339
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:14,240
 "If I go home, I get four hours to study, right?

340
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,240
 "And do you want four hours to study

341
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,400
 "or one hour to study?"

342
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,720
 Of course you want four hours, right?

343
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,680
 But what I did was I go to the library

344
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:27,720
 right after the class, while the material is still fresh,

345
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,040
 I'll review it only for one hour or so.

346
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,760
 And then I'll go home.

347
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:37,140
 And then I ace every single test, all nine of them.

348
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:40,040
 And then I got an A at the end.

349
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:44,960
 Again, it's the tiny changes, insignificant habits

350
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,460
 that would pave the path for fruitfulness.

351
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:53,780
 This is what we do for spiritual life as well, right?

352
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:57,340
 Proverbs 9, 10, "The fear of the Lord

353
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,880
 "is the beginning of wisdom.

354
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,400
 "Knowledge of the Holy One is understanding."

355
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,980
 You see the parallels here?

356
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,060
 What is the fear of the Lord?

357
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:09,100
 The fear of the Lord is that you fear God

358
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:12,120
 and you relate to God in a proper way.

359
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,400
 And that is the real knowledge of the Holy One.

360
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,760
 You know God and you fear Him and you are related to Him,

361
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,680
 you have a right relationship with God, your Creator.

362
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,600
 That is the foundation of small things.

363
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,680
 Small habits will go a long way.

364
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,160
 Now I want to test you.

365
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,500
 How many of you do push-ups?

366
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,480
 How many of you?

367
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,920
 How many push-ups can you do?

368
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:41,920
 How many?

369
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,960
 25?

370
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,220
 I do 40 push-ups every single day.

371
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:48,840
 It's not much.

372
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,080
 How did I begin?

373
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,200
 I begin with 10, right?

374
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:59,200
 And I add one the next day, I add five next week, right?

375
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,840
 And now I do 40 push-ups every single day, right?

376
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,500
 It's just my way to strengthen myself.

377
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,080
 How about plank?

378
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,740
 How many of you do plank?

379
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,940
 And how long do you do?

380
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:17,180
 I do four minute plank every single day.

381
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,500
 How did I start?

382
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,740
 I start one minute, right?

383
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:25,420
 And then one minute and 15 second, one minute and 30 second,

384
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:28,020
 two minute, three minute, and four minute, right?

385
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:31,860
 And my goal next year is five minutes, right?

386
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:32,980
 Now how do we do that?

387
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:36,500
 Small, tiny habit of 1% power.

388
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,940
 This goes the same way for our Bible reading

389
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:44,640
 and our daily prayer life, right?

390
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,300
 It doesn't have to be huge, significant change.

391
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:53,080
 It's not a massive action that God is calling for.

392
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:57,300
 It's just tiny, little habit that will change you,

393
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,180
 that will effect life changes.

394
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,460
 So 1% power, that's the first principle.

395
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,140
 The second principle is incentives

396
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,380
 and this incentive are effective.

397
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,780
 The behavioral psychologists find out

398
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:14,340
 if there's pain involved, if there's suffering involved,

399
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:17,060
 people are more likely to follow through,

400
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,940
 especially financial pain.

401
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:23,540
 That's why people pay money to go to gym, right?

402
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:28,900
 That's why you go to exercise class and you pay, right?

403
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,620
 After you pay the amount,

404
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,740
 there's more likelihood for you to go.

405
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:38,620
 The more likelihood you keep on doing physical exercise.

406
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:42,860
 When money is involved, the psychologist tells us

407
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:46,700
 your chances of success increase by three times.

408
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:50,940
 You pay to go to school, right?

409
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:56,580
 You better go to school because you pay for it, right?

410
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:01,420
 There's a website called stick.com

411
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,620
 and you sign up, you set up your goal

412
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:07,060
 and it will ask you to pay money

413
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:12,860
 to something that you hate, like an anti-charity, right?

414
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:15,740
 For those of you who don't support Trump,

415
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,180
 you donate to Trump.

416
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,020
 If you fail in your goal,

417
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,860
 if you fail to do your daily exercise

418
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,860
 or fail to meet your goal,

419
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:27,740
 you're gonna donate money to Trump that you hate, right?

420
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:31,140
 For those of you who hate Biden, you can choose Biden.

421
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,580
 And then when you meet your goal, you report it

422
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:39,020
 and then you stop the payment for your credit card, right?

423
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:41,140
 Money is involved.

424
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,460
 If you do that or you don't,

425
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,460
 you will kind of lose money

426
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:48,300
 and you better work on it, right?

427
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:51,580
 That's how it works.

428
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:55,100
 There's reward and disincentive.

429
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,220
 If there's incentive in your life-changing goals

430
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:02,140
 or new US solutions, the psychology is applied.

431
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:05,300
 The rate of success is better

432
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,860
 if there's incentive or disincentive.

433
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,060
 That's the same way in wisdom literature.

434
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:14,860
 It says one man gives freely if someone is generous to give,

435
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:17,860
 yet gains even more.

436
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:21,980
 Another withholds and comes to poverty.

437
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:24,220
 A generous man will prosper.

438
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:28,660
 He who refreshes others will himself be refreshed.

439
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,820
 What is the incentive here?

440
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,740
 What is the reward here?

441
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:36,060
 The Bible says that if you honor your wealth,

442
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:40,940
 you honor God with your money, you will increase.

443
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:44,380
 You will benefit others and you will benefit yourself.

444
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,100
 That is what Jesus said.

445
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:49,300
 You lay up treasures in heaven, not on earth.

446
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,780
 And then your reward will be heavenly, right?

447
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,540
 If you will believe in the gospel,

448
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,460
 you believe in eternal life, right?

449
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:00,020
 The reward is eternal.

450
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,900
 The reward is there.

451
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:05,700
 So once you think about, okay, I need to do maybe New Year.

452
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:11,180
 One of my resolutions is to be faithful in tithes and offering,

453
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:13,660
 to be generous, right?

454
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:18,100
 Not to hold tight to the wealth God has given to me,

455
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,380
 but to benefit other people,

456
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:24,900
 to give it, to support the ministry or support the church

457
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,140
 or support the cause that is heavenly,

458
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,060
 that is gospel related.

459
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,740
 You need to understand there's reward

460
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:35,500
 and the reward will be great.

461
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,940
 There is incentive there.

462
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:42,420
 But if you do not want to do that, if you withhold,

463
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,820
 then there's this incentive.

464
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:49,020
 Your life becomes poor, right?

465
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,260
 It's always needy.

466
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:54,860
 If you practice generosity, then God will honor you,

467
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:55,980
 He will bless you,

468
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:59,420
 He will continue to make your life rich.

469
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:02,260
 That is the incentive and disincentive there.

470
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,460
 So think about your New Year resolutions.

471
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:08,220
 What are the incentives or what are the disincentive, right?

472
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,940
 Yeah, one of the disincentive I can think of,

473
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,940
 if you want to read the Bible next year,

474
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:17,820
 if you fail your goal, you sign up stick.com

475
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,500
 and you give me $500,

476
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,740
 that would be a great motivation for you, right?

477
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:27,020
 Because you don't want the $500 to go into my pocket, right?

478
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:30,500
 And I promise you, if you fail in your goal,

479
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,300
 you give me $500 at the end of the year,

480
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,020
 I'm gonna keep it for you.

481
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:37,580
 I won't use it, I won't spend it,

482
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,340
 and then the following year, if you meet your goal,

483
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,540
 I'll give it back, right?

484
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:44,940
 And those kind of incentives or disincentives,

485
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:47,380
 you can think of in your New Year resolutions,

486
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,740
 and that is wisdom.

487
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:52,820
 Number three, specifics are better.

488
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,820
 Now the wisdom literature

489
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:58,420
 use a lot of different illustrations to talk about wisdom,

490
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:02,580
 usually animals and creatures on Earth.

491
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,980
 Sometimes these creatures don't seem to be strong,

492
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:09,100
 don't seem to be wise, but the observers,

493
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:12,740
 you know, wisdom teacher are good observers.

494
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,500
 They observe the creation,

495
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:17,660
 they observe how the creatures work, right?

496
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:20,860
 And then they learn lessons of wisdom.

497
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,820
 They learn how to be wise.

498
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:27,340
 Chapter six, it says, "Go to the end,

499
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:31,420
 "use lucker, consider the ways and be wise."

500
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:34,460
 They don't have commander, they don't have ruler,

501
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:39,460
 they don't have king, yet they store provisions in summer,

502
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:43,580
 and gather the food at harvest,

503
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:46,740
 at the right time, specific time, right?

504
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,340
 And that is wisdom.

505
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:51,380
 And psychologist tells us the more specific your goals are,

506
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:54,660
 the likelihood the success will be.

507
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:59,420
 If your goals are general, you know, non-specific,

508
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:03,460
 you are planning to fail.

509
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:09,580
 And there's a study done in UK on physical exercise.

510
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:12,140
 So they divide the people into two groups.

511
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:16,660
 First group, group A, is that people who are committed

512
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:19,660
 to do exercise on a daily basis,

513
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,820
 and they do the checkbox, okay?

514
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:25,460
 I'm gonna commit to do pushup, do crunches,

515
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:28,460
 do plank, walk a little bit, right?

516
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:31,260
 They check the checkbox.

517
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,820
 That's group A.

518
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,780
 And they follow through,

519
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:39,780
 and the success rate for this group, group one, is 35%.

520
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:44,820
 Group B, they also do the checkbox,

521
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:48,300
 but they write specifics to their goals.

522
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:53,300
 Like time of the day, day of the week that they do exercise,

523
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:57,900
 and how long exactly, how many minutes that they going to do.

524
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:01,300
 20 minutes they gonna check, and then write it down.

525
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,900
 And they specify the exact time, place,

526
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:08,500
 where, when to do the goal.

527
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:12,500
 And the success rate is 91%.

528
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,620
 Three times higher.

529
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:18,780
 So the more specific that you go,

530
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:21,700
 the more successful you will be, right?

531
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:24,060
 Your goals will be achieved,

532
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:27,860
 and the likelihood to have result is higher.

533
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,580
 Let's say you wanna commit yourself

534
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:34,660
 to restructure your worship life, okay?

535
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,460
 Every single week, the Lord's Day,

536
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:39,540
 you're gonna come here and worship, right?

537
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,740
 And that's a very, very good goal, right?

538
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,820
 That's a very good goal, because as the people of God,

539
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,780
 we need to worship Him, right?

540
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:49,300
 The day of Sabbath, or day of celebrations,

541
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:53,180
 day of worship, we set aside time for God, right?

542
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,020
 Every single week.

543
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:56,620
 That's a good goal, but it's very general.

544
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,980
 To be more specific, you should say,

545
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:01,940
 I'm gonna commit myself to worship God

546
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:06,660
 every single Sunday, and I'm gonna come here

547
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:10,220
 at 11.16 in the morning.

548
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:13,460
 By 11.16, my butt is here.

549
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:18,620
 And I'm gonna sit at the same place every single week.

550
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:23,260
 The when and where are specified,

551
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:25,860
 and the rate of success is higher.

552
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:30,940
 That, the same way goes for any kind of goal.

553
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:33,220
 Your physical health, emotional health,

554
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,020
 or even your spiritual health.

555
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:37,980
 That's how it works.

556
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:40,580
 And then another principle, number four,

557
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:42,980
 and that's the last one I'll continue next week.

558
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:45,980
 Is community influences you.

559
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:49,900
 It has power to impact you.

560
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,940
 The people that you hang out with,

561
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:56,260
 the people that you build friendship with,

562
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,500
 the people who are part of your family

563
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:02,460
 will have impact on you, and the impact is significant.

564
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:05,900
 Proverbs says the same thing, 13.20.

565
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:09,100
 Whoever walks with the wise becomes wise.

566
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:15,020
 And the friends or the companion of fools will suffer harm.

567
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:19,200
 If you wanna experience destruction,

568
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,620
 you hang out with the fools.

569
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:23,340
 If you want to have wisdom,

570
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,100
 if you wanna have successful life,

571
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:30,900
 you walk with other who are wise as well.

572
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:33,180
 And there's a study on the effect of people

573
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:35,700
 on one's behavior.

574
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,100
 You know, how people around them behave

575
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:41,460
 will affect that specific person.

576
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,420
 So that study is very interesting.

577
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:48,420
 They send out actors, actresses, to the buffet line.

578
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:52,980
 You know, you go to a buffet restaurant,

579
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:56,020
 and you pick up some food, right, on your plate,

580
00:29:56,020 --> 00:30:01,020
 and the actors are being taught to go into the buffet line,

581
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:05,380
 and they pile up all kinds of food on the plate.

582
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:08,620
 You know, the more they get, the better, right?

583
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:12,540
 So the actors act that way in order to influence

584
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:14,420
 those who are not acting.

585
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:17,340
 You know, the typical restaurant customers,

586
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:21,500
 they're trying to line up at the buffet to get their food.

587
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:26,500
 And they wanna see how this will influence the next person,

588
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:30,740
 and how much food they will get, right?

589
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:31,580
 It's very interesting.

590
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:36,580
 The result is, the result for men and women are different.

591
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:41,940
 Men has no impact.

592
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:47,740
 For women, because the next person is piling up more food,

593
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:51,700
 the women are more likely to get more food.

594
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:58,300
 The point is, your community works.

595
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:02,260
 You gather, you study the Bible with other people,

596
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:05,180
 you join a class for exercise,

597
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:10,180
 you go to a fellowship group, you study in the library,

598
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:13,580
 the environment, other people will have impact on you.

599
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,180
 So in order to increase the rate of success,

600
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,740
 you have to find the right community.

601
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,960
 You cannot do solo.

602
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:25,380
 Let's say you wanna improve your academic study.

603
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,340
 What is the best way?

604
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:33,340
 For me, if I study at home, it would not be helpful for me,

605
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:36,380
 because my wife doesn't study.

606
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:39,380
 She's listening to music and watching TV show.

607
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:42,820
 Huge distractions, right?

608
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,020
 Huge temptations.

609
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:47,620
 I have to go away from her, right?

610
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:51,620
 I have to go somewhere that is fruitful

611
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:56,900
 for my study, like library, right?

612
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,740
 Or be myself, be by myself.

613
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:04,020
 So the whole point is, you have to find friends

614
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:08,660
 and people who can influence you positively, right?

615
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:12,380
 So there are more insights I can share,

616
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:15,280
 or more wisdom I can share, and that will be next week.

617
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,600
 But today, I would like to conclude

618
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,020
 with some of the suggestions I have.

619
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:25,560
 It's for the new year, 2024, new year.

620
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,460
 I'll suggest three areas you should think

621
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:32,380
 about new year resolutions, new year goals for you.

622
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,860
 First is spiritual health.

623
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:38,420
 How important that is, very, very important.

624
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:42,720
 It's very important you will take time

625
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,660
 to read the word of God, right?

626
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,900
 Not just reading more of the Bible,

627
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,900
 it's learning how to read better,

628
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,960
 how to be a good reader of scripture,

629
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,900
 praying, prayer life, it's part of our spiritual health.

630
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:01,660
 Right, we receive the word of God

631
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:06,100
 through reading scripture, we talk to God

632
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,820
 in our daily prayer, right?

633
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,300
 And part of the good things about going to fellowship

634
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,900
 is that we can pray together.

635
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:17,220
 And by praying together, somebody is praying,

636
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,480
 people around you are praying,

637
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,420
 and it will influence you, impact you to pray.

638
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,840
 Worship is part of it.

639
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:30,600
 Take time that is set apart for worshiping God

640
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:34,760
 to come in person, right, if possible.

641
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,620
 Come in person and worship God.

642
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:40,720
 Spiritual health, you know, you need to set some goals,

643
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,920
 or maybe you should read a spiritual book,

644
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:46,720
 a Christian book, a good book

645
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,020
 that will help you grow spiritually.

646
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:54,040
 2024, maybe you should pick one of the good books out there,

647
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:57,280
 right, in the library, or you want some recommendation

648
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,960
 I can give to you.

649
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,800
 In the morning service, I talk about this,

650
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,720
 and right after, a couple of people talk to me,

651
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,920
 "Hey, can you recommend one or two

652
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:09,700
 "for me to read through in 2024?"

653
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:13,060
 Spiritual health, emotional health.

654
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:18,160
 New year, 2024, it just dawned on me this year

655
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:23,160
 that the emotional life for every single one of us

656
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,780
 is so important.

657
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:28,720
 How do we manage different emotions?

658
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,140
 How do we manage them well?

659
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:33,200
 I'll have more to talk about next week,

660
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,460
 but this is something for you to think about.

661
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:39,400
 You know, your emotional health impacts

662
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,000
 your spiritual relationship with God,

663
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,800
 and your spiritual relationship with God

664
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,640
 impact your emotional life as well.

665
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:51,240
 And number three is physical health, physical health.

666
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:54,060
 You wanna be stronger and stronger, right?

667
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:59,280
 And live a healthy lifestyle, right?

668
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,160
 Stay strong and stay healthy, right?

669
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,640
 Set some goals for yourself, right?

670
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:10,640
 And then remember, 1% is powerful, right?

671
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,160
 Do tiny little changes, little and often,

672
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,400
 and then at the end of the year,

673
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:20,400
 you get results 30-some percent of 30-some times results.

674
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,120
 And let's do that.

675
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,280
 And my final prayer for you,

676
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,440
 and we're gonna pray together,

677
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,960
 is that dear God, as this year comes to an end,

678
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:37,360
 help me to know what I need to get rid of

679
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,140
 in order to have more room for you,

680
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,100
 for what you have in store for my life.

681
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,760
 Let's all pray together.

682
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:49,680
 Father, we wanna give you thanks

683
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,360
 because in this entire year,

684
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:57,120
 from the beginning to the end to today, you are faithful.

685
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:03,120
 Yes, we go through our life journey with ups and downs,

686
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,200
 and with all these turns and twists,

687
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,880
 but we continue to acknowledge that you are faithful.

688
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,360
 You're faithful to us,

689
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,960
 and thank you for your loving kindness.

690
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,500
 In the next year, in the new year to come,

691
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:20,080
 we know we are not in control,

692
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,980
 but we do know that we need to make room for you,

693
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:27,420
 for your blessing, for your grace,

694
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:30,040
 for your work in our lives.

695
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,480
 And I pray that you will continue to help us

696
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,280
 to be obedient, to be open,

697
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,280
 to listen to your voice,

698
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,480
 so that in the next year, 2024,

699
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,540
 we look forward to walking with you,

700
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:48,240
 to experience you, to go deeper with you,

701
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,980
 to get to know you better, get to know you more.

702
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:56,560
 Help us to rebuild, reestablish

703
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,400
 some of the tiny daily habits,

704
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,900
 habits that are life-changing,

705
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:07,180
 habits that are seemingly tiny and insignificant,

706
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,660
 but will make our life fruitful.

707
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:14,860
 And I pray that we'll read your scripture more,

708
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:17,940
 pray to you more, and worship you more, and give more.

709
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:21,120
 And I pray that you'll grant us wisdom

710
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,780
 to manage our emotions.

711
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:28,720
 Help us to go to you when we are in need.

712
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:34,380
 And Father, we commit our whole body into your hand,

713
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,800
 knowing that our physical health

714
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,420
 will impact every single area,

715
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:44,160
 our emotional life, our spiritual health, and vice versa.

716
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:48,760
 And I pray that we'll grow holistically.

717
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:55,000
 So we put our hope in you, knowing that in year 24,

718
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,860
 you have so much in store for us,

719
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,300
 because you are our good God.

720
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:04,780
 I pray that we'll experience your love and your grace.

721
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,840
 And help our church to grow together,

722
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,060
 so that we will honor you,

723
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:13,500
 and proclaim your name in Christ, in praise.

724
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:17,860
 Well, God bless you, and see you next year.

725
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,860
