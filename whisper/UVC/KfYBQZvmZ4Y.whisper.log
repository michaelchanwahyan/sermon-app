[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.820]   to finish the long series on Apostles Creed.
[00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:06.980]   All right, Apostles Creed.
[00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:07.900]   This is a long series.
[00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.140]   I think this is part number nine or 10.
[00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.440]   We began with the series and saying that
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.260]   the Creed of the Apostles are like
[00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.200]   roadmap of Christian faith.
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.380]   I remember when I was still in college
[00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.460]   and there were a bunch of guys and girls,
[00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.020]   brother and sisters, we grew up together
[00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.060]   in a local church and we were still
[00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.040]   in the college fellowship in my home church.
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.980]   Had quite a close friends and we grew up together.
[00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.920]   And back then we were all solid Christians,
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.440]   standing together, serving together,
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.300]   at least judging from what we said
[00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.740]   and how we act back then in those years.
[00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.820]   But as years go by, some have decided to quit.
[00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.580]   Some have decided to drop out of Christian faith altogether.
[00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.500]   But as I continue to discover,
[00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.380]   some of these friends quit
[00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:12.400]   because they reject the Christian faith.
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.020]   And as I continue to discover,
[00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.100]   they have some sort of truncated version
[00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.860]   or truncated understanding of what
[00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.100]   Christian faith is all about.
[00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.940]   For instance, I don't know what got into their thinking.
[00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.380]   One friend believes that Jesus is just a man,
[00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.600]   just a typical human being,
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.160]   and teaching mankind how to be good for some reason.
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.660]   But I find it interesting.
[00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:50.980]   And then the sort of Jesus that he believes in
[00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.300]   is simply a moral teacher.
[00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.020]   So it is understandable why there's no point
[00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.620]   to continue to follow Jesus, right?
[00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.820]   Because if Jesus is just a moral teacher,
[00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.060]   and what the heck does he do?
[00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.060]   What the heck does Christianity do to you, right?
[00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.060]   There are many moral teachers in the world or in history,
[00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.420]   right, and Jesus is one of them.
[00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.340]   And again, as I continue to discover,
[00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.460]   this is sort of a truncated, reduced understanding
[00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.940]   of what Christian faith is all about.
[00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.940]   Another friend of mine drops out of the Christian walk
[00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.300]   because life gets tough.
[00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.600]   Don't get me wrong, life does get tough.
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.340]   Different circumstances or difficulties
[00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.700]   happen along the way, and then sometimes we lost focus.
[00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.800]   And I think this friend of mine definitely presupposes
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.240]   that following Jesus means nothing
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.020]   but everything will go well, right?
[00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.900]   Now, if that version of Christianity shattered
[00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.020]   by different difficult circumstances in our lives,
[00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.420]   then definitely you will drop out, right?
[00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.580]   Now, again, I wanna focus on saying
[00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.580]   that this sort of understanding is problematic
[00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:16.160]   because following Jesus is being thought of
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.620]   as the skies are always blue and joy without sorrow
[00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:21.540]   and all that.
[00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.500]   And I tell you this, these kind of thinking
[00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.500]   are nothing but heresy, nothing but heresy, right?
[00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.980]   We are being blown by different cultural winds of our day.
[00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.380]   And the culture script has always been saying to us,
[00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:44.380]   hey, your life will go well because God is good.
[00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.640]   If your life doesn't go well,
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.280]   then there's some problem with God, right?
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.680]   There's some problem with your faith or anything like that.
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.760]   So you will automatically drop out, right?
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.760]   In our days and age, we love to pick and choose.
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.840]   We do, we love to pick and choose, right?
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.640]   I do that too, right?
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.440]   We go on Amazon, AZ, whatever that is, right?
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.260]   Recently, I was buying some item off Amazon
[00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.180]   and it took me quite a few minutes to pick and choose.
[00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.820]   I look at the customer view
[00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.260]   and I want to find the best deal I can get, right?
[00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.660]   It's for my benefit, right?
[00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.220]   That sort of mentality, if we bring to faith,
[00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.040]   it is problematic.
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:38.220]   And we think that sometimes we are tempted to think
[00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.220]   that the Bible, the Christian faith is like Whole Foods,
[00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.100]   right?
[00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.560]   Ever been to a Whole Foods?
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.000]   You just go in and, you know, to a section.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.460]   You can pick the salad you want.
[00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.700]   You pick up some items or drop some items, right?
[00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.920]   Not interested, you just decide not to buy it.
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.500]   And I tell you, this is the biggest lie
[00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.140]   Satan is telling us.
[00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:10.120]   In the Bible, particularly in the Psalms,
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.360]   in the Old Testament, you see the poet, the believers,
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.800]   they struggle with their life circumstances.
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.000]   They struggle with suffering.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.880]   They suffer from pains and sickness,
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.780]   but they never drop out.
[00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.940]   The only thing we know they are not dropping out
[00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.900]   because they, it's the fact that they are praying.
[00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.640]   The fact that they are struggling with God.
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.700]   They struggle mightily with God.
[00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.740]   When life is good, they praise God.
[00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.380]   When life is good, they give credit to God.
[00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.500]   But when life goes through a valley,
[00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:48.500]   they lament, they struggle, they complain
[00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.060]   until their faith is refined
[00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.580]   and their relationship with God is so polished.
[00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.940]   Have you ever seen a couple who are married for many years?
[00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:04.260]   Have you ever seen one of those couples, married couples?
[00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.220]   Married for so many years, okay?
[00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:13.020]   If you know them well, you know that their relationship
[00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.100]   is no more the kind of, you know,
[00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.760]   rosy, romantic stuff, right?
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.700]   They are, they passed that stage.
[00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.060]   I mean, they still have romance.
[00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.940]   They still have romance, but it's a different kind, right?
[00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.700]   The beginning phrase of the relationship
[00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.220]   of a married couple, probably just puppy love
[00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:33.720]   or something like that, right?
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:35.560]   It's very warm.
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:40.280]   I'm not going to talk down on those experiences.
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.840]   Those are great experiences.
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.840]   However, when the couple are committed to walk together,
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.360]   you find that their lives and their relationship
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.400]   is mature, right?
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.160]   And there you go, in years of experiencing
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.600]   the relationship together, walking together,
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:03.120]   you find husband and wife,
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:08.640]   they do have, you know, they do have mistakes.
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.120]   They sin against one another.
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.560]   They oppose one another.
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.320]   They fought, right?
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:17.160]   They argue.
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:21.460]   However, you see also the maturity of love,
[00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:25.520]   which means forgiveness, right?
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:30.520]   They learn to overlook each other's shortcomings.
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:35.800]   And the relationship is refined and continue to grow.
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.000]   And that sort of relationship is a great picture
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.600]   of our relationship with God, right?
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.840]   Our spiritual journey with God is exactly like that.
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.560]   We grow in the midst of difficulties.
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.280]   We grow in good times and bad times.
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:54.440]   And we grow also in our ability to discern,
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.880]   to evaluate things on earth,
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.640]   biblically and spiritually.
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:03.800]   And we grow in our ability to take on things that matter.
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:08.160]   As my relationship with God continues to grow,
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.640]   I know that there is something that really matter,
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:16.240]   eternal value, something of eternity,
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.440]   something that does not change and will continue to grow.
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.460]   And that is the most important thing
[00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:23.280]   that matters in my life.
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.640]   You know, I grew up, as I said,
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.880]   I grew up in my good years, you know, in college.
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.980]   I lost some friends, you know,
[00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:34.600]   but what the hell, I don't care, right?
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.520]   I know, I get to know other new friends.
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:40.080]   I get to know other people, right?
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.960]   It's like, it's like traveling on a train, right?
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:47.600]   There are some people who enter into the car
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:51.260]   and then some, you know, along the way, they exit the car.
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:57.160]   A few of them stay together until the destination.
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.840]   You know, people come and people go,
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.320]   but what is most important in your relationship with God
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:07.220]   is that you need to discern and you need to stick to
[00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:09.440]   what is most important.
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.400]   What really matters in your life, right?
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.700]   Romans 8.
[00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:17.560]   Romans 8.
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:26.600]   It gives us the biggest possible roadmap
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.920]   of our Christian journey.
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:35.280]   This is the biggest, like 50,000 feet above bird eye view
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.800]   of what Christian journey is all about,
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:41.480]   what God is doing in your life.
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.560]   Romans 8, 29.
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:48.600]   For God knew his people in advance.
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:52.000]   He chose them to become like his son,
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.880]   so that his son, Jesus Christ,
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:59.400]   would be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters.
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:03.900]   And having chosen them, he called them to come to him.
[00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:06.000]   And having called them to come to him,
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.600]   he gave them right standing with himself.
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:13.800]   And having given them right standing with himself,
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:18.120]   God also gave them his glory.
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:24.120]   Now, this is a bird eye view
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:28.000]   of what your relationship with God should look like.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.040]   All right?
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.800]   Everything aside, all right?
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.600]   Oh, whether I have a good time or bad time,
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:37.320]   whether I have good buddies to walk with me,
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.340]   it's not even in this picture.
[00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:43.600]   God knew his people in advance,
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.320]   chose them to become his son.
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.800]   Now, we can call this sanctification.
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:53.300]   You know, when you started to follow Jesus,
[00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:56.800]   in definitely in different circumstances,
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.340]   some people come to Jesus in their difficult times.
[00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:02.860]   Some of them, you know, mountaintop experience,
[00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:05.600]   they come to know Christ himself.
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.720]   The process is still the same.
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:10.720]   The process of sanctification,
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.920]   sanctifying your life, right?
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.160]   God chose you.
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.080]   To be like his son.
[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:21.440]   It's a long, lifelong process
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:26.160]   that you will continue to become more and more like who?
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.680]   Well, not your old self.
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:29.680]   Have you ever checked the mirror recently?
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:31.400]   Look at yourself.
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:32.320]   Have you changed?
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:36.560]   You know, a couple of years ago, many years ago,
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.400]   definitely you change, right?
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.320]   You know, I got more, you know, gray hair
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:44.640]   and, you know, wrinkles in here and there, you know?
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.800]   No matter what I do to myself.
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.320]   But, you know, I continue to grow older.
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:56.560]   But in the process that God has launched in your life,
[00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:59.880]   when you decide to profess that Jesus is my Lord,
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:02.520]   Jesus is the Christ, Jesus is my savior,
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:03.840]   and he died for my sin,
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.960]   and he rose from the dead for my hope,
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:10.320]   I kick in, God kick in.
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:13.400]   The lifelong process of sanctification
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.720]   is a process of sanctifying you,
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.680]   making you like who?
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:20.080]   Like his son, right?
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.040]   Hopefully at the end of the process,
[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:26.560]   you will become more like his one and only son,
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:27.480]   Jesus Christ.
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:31.280]   So that his son will be the firstborn,
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:34.840]   the one who get the glory among the sisters and brothers.
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:37.720]   And God chose them and he called them to come to him.
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:38.680]   Having called them,
[00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:42.920]   he also gave them right standing with himself.
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:46.800]   Now that is what we call justification.
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:47.920]   You are justified.
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:52.240]   You became like Jesus Christ.
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:57.240]   God sees you just like he sees his one and only son,
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.720]   because you believe in the salvation, right?
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.840]   You believe in Jesus Christ.
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:06.640]   And that this process is not a long-term process.
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:10.320]   It's a punctual, one-time act.
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.440]   God acts in your life,
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:15.760]   and you became his child.
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:20.080]   You became his son or daughter.
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:21.720]   That is justification.
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:26.760]   That you stand before God and declare sinless.
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:29.640]   You declare totally forgiven.
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:32.560]   And that is eternal life.
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:36.200]   That is a one-time punctual event.
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.680]   When you are in Christ,
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:42.680]   God sees you as he sees his perfect son.
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:48.160]   Now, can you imagine the timeline, okay?
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.240]   Timeline of the Christian faith.
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:53.120]   All the way to the left, all the way to the left.
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.160]   All right, your left.
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:58.280]   It's justification, all right?
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:00.840]   You became a Christian.
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:04.800]   You became God's daughter or God's son.
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.960]   That is one-time justification.
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:08.600]   You stand justified,
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:11.440]   all because Jesus Christ has done for you
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.280]   on the cross and in the empty tomb.
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:16.080]   And then the timeline goes,
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:19.360]   the lifelong process of sanctification,
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:23.960]   that you will become more and more like his own son.
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:24.960]   Just like this.
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:28.520]   You start with justification, boom.
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:33.720]   And then there was up and down, up and down, you know,
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:36.560]   but in general, you're going up.
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:42.040]   In general, you're going up to heaven or the new world.
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:46.280]   That is the lifelong process that we are in right now,
[00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:49.120]   process of justification.
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:52.520]   And then at the end of it is glorification.
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:56.840]   Notice what he said, Paul said at the last phrase,
[00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.840]   "Having given them right standing justification,
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:03.560]   "God gave them his glory."
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:08.920]   One day when we see Jesus face to face, all right,
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:11.240]   either Jesus come back in his second coming
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.400]   or you go to Jesus, all right,
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:16.520]   because of whatever, you know, you die, okay?
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:17.400]   You die.
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:22.320]   And then your spirit will go, go to the presence of God.
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:26.200]   And one day, you know, the last two chapters of the Bible,
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.560]   the new world, the new heaven and new earth,
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:32.400]   when heaven and earth joined together
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:35.840]   in the state of glorification, the perfect state,
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.840]   there's no pain, there's no sickness,
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:41.360]   there's no homework, all right?
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:44.160]   There's no frustration anymore.
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.000]   Then you kick in the new world,
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.560]   the new heaven and new earth.
[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:49.800]   Now, there are different,
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:54.800]   different funny understandings of what heaven is like,
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:58.800]   you know, what new heaven and new earth is like.
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:00.160]   Some people would think,
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:04.920]   "Oh, probably we just sing and make music 24/7," right?
[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:06.920]   That's kind of boring, right?
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:09.920]   Especially if you are not musically talented, right?
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.080]   Unless, I guess, you know,
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:14.800]   in the last process of glorification,
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:18.520]   you resurrected and you got the glorified body
[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:21.480]   just like Jesus had on the third day,
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:24.200]   then you probably become the best bass player
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.280]   or whatever, right?
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:30.280]   But still, I mean, making music 24/7 is kind of boring, right?
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.760]   But you know, you need to understand,
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.440]   you need to understand new heaven and new earth
[00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:37.280]   is Genesis 1 and 2,
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:41.840]   we fulfill, you know?
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:45.120]   Fulfill right before your eyes.
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:47.840]   Remember what Genesis 1 and 2 is all about?
[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.760]   When God created humanity,
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:54.000]   His image bearers, all of us,
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.560]   God said to them,
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:02.560]   "Go and take control and rule the world for me.
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:07.440]   "You represent my image, my glorious image on earth,
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:12.440]   "and you're gonna bring my order to the rest of the cosmos."
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:15.000]   That is Genesis 1 and 2, right?
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.320]   Of course, it didn't go well, right?
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:21.320]   Genesis 3, man proclaim himself to be God, right?
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:24.840]   And kicks in the entire grand story of the Bible.
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:28.520]   But God never forsaken His world,
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:32.120]   His creation, our creation, you know, our world.
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:37.120]   He set himself a program to redeem the whole world,
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:42.200]   to bring humanity back to Him
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:45.160]   through His son, Jesus Christ.
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:47.960]   And now we are part of it, right?
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:51.680]   So the new heaven, new earth, what will it look like?
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.040]   It's not just playing music, saying,
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.560]   "Hallelujah 24/7."
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:56.640]   "No, no, I don't wanna go there."
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:01.880]   It's gonna be a glorified state
[00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:05.600]   that will bring God's holy, sacred, beautiful order
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:08.320]   to the rest of the cosmos, all right?
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:12.840]   I don't know if there's a space exploration
[00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:15.200]   in heaven and new earth, but whatever.
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:18.560]   There's no death, there's no pain, there's no sickness.
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:21.600]   All you do in this life, think about it.
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.000]   You know, you all go to work, right?
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   Think of moments in your work
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.600]   that you find so much fulfillment.
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:35.000]   You find so much fulfillment.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:35.840]   What is that?
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:38.600]   Ask yourself, what is that?
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:42.320]   That after, you know, your labor, your sweats,
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:46.360]   you work on something and you finish something.
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:50.240]   You finish a product, you finish maybe homework, okay?
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:52.000]   Maybe your assignment or something.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.720]   And then you get a sense of satisfaction or fulfillment.
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.280]   That is who you are, right?
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:02.200]   You're so gifted in this area, no matter what that is.
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:09.240]   That sense of fulfillment multiplies it infinitely.
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:15.480]   That is what new heaven and new earth will look like.
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:21.720]   That you will be exploring and extending
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:27.200]   the order of God to other areas.
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:28.760]   Take control of other areas.
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:33.200]   You know, I always remind some of our accountants
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:39.480]   or finance people in my church.
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:43.760]   I always ask them, you know, have you ever realized,
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:46.720]   you know, God's original creation
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:50.960]   is the creation that has potential to multiply.
[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:54.160]   Just as when you read through it, you know,
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:58.640]   seed within seeds, God creates trees and the plants
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:02.880]   and the animals and they can multiply.
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:06.720]   Things are meant to be multiplied by human hands.
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.680]   You know, I think last hundred years,
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:11.760]   the biggest discovery for ancient history
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:14.800]   is that when you pick some, when you take some wild grain,
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:20.640]   take some wild grain, and then you work it
[00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:23.840]   and you cultivate it and you take the seed out of it,
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:29.280]   human hands, plant it, and then it grows.
[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:34.960]   The biggest discovery is that through a human process,
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:38.840]   wild grain becomes better, right?
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:41.840]   You know, the rice, the white rice that we eat, okay?
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:46.840]   I don't eat that much now, but why is it so soft?
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:50.760]   Why is it so rich?
[00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:55.760]   Because it's process and process of human effort
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:21:00.680]   being added into the creation, and the creation multiplies.
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:03.000]   The value becomes higher.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:09.200]   Cultivated grain is more expensive than the wild grain, right?
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:13.400]   Because there is human process involved in it.
[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:16.080]   And that is the process of multiplication.
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:20.360]   That is what God originally meant us to do.
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:23.040]   The original creation, Genesis 1 and 2,
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:26.400]   and the last two chapters, the new heaven and new earth,
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.080]   it's not a static concept.
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:31.840]   It's the holy, sacred, dynamic.
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:35.760]   We, as we deem people in Christ,
[00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:39.000]   we will participate in the new heaven and new earth
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.360]   to explore and to invent, you know,
[00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:45.840]   to get to know this amazing creation
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:50.840]   and to get to know God himself, and God is infinite, right?
[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:54.720]   So I hope I will continue to teach in heaven and new earth.
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:57.120]   And you will continue to do Bible study
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:00.160]   in heaven and new earth.
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:05.160]   And whatever you do, and God made you to who you are, right?
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:09.520]   Whether you do a labor work or those,
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:13.920]   some guys doing PhD researching or something, right?
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:18.280]   Making molecules, those, I don't understand those stuff.
[00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:22.520]   But we will continue to engage in the creative process,
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:25.320]   you know, bringing God's order to the rest of the cosmos.
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:30.080]   That is the bird eye view of what it is,
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:32.400]   what it is all about to follow Jesus.
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:35.920]   Justification and lifelong process of sanctification,
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:38.600]   and then finally, the glorification, all right?
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:42.920]   So don't get, don't retire yet.
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:48.160]   All right, new heaven, new earth is not for retirees.
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:53.800]   We continue to work without frustration, right?
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:55.840]   And again, the apostles,
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:23:00.080]   we end with Romans 8,
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:03.760]   is telling us that once we kick in
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:06.920]   to that relationship with Jesus, it's a dance with God.
[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:09.120]   It's a dance with God.
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:13.160]   We dance with the music of the Holy Spirit.
[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:19.040]   And sometimes the music sounds bright and happy.
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:24.200]   Sometimes the melody sound sad, lamentation.
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:27.760]   That is the long process of ups and downs
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:31.560]   in our sanctification, but it's an eternal dance.
[00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:34.200]   It's an eternal dancing with God.
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:37.080]   A long-term process, a long-term journey
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:39.920]   of discovering God and being transformed
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:44.920]   into His Son's image.
[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:49.360]   To say to a 15-year-old that you are okay
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:54.360]   with the way you are is the utmost disrespect to humanity.
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:59.680]   Let me say that again.
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:04.920]   To say to a teenager or younger or older, or even you,
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:11.720]   you are okay, perfectly okay with the way you are.
[00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:15.240]   It's disrespect of God's creation.
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:19.800]   You are not okay with the way you are right now.
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:21.920]   Agree?
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:28.240]   You cannot avoid the need and the joy of transformation.
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:34.080]   God is transforming you and shaping you.
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:38.000]   That is the mark of maturity.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.200]   The mark of maturity is to say to yourself in the mirror,
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:45.680]   I'm not okay with the way I am today
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:50.280]   because the Holy Spirit is shaping me constantly.
[00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:53.720]   And I need to let God's grace to work in my life.
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:57.360]   Let the Word of God continue to shape me
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:00.760]   and challenge me to shape me,
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:04.960]   to transform me into the image of His Son.
[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:09.720]   And the Apostles' Creed is challenging us to aim for that,
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:13.360]   to aim high in the kingdom of God.
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:16.960]   You are not okay with the way you are today, no way.
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:22.720]   You will be transformed and let God transform you.
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:24.080]   I believe in the Holy Spirit.
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:28.040]   That's the first section of the Creed.
[00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:29.440]   I believe in the Holy Spirit.
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:32.200]   Have you realized this is the new creation?
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:34.520]   When the Spirit comes upon you,
[00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:39.080]   when the Holy Spirit is making you God's children,
[00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:42.720]   you are a new creation.
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:47.480]   The Holy Universal Church, the Holy Catholic Church,
[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:51.120]   the Chameleon of Saints speak to us
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:54.400]   that once the Holy Spirit is taking you
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.360]   into the kingdom of God,
[00:25:56.360 --> 00:26:00.640]   the church becomes your new family.
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:03.520]   And that new family never change.
[00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:06.440]   The earthly family will change.
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:09.440]   The configuration of it, you know,
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:11.640]   it will not last forever, right?
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:15.520]   Family relationship will not last forever.
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:17.200]   You understand?
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:21.600]   Someday, my son is not my son, right?
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:26.080]   And I'm not his father, someday, okay?
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:32.960]   This family, earthly relationship will not last forever.
[00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:34.920]   Right?
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:38.720]   To make it last forever as if it really lasts forever
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:40.240]   is actually idolatry.
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.920]   To make it idol in our lives.
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:46.200]   It will change if we transform so much
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:49.120]   that it will be glorified, right?
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:53.280]   And the fulfillment that we have in the family relationship
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:58.280]   will exceed how we feel.
[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:04.320]   Will exceed the sense of fulfillment we have right now.
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:06.600]   In the new day, in the new heaven and new earth,
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:08.360]   it will be so glorified.
[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:11.400]   So the church, the Universal Church,
[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:14.200]   the capital C Church is the new family.
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:17.280]   And then the Chameleon of Saints,
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:20.480]   I think we talk about it, is the new relationship.
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:24.360]   When we are in Christ, okay?
[00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:26.280]   When we are in Christ,
[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:29.600]   whether you're a Christian struggling with your faith
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:31.840]   so much or some other, you know,
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:34.360]   having a mountaintop experience,
[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:36.120]   praise God every single day.
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:40.000]   If we are in Christ, we have this new relationship,
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   the Chameleon of Saints, like togetherness, right?
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.240]   Somehow being united together.
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:52.840]   As we worship today, I don't know if you have noticed
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:56.560]   one of the songs, One Voice, right?
[00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:57.960]   Now, I didn't plan that,
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:00.080]   and the worship leader picked that song.
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:04.080]   The song talks about some sort of unity.
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:08.160]   That kind of unity goes beyond our ethnic unity,
[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:12.920]   our political identity.
[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:16.160]   It goes beyond that.
[00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:19.960]   In Christ, we find that new communion, new unity.
[00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:26.240]   The forgiveness of sin, the new relationship with God.
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:28.840]   Chameleon of Saints is the horizontal relationship,
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:32.960]   human being to human being, question to question,
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:34.720]   new chameleon of saints.
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:36.880]   And the forgiveness of sins is vertical.
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:42.040]   So we look upon God and say, "We are justified,
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:48.200]   "not because of our own effort, our own work,
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:51.840]   "but what Christ has done in your life
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:55.360]   "that made you someone who is new before God,
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:59.120]   "as if Jesus Christ, the one and only perfect Son."
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:04.080]   And then finally, I believe in the resurrection of the body,
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:06.360]   the new existence.
[00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:09.640]   God kicks in the new existence in our lives
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:11.840]   when we profess the name of Jesus.
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:14.640]   You know, you realize that?
[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:19.280]   Yeah, I know my body continues to decay,
[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:21.280]   your body too, right?
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:27.560]   We get old and we get sick, we get COVID.
[00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:30.240]   We are weakened, right?
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:34.080]   You know, it used to be I could do 70 pushups,
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:36.920]   just like that.
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:40.640]   Or you could do that.
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:44.240]   I can't do it anymore.
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:48.280]   Right, now I even have struggle with 20, right?
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:51.160]   We decay.
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:56.160]   However, we have the hope of getting the new body,
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:30:00.800]   the new existence, just like the third day of Jesus Christ.
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:03.200]   He walked out of the empty tomb.
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:05.160]   He conquered death for us.
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:08.640]   He conquered sin and darkness and Satan for us.
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:10.160]   No more forces of darkness,
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:15.160]   no more forces of deterioration can go upon you.
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:18.360]   And this is the new existence that we have.
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:20.640]   And we have that hope in future.
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:23.760]   Whether we see Jesus face to face
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:25.720]   or in the new heaven and new earth,
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:27.720]   we'll get a new body.
[00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:31.240]   A lot of people think that, okay, once we die,
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:36.960]   our spirit will go like floating around, you know,
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:39.920]   just being creepy and all that.
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:42.400]   No, that's not the biblical picture.
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:46.520]   The Bible tells us that we are going somewhere,
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:49.600]   eschatology, going some end,
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:52.560]   and the end is the glorified body.
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:57.120]   All God's people will share in Jesus Christ.
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:59.640]   And lastly, the Creed says,
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:04.080]   I believe life everlasting.
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:07.000]   That is the new world.
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:09.720]   Eternal life is not something
[00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:12.400]   that we experience after we die.
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:16.000]   Eternal life is the experience that we have once
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.240]   you come to know Christ.
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:24.560]   When you come to know Jesus, that is eternal life.
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:26.120]   And God is with you.
[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:28.040]   And you live in the presence of God.
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:33.040]   That's why the Bible continues again and again
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:37.080]   telling you, you need to be obedient.
[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:38.760]   You need to listen to the word of God.
[00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:41.080]   You need to walk with the spirit
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:44.520]   so that you can live in the presence of God, right?
[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:45.760]   And that is conditional.
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:49.840]   I know God's love is unconditional in some sense,
[00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:51.880]   but it's also conditional.
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:56.880]   If you want to experience the power and the joy,
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:00.680]   the peace, the hope that we have in Jesus Christ,
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:03.400]   well, there is condition.
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:06.400]   We need to be committed to worship Him.
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:09.440]   John 10, 10.
[00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:14.520]   Let me close with this verse.
[00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:19.080]   Jesus is talking to the Jewish people in the New Testament,
[00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:20.680]   to the people of God.
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:24.840]   The thief comes only to steal and kill and to destroy.
[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:31.040]   I, Jesus said, came that you may have life
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:36.240]   and have it abundantly, abundantly, you know?
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:39.080]   Like overflowing in your life, right?
[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:41.080]   All the good things of the kingdom,
[00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:44.120]   the joy, the peace, the patience, the hope,
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:47.680]   and all those good stuff will be so overflowing
[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:49.440]   in the cup of your life.
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:52.720]   You cannot bear to contain them.
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:54.800]   It has to overflow out of your life
[00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:57.600]   and you need to share with other people, right?
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:02.600]   You need to, you know, have other people experience it.
[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:05.440]   It's shareable, right?
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:07.440]   And it has to be shared.
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:09.520]   There is life abundant.
[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:11.760]   In Old Testament term, this is New Testament,
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:14.600]   Gospel of John, in Old Testament term, it's shalom.
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:16.880]   Shalom.
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:20.560]   Even the Israeli Jews today will meet each other,
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:23.040]   see each other, and they will say the first word,
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:27.160]   not hi, not hello, but shalom.
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:30.400]   Shalom.
[00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:31.240]   What is shalom?
[00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:37.880]   Shalom is not merely the absence of war.
[00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:42.200]   It's not just the absence of frustration,
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:44.760]   absence of death, all the bad things.
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:49.440]   It's not just the absence of the negative things.
[00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:54.440]   Shalom is positively means all the great things
[00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:58.560]   that we have in the kingdom,
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:03.120]   all the great attributes of God that we can share,
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:06.080]   we can experience, that is shalom, right?
[00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:10.880]   Quite meaningful, you know, to greet each other,
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:12.200]   to say shalom.
[00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:14.560]   I wish you well.
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:20.880]   Your body, your spirit, your mind, your emotion,
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:24.520]   everything in your life will be so blessed
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:27.920]   that you can have shalom, right?
[00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:33.280]   That is a foretaste, a foretaste of the new world,
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:35.800]   the new heaven and new earth.
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:40.760]   Well, I pray that God will bless you in such a way
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:45.400]   that you will continue to experience the foretaste
[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:50.480]   of the banquet, foretaste of the great things to come,
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:52.840]   the greatest thing to come.
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:56.520]   Nothing the world can offer you that,
[00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:59.680]   only in Christ we have this hope.
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:02.080]   Let us all pray together.
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:06.600]   Father, we give thanks because you are our great God.
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:11.080]   And thank you for the hope that we have in the kingdom,
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:14.960]   the eternal hope that we have,
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:21.160]   that that hope challenges and conquers death,
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:28.400]   and conquers the dark power of Satan and sin.
[00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:31.960]   And I pray that this hope will be,
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:36.400]   will sink in into the very core of our being,
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:39.880]   that we'll continue to look forward
[00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:42.880]   to this new heaven and new earth, this life eternal.
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:47.040]   And thank you that we are justified in Christ.
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:52.680]   And thank you for your spirit being sent to be with us,
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:57.280]   to dwell in us, to sanctify us,
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:00.240]   to help us to walk and follow you.
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:05.480]   And I pray that one day we look forward
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:08.040]   to the day of glorification,
[00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:12.400]   that we can experience kingdom in the fullness.
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:15.000]   And right now, no matter where we are,
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.440]   no matter what circumstances we are facing,
[00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:22.480]   we get the foretaste of the glorious heaven.
[00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:25.520]   That someday we'll see you face to face,
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:29.360]   and your people will continue to worship you, to serve you.
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:32.680]   And thank you for the church that we have,
[00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:34.520]   the community of faith that we share,
[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:36.440]   the communion of saints.
[00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:38.160]   And I pray that this sense of unity
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:41.960]   will continue to grow your church, to grow your family,
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:45.040]   that your church will be your people,
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:47.840]   empowered to glorify your name.
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:49.800]   In Christ's name, we pray, amen.
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:53.000]   Well, lastly, two minutes, I want to.
