1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
 - The phone?

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:01,660
 - Oh, yeah.

3
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:02,500
 - All right.

4
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,460
 Brothers and sisters, I realized I didn't really

5
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,740
 have a chance to tell everyone a little bit about myself.

6
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,500
 And it's a good, I'm really happy to see

7
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,940
 you brothers and sisters in the church.

8
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,900
 And it's a little bit about me is like,

9
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,340
 James, man, James, I mean, that song,

10
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,300
 "The Power of Your Love" was like something

11
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,900
 that I haven't heard for a while.

12
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,980
 And it was the first time when Pastor Mark

13
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,900
 was my youth pastor, like close to 20 years ago.

14
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,260
 And then it was the first time in the retreat

15
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,100
 that I felt like God convicted me to change.

16
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,540
 I need to be different.

17
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:33,820
 I gotta be better.

18
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:34,660
 And that was the starting.

19
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,300
 I was like, wow, my Christian journey,

20
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,500
 especially that verse, "Where your will and foe

21
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,760
 "in our lives."

22
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,020
 I'm like, here we are.

23
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,460
 I graduated from Moody two years ago,

24
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:50,340
 a Master of Arts in Spiritual Formation and Cycle Ship,

25
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,660
 along with my beautiful wife right here, Shirley.

26
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,480
 And right now, we're getting ready

27
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,020
 for the mission field in Taiwan.

28
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,060
 Once Taiwan opens up, we get our visa,

29
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,220
 we're about to head out.

30
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,340
 So I learned a lot about being a missionary,

31
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,600
 but that's God's will in my life.

32
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,980
 From what I remember 20 years ago as a kid,

33
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,260
 as a high school kid, with my youth pastor,

34
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:10,840
 who's still my pastor right now.

35
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,640
 So I'm just very grateful to have a chance right here

36
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,860
 to share God's word with you right here.

37
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,460
 Let's pray together.

38
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,780
 Father, we thank you, Lord,

39
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,080
 for the time that you give us right here

40
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,020
 to focus on you, Lord.

41
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,900
 As you said, let tomorrow worry about tomorrow, Lord.

42
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,420
 Help us worry about today.

43
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,060
 And today is your day, Father.

44
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,220
 Help us focus, Lord.

45
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:37,100
 Holy Spirit, may you come into us.

46
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,900
 Help us not worry.

47
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,900
 Help us just focus on you to receive your words, Father.

48
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,380
 To receive, to see how great your salvation plan is,

49
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,580
 Father, for every one of us.

50
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,980
 In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

51
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:54,840
 Hey, when I talk about the Cubs and the Sox,

52
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,800
 you have an idea what comes to mind.

53
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:01,340
 How about the Bears and the Packers, how about that?

54
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:04,800
 If you've been in Chicago for a while,

55
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,040
 you probably have a good idea, right?

56
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,060
 These are a rival.

57
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,260
 I mean, these are fans from opponent's side

58
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,900
 really hate the other team.

59
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:16,900
 I mean, these are just basically friendly rivals we see.

60
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,760
 But in society, as you know, there are many rivals.

61
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,360
 And these could be religious rivals,

62
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,640
 like Catholic versus Christian in general,

63
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,440
 like economic rivals, right?

64
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,260
 Are you lower class, are you middle class,

65
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,140
 or are you in upper class, right?

66
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:35,260
 Or other rivals like, oh, the school that you go to,

67
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:38,460
 that distinguish, kind of like signify your intelligence.

68
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,080
 And there could be family rival.

69
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,140
 So I wanna tell you a little bit about a family rival

70
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,820
 that I had last year.

71
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:48,060
 It happened during when my grandmother died,

72
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,140
 like last April.

73
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:53,260
 And she was like 90 something already, about the time.

74
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:57,140
 You know what the sad thing is that she died?

75
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,720
 But the saddest part is that all my uncles,

76
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:04,360
 when she wasn't even in her grave yet,

77
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,460
 they were talking about money.

78
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,300
 That's the rival.

79
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,420
 You guys know what I'm talking about, we're Chinese.

80
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,980
 Yep, we talk about money, and they became enemy.

81
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,660
 It's within these division

82
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:18,220
 that how Jesus established his church.

83
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,320
 So today's topic I wanna talk to you about

84
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,920
 is how did Jesus establish the church?

85
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,360
 So in the book of Ephesians, actually,

86
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:31,360
 Paul did not chastise these Christians for anything.

87
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,580
 It's more like an encouragement

88
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,680
 and laying out God's cosmic plan for them to understand.

89
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,980
 So in the beginning, he talk about God's plan in general,

90
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,480
 which involves our spiritual blessing.

91
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,280
 And in the beginning section of chapter two,

92
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,200
 he talks about how we are dead to our sins and transgression.

93
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,360
 Therefore, God, through Jesus Christ, made us alive.

94
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,720
 And then right now, we're gonna talk about the second part

95
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,520
 that is parallel to the first part.

96
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,520
 Within this, we're talking about another way

97
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,840
 how we are dead to Christ in a different standpoint.

98
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,600
 So in my first point,

99
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,480
 I wanna talk about hopelessness without Christ.

100
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,840
 How there's no hope without Christ.

101
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,040
 Let me start reading.

102
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,280
 Therefore, remember that formerly you who are Gentiles

103
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,200
 by birth and caught uncircumcised

104
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,420
 by those who cautimcise the circumcision,

105
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:31,100
 which is done in the body by human hands.

106
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:35,700
 Remember that at that time, you were separated from Christ,

107
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:39,560
 excluded from citizenship in Israel and foreigners

108
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,800
 to the covenant of the promise.

109
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,840
 Without hope and without God in the world.

110
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,600
 But now in Christ Jesus, you who once were far away

111
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,180
 have been brought back near by the blood of Christ.

112
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:57,040
 So Paul start off by reminding these Christians in Ephesus,

113
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,720
 these Gentile Christians,

114
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,320
 there is a group called circumcision.

115
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,880
 Mainly, these are Jewish people

116
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,860
 who probably have accepted Jesus Christ already,

117
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,500
 but still thinks that circumcision is necessary.

118
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,100
 So they're saying these groups are mocking you guys

119
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,920
 because you are not circumcised yet.

120
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:22,380
 But the thing is that Romans and Greeks

121
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,460
 don't call themselves Gentiles.

122
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,080
 The only people that call themselves,

123
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,360
 call other people Gentiles are Jews, the Jewish people.

124
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,820
 So why is it so important to distinguish

125
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:37,820
 that they are Jews and those other people are Gentiles?

126
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,140
 So if you take a look,

127
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,420
 let's go back to the book of Genesis.

128
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:45,300
 This verse right here is basically the backgrounds

129
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,460
 where God and Abraham,

130
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,960
 God made a covenant with Abraham, an agreement.

131
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,340
 He's telling Abraham,

132
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:58,220
 all the nations on the earth will be blessed because of you.

133
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,500
 And this circumcision is this phrase

134
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,060
 that you are to undergo circumcision

135
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:05,280
 and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and you.

136
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,220
 This is a physical sign to show how they are different.

137
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,300
 But the problem is that a lot of times

138
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,580
 these Jewish people use,

139
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:17,020
 think of the sign as seeing themselves as superior.

140
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,740
 Like they are the special race.

141
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:20,980
 They have God with them.

142
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,620
 They are part of God's family.

143
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,860
 This covenant is telling them,

144
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,940
 we are part of God's family and you are not.

145
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:30,500
 So they think of the Gentiles as a lower race, outsiders.

146
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,640
 But when Paul is writing this,

147
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,300
 God, Jesus Christ, step on the cross,

148
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,580
 has redeemed us already.

149
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:42,060
 Therefore, the old order of the Judaisms,

150
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,960
 their external and material feature is outdated already

151
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,820
 because Christ came in and pushed in a new order.

152
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,380
 Therefore, if I go back here and you take a look,

153
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,020
 Paul specifically says,

154
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,780
 which is done in the body by human hand.

155
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,300
 What does that mean by human hand?

156
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,180
 Paul emphasizes because if it's by human hand,

157
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,600
 that means it's not from God.

158
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,260
 Therefore, what Paul is saying,

159
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,900
 he's mocking these people also,

160
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,180
 these circumcision, these Jews.

161
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,100
 He's trying to tell them,

162
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,300
 hey, you guys don't have the real circumcision either.

163
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,220
 Like, let's take a look what's the real circumcision.

164
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,300
 The same author of Genesis, Moses,

165
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,620
 he wrote through to Tyrannomy.

166
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,460
 He says,

167
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:30,260
 Circumcision is,

168
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,940
 God has to do the real circumcision through the heart

169
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:36,420
 where we have the ability to obey and follow his order.

170
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,220
 So how does Paul look at that, right?

171
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,260
 In Colossians, this is how he sees it.

172
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,300
 In him, you were also circumcised

173
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,180
 with a circumcision not performed by human hands.

174
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:49,020
 Your whole self ruled by the flesh was put off

175
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,660
 when you were circumcised by Christ.

176
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,980
 So as we know now, how does God circumcise us?

177
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:54,820
 It's through Christ.

178
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,140
 Christ has to come and die for us

179
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:59,180
 and change us into a new person.

180
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,660
 That is the real circumcision

181
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,260
 that's available to the Jews and Gentiles currently.

182
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,740
 (pages rustling)

183
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:13,380
 After talking about circumcision, the physical sign,

184
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,780
 Paul continues to remind these Gentile Christians

185
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:20,260
 in Ephesus about their former state without Christ.

186
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,100
 Why?

187
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,100
 This is to show them how blessed that they are

188
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,900
 at their current position.

189
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,220
 So this is what he says to these people

190
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,260
 before they know in Christ.

191
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,700
 Remember that at that time you were separated from Christ,

192
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,380
 excluded from citizenship in Israel,

193
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:39,260
 and foreign to the covenant of the promise.

194
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,100
 Basically, this is what Paul is saying.

195
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,700
 Israel has an advantage over you.

196
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,420
 The Jewish people have an advantage over you

197
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,460
 because they're part of God's family, but you are not.

198
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:52,740
 So it sums up basically this is what he's saying.

199
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,860
 The Gentiles, you don't have anything related to God.

200
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,140
 You're isolated from God, right?

201
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,820
 So the result comes at the second part of the verse.

202
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,860
 You are without hope and without God in this world.

203
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:09,740
 So if you take a look, verse 11 and 12,

204
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,620
 look so dark and gloomy for the Gentile

205
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:16,060
 in their former state before knowing Christ.

206
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:21,060
 But again, Paul states but in verse 13.

207
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:27,080
 But Christ right here made 180 turn again for them.

208
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,920
 You know, he says, "But now in Christ Jesus,

209
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,720
 "you once were far away, have been brought near

210
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,520
 "by the blood of Christ."

211
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:40,000
 Instead of being dead to our transgression,

212
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,840
 we were once far from God, but Christ brought us near.

213
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,920
 What does that mean?

214
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,280
 Bring us near means that we have access to God

215
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,220
 and that access is through the blood of Jesus Christ.

216
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:58,540
 And this gives me, helps me think of this illustration.

217
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,540
 Actually, it's also from Paul.

218
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,820
 He talks about a branch grafted in in Romans.

219
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,900
 And if you take a look, the lower branch,

220
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,700
 the main branch is very different from the top branch

221
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,060
 that is grafted in, you know?

222
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,160
 The top branch doesn't belong.

223
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:17,140
 And take a look at how this person

224
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,340
 attached these two branches together.

225
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:22,340
 It's by some sort of tape or something to glue it on, right?

226
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,400
 That tape is basically the blood of Christ.

227
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,260
 He used that to glue us into the main branch

228
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,300
 that we could be part of the same family.

229
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:35,420
 Therefore, have a great appreciation

230
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:39,420
 for what Christ did for us when we were far away from God.

231
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,320
 Therefore, he used his blood to draw us near.

232
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,780
 Now let's go to the second point.

233
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:47,520
 The second point is what Christ did to make the church.

234
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:52,580
 So for he himself is our peace,

235
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,220
 he who has made the two groups one

236
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,260
 and has destroyed the barrier,

237
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,080
 the dividing wall of hostility,

238
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,500
 by setting aside in his flesh the law

239
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,780
 with its command and regulations.

240
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:08,640
 His purpose was to create in himself a new humanity

241
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,360
 out of the two, thus making peace,

242
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,900
 and in one body to reconcile both of them to God

243
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:19,900
 through the cross by which to put to death their hostility.

244
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:24,740
 He came and preached peace to you who were far away

245
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,900
 and peace to those who were near.

246
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,460
 For through him we both have access

247
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,900
 to the Father by one spirit.

248
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:36,420
 So as we talk about how Christ in the previous point,

249
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,300
 he restored our relationship with God.

250
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:44,720
 So in verse 14, Paul starts out by emphasizing

251
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,460
 that Christ is our peace.

252
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,260
 But what does this peace mean?

253
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:54,260
 In general, peace means there is no hostility, right?

254
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,040
 Everyone get along.

255
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:01,000
 But how do you gain that peace?

256
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,700
 How did Christ gain that peace for them?

257
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,420
 Well, you had to join two groups into one.

258
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:09,140
 Those two groups that we know are the Gentiles and the Jews.

259
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,020
 So how did he go on doing so?

260
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:14,100
 The first, there is two things,

261
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,940
 that's one thing you have to do.

262
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,780
 Let me read it according.

263
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,380
 He had to destroy the barrier,

264
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:21,900
 the dividing wall of hostility by setting aside

265
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,960
 in his flesh the law with his commands and regulation.

266
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:29,460
 So this is referring to the Temple of Jerusalem, guys.

267
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,540
 So if you take a look, where I label Gentile,

268
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,260
 that's the outer court.

269
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:37,580
 That is as far as you can go if you're not Jewish.

270
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:40,820
 If you're a Jew, you could go into the inner court

271
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,260
 to worship God.

272
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,860
 There is actually a physical wall

273
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,520
 that divides the two people at a time.

274
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:50,340
 So, but the thing is that,

275
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:54,780
 that's only a manifestation of the Mosaic law,

276
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,340
 the regulations of the command.

277
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:03,920
 That's why Jesus had to come and abolish those commands.

278
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,620
 Those regulations and law, to tell you honestly,

279
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,260
 even the Jewish people, they can't meet themselves.

280
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,500
 That holiness is so high, the God standards is so high,

281
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:18,260
 that it's really impossible to meet in human standpoint.

282
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:22,580
 But besides separating these two groups religiously,

283
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,860
 there are also separated,

284
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,260
 the law also separated them socially.

285
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,500
 Because of this law,

286
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,420
 the Jewish people have to live according to,

287
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,580
 they don't live according to the custom of the world.

288
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,540
 So they kind of like lost communication in that point,

289
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,540
 but consequently at the same time,

290
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,780
 it gives the Jewish people that pride.

291
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:43,020
 They feel like the way how we live, we're superior.

292
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:43,880
 The way you live.

293
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:49,620
 But the thing is that at the end,

294
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,460
 Jesus came and abolished that law once and for all

295
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:57,460
 with his flesh to present his perfect sacrifice to God.

296
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,660
 So we don't have to worry about this anymore,

297
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,980
 these regulations.

298
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:05,540
 Now let's move on to the second part of verse 15 and 16.

299
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,980
 So as we move on,

300
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:12,360
 so the purpose of abolishing these hostility is twofold.

301
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,660
 First of all, in verse 15,

302
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:17,960
 the second part is to create in himself a new humanity.

303
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,800
 Basically,

304
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:24,500
 the rift between the Jews and Gentiles are too deep.

305
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,900
 You cannot put them together anymore.

306
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,820
 Think about in our country,

307
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,740
 you think about the political state right now,

308
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,740
 the two big parties, the Democrats and the Republicans,

309
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,220
 you can't even work together anymore.

310
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,140
 The only thing they could do right now

311
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,340
 is call each other name.

312
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,640
 We're lucky that our country's continued to function,

313
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,440
 seems like quite normally right now.

314
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:49,680
 Therefore, God has to push a new humanity.

315
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,840
 Within this new humanity, a new order, a new covenant

316
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,880
 has to be established by Christ.

317
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,720
 And as I said again,

318
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,680
 Jesus is the one that kind of present himself

319
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:05,320
 as an offering to reconcile human between human.

320
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,400
 So he reconciled the horizontal hostility,

321
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,180
 the horizontal dimension of the hostility.

322
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,700
 And as we go on to verse 16,

323
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,380
 in that new body is to reconcile

324
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:19,420
 both this new humanity to God.

325
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:22,980
 So his blood not just reconcile

326
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,340
 this our human to human hostility,

327
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:28,280
 it also reconcile the vertical dimension,

328
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,780
 our humanity to God.

329
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:37,900
 So as we talk about the reconciliation process,

330
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:42,260
 Paul now talks about the proclamation of peace from Christ.

331
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:46,940
 In verse 17, it says, "He came to preach peace."

332
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:50,780
 How does Christ preach peace?

333
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:56,660
 He did it by walking, by doing, by walking the talk.

334
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:00,180
 He was, he is our peace in verse 14,

335
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:03,560
 that says, "For he himself is our peace."

336
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:07,420
 Again, by using his body, the flesh, the blood,

337
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:11,480
 to bring, to end that hostility.

338
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:18,620
 And who are he talking to?

339
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:22,020
 Again, he's emphasizing the ones who are near,

340
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:25,180
 which are the Jewish people.

341
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,340
 They have, think about it,

342
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,620
 they have all the time, they have the temple,

343
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,860
 the laws, the worship regulation, the covenant,

344
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,020
 and the Gentiles, the ones who are far,

345
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,180
 they don't have anything.

346
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:39,060
 But Paul is saying, in verse 16,

347
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,380
 "Even though they have all these things, the Jewish people,

348
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,240
 "they still need reconciliation."

349
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:48,160
 Again, in verse 18,

350
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,460
 Paul continued to further the concept of peace.

351
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:54,280
 Besides just being right with God, we have access to God.

352
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,540
 We, as Jews and Gentiles,

353
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:00,740
 we stand as one humanity in front of God.

354
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,260
 And there is no distinction anymore,

355
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,940
 because it's just by one spirit,

356
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,140
 we have access to the Father.

357
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:10,420
 It stresses that oneness that we have, the new humanity.

358
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:15,060
 And within this new, excuse me,

359
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,940
 within this new humanity,

360
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:19,380
 I don't have to talk about my credentials,

361
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,900
 my spiritual heritage, my zeal,

362
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,460
 or my talent to access God.

363
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,740
 The only thing we all need to share in common

364
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,220
 to have access to God

365
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,820
 is believing in the redemptive work of Jesus Christ.

366
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:35,460
 This brings me, reminds me of this person right here.

367
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,420
 Do you know this person?

368
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,980
 His name is Jim Elliott.

369
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,020
 He was a missionary to Ecuador,

370
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:45,020
 especially to the Native American tribes in around the 1950s.

371
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:49,540
 He and his fellow companions, missionaries,

372
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:54,280
 have decided, "We must let these people hear the gospel."

373
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,140
 But the thing is that they know

374
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,580
 these Indians are hostile to foreigners.

375
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,300
 Yet they went anyway.

376
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,580
 What's the result?

377
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,460
 He got martyred.

378
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,860
 He and his fellow missionaries got martyred.

379
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:11,700
 Yet creating this hostility between their families

380
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,340
 and these Indian tribes.

381
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:18,860
 But instead of seeking revenge,

382
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:22,060
 their wives decided to continue on this mission,

383
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:25,740
 decided to go into these tribes and live with them,

384
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,780
 to walk out that gospel.

385
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,380
 At the end, bringing the gospel,

386
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:32,180
 bringing the conversion to these Indians,

387
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,240
 thus ending the hostility.

388
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:40,240
 Therefore, Jesus' work of redemption brings us this peace.

389
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,400
 We might have an understanding how hard,

390
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,340
 how much work he had to go through to start this.

391
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:52,400
 Now let's go on to our last point.

392
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,940
 What the church looked like.

393
00:18:53,940 --> 00:19:00,480
 Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and strangers,

394
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,160
 but fellow citizens with God's people

395
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,840
 and also members of his household.

396
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,040
 Built on the foundation of the apostles and the prophets,

397
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:12,080
 with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone,

398
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,120
 in him, the whole building is joined together

399
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,120
 and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord.

400
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,680
 And in him, you too are being built together

401
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:25,640
 to become a dwelling in which God lives by his spirit.

402
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,840
 So as a result of God's redemptive work,

403
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,980
 Paul's telling us our status in front of God has changed.

404
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:36,140
 And Paul wanted to talk about

405
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,460
 how this new humanity functions,

406
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:41,620
 which we will see the characteristics of the church.

407
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:47,580
 Paul starts out by using, again, the spatial relationship

408
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:50,800
 to show the differences before and now.

409
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,200
 He says, consequently,

410
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,080
 you are no longer foreigners and strangers.

411
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,880
 What does foreigner and stranger,

412
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,300
 when you think about that, what comes to mind?

413
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:02,360
 You live in a land that is not your own homeland.

414
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,560
 You live with the people who are not your people,

415
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,840
 who are not your tribe.

416
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,600
 So what does that mean?

417
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,800
 You are outsider.

418
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,680
 You don't belong.

419
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,600
 But Paul continues to elaborate.

420
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,480
 But fellow citizens with God's people

421
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,480
 and also member of his household.

422
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,720
 We are citizens.

423
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,700
 We are part of God's family right now.

424
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,520
 We are not second-class citizens.

425
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,440
 We are the same of the Jewish people.

426
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,740
 Or let's say this new humanity that Christ created.

427
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:35,780
 As stated in chapter one, verse five,

428
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,540
 God already said he has destined us

429
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,940
 for a daughter and sonship.

430
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,400
 This is the closest relationship

431
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,300
 that you can have with someone.

432
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:47,020
 But think about the process of you becoming our citizen,

433
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:49,020
 like the ones that have become, right?

434
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,920
 You have to come to this country.

435
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,700
 You have to become a good member for a couple years.

436
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,740
 Make sure you follow the law

437
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:58,300
 and be a good person in society.

438
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,580
 And then you have to study for a test.

439
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,420
 And then you make sure you pass the test.

440
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,720
 Then you might be able to become a US citizen.

441
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,100
 But what happen if I say,

442
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,260
 today the US president came to you personally and said,

443
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,940
 "You don't have to do any of that.

444
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:15,480
 "I will accept you in as a member.

445
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,980
 "At the same time, I will adopt you into my personal family."

446
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,840
 That is what the household of God looks like.

447
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,880
 Now in verse 20, Paul can you elaborate

448
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:30,040
 how this household is built upon, this universal church?

449
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,800
 He said, "It's built upon the foundation

450
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,040
 "of the apostles and the prophets."

451
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,240
 So the apostles, it's basically talking

452
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,200
 about the 12 apostles and Paul himself,

453
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:43,200
 who Jesus personally chose to proclaim the gospel.

454
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,880
 And how about these prophets?

455
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,360
 These prophets, based on this context,

456
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,240
 I would see they are not the Old Testament prophets

457
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,440
 because Paul in chapter three, verse five says,

458
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,280
 "The mystery of the gospel is not known

459
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,400
 "to any other generation until now."

460
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,160
 So I would say these prophets are the people

461
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:05,180
 along with the apostles who might have walked with Jesus,

462
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:10,180
 or these prophets are people that the apostles converted,

463
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:13,580
 and they continue to preserve the teaching of Jesus Christ,

464
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:16,700
 because if they don't continue to preserve the teaching,

465
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:21,700
 this new humanity will not have its foundation to rely on.

466
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,500
 But however, that's not the main and most important element.

467
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,140
 As Paul continue, he says, "Jesus Christ himself

468
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,100
 "as the chief cornerstone."

469
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:34,560
 As you see, Paul emphasize this point.

470
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:38,280
 He uses the word himself to tell

471
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,480
 that Jesus is the chief cornerstone.

472
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,480
 What does that mean?

473
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:45,080
 In the ancient world, the builders,

474
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,240
 the first stone that they lay is the cornerstone.

475
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,880
 That's the most important stone.

476
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,160
 It's the stone that gives the direction

477
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,440
 where the building's gonna go,

478
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:56,020
 and it determines if that building will be stable.

479
00:22:56,020 --> 00:23:01,040
 And other stones are built upon this cornerstone.

480
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,120
 Therefore, Jesus ensure the stability

481
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,020
 of the system of salvation.

482
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:11,500
 As we continue on to the last two verses, 21 and 22,

483
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:16,500
 Paul continue to elaborate that we also are the stones

484
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,280
 along with the prophets by using the word you too,

485
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,880
 that we, well, for him, he's meaning the Gentiles,

486
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,120
 but we are the Gentiles too right now.

487
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,000
 We take part in building this temple too.

488
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,480
 Again, within those two verses, Paul is saying,

489
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,260
 "We are joined and built together

490
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,820
 "to construct this household."

491
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:39,240
 It gives us, symbolize the closeness

492
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,920
 that we have between believers.

493
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,000
 And it also shows us this church

494
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,440
 should be a continuous growing body

495
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,160
 because through our evangelism and discipleship,

496
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,520
 it should continue to be growing.

497
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,140
 And at the end, the last verse, it says,

498
00:23:56,140 --> 00:24:00,440
 Jesus also dwells within his household.

499
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:05,440
 It shows that God and the people, the believer,

500
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,840
 we should have a close relationship also.

501
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,620
 But overall, Jesus is in charge

502
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,860
 of connecting all these stones.

503
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,560
 Therefore, he is responsible

504
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,800
 of retaining all these relationships, not us.

505
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:24,280
 But everything is emphasized on Jesus Christ himself.

506
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,040
 Everything is linked to him.

507
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:29,960
 The house functions probably only because of Jesus.

508
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,520
 We, the people, are the church.

509
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,240
 We're not talking about the building, but Jesus is the head.

510
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:41,120
 Now, this brings me to this picture.

511
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,700
 If you guys take a look, as you take a look,

512
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,420
 something's wrong with this building.

513
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:49,680
 This is actually a building that collapsed

514
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,520
 because of an earthquake that happened

515
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,520
 in 2017 in Mexico City.

516
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:58,640
 Actually, Mexico is known to be a place

517
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,600
 with a lot of earthquakes,

518
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,820
 so their building regulation is pretty rigorous.

519
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:07,040
 However, why so many buildings still collapse

520
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,320
 is mainly due to because of corruption.

521
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:13,880
 A lot of these engineers still sign off on that blueprint

522
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,360
 knowing that they do not meet the safety inspection.

523
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:22,380
 I mean, when glamorous time, when everything is fine,

524
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,960
 I mean, the building looks fine, right?

525
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:27,540
 But when hard times come, you can see what happens.

526
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,260
 But I could assure you,

527
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:32,340
 our Christian faith in the church

528
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:35,060
 has endured a lot of hardship and trial

529
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,900
 throughout the many centuries, right?

530
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,380
 Yet, it stands solid as a rock

531
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,220
 because who is our cornerstone?

532
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,280
 Jesus Christ.

533
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,520
 Therefore, we continue to be confident

534
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,080
 to place ourselves as rocks

535
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,920
 to continue to build this household, this church.

536
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:55,400
 In conclusion, let me get back to my story

537
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,840
 of my family few.

538
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,460
 My uncles, they're currently still enemies.

539
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:04,400
 They have a hatred toward each other,

540
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,400
 but from the way I see it,

541
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,920
 there's a sense of hopelessness in them.

542
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,400
 They don't know, they can't see the light

543
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,600
 at the end of the tunnel.

544
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,600
 Because there's no mediator for them to help them see it.

545
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,920
 But unlike my family member, unlike my uncles,

546
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,440
 the church has Jesus Christ as the cornerstones,

547
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,640
 brothers and sisters.

548
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,120
 He's the one that made the peace

549
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,560
 between human to human and with God.

550
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,200
 Therefore, we should have an attitude

551
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,880
 of profound thankfulness towards God

552
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,240
 because we are in a very, very privileged position

553
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:41,200
 as member of God's new community, which is the church.

554
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,800
 Let's pray.

555
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:47,100
 Father, we just wanna thank you, Lord.

556
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:52,160
 Just help us see the big contrast of where we were.

557
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,400
 We were not your family.

558
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,240
 We were cut off.

559
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,760
 We don't have any part of what the Israelites had.

560
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:05,860
 And our goal, the end point was hopelessness, Lord.

561
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:10,360
 But again, Father, Jesus changed that for us

562
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:14,880
 without us doing anything, while we were still his enemy,

563
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,720
 Lord, and he changed us and he put us as citizens

564
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,280
 right here along with everyone else

565
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,640
 who profess faith in Jesus Christ,

566
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:28,360
 where we get to build the church along with him, Lord.

567
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,040
 We thank you for this privileged position, Lord.

568
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,080
 Help the brothers and sisters right here

569
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:37,900
 have that, meditate on that, Father,

570
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,380
 that this position is not something

571
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,900
 that we could take granted for, Lord,

572
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:46,360
 but to be thankful every day of where we are,

573
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:50,420
 especially our status with you, Father God.

574
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,480
 We thank you so much.

575
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,020
 In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

576
00:27:53,020 --> 00:28:03,020
