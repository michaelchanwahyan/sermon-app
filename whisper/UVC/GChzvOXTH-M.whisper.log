[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200]   - You know, one of the things, good morning everyone.
[00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.000]   My name is Tommy Lee and I get a chance to lead
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.120]   this wonderful organization, Resource Global
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.500]   and the Growth Center and we get a chance to partner
[00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.660]   with Pastor Mark and his church.
[00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.320]   I love the humility of Pastor Mark
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.640]   and I love how even simple things of just coordinating
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.120]   some of these setups here on Sunday morning
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.560]   is something that I've learned from Mark as well too.
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.080]   Thank you James and you know,
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.400]   it's my first time meeting James in person.
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.080]   I got a chance to meet Phoebe also in person.
[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.360]   Our whole life these days is online.
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.880]   Our whole life is on Zoom and everything like that
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.840]   so when you get a chance to meet each other in person,
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.160]   it is a joy.
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.080]   I will probably say James is, when we chat with him,
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.360]   he had graduated from Moody Bible Institute in Chicago
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.520]   and now he works in the marketplace.
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.720]   And I think all of us in this day and age,
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.960]   this is the world of the modern day pastor,
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.120]   don't you think?
[00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.280]   And a lot of times there will still be a need
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.280]   of the full-time pastors, there will still be a good chunk
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.800]   of those who are full-time pastoral ministry
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.840]   who went to seminary and are doing that full-time
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.160]   as a vocation.
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.200]   But more and more as I encounter leaders
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.280]   from different parts of the world,
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.520]   they're wearing different hats.
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.640]   They're your bi-vocational pastor,
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.260]   whether or not their church won't be able to afford them
[00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.920]   in the full-time salary, so they're doing that
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.440]   and then from that point on, they're doing a job
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.200]   or there are different business leaders out there
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.760]   who are working in the area of finance or accounting
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.240]   or tech, but they love the church.
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.880]   And so they're doing that full-time and then on the weekends
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.560]   or on the time, they're working.
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.560]   There's this one friend I have, Shundren Thomas.
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.000]   Shundren is the president
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.640]   of Northern Trust Asset Management.
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.640]   Shundren is so successful in the area of private equity,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.600]   but yet on the weekends, he's the associate pastor
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.160]   of his dad's church.
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.400]   There's another guy, Dr. Nicholas Pierce.
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.440]   He is a MBA, executive MBA professor
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.720]   at Northwestern University.
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.840]   He does a great job in the area of education,
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.400]   but yet on the weekends, he's the associate pastor
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.240]   of his church.
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.200]   We're seeing that more and more as well too
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.160]   and that's why a lot of times with the Growth Center,
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.640]   I get a chance to partner with Pastor Mark
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.280]   and do all of these wonderful things
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.520]   that you guys are doing.
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.960]   Hey, let me just, before we dive into our sermon today,
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.760]   two, couple of things I did wanna share with you
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.600]   as well too.
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.800]   Let's bring up the first couple slides here.
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.900]   Next slide here.
[00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.240]   We are starting a certificate.
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.840]   I went to, for me, I spent 10 years building cell towers.
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.760]   That was my job, those big telecommunications tower.
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.820]   That was what I did for 10 years.
[00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.440]   But during the evening, I went to seminary
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.320]   and it was three grueling years of evening classes.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.800]   I walked away from seminary realizing
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.840]   that sometimes a seminary is not something
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.280]   that people can afford.
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.020]   It's not even something people can have time for.
[00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.600]   So what are some of the core classes that you need
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.960]   from some of the key teachers, whether it's Bible,
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.080]   theology, but leadership, culture, justice,
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.760]   integration, faith, and work that you need
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.520]   that allows you to really be able to gain the knowledge
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.000]   and education that you need.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.740]   So we've actually created a nine-month cohort program.
[00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.660]   If some of you guys who are listening
[00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.860]   or sitting here who are interested,
[00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.960]   I'll send you more information that Pastor Mark
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.960]   to send over to you once a week for nine months
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.840]   and you could decide, hey, I wanna do month one,
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.320]   but I don't wanna do month two.
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.900]   I could do month four taught by some practitioners,
[00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.080]   marketplace leaders.
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.000]   You have people like Ashundra Toms who I was talking with,
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.920]   Jillian Anderson who works at Gallup.
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.560]   Her job is working with Southwest Airlines
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.340]   in the area of Strength Finders.
[00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.840]   You have Pastor Albert Tate who does a great job
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.120]   of expository preaching in LA.
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.920]   Andy Crouch who wrote the wonderful book,
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.360]   "Culture, Making, and Power," and he does a great job
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.480]   talking about the role of Christians integrating in culture.
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.680]   Or Dr. Crawford Luritz who teaches a wonderful class
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.240]   in leadership that he taught over at Trinity,
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.360]   "Leadership as an Identity."
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.360]   Another one, next slide as well too,
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.520]   that I wanna point out is Mr. Dave Evans.
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.160]   If you have ever never talked to Mr. Dave Evans,
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.680]   he worked for Steve Jobs many years ago,
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.780]   created the mouse for Apple.
[00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.120]   Now he teaches at Stanford University
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.520]   called "Designing Your Life," a wonderful class
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.520]   that is always filled with people as well too.
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.440]   All talking about design thinking,
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.120]   how God uses design thinking to really be able
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.240]   to help you process the calling in your life.
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.120]   So that is it.
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.000]   I will send you guys more information.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.600]   Let's go, actually, let's hold off on all the slides.
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.480]   Two other things as well too.
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:06.480]   Is number one, and again, ministry has changed, doesn't it?
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.160]   And so I think a lot of times one of the things
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.260]   I've also been wondering, and I love what Urban Voice
[00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.380]   is doing with your church, I've been wondering, Mark,
[00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.800]   how do you plant churches in the meta universe?
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.240]   We've now done it over in Zoom, and we're getting used to it
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.000]   but around the world with government restrictions,
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.280]   access, whatever it is, Roblox has become
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:35.280]   one of the most popular platforms in all of the world.
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.120]   I sat down with a private equity analyst
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.360]   who studies all of the Asia markets,
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.840]   and she says, Tommy, you need to look at how ministry
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.840]   interacts with the world of Roblox in the meta world.
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.220]   Because a lot of times Katy Perry just did a live concert
[00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:00.460]   there and had over three million people attend.
[00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.220]   Another individual on Fortnite, Travis Scott,
[00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:09.160]   had a live concert there and had 30 million people attend.
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.340]   Another individual over in Bellevue in Seattle,
[00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.300]   or in the Washington area, created a youth ministry.
[00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:22.300]   He draws 40,000 youth from around the world
[00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.060]   for this youth ministry.
[00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.100]   And so as a result, as we begin to look at ministry,
[00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.140]   what are some of the creative ways,
[00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:33.200]   because the traditional church model is decreasing.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.200]   A lot of the American churches,
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.260]   I speak mostly for American church,
[00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.560]   their decline are coming from the younger people
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.440]   who are disengaged or frustrated with where the church is.
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:45.880]   So a couple of thoughts as well too,
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.040]   but look, it is always in ties in with our sermon
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.880]   as well too.
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.480]   All of us are anointed by God to do something unique.
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:57.820]   All of us are called by God to contribute to this world.
[00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:01.040]   How that looks like for each one of us
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.400]   is gonna be a little bit different.
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:07.000]   Today is a part two of our sermon called Anointed by God.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.960]   We're looking at a popular story that all of us,
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.680]   whether you're sitting here or you're sitting at home
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.360]   watching this, is a story of David and Goliath.
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.120]   A story that all of us have always been familiar with.
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.380]   Besides the crucifixion, besides the birth of Jesus,
[00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:26.960]   David and Goliath is a story that we've grown up hearing.
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.400]   The story of the little boy with the slingshot
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:34.400]   who takes on the nine foot giant in Goliath and wins.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.520]   And later on becomes the king of Israel.
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.040]   We love that story.
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.320]   It has a great happy ending.
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.880]   But within that story, there are some unique things
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:50.880]   that God teaches us and how God anoints a young boy.
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:55.120]   And through that journey, he allows him to have
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.720]   one turning point in his life
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:01.400]   that changes the course of his life.
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.200]   He is anointed by God.
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.720]   And we talked about part one two months ago.
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.800]   It may seem like eternity, part one two months ago.
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.360]   And today we're gonna talk about part two
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.000]   of anointed by God.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.440]   Some of the things, just to refresh your memory
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.680]   of what we talked about part one
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.220]   and we'll go on to part two.
[00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:19.480]   I talked about three things,
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.140]   six insights on being anointed by God.
[00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:24.040]   Two months ago we talked about the first three.
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.760]   So let me just review it.
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:29.000]   Number one, when God looks at the heart,
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.680]   when God anoints a leader,
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.940]   he looks at the heart of the individual
[00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:37.440]   versus the outer appearance.
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:40.560]   When God anoints a leader,
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:43.600]   he looks at the heart of the individual
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.200]   versus the outer appearance.
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.520]   And we talked about the story of Saul.
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:50.680]   If you guys all remember Saul,
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:53.280]   Saul was a man from Benjamin.
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.760]   Benjamin had a wonderful reputation.
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.960]   Benjamin was the elite of all of the tribes.
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.600]   Benjamin was a very wealthy tribe.
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.880]   That's where Saul came from.
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:07.160]   And Saul came from an extremely wealthy family,
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.520]   an extremely powerful family,
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:14.380]   and now he was brought in and selected as king.
[00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:17.700]   But sometimes having the outer appearance, right,
[00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.140]   doesn't qualify you to be king.
[00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:23.020]   Having the talents, having the smarts,
[00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:26.320]   having the wealth by appearance alone,
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:30.500]   outer appearance, does not qualify you for leadership.
[00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:33.380]   And as a result, through a series of mistakes
[00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:38.380]   that Saul makes, disqualifies him for leadership.
[00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:41.940]   And so then God sends Samuel the prophet
[00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:46.460]   over to Bethlehem to meet Jesse and his family.
[00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:49.340]   And he says, "Jesse, there when you meet this guy,
[00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:51.800]   "a Bethlehemite by the name of Jesse,
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.540]   "you will find your first king."
[00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:56.780]   And there Jesse goes, and the story goes,
[00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:59.340]   some of you guys, he brings all of his son,
[00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:02.700]   Jesse calls all of his son, the first three oldest boys,
[00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:05.700]   and the first one is Eliab, and he looks at Eliab,
[00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:08.940]   he is the oldest, he is the strongest of all of the boys,
[00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:13.940]   and Samuel says to him, "Surely, surely, that is the king."
[00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:18.260]   And God reminds him, says to Samuel,
[00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.680]   "Do not look on his appearance,
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.160]   "or on the height of his stature,
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.280]   "because I have rejected him.
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:27.780]   "For the Lord sees not as man sees.
[00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:30.820]   "Man looks on the outward appearance,
[00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:33.020]   "but the Lord looks on the heart."
[00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:36.700]   And so Eliab was in it.
[00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:40.340]   And remember, later on, Eliab becomes very key in the story.
[00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:44.380]   And he looks at his second son, that was in it as well too.
[00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:46.780]   And he goes for the third son, that was in it.
[00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:50.560]   And Samuel then says, "Jesse, is there anyone else?
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.080]   "Oh, I forgot, there's David, the young boy
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:56.000]   "who's out in the shepherd field, call him."
[00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:01.300]   And there God, Samuel anoints him as the king.
[00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:06.300]   Story goes on, sometime later on, a battle takes place.
[00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:10.460]   And this battle takes place in the Valley of Eliab,
[00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:13.460]   between the Philistines and the Israelites.
[00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:14.940]   One of the things, if you guys remember,
[00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:16.320]   that I talked about, the differences
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.740]   between the Philistines and the Israelites,
[00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:20.460]   and we're gonna talk a little bit about
[00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:23.940]   why Eliab was so important in today.
[00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:27.280]   But look, the Philistines were coastal people.
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:30.540]   The Philistines were sophisticated cultural people.
[00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:35.040]   The Philistines learned how to use iron for weapons
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:38.540]   and tools and maintain monopoly on the markets.
[00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:41.460]   They were masters at working with iron.
[00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:44.160]   As a result, they had the technology and tools
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.200]   to make them one of the strongest,
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.420]   one of the most elite tribes at that time.
[00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:51.820]   They could make shields, they could make swords,
[00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:55.260]   they could make spears, they could make armor, everything.
[00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.620]   Compare that to the Israelites.
[00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:03.300]   The Israelites were primitive in comparison.
[00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:05.980]   They were not a professional army.
[00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:08.700]   They were shepherds and farmers.
[00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:11.240]   They had outdated weapons.
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:14.560]   Probably the only two that had even any armors
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:19.040]   or shields or swords was Saul, their leader, their king,
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.160]   and Jonathan, their son.
[00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:22.440]   That's it.
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:25.820]   So you're having a ragtag bunch of guys
[00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:30.820]   who were farmers and shepherds against this group,
[00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:32.660]   and the odds were great.
[00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:35.780]   Why Eliab, as you said?
[00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:36.780]   Guys, if you get a chance,
[00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:38.580]   take a look at this particular map,
[00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:42.240]   and you'll see, next slide, right there.
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.980]   Look at where Gath is.
[00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:48.280]   Look at where Azekah is in Soko.
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:51.220]   That right there is the Valley of Elah.
[00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:54.740]   If you look at north, what do you see there?
[00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:57.580]   It leads to a lot of things.
[00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:00.760]   The richness of the Jordanian Valley.
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.260]   Thank you, guys.
[00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:06.420]   And the reason why is where Israelite was positioned
[00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:10.460]   led to a passageway into the Jordanian Valley
[00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:12.420]   into much riches.
[00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:15.540]   And so the Philistines had to defeat the Israelites
[00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:19.560]   and get rid of them in order to gain access
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:20.960]   into this passageway.
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:24.000]   They were standing in their way.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.360]   And so they brought all of their armies
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:30.400]   from Gath over to the Valley Elah.
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.160]   And this is why they were so weak.
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.080]   They were so weak.
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.960]   The Israelites were so weak.
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.560]   The Philistines are looking at it and says,
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.120]   you know what, they're not worth our time.
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.600]   We're not gonna get our guys into battle
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:42.800]   and try to fight them.
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:43.800]   Let's just get it easy.
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.300]   So they called in their big giant Goliath
[00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:50.040]   and say, Goliath, we're gonna call, bring you in.
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:52.300]   And Israelites, bring in your best champion,
[00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:54.400]   which was supposed to be Saul.
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:55.560]   And we're gonna have a duel.
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:57.280]   Whoever wins gets access.
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:00.480]   If we win, Israelites, we'll go away.
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:03.760]   But if you lose, you go away and we take over.
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.200]   Easy.
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:09.160]   So for 40 days, this happens,
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.440]   which leads us to the second point.
[00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:16.280]   That you never know when God is calling.
[00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:18.040]   Because if the first point that we had
[00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:20.120]   is that when God anoints a leader,
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:23.040]   he looks at the heart of the individual
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:25.040]   versus the outer appearance.
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:26.800]   The second point is this one.
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:29.120]   You never know when God will come calling.
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:32.940]   Here is David who just got anointed by God
[00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:34.960]   as the next king.
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:38.160]   Samuel whispers to him, you're gonna be the next king.
[00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.000]   And what happens?
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.560]   Does David then become the next king?
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:43.900]   No, he goes back to the field.
[00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:45.060]   He becomes a shepherd boy.
[00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:46.820]   And then Jesse comes calling him and says,
[00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:48.100]   hey, come here, come here.
[00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:51.500]   I need you to bring food to your brothers.
[00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:53.960]   And from that point on, bring these 10 cheeses
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.100]   to the commander and their thousands.
[00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:59.500]   Bring some food to your brothers, make sure they're well.
[00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:02.180]   And bring some token from them.
[00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:05.500]   You never know when God is calling you
[00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:07.860]   to do something amazing in your life.
[00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:10.280]   So God looks at the outer appearances.
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:12.140]   But yet God calls you.
[00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:15.860]   We look at the story of Nehemiah at age 60 something, right?
[00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:17.780]   He's a cupbearer to the king.
[00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:21.860]   And now he's called because he has a burden
[00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:24.380]   to rebuild the walls of Israel.
[00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:27.380]   Peter, James, and John are fishermen.
[00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:32.380]   God calls them to take up and leave their job as fishermen
[00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:34.380]   and to come and follow me.
[00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:37.220]   But then we also see Zacchaeus, don't we?
[00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:38.940]   Zacchaeus is a tax collector,
[00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:43.260]   not just any tax collector, but the chief tax collector.
[00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.600]   And somehow or another he encounters Jesus
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.900]   because there's something about his life
[00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:49.260]   that he doesn't like to see.
[00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.420]   And what happens with Zacchaeus?
[00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:52.900]   God calls and says, Zacchaeus,
[00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:55.660]   I need to spend time in your home.
[00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:59.740]   But yet he doesn't call him into full-time ministry.
[00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:02.140]   He doesn't call him just like he calls James
[00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:04.480]   and John and Peter to pick up everything and follow.
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.560]   Matthew calls him as a tax collector,
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:07.680]   pick up everything, follow him.
[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.880]   But Zacchaeus is different.
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:12.640]   Zacchaeus, I need you to go back
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:15.180]   and become the tax collector again.
[00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:18.840]   But I want you to be a better version of the tax collector.
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:21.740]   You never know when God is calling.
[00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:24.060]   You never know what he's calling you to do.
[00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:28.100]   And that calling may not sometimes be vocational ministry.
[00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:30.780]   Maybe you're calling like I was talking with James.
[00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:32.920]   Graduate from seminary
[00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:34.900]   and now work in the corporate marketplace,
[00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:38.020]   but still using his skills as a worship leader,
[00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:41.300]   a wonderful worship leader, and in ministry as well too.
[00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:44.180]   It all looks differently as well too.
[00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:46.340]   For me, I grew up, I worked 10 years
[00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:48.780]   in the corporate world building cell towers.
[00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:50.580]   I always thought I was supposed to be a minister.
[00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:52.500]   I thought I was supposed to be a pastor.
[00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:54.040]   After three years, I realized,
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:55.860]   God, you're not calling me to be a pastor.
[00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:58.220]   That is not what I'm called to do.
[00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:00.140]   Worked at Moody Bible Institute as seminary
[00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:01.700]   for a number of years under the president.
[00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:03.420]   I thought that was it.
[00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:06.620]   After three years, that ended, and God closed that door.
[00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:08.460]   And now for the last 12 years,
[00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:10.820]   I get a chance to run multiple organizations,
[00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:14.060]   not one, but two, four, five organizations,
[00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:17.740]   because I realized God had wired me differently.
[00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:20.020]   That the traditional way of doing church
[00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:22.420]   was not what my calling was.
[00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:24.580]   But I get a chance to work with marketplace leaders.
[00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:27.660]   I get a chance to launch new organizations.
[00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:28.900]   That's what God was calling to do.
[00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:31.700]   You never know what God is calling.
[00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:34.180]   You're always sitting there looking and seeing
[00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:37.020]   and asking God to really work in your life.
[00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:39.140]   And the third thing, the anointed leader
[00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:41.540]   will be criticized by others.
[00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:43.380]   That you won't make everyone happy,
[00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:46.220]   and your goal is not to strive to make everyone happy,
[00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:48.020]   because we saw the story of Eliab,
[00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:51.580]   where when he sees David, Eliab, the oldest brother,
[00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:53.820]   he sees David and says, why have you come down?
[00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:58.620]   With whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness?
[00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:02.060]   That God's anointed can be criticized
[00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:05.540]   because we're never gonna meet everyone's expectations.
[00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:07.620]   There are things that we do or don't do
[00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:10.140]   that's not gonna make everyone happy.
[00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:12.500]   We're gonna not meet the expectations
[00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:14.060]   that people have of us.
[00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:17.260]   And so God's anointed needs to learn how to,
[00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:20.540]   as we talked about, needs to be thick-skinned.
[00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:24.460]   You can't take things personally.
[00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:26.860]   You have to learn to hear what people have to say,
[00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:28.480]   learn to listen to feedback,
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:31.380]   but you have to be thick-skinned
[00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:33.660]   and continue to strive to do what is best
[00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:36.080]   to honor the Lord in everything that you do.
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:40.080]   And there it goes to verse 34.
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:42.580]   But David said to Saul in verse 34
[00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:46.820]   in 1 Samuel chapter 17, in verse 34,
[00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:48.940]   in the story of David and Goliath,
[00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:52.840]   David said to Saul, as soon as he volunteers
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:56.300]   to kill Goliath, Saul says, what in the world are you?
[00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:58.240]   Who are you again?
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.080]   You're this tiny little shepherd boy
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:03.900]   coming to bring cheese to his brothers.
[00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:05.300]   But David said to Saul,
[00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:11.240]   your servant, in chapter 17, verse 34,
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:15.440]   your servant used to keep sheep for his father.
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:19.940]   And when there came a lion or a bear
[00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:21.740]   and took a lamb from the flock,
[00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:24.620]   I went after him and struck him
[00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:27.380]   and delivered it out of his mouth.
[00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:30.980]   And if he rose against me, I caught him by his beard
[00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:33.800]   and struck him and killed him.
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:37.220]   Your servant has struck down both lions and bears,
[00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:39.620]   and this uncircumcised Philistine
[00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:41.460]   shall be like one of them,
[00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:45.100]   for he has defied the armies of the living God.
[00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:47.620]   And David said, the Lord who delivered me
[00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:51.900]   from the pawl of the lion and from the pawl of the bear
[00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:55.300]   will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.
[00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:59.220]   And Saul said to David, go and the Lord be with you.
[00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:01.580]   Which goes to my fourth point.
[00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:06.580]   God uses your past to prepare you for the future.
[00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:13.280]   God uses your past to prepare you for the future.
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:16.280]   Why do I say this?
[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:20.700]   Some of us are always in the midst of looking
[00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:24.380]   to see what God is doing, what God is calling us to do.
[00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:26.500]   We're anxious.
[00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:28.140]   Across the board, when I travel,
[00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:31.060]   I get a chance to travel to Southeast Asia, Nairobi,
[00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:33.440]   I hear the same thing from young leaders,
[00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:35.820]   especially those in their mid-20s and their mid-30s.
[00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:37.580]   They always say to me, Tommy,
[00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:40.020]   I wanna know what God is calling me to do.
[00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:43.260]   I just wanna know what God is calling me to do.
[00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:45.460]   And one of the things I've always had to tell them,
[00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:48.800]   I said, you gotta learn to be patient in this sense.
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:53.100]   That sometimes God doesn't tell you what to do.
[00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:56.500]   God, sometimes God leaves you in limbo
[00:20:56.500 --> 00:21:00.180]   because remember, you are on a journey
[00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:01.260]   that he wants you to be.
[00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:04.980]   And so as a result, he wants you to learn to be faithful
[00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:09.180]   to where he has placed you right now.
[00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:14.640]   And he uses that experience to prepare you
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:17.780]   for something that he wants you to do.
[00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:20.940]   I say this, we look at scripture, Nicodemus, right?
[00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:23.660]   Nicodemus was in his mid-60s before what?
[00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:27.260]   Before God says, I need you to build this wall for Jerusalem
[00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:29.460]   but what was Nicodemus doing this whole time?
[00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:31.980]   He was a faithful what?
[00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:35.140]   Cupbearer to the king.
[00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:37.540]   He served the king faithfully.
[00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:40.460]   He did his job well.
[00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:43.380]   He was a great employee.
[00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:46.460]   And when he finally got that burden to rebuild the wall,
[00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:47.340]   what happens?
[00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:53.220]   His boss, the king, who Nicodemus served faithfully well,
[00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:58.580]   was his first and only donor, funded his entire project,
[00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:01.200]   gave him the vacation days and the time off
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:04.420]   to go and do his job because what?
[00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:07.540]   He was a great employee.
[00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:10.100]   When I graduated from Washington University in St. Louis,
[00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:12.140]   I graduated with a business degree.
[00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:13.780]   And there I was looking for a job
[00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:15.100]   and I got hired in my job
[00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:16.980]   and it was a company by the name of American Tower
[00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:19.380]   and they built cell towers for a living.
[00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:22.860]   And I thought, great, I come from a Ivy League school,
[00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:25.780]   Washington University in St. Louis.
[00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:26.700]   What is my job?
[00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:27.940]   Am I gonna oversee a team?
[00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:29.420]   Am I gonna oversee projects?
[00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:30.260]   Tell me what it is.
[00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:32.240]   They said, yes, your first job.
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:35.060]   You see all those files that we just got?
[00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:36.720]   Verizon Wireless, at that point in time,
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:41.720]   we acquired 200 towers and all of their documents,
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:44.820]   all of their files in one room,
[00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:47.420]   unorganized construction drawings,
[00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:50.220]   all of this random drawings.
[00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:51.620]   You see that?
[00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:53.220]   Organize that room.
[00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:54.420]   What?
[00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:57.060]   I just graduated from university.
[00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:58.620]   I graduated with a management degree.
[00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:00.060]   You want me to do what?
[00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:03.620]   Lord, what are you calling me to do?
[00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:06.900]   What can I learn from this?
[00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:09.120]   So I said, Lord, if you would put me in here,
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:11.460]   I'm gonna do the best job I could possibly do.
[00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:14.540]   And I organized that file room pretty well.
[00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:18.420]   But more so, I learned how to be organized.
[00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:20.940]   I learned the discipline of spotting
[00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:24.340]   and creating structures that I never learned before,
[00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:25.820]   day in and day out.
[00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:29.180]   For over six months, I did that.
[00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:33.420]   And so after I did that, my boss said to me,
[00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:36.380]   you did great, now I need you to do something different.
[00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:39.340]   I need you to create a system to scan everything.
[00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:40.180]   Really?
[00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:41.980]   I gotta scan everything?
[00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:44.180]   Back then we had scanners and we had to take card copies
[00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:45.940]   and sit there and scan it.
[00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:48.580]   And so I did that for another four months.
[00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:51.100]   Oh, God, I look back now, it's 12 years later.
[00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:57.020]   God used that time in my life to create me a discipline,
[00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:59.380]   to be organized.
[00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:03.040]   He helped me to spot how to create patterns,
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:04.900]   how to organize different things,
[00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:06.580]   how to organize different projects,
[00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:09.940]   how to really be able to use Excel, all of that.
[00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:13.820]   To this day, I still use that.
[00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:15.860]   One of the things that people tell me all the time,
[00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:18.620]   they say, Tommy, you organize your team so well
[00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:21.100]   and you are able to keep in line everything.
[00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:24.500]   How do you manage so many different projects?
[00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:28.860]   And I think back to all those months
[00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:32.700]   of being in a file room, learning grudgingly
[00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:34.740]   and saying, Lord, if you've placed me,
[00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:37.980]   or how can I be faithful to where you have placed me
[00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:38.900]   in my life?
[00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:40.900]   You never know.
[00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:42.260]   We sit there and we grumble.
[00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:44.500]   This is, we're above this.
[00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:46.860]   No, where has God placed you?
[00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:49.060]   How can we be faithful?
[00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:51.300]   How do we continue to be a good witness,
[00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:54.180]   to honor and faithful to where he has placed us
[00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:55.260]   in whatever job?
[00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:57.620]   Because you may be sitting here right now,
[00:24:57.620 --> 00:25:01.020]   watching this, you're saying, I can't stand my job.
[00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:02.660]   I can't stand my boss.
[00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:04.820]   I hate everything that I'm doing.
[00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:07.460]   What is God teaching you?
[00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:11.060]   Why does he have you right there?
[00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:15.100]   Why is that so important during this first time?
[00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:18.340]   What is he showing you?
[00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:22.660]   God uses your past to prepare you in the future.
[00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:25.740]   One little thing, I get a chance to work
[00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:27.780]   with young leaders around the world,
[00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:30.220]   especially Indonesia, I love Indonesia.
[00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:32.900]   I get a chance to work with these young leaders
[00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:35.780]   who are now starting businesses
[00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:38.820]   and they're growing in massive, not only wealth,
[00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:41.660]   but power that will influence their city.
[00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:43.380]   They're running family businesses
[00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:47.140]   and what they call unicorn companies that are growing big.
[00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:49.580]   And I get a chance in the honor of serving
[00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:52.100]   and working alongside with them to integrate their faith
[00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:54.100]   in everything that they do.
[00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:56.140]   But you know why I'm doing that so well,
[00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:57.900]   or I've gotten a chance to work?
[00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:02.260]   Because I sat in a church in Chinatown, Chicago
[00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:07.260]   for 18 years, working with youth in high school and college.
[00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:09.820]   And I learned how to work with them
[00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:12.620]   because during those 18 years in that private
[00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:15.340]   with those 100, 200 students that came in
[00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:17.180]   and out every single year,
[00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:19.340]   I learned what it meant to be a leader.
[00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:22.580]   I learned what it meant to work with developing leaders,
[00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:24.060]   working with younger leaders,
[00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:25.900]   what it meant to work with volunteers,
[00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:27.380]   what it meant to plan games,
[00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:28.740]   what it meant to plan events,
[00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:31.940]   to sit there and plan, all of those things
[00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:34.340]   led me to what I am doing now.
[00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:38.100]   You never know, you never know.
[00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:39.620]   God has powerful plans,
[00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:41.420]   and here's my encouragement for those who are watching,
[00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:43.340]   God has powerful plans in your life.
[00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:48.540]   But he may not have revealed it to you right now.
[00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:51.500]   So are you faithful to where he has placed you
[00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:54.300]   at that moment because God uses your past
[00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:57.780]   to prepare you for the future.
[00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:03.460]   Second thing is in 1 Samuel 17, 38 through 40,
[00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:06.340]   then Saul called David with his armor.
[00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:08.380]   He put a helmet of bronze on his head
[00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:10.900]   and clothed them with a coat of mail.
[00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:13.180]   And David strapped his sword over his armor,
[00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:16.220]   he tried it, and he tried in vain to go
[00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:18.580]   for he had not tested them.
[00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:21.300]   Then David said to Saul, "I cannot go with these,
[00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:24.060]   "for I have not tested them."
[00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:26.660]   So he put them off, then he took his hand,
[00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:29.700]   took his staff in his hand,
[00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:33.660]   and chose five smooth stones from the brook
[00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:35.620]   and put them in the shepherd's pouch.
[00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:39.740]   His sling was his hand and he approached the Philistine.
[00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:40.700]   Let me show you another picture.
[00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:42.140]   Let's show the last slide over there
[00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:44.940]   of what that sling looked like, that slingshot.
[00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:49.380]   Right there, that's what the slingshot did look at.
[00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:50.980]   Couple things.
[00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:55.980]   Ironically, Saul chooses to give David his armor
[00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:58.100]   and sword and everything like that.
[00:27:58.100 --> 00:27:59.540]   Here's why.
[00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:03.860]   Let me read to you, Judges 20, verses 15 through 17.
[00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:06.500]   Judges 20, 15 through 17.
[00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:11.500]   The people of Benjamin, remember which tribe Saul was in,
[00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:15.280]   the people of Benjamin mustered out of their cities
[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:20.280]   on that day 26,000 men who drew the sword
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:23.460]   besides the inhabitants of Gibeah
[00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:26.060]   who mustered 700 chosen men.
[00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:31.060]   Among all those were 700 chosen men from Benjamin
[00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:34.620]   who were left-handed.
[00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:39.620]   Everyone could sling a stone at a hair and not miss.
[00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:45.500]   The tribe of Benjamin were experts at the slingshot.
[00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:48.060]   Ironic, isn't it?
[00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:51.100]   That Saul, where is he from?
[00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:52.700]   The tribe of what?
[00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:53.860]   Benjamin.
[00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:57.780]   The very tribe who knew how to use a slingshot,
[00:28:57.780 --> 00:28:59.120]   they used it in battle.
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:02.520]   They were skilled marksmen with the slingshot.
[00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:06.800]   He gives David a sword and a shield, armor, all of that.
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:08.440]   David puts on him.
[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:09.440]   Does it work?
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:12.200]   Lesson here is this.
[00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:16.800]   What works for others may not necessarily work for you.
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:20.120]   What advice people give you, what they tell you to do
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:22.360]   may not necessarily work for you.
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:26.000]   And does that mean as leaders we sit there
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.240]   and we don't listen because hey,
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:28.080]   we're gonna do it our way?
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:30.320]   No, you listen.
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:32.240]   One of the best things, qualities about leadership
[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:34.600]   is you're listening to people.
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:36.720]   You're always trying to improve yourself.
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:38.560]   You're always trying to be the best version
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:40.020]   that God calls you to be.
[00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:42.500]   But in the midst of that, always knowing that sometimes
[00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:47.280]   the answers that they give you, it may not work for you.
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:48.120]   That's how it works.
[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:49.480]   Let me give you an example.
[00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:54.480]   My mother is trained in Hong Kong as a teacher.
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:58.600]   And she has a very, very stern way of teaching.
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:01.440]   Growing up, we always had to get straight A's.
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:03.200]   And she had a chopstick on her finger
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:04.700]   that if we got a math problem wrong,
[00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:06.680]   that chopstick went on her finger.
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:08.200]   If we got a spelling word wrong,
[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:11.240]   we had to sit there and write it out 100 times.
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:13.960]   Well, and she's always reminding us,
[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:16.640]   you have to get straight A's, education, education,
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:18.080]   all that you do.
[00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:21.880]   Well, now I have a daughter and she's seven years old.
[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:24.560]   Well, she goes to my mom's school over here in Bridgeport,
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:26.000]   here in Chicago.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.100]   My mom takes her way because that's her way
[00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:30.880]   of doing education, that she believes
[00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:32.360]   is work on straight A's.
[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:34.380]   And she tries to use this on my daughter.
[00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:35.920]   Not to say it doesn't work,
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:37.400]   but I keep telling my mom all the time,
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:40.900]   you have to understand that getting straight A's
[00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:42.640]   is not always the end all.
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:45.800]   Just driving, studying without interaction
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:47.280]   is not always the end all.
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:49.520]   But in her mind, no, no, no, this is the best.
[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:51.680]   You have to study all the time.
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:54.400]   To the point, my daughter doesn't like going to her house
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:57.560]   anymore because my mom is at the same school.
[00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:59.920]   She picks her up and she sits there
[00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:02.880]   and she makes her study from three o'clock
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:05.280]   all the way to five and then when she wants her
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:07.760]   to go to her house on Sundays to do homework,
[00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:10.000]   what do you think is gonna happen with my daughter?
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.320]   She cries every single time she has to go
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:15.760]   to her grandmother's house because she doesn't wanna go.
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:18.160]   And I keep telling my mom, maybe you need to lighten up.
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:21.160]   No, no, you need to make them study all the time.
[00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:23.860]   It's gonna look different, folks.
[00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:28.420]   What worked for them may not necessarily work for you.
[00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:31.740]   And so as a leader, hear from people.
[00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:33.940]   Listen to what people have to say.
[00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:38.980]   But you gotta figure out, is it gonna work for me?
[00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:40.660]   Is it gonna work for me?
[00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:42.940]   In all of the leadership that you have.
[00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:46.280]   As a leader, those who are anointed by God,
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:49.300]   you're gonna hear advice from problems,
[00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:51.340]   you're gonna hear solutions to the problems
[00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:53.880]   that you deal with all of the time.
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:56.980]   And some of them, listen to it.
[00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:58.220]   Some of them, will it work?
[00:31:58.220 --> 00:31:59.460]   Probably not.
[00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:01.280]   You gotta figure out that decision.
[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:03.260]   But as leaders, on the other flip chart,
[00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:08.260]   if you have a team, don't insist that your way works.
[00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:11.020]   Don't insist that your way works.
[00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:12.780]   What works for others may not work for you.
[00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:15.700]   Your job as a leader, for God's anointing,
[00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:18.040]   God has given you people to shepherd
[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:20.780]   to help them find their voice,
[00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:23.420]   to help them learn how to think.
[00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:25.740]   I work for one ministry leader,
[00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:30.740]   and Caucasian guy, older guy, his way was always the best.
[00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:33.320]   His style was always the best.
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:35.900]   You couldn't make the decision unless you do it,
[00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:38.300]   run it by him for him to give you the okay.
[00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:41.700]   That way worked for him, probably for a period of time.
[00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:43.660]   Doesn't work for everyone.
[00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:47.300]   What works for others may not necessarily work for you.
[00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:49.820]   And the last one I want to look at,
[00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:54.100]   is the battle goes on, David takes a slingshot,
[00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:56.820]   from afar, he defeats Goliath.
[00:32:56.820 --> 00:33:01.220]   And David said to the Philistine, right before that,
[00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:04.840]   you come to me with a sword and with a spear,
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:07.360]   and with a javelin, nine foot tall Goliath.
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:13.600]   But I come to you in the name of the Lord of hosts,
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:16.660]   the God of the armies of Israel,
[00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:19.020]   whom you have defied.
[00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:23.860]   God uses your past to prepare you for the future.
[00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:28.580]   What works for others may not work for you.
[00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:29.920]   We have to understand that.
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:34.920]   And thirdly, the Lord's anointed is a concern
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:37.620]   about upholding the glory of God,
[00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:43.500]   and honoring God and he or she goes out before the Lord,
[00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:46.120]   in everything they do.
[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:51.160]   You're a steward of who God is.
[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:54.400]   You're a steward of what God is calling you to be.
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:57.640]   Your life is no longer yours.
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:00.640]   I pick on James because I see him right in front of me.
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:02.600]   James who's at Moody Bible Institute,
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:04.940]   that life isn't his.
[00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:08.140]   His calling to work in the marketplace,
[00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:10.720]   that life and that calling isn't his.
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:12.080]   It's a calling that God says,
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:14.240]   that God, what do you want me to do?
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:15.880]   I graduate from a seminary,
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:17.920]   but Lord, what is it that you want me to do?
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:20.520]   His life is coming before the Lord with an open hand
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:23.680]   to say, Lord, my life is yours.
[00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:24.680]   I give it to you.
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:29.320]   But that decision has to come early on, doesn't it?
[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:30.760]   Again, going back to Indonesia,
[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:32.480]   one of the, I get a chance,
[00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:34.640]   one of this 24 year old individuals,
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:36.120]   I had a chance to sit down and talk with him,
[00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:38.200]   I had a mentor who sat with him.
[00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:41.440]   He had started and he had invested $10,000
[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:45.520]   and he got an investment of $10,000 to work on a startup.
[00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:48.480]   Well, that startup grew,
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:52.240]   that he sold his business for $132 million.
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:55.840]   But one of the things that we talked to him about
[00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:57.040]   before he did this startup,
[00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:59.000]   and I said, so and so,
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.640]   whose life does it belong to?
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:03.680]   Whose life do you belong to?
[00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:06.880]   Because if that life is the Lord's,
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:09.160]   then you gotta make a decision right now,
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:10.580]   what you're gonna do with that money
[00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:13.520]   before your company goes really successful
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:15.400]   and you make tons of money.
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:17.320]   Because when you make that decision,
[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:19.400]   once you become rich,
[00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:21.360]   you won't make that decision.
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:25.120]   You're gonna have to make that decision early on,
[00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:27.320]   before you become wealthy,
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:29.000]   before you get that job,
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.580]   before, whose life do you belong to?
[00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:35.960]   Because when we're right in that mist,
[00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:38.960]   it's not gonna be very good.
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:42.320]   And we're gonna make decisions that benefit us.
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:44.800]   I share this with you because for many of us,
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:46.520]   money is a huge issue, isn't it?
[00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:48.180]   We worry about money.
[00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:50.400]   We like that life.
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:51.840]   My wife and I, early on,
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:54.080]   when we first started Resource Global,
[00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:55.520]   we had no money.
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:58.000]   I still remember the early days of Resource Global
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.320]   when we first started 12 years ago.
[00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:02.520]   I sat there, I had maxed out my credit cards,
[00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:04.560]   not very good for a startup.
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:09.560]   I had my last amount of $200 left to get a hotel,
[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:14.720]   to meet with the donor, all of those different things.
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:16.880]   But my wife and I said,
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:18.920]   can we live on one salary?
[00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:24.500]   And can we always use that rest of the salary that we have
[00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:28.920]   to glorify the Lord in everything that we do?
[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:31.440]   To continue to support it for ministry initiatives
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:35.720]   because Lord, that money is not ours.
[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:39.000]   We're a steward of the money and the time and gifts
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.520]   that He has given us.
[00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:42.480]   Fast forward 12 years later,
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:47.120]   I've gotten doing pretty well financially.
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:49.480]   This organization has grown to a point where it was zero
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:52.920]   and now it's about $1,000,001.5 million.
[00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:54.240]   Things are going well.
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:56.200]   My wife is doing well at work as a teacher.
[00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:58.600]   Her salary continues to increase.
[00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:01.880]   Does our giving change?
[00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:03.320]   The answer is no.
[00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:06.040]   We're still committed, doing the same thing.
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:08.760]   And I'm not standing here bragging about it.
[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:10.740]   It's a commitment that we have to make.
[00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:13.520]   It's a commitment that all of us have to make in our lives.
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:15.760]   Whose life do we belong to?
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:17.960]   And that our life belongs to the Lord.
[00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:20.440]   And if the Lord calls us that it's about others first
[00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:23.340]   and never ours, then it makes it easy.
[00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:25.480]   That the Lord's anointed, as David talks about,
[00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:28.200]   is concerned about upholding the glory of God
[00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:31.040]   and honoring the God, that I come to you
[00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:32.600]   in the name of the Lord, the host,
[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:34.440]   the God of the armies of Israel,
[00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:36.480]   whom you have defied, and Lord,
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:38.320]   you are calling me to do this.
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:40.580]   So the answer makes it easy.
[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:45.880]   That the money that I have is not mine,
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:47.840]   but rather it's yours.
[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:50.620]   And so when Mark and church is so gracious
[00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:53.740]   to give me an honorarium every single time I speak,
[00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:55.120]   the answer is simple.
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:57.480]   Mark, you use it back for your church
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:59.520]   because this money is not mine.
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:03.280]   I do it out of humbleness because of what you have provided
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:04.560]   for me in the cross.
[00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:08.560]   This person needs help, great.
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:10.000]   This money isn't mine, Lord.
[00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:13.720]   And the Lord blesses me, probably not in financial ways,
[00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:16.180]   but in ways that I can't even imagine.
[00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:20.240]   Whose life do you belong to?
