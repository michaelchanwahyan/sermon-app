[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960]   - Hey, welcome to all of you.
[00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.220]   And some of our folks are actually out of town,
[00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.120]   so we have less people here, but that's okay.
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.180]   We're gonna worship together,
[00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.960]   and I pray that you will open the Bible
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.200]   and turn to the book of Proverbs,
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.840]   and we're going to think about what it means to be a father.
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.240]   Today's Father's Day, right?
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.960]   Yeah, happy Father's Day to all the fathers here, okay?
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:30.800]   That's me.
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.680]   (audience laughing)
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.040]   And then soon to be father, happy Father's Day.
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.760]   I wanna start with a question.
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.960]   What do you think of when you see this word, father?
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.080]   Father.
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.320]   What kind of image do you have in mind?
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.280]   Do you think of father, fatherhood?
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.280]   Do you think of courage, loyalty, faithfulness?
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.920]   Responsibilities, loyalty, wisdom, perhaps?
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.300]   Do you think of that, those terms?
[00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.440]   You do?
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.720]   All right.
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.360]   But most of the time, I think, sadly,
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.760]   we are in a crisis of fatherhood,
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.200]   and absentee father, probably you can think of that
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.520]   when you see father, or think about father,
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.820]   abusive father, detached father,
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.420]   or angry father.
[00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.760]   I don't know what you think of,
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.080]   especially in the Asian context.
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.960]   Sometimes we think of all sorts of negative images
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.400]   related to fatherhood.
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.060]   According to some of the numbers,
[00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.600]   24 million children in United States,
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.800]   they grow up without a biological father.
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.920]   So that's one in three, right?
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.280]   That's a pretty big number, right?
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.040]   One out of three children, you know,
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.200]   growing up without a biological dad in their home.
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.600]   That is the crisis of fatherhood,
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.180]   and that leads to all sorts of different crises
[00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.240]   about your personal development,
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.000]   about our personal identity,
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   about how we anchor who we are with our fathers.
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.240]   So that's a huge crisis,
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.720]   and that's why we need to talk about this, okay?
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.360]   Today's Father's Day, and I would like to think
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.600]   a little bit more about what it means to be a father,
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.760]   and hopefully this will not be applicable
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.640]   only to fathers, but to all of us.
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.360]   Think of the fathers in the Bible.
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.600]   Any negative examples in the Bible?
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.640]   Abraham, Isaac, Jacob?
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.640]   They're not colorful or beautiful figures most of the time.
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.760]   They have their own weaknesses and brokenness, right?
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.360]   Think of Jacob, right?
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.480]   He favored one of his sons, right?
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.320]   Joseph, and brings about some sort of family emergency
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.960]   or family crisis.
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.400]   He almost breaks apart the entire family
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.320]   because of his favoritism on Joseph,
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.280]   destroying the family of God.
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.160]   Without the grace of God at the end of the book of Genesis,
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.060]   the family cannot be safe, right?
[00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.440]   So negative image of father.
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.320]   And then probably you can think of some positive image
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.480]   of a father from the Bible, right?
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.480]   Joseph, New Testament, Jesus' earthly father, right?
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.960]   Being described as righteous, right?
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.080]   Obedient to Torah.
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.960]   Father Abraham, again, he believed in God
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.000]   and God credited him righteousness, right?
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.440]   He trusted in God.
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.920]   So there's some mixed complexity
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.400]   with all the fathers in the Bible.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.480]   But I think this is good news.
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.680]   The good news is that even with our own brokenness,
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.680]   I'm somebody's father and I struggle with my own witnesses.
[00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:22.860]   I struggle with my, you know, there's all sorts of things.
[00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.540]   Brokenness, in order to be a father,
[00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.540]   I try to be a father that is pleasing to God.
[00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.600]   And I think this is good news when we see, you know,
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.240]   all sorts of different positive fathers
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.940]   or negative fathers in the Bible.
[00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.220]   And the grace of God is always sufficient.
[00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.060]   It's always abundant.
[00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.460]   And only if we have the courage,
[00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.540]   only if we have the humility to come before God
[00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.020]   to be shaped by the grace of God.
[00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.460]   So today, I hope the message will not be
[00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.500]   just applicable to the fathers, but to all of us.
[00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:04.700]   Now, if you turn to your Bible,
[00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.980]   in the middle part of the Bible, there are five books.
[00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.980]   Job, Psalm, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Psalms.
[00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.300]   These five books, what we call together,
[00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.220]   is the body of literature.
[00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.940]   We call them wisdom literature.
[00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.260]   Wisdom literature.
[00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.780]   And each of these books has its own way
[00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.660]   to show the life of wisdom.
[00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.700]   What does it mean to live wisely?
[00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.700]   And in the context of today,
[00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:40.340]   father is often teaching the son,
[00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.420]   like in the book of Proverbs, Ecclesiastes,
[00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.780]   Psalm of Psalms, teaching the son and the daughter
[00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.260]   how to behave, how to live a life of wisdom.
[00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.540]   So there we go.
[00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.660]   We have a huge body of literature
[00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.700]   right in the middle of the Bible,
[00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:00.700]   showing us what it means to live a life of wisdom.
[00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.600]   Will you consider yourself wise?
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.420]   How many of you would consider yourself,
[00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:08.420]   I have some wisdom?
[00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.740]   You know, how many of you?
[00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.760]   All right, you guys are very humble.
[00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.900]   You know, this is interesting
[00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.940]   about wisdom literature in the Bible.
[00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.100]   You know, wisdom literature, if you read carefully,
[00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.900]   if you think about it carefully,
[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:29.340]   it is different from all other different writings
[00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.360]   of the Bible, like the prophetical books.
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:38.740]   Some of the writings are written in such a way
[00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:42.980]   that truth comes from above.
[00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:44.940]   Thus says the Lord, right?
[00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:46.420]   The prophet said.
[00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.860]   Thus says the Lord, this is what Yahweh said.
[00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.020]   So you have to obey, right?
[00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:54.300]   Wisdom literature is a little bit different.
[00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:55.900]   Actually, in terms of direction,
[00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.860]   wisdom literature from below.
[00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:03.980]   It's all, it often gives us some sort of,
[00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:07.500]   you know, from observation to insight.
[00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:13.540]   So the wise, the wise teacher in the book of Proverbs,
[00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:19.100]   for example, he moves from observation to truth.
[00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:23.580]   He observed there's a divine order in the world.
[00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:27.820]   Of course, the universe is complex and just,
[00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:30.180]   you know, finely tuned.
[00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:31.860]   It's amazing.
[00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:36.860]   But the wise teacher moves a little bit forward
[00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:39.260]   and says not only the universe is designed
[00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.940]   and created by God, and it's amazing by itself,
[00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:47.260]   he perceives there's an order in the universe.
[00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.380]   And that order is not just a physical order,
[00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:52.300]   but a moral order, a spiritual order.
[00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:55.740]   And that spiritual order, he perceives and he observed.
[00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:00.700]   And then he got some insights and spiritual insights
[00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:05.460]   and lessons to how to live a godly life.
[00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:08.300]   That is what wisdom is all about.
[00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.580]   Wisdom in the biblical sense is practical skill,
[00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:13.340]   how to live a beautiful life,
[00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:16.820]   how to live a life, a godly life that is pleasing to God.
[00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:18.740]   That is wisdom in the Bible.
[00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:20.620]   So because you guys are all wise,
[00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:24.500]   I want to give you some questions, okay?
[00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.220]   So I'll give you a picture,
[00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:28.900]   and you tell me what kind of insight
[00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.820]   you can get out of it.
[00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:31.900]   All right, you ready?
[00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.500]   All right, let me show you this.
[00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:37.420]   So when you see something like this,
[00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:40.500]   okay, when you see something like this,
[00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:44.020]   what kind of insight can you get?
[00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:47.860]   Where you see this picture?
[00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.500]   Home Depot, right?
[00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.340]   A door hinge, right?
[00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:54.060]   A door hinge.
[00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:57.220]   What kind of practical wisdom can you get out of it, right?
[00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:58.220]   It's kind of strange, right?
[00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:00.460]   Why you show me this picture on the worship?
[00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:02.420]   And, right?
[00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:05.420]   What do you see?
[00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:08.900]   The wise teacher will come and observe something,
[00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:11.580]   and how the door hinge works,
[00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:16.580]   and he will understand the order of life,
[00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.860]   you know, spiritual lesson, so-called.
[00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:20.460]   Let me show you.
[00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:22.500]   Proverbs 26, 14.
[00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:27.260]   As the door swing back and forth on his hinges,
[00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:32.260]   so the lazy guy turns over in the bed, right?
[00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.420]   That's what he's getting at, right?
[00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:36.620]   From observation to truth, remember?
[00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:38.740]   From observation to insight.
[00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:41.700]   From observation of how the world works.
[00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.700]   And then he gets some spiritual lesson
[00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:46.940]   that is applicable to all of us.
[00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:50.940]   You gotta work hard, otherwise you will be like a hinge,
[00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:55.260]   moving left and right, and you are not moving anywhere.
[00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:56.860]   And your life will not be
[00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:00.660]   contributing to the community.
[00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:04.380]   That's what the wise is getting at, right?
[00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:07.300]   So from observation to truth, okay?
[00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:08.860]   You get what it means, right?
[00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:10.220]   You get what I mean.
[00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:12.460]   So I give you a second picture,
[00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:15.420]   and then you tell me what kind of insights
[00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:18.540]   or spiritual lessons you can get, okay?
[00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:22.100]   Now this second picture I took two weeks ago,
[00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.940]   and I was in Israel, and as you know,
[00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:29.940]   I was leading about 27 people for two weeks in Israel.
[00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:33.580]   So we were in Bethlehem, and as you know,
[00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:35.100]   we tour around the country,
[00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:38.740]   and sometimes we need to do shopping, okay?
[00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:39.580]   We need to do shopping.
[00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:41.100]   So we were in a shop,
[00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:44.820]   and it was owned by a Palestinian Christian family,
[00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:46.900]   and we spent a little bit of time in there,
[00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:51.220]   and they got some souvenirs, some olive wood,
[00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:53.500]   craft, all sorts of things.
[00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:56.580]   And don't ask me, I didn't buy anything for you.
[00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:00.140]   But they all bought something, right?
[00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:02.580]   So by the time I told the group,
[00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:04.180]   okay, we gotta go, right, we gotta go.
[00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:05.380]   The time's getting late.
[00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:07.860]   You know, we need to move on to the next stop, right?
[00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:11.800]   So everyone is exiting the shop
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.780]   and ready to get onto the bus, right?
[00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:17.080]   And then right at that moment,
[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:21.040]   a street merchant ambush us
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:25.140]   and came with some sort of, you know,
[00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:28.020]   souvenir items and trying to sell those
[00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:31.620]   to some of the people who got extra money.
[00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:36.420]   So that delayed us from getting onto the bus.
[00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:39.060]   So right there, I was trying to tell them,
[00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:42.260]   you know, we gotta go, we gotta go, you know?
[00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:43.580]   You know, we're running out of time.
[00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:45.500]   And then I took this picture.
[00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.300]   (audience laughing)
[00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:49.180]   So they were on the ground,
[00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:51.180]   they were on the ground with all this scarf
[00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:53.540]   and, you know, textile products,
[00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:57.300]   and then bookmarks, you know, fairly cheap.
[00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:00.500]   And I think the merchant, you know,
[00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.860]   got some of our weaknesses.
[00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:05.100]   You know, he's like, oh, I'm gonna sell you,
[00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:07.660]   like, you know, it was originally $10 for five,
[00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:09.740]   and then now it's $5 for five, okay?
[00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:13.980]   And then all this, you know, team members,
[00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:17.420]   as you know, they got delayed, you know?
[00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:21.020]   We actually, we are frozen in time.
[00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:24.060]   And then they are trying to get all of these things.
[00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:26.740]   It's actually very nice, it's very nice.
[00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:29.240]   It's just not, this is not me.
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:33.700]   So, this is the picture I took, okay?
[00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:35.700]   So, from observation to truth,
[00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:39.140]   what kind of insight did you get?
[00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:43.300]   Immediately, I thought of one verse in the Bible
[00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:47.140]   that talks about this picture, exactly, right?
[00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:50.860]   It's this one.
[00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:52.580]   2014 Proverbs.
[00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:54.820]   The buyer heckles over the price,
[00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:57.580]   saying it's worthless, it's worthless.
[00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:00.420]   Then, brag about getting a bargain.
[00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:03.340]   (audience laughs)
[00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:07.540]   So, the wise teacher is making some observations
[00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:09.300]   about human nature.
[00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:12.020]   He's trying to describe human nature, right?
[00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:15.460]   What is the human nature that he describes?
[00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:17.580]   He observes humanity.
[00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:21.300]   We are all beings of contradiction, right?
[00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.380]   When they were looking for the different colors
[00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:25.260]   of textile products, this is not good,
[00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.660]   this is not good, this is not good, this is not good.
[00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:31.420]   And, by the way, it's not just ladies, men too.
[00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:32.780]   Yeah, this is not good, this is not good,
[00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:34.340]   this is not worthless.
[00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:36.380]   They try to heckle the price, right?
[00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:39.900]   And after they got it, they got onto the bus,
[00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:41.860]   they say, "Oh, this is so good.
[00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:44.020]   "This is so nice."
[00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:48.660]   Now, what the Book of Proverbs is trying to get at
[00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:51.080]   is that we tend to be prival.
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.180]   We tend to be proud.
[00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:57.600]   That's our natural tendency.
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:01.760]   Our natural tendency has always not been humility.
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:06.520]   You don't have to work on yourself,
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:11.120]   you don't have to work hard in order to be a prideful person.
[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:13.920]   You are a prideful person, right?
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:18.080]   And that's why our inner self is often contradicting
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:22.160]   ourselves.
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.280]   So that is what the wise teacher is trying to do.
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:27.960]   From observation on earth, and then he gets
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:32.200]   some spiritual lesson to understand who we are
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.480]   and understand the way of wisdom.
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:38.220]   So there are two big points I wanna show you.
[00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:43.080]   First is biblical wisdom is understanding
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.920]   the order of creation.
[00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:49.280]   There is a certain order, spiritual order,
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:52.000]   moral order in this universe.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.760]   And the wise teacher, the wisdom literature,
[00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:58.520]   is trying to get at, is to observe carefully
[00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:01.520]   and then get some spiritual lessons out of it.
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:04.120]   And the second point, which is important,
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:08.280]   is that wisdom begins with obeying the voice of God.
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:11.800]   So let me show you the first point.
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:15.300]   Understanding the creational order of God.
[00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:18.360]   I'll show you this picture.
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:20.100]   What do you see here?
[00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:23.140]   Stone fallen, right?
[00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:25.860]   Stone fallen wall.
[00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:29.560]   It's very simple, right?
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:31.120]   And what do you get?
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:34.040]   Again, observation to insight, right?
[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:34.880]   2430.
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:39.520]   Here the teacher says, "I walked by the field
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:43.680]   "of a lazy person, the vineyard of one with no common sense.
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:49.640]   "I saw that it was overgrown with all sorts of nasty weeds
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.640]   "and the walls were broken down.
[00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:55.000]   "And then I look and then I reflect upon it
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.720]   "and I learn this spiritual lesson.
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:02.080]   "A little extra sleep, a little more slumber,
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:04.560]   "a little more folding of hands to rest,
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:06.640]   "then poverty will come.
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:10.000]   "It will pound on you like a bandit.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.160]   "It will come to you and attack you like an armed robber."
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.720]   So that's what he's trying to get at.
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.880]   If you slumber a little bit more,
[00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:23.240]   if you're lazy a little bit more,
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:26.920]   you should know that life always works this way.
[00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:29.440]   That is the principle of life.
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:32.280]   He passes by a lazy person's vineyard.
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:35.400]   You know how many years do you need
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.560]   to grow a mature vineyard?
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:41.080]   How many years of hard work?
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.280]   What, six years?
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:45.840]   (audience laughing)
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:49.640]   20 years would be very mature, very mature, very valuable.
[00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:53.000]   You know, you go to a wine store, you get some good wine.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.960]   Those are from a very, very old,
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:57.560]   a very, very mature-grown vineyard.
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:01.040]   But what I'm telling you is at least six years,
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.960]   24/7, 365 days a year.
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:08.280]   You have to work on the soil, you have to work on the wall,
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:10.920]   and you have to retain the soil, the good soil,
[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:14.760]   and then you have to fertilize it, you have to water it,
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:18.000]   take care of it, prune it, and grow it.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.760]   For six years of sweat and labor.
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:23.400]   And then you get a vineyard.
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:27.720]   But if the vineyard is in the lazy person's hand,
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:30.060]   the vineyard will be ruined.
[00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:33.120]   You'll find weeds.
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:36.480]   You'll find your vineyard being destroyed.
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:38.360]   Just naturally being destroyed.
[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:41.120]   Doesn't mean there's enemies trying to attack it,
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:43.760]   trying to break down the walls.
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.160]   It's just naturally.
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:48.280]   Stone will always fall down.
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:51.400]   Stone from the stone wall will always fall down
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:53.520]   and the wall will be broken,
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:56.840]   and you lose all the soil and all your produce.
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:58.760]   So the wise teacher is a spiritual teacher.
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:01.480]   He's not a natural scientist.
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:05.840]   He observes how the world works and he learn a lesson.
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:10.320]   If you're a little bit lazy in your spiritual life,
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.440]   in your relationship with God,
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:16.600]   if you stop working, there's always forces of chaos
[00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:20.800]   that will destroy you.
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:22.960]   That is the natural order of things.
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:26.800]   And the order will naturally give way to chaos.
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:31.760]   The wise teacher is saying, in your life,
[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:35.920]   the world has always been this way, order to chaos.
[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:39.200]   Always order to chaos.
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:42.600]   Unless you work hard and you work against
[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:47.800]   the forces of darkness, forces of chaos.
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:51.240]   You put the fallen stone back on the wall.
[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:54.080]   You input, you work and you labor.
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:59.100]   You sweat, repair and maintain your life.
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:05.400]   Otherwise you will not enjoy the fruit of your labor.
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:09.560]   Spiritual life, or life in general, does not come easy.
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:14.280]   That's what wisdom is trying to say to you.
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:18.440]   There's always an insistence of emphasis of diligence.
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:23.680]   You know, wisdom does not come easily.
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:25.520]   It can only be earned.
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:29.520]   It can only be earned by your hard work.
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:33.680]   Spiritual maturity, character formation.
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:36.200]   You want to be like Christ.
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:40.360]   You want to be making advances in your spiritual journey.
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:43.600]   It doesn't come naturally.
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.600]   What comes naturally is ruin, chaos.
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:50.560]   If you fold your hands, fold your arms,
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:53.720]   naturally you will be destroyed.
[00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.520]   And the wise person is saying,
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:59.680]   you need to put sweats and tears into your spiritual life.
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:03.680]   Think about it.
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:06.760]   I've been a Christian for a long time.
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:10.920]   Whenever I got lazy, I don't do anything about it.
[00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:17.360]   I don't work against my own weaknesses, my own old self.
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:22.880]   All sorts of sinful nature will come out.
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:24.640]   You have to guard your heart.
[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:26.360]   In fact, the Old Testament and New Testament,
[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:30.040]   the entire Bible often advises and command us
[00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:32.280]   to guard our heart.
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:34.960]   And guarding is a military term.
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:37.600]   It's a military term.
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:40.840]   You stand on a tower to guard against the enemies.
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:43.480]   They will come any time to destroy you
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:45.840]   and your life will be ruined.
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:48.080]   And you have to guard your own life.
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:49.920]   And how do you do that?
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:52.120]   That is wisdom calling.
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.920]   Calling you to form your character,
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:57.400]   to mold yourself so that you are on the right track
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.040]   in your spiritual relationship with God.
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:03.440]   So wisdom is understanding the creational order
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:07.600]   and then you learn some spiritual insight out of it.
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:11.680]   For those of you who have the blessing
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:15.840]   to be born and to grow up in a Christian environment,
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:21.080]   I want to tell you, you cannot take it for granted
[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:24.480]   because the forces of darkness will destroy you.
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:28.640]   It will ruin you unless you work really, really hard.
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:32.880]   That is Proverbs 24.
[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:38.240]   So second point is, wisdom is listening and obeying God.
[00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:41.920]   Now don't get me wrong.
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:46.520]   Wisdom literature is not about self-help, self-improvement.
[00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:50.960]   It's about drawing us closer to God himself.
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:52.380]   So Proverbs 19.27.
[00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:59.080]   It says, "If you stop listening to discipline, my child,
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:01.560]   "you will stray from the words of wisdom,
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:03.600]   "words of knowledge."
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:06.440]   Words of discipline, think about it.
[00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:08.280]   The Hebrew word means,
[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:13.680]   actually it can mean chains, you know, boundaries.
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:18.800]   Something you can think of,
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:21.720]   but it's not some comforting words.
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:24.540]   Words of discipline.
[00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:30.360]   It's gonna be tough to listen to,
[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:32.640]   but you have to listen to it.
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:34.160]   You have to be obedient.
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:37.360]   You have to be open to discipline.
[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:41.520]   Strayed, it means unable to walk in a straight line.
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:46.280]   Have you ever got drunk?
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:49.280]   Yeah, you did, right?
[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:52.760]   You had before, right?
[00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:56.040]   You got drunk and you cannot walk in a straight line.
[00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:59.880]   You just wander, wander, you waste your time and energy,
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:02.080]   and then you probably will fall, right?
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:04.600]   Fall and stumble, right?
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:08.080]   Strayed is unable to walk straight.
[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:11.920]   It's actually describing people who got drunk.
[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:14.320]   But what it says is,
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:18.320]   if you stop listening to words of wisdom,
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:20.740]   even tough words, discipline,
[00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:25.200]   then your life will be in ruin.
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:28.080]   Now, we often misunderstand spiritual growth
[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:30.560]   in some sort of rosy picture.
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:31.400]   We always think, okay,
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:33.120]   how do you grow your relationship with God?
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.560]   Okay, how do you grow?
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:36.760]   Well, we're talking about going to a retreat, right?
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:38.840]   To St. Louis, going to a retreat,
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:40.960]   you know, going somewhere else.
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.720]   And probably there will be times
[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:48.200]   we will do some, you know, devotion, right?
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.200]   Quiet times.
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:51.920]   When you think of quiet times, spiritual reflection,
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:54.600]   what kind of picture you have in mind?
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:58.200]   You probably have this kind of picture in mind, right?
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:02.000]   Ah, so nice, you know, go to a lakeside
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.640]   and you just sit there and open up your Bible
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:08.360]   and, you know, you turn to some of the passages
[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:11.940]   that may be your favorite passages, right?
[00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:16.800]   You don't want to turn to any passages
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:19.120]   that will yell at you, right?
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:20.640]   That will discipline you.
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:22.040]   You don't turn to that, right?
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:24.160]   Because, you know, we're in the retreat, right?
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:25.880]   We want to feel nice.
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:27.840]   So, oftentimes we think of spiritual growth
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:31.960]   or spiritual relationship with God in this sort of picture.
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:36.160]   I want to tell you today, this is a wrong picture.
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:37.960]   You raise it.
[00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:39.720]   It doesn't happen that way.
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:44.160]   Spiritual growth, your spiritual life, your character,
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:46.240]   it doesn't grow this way.
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:48.520]   This is a lie.
[00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:52.000]   It doesn't work that way.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.760]   Now, think of spiritual growth not in this sort of picture.
[00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:00.240]   Think of spiritual growth in this picture.
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:03.120]   This is spiritual growth.
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:05.240]   This is character formation.
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:07.640]   This is spiritual formation.
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:11.120]   I remember years ago, I was in a region college in Vancouver
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:12.440]   and I was taking MDiv, right?
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:14.560]   I was preparing myself for ministry.
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:18.640]   And I have so many classmates, other seminarians,
[00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:25.080]   they were taking the program of a spiritual theology, yeah.
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:28.400]   Spiritual theology or spiritual formation.
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:33.800]   I never heard of any one of those
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:36.240]   would talk about spiritual growth this way.
[00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:38.080]   I never.
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:41.040]   To sweat?
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:42.960]   I mean, to labor?
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:46.640]   I mean, to work hard, right?
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:47.560]   Difficult?
[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:50.320]   Being tough?
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:53.000]   I never heard of that.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.400]   You know, I came out and I really have a big question.
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:59.240]   You know, how do you grow yourself?
[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:02.120]   How do you grow in your character, in your spiritual life?
[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:04.640]   They always think this way.
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.080]   Oh my God.
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:07.640]   Oh my God, I need to grow.
[00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:11.320]   Okay, I need to go away and to reflect, right?
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:13.960]   On the calm, you know, weather.
[00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:18.120]   It doesn't work that way, guys.
[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:20.840]   I'm not saying there's no room for your spiritual growth
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:25.840]   to have some quiet times and spiritual reflection.
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:27.960]   We all do, right?
[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:30.880]   Put out 15 minutes a day, 10 minutes a day.
[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:33.840]   It's necessary.
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:36.120]   But most of the time, it's like this.
[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:42.000]   The Bible is very clear to all of us, you know?
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.560]   And the spiritual teacher is showing us
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:47.760]   that character growth, spiritual formation,
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:50.240]   requires hard work.
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:52.360]   There's no shortcut.
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:56.400]   If you forget about it, if you fold your arms,
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:59.480]   your life will be in ruin.
[00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:03.520]   And your relationship with God will go down the pit.
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:08.240]   Spiritual growth requires sweat and tears
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:10.040]   by a hardworking farmer.
[00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:16.640]   Proverbs 1:7, it says, "Fear of the Lord
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:19.200]   "is the foundation of true wisdom,
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:25.080]   "but fools despise knowledge and discipline."
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:28.760]   My child, my child, listen.
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:30.240]   When your father corrects you,
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:34.840]   what you learn from them, from wisdom,
[00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:39.080]   will crown you with grace, and you will have honor.
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:43.760]   Now, how do you earn a life of wisdom and life of honor?
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:46.440]   You've got to listen.
[00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:48.560]   And listening is hard work.
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:52.120]   You've got to work against your own natural tendency, right?
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:54.760]   When someone says some words of discipline,
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:59.440]   correction to me, you know, I don't have to work on it.
[00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:03.000]   I will naturally resist, right?
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.200]   I will naturally resist.
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:07.760]   But you've got to work against that tendency,
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:12.120]   that sinful tendency, in order to get that honor,
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:15.560]   to grow your life and grow closer to God.
[00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:20.120]   So to all the fathers today, or soon to be father,
[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:22.320]   I want to challenge you and want to remind you
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:25.760]   to grow in the way of wisdom.
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:27.880]   And that's going to be hard work.
[00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:30.000]   There's so much work in there, right?
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.120]   And work hard to build a godly character.
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:36.600]   Because as father, I think fatherhood
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:39.120]   is the embodiment of spiritual wisdom.
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:45.080]   And there's no excuse.
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:46.760]   There's no excuse for us to say,
[00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:50.120]   oh, no, I'm not a good Christian, that's okay.
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:52.680]   You know, that sort of excuse will only lead to
[00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:54.600]   ruin and chaos and disorder.
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:29:00.520]   Do your best and run in the way of wisdom.
[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:04.600]   Even though it will require you to work hard.
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:08.600]   And to all of you, to each and every one of you,
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:12.680]   I want to remind and challenge you to grow spiritually.
[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:15.600]   And what I meant is not that rosy picture.
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:19.680]   No, no, no, no, no, no, erase that.
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:22.520]   This one, I want to remind you,
[00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:26.560]   we need to work hard to build godly character.
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:30.880]   To build a community of God, to build a church.
[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:31.920]   This is the picture.
[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:34.920]   And that is the picture of honor.
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:37.520]   And that is the future of honor.
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:42.360]   So let's work on it and walk in the way of wisdom.
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:45.240]   Let's pray and recommit ourselves
[00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:48.560]   before the God of wisdom.
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:53.680]   It is his pleasing will, his pleasing desire
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:56.840]   for you and for me to grow in wisdom.
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:59.760]   Let's all pray.
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:01.600]   And I'll ask the team to come back up.
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:07.560]   Father, we come before you and humble ourselves.
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:10.960]   And may your spirit humble our hearts,
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:15.480]   knowing that we are sinful
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:18.040]   and we resist the word of wisdom.
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:21.640]   And I pray and I beg for your grace.
[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:25.400]   I pray that you will change us and mold us
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:26.800]   so that we'll be teachable.
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:32.720]   Our spirit will be obeying to the voice of you.
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:38.160]   Speak the word of wisdom in our lives
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:42.240]   and grow us and mold us in the way of wisdom
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:45.680]   so that we can grow closer and closer to you.
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:51.200]   Perhaps we need to get back to reading your word
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:54.640]   and just work hard on understanding your word.
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:57.400]   Help us, Father.
[00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:02.600]   Perhaps we need to get on our knees to pray,
[00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:08.520]   to pray that we will grow in holiness,
[00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:12.880]   grow in godliness, and to humble ourselves before you
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:16.920]   and acknowledge that you are our God.
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:19.680]   (soft piano music)
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:22.560]   So I pray that you will continue to help us to grow,
[00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:24.640]   even though it will take hard work.
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:26.920]   We will not be lazy.
[00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:30.040]   We will cling to your mercy
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:34.440]   and to grow spiritually and wisely
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:37.160]   so that your name will be honored in our lives.
[00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:38.120]   In Christ, we pray.
