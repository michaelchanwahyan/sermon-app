[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   I am going to teach you how to use Premiere Pro.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   If you already know the basics, please skip to Part 2.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   This is Part 1 for those who have not used it yet.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   First, you open the program and click New Project.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   I usually don't change all the settings.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   What you need to change is to make sure your location.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   Make sure you open a new folder.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   Make sure you set up everything.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   Give it a title.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   This time I am using Premiere Pro Video Editing Part 1.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   After opening it, you will see what it is.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   You don't have to worry about a lot of things.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   You can adjust everything.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   Basically, these four boxes can be moved freely.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   You can move a lot of things.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   For example, if you press the tool box, you can drag it to another place.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Yes, you can drag it up.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   But everyone has their own preference.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   So don't move things around.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   For example, go to Tools.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   You can drag it down and put it in your preferred position.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   The most important thing is to import your files, audio, video, and pictures.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   So you will see the "Import Media to Start" at the bottom left of my screen.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   You can right-click here and you will see "Import".
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   But if you don't have this, you may not see it when you first do it.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Go to the file above and find "Import".
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   It will be the same.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   First, you can choose a video or a picture.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   But sometimes, if there are some files that are not clear in the name, you may not remember what it is.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   There is a way to see it.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Just highlight the name and double-click the icon.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   You will see it pop up in a corner.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   That window is your preview window.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   My setting is in the upper left corner.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   You can see the video by clicking the "Play" button.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   It's a preview, right?
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   If you are a picture, you can see it.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   But you can't play it.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   You can see the timeline is moving, but it won't move the other days.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   It's a picture.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   As for the audio, you can play it.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   There is no topic, but there is sound.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   That's it.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   How to start making videos?
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   You can see the timeline in the bottom.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   It's like your workspace.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   For example, I want to put a video in the timeline.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   There are two ways.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   First, you can drag it directly.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   You hold and drag it.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Or you can click the "Left" button on the cursor on the screen.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   You can drag it to the timeline.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   That's it.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   You can start your timeline.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   You can see the video is about 10 to 15 seconds.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   The video can be extended or shortened by clicking the "Short" button.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   You can see the video is getting shorter and shorter.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   You are looking at the video getting longer and longer.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   You can see the video is 1 minute and 30 seconds.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   This is the function of zoom in and zoom out.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   The above function is called V123.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   You can play more than one video.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   You can adjust the height.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   You can also add audio.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   If you have a lot of audio or videos,
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   you can right-click on the space next to the eye and click "Add Track".
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   If you want to add more tracks, you can click "Delete Track".
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   It will ask you if you want to delete the track.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   You can highlight and uncheck the tracks.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   I will tell you the difference later.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   You can mute the audio tracks.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   For example, I want to add a picture.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   You can click "Add" and click "Picture".
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   When you play the video, the picture will be changed.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   I will add one or two more videos to show you the difference.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   I will keep clicking "Video", "Picture", "Video", "Picture".
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   I will add Tony's audio.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   You can see that I can't add audio because there is a "Video" button.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   I will add the audio.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   If you make a video, you will see that Tony's audio is very long.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   I will add a lot of audio to fill up the space.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   I will make the audio short this time.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   You can see that the audio is not long.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   We need to adjust the time.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   I have a music player, so I will play the music.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   This is the final product.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   I only have a few pictures.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   I want to make the audio longer.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   What can I do?
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   First, the picture is long and short.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   When you highlight the picture, the cursor will be on both ends.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   When the cursor is on the end of the picture, the red bracket will be changed.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   This is to shorten the picture.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   The picture will not move, so it will stay in the same position.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   You can drag the picture as long as you want, but it will not move.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   If I want to undo, I will press "Ctrl + Z".
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   I will play the music.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   I want to make the audio longer, so I will play the music.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   The video can be long or short.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   I will adjust the duration.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   Now the duration is 100%.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   I will adjust the duration to 50%.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   Why is the duration not changed?
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   Actually, the duration is not changed.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   I can play the music longer.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   The video was long, but now it is longer.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   When I play the music, the video will be slower.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   Can you see it?
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   The video is much slower.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   I will shorten the video.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   The video is longer, but the video is shorter.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   If the video is shorter, the duration is 150%.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   Now the video is only 16 seconds.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   The video is shorter.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   The video will be faster when I play the music.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   This is how you play with video.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   What else can be changed?
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   For example, I need this picture to be 10 seconds long.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   But I am bored.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   There is a trick.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   Go to the "At the beginning" of the timeline.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   Go to the "Back 1 frame" of the timeline.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   This is a very useful trick.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   This is still a video of a girl.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   This is the picture.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   How can I adjust the duration of this picture?
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   How can I make this picture not boring?
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   There is a way.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   Zoom in and zoom out.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   First, highlight the picture.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   Then, click on the "Preview" box.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Then, click on "Effect Controls".
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   Then, click on "Highlight Picture".
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   This is a little complicated.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   The program reads each frame.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   At the beginning of the frame, the frame rate is 100%.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   The position is 960x540.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   There is a stopwatch.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   First, click on the stopwatch.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   Then, you will see two points.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   What is strange?
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   I will zoom in a little.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   You will see three small points.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   At this time, the program will know the frame rate is 100%.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   I want to make it 200% now.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   You can see the frame rate is bigger.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   I want to zoom in the picture.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   But I want to zoom out after 5 seconds.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   So, you have to click on the "Add Keyframe" button.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   You have to add a command here.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   Click on this frame.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   You can see two points.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   The computer knows what to do at this moment.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   You can choose the frame rate you want to change.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   Click on the stopwatch.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   At this time, the frame rate is 200%.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   But I want to change it to 100% at this time.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   What should I do?
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   I will zoom out now.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   But you don't have to do every frame in between.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   You just need to tell the program that you want to change the frame rate to 100% at this time.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   Then the program will play out the zoom function smoothly.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   I will play it for you.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   Don't just look at the bottom.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   You have to look at the top.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   I will show you again.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   It is zooming out.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   Now your video is not so boring.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   Because you have something moving.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   Although you are playing the picture.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   Zoom in and zoom out.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   Just move the scale is one of the ways.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   But do you remember that I asked you to put the stopwatch in the position?
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   In addition to the scale, you can also play with the position.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   Okay, let's go back here.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   This is the final product.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   I want them to be like this.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   But at the beginning, I want the woman to be a little higher.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   What should I do?
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   960 is like a vertical axis.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   Horizontal and vertical.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   When you put the cursor on the 960, you will see two arrows.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   You can hold it and move it left and right.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   You will see that the picture is actually moving.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   For example, I want to focus on a black man.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   Or maybe these two black people.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   At this time, focus on these two black people.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   But when I go outside, I want it to go back to the middle.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   I just need to move one time frame.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   Now when you play, there are different effects.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   You can play with this setting in many places.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   But remember the original position.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   When we put the picture in the middle, the settings of Premiere Pro are usually 986 and 540.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   540 is the top and bottom.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   If you don't remember, press 540.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   The number in the middle is 960 and 540.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   You can see that the screen is a little slow.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   I set it to full resolution.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   If you see the screen is moving, I usually set it to 1/4.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   Then the screen will be smoother.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   If you notice, I added a little more.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   Because I adjusted the settings.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   If you don't want to do anything, you can add more.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   You can highlight it individually.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   After highlighting, press delete to delete.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   Of course, you can press Ctrl + Z to undo.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   You can play with the picture to make it more vivid.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   Zoom in and zoom out.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   Zoom in and zoom out from the left and right.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   You can also adjust the time.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   You can also zoom in and zoom out.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   You can also do this function.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   For example, you can zoom in on this woman at the beginning.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   Then slowly zoom out.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   You can also see the background on the side.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   You can see that the transition between each video is quite boring.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   Because when you play, it suddenly changes to another one.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   How to make a more interesting transition in the middle?
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   This is called dissolve.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   It is not called transition in this program.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   How can I do this?
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   You can go back to the import box.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   You can see the top of each box.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   If there is a double arrow, you can press it.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   Then look at the effects.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   It's not effects control.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   It's effects control.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   Then it tells you that there are many presets, audio transitions.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   You can slowly cut it.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   But if you know your function, you can type it directly.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   These transitions are called dissolve.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   You haven't finished playing, but it's usually out.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   It's out.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   There are many different dissolves.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   It's actually a transition.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   For example, cross dissolve.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   Highlight it and drag it down.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   Just put it at the end of the box.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   I want to show you something.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   I just went to the effects.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   Where did I go?
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   You just have to press the project button.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   You will be back.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   I found something.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   If you have two pictures.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   I have two pictures on the side.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   Put a transition in the middle of the two pictures.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   Go back to the effects.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   When you put cross dissolve here,
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   You can see that I can put the dissolve in the middle of the two pictures.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   You can see that the two pictures are highlighted.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   You can put it on the left.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   On the right.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   But it's also in the middle.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   This is the dissolve function.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   Put it in the middle of the two pictures.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   When it transitions, it's called cross dissolve.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   You can see it slowly.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   Cross because both will appear at the same time.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   Then dissolve to another.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   A very smooth transition.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   If you like this style.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   If you don't like it, you can change to another.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   For example, if I don't want it, I can highlight it and press delete.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   I can dip it to black.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   You can see that the glow will be black and come out.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   Or dip to white.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   There are many different dissolve methods.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   There is a method called film dissolve.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   I think it's the same as cross dissolve.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   What I want to say is that no matter what you are,
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   This dissolve transition can be very long and short.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   First highlight it.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   Then you will see that when the control box is opened,
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   You will see that something pops out.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   I usually don't need to use the top one.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   I just need to do it here.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   Because after highlighting, you can see that the cursor is in the film dissolve box.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   There will be a red bracket.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   Press it to lengthen it.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   Just do it like this.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   You can go to the preview box.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   When you mouse over, you will see many different buttons.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   First, you can press the lengthen button.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   You can see that it is only lengthened one side.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   It is different from the previous one.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   Both sides are lengthened evenly.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   If you see this symbol,
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   You can move the box forward and backward.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   There are different effects.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   Because when you move it forward,
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   The left hand picture will disappear very quickly.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   The right hand picture will come out very quickly.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   There are different effects.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   I usually don't press the transition.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   I usually put the mouse in the middle and press the left hand button.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   It will be fine.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   If you have the same nature,
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   It is easy to do the same thing.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   But if you want to do the same thing,
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   Between a video,
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   This is a video.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   This is a picture.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   I found that sometimes the cursor can't drop exactly in the middle.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   You see, I can't drop the cursor in the middle.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   What should I do?
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   I can highlight the cursor.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   Remember that we have this function.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   Go to the effects control.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   There is this function.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   I can do it here.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   I put the cursor in the middle.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   I want the dissolve transition to be longer.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   I can drag it back.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   Sometimes you will find that the cursor can't be placed in the middle.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   You can try to move it to the effects control.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   You can play around with it.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   This is one of the transition methods.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   How to dissolve, how to transition.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   You can cross dissolve, dip to black, dip to white.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   These are very basic.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   You can find it here.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   It is what we need to do for now.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   If you think it is clean cut,
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   It will be better if you jump to another place.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   You don't need to put anything between the clips.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   After talking about video, let's talk about audio.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   I have muted two audio clips.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   Let's listen to the audio.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   Let's listen to it.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   The background music is very good.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   But when Tony talks,
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   I can't hear him at all.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   What should I do?
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   I want to keep the background sound.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   The level is really good.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   What should I do?
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   You can do one thing.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   Highlight the background.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   How to adjust the volume?
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   If you want to lower the volume of the audio at the same time,
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   There are two ways.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   First, highlight it.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   Right click, go to audio gain.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   You can see that it only changes the volume.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   You can increase the volume.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   Press positive number,
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   Press 5, press 10.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   You can see that the volume is reduced.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   You can increase the volume.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   Press 5, press 10.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   You can see that the volume is reduced.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   You can increase the volume.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   If you want to decrease the volume,
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   you can press negative.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   For example, I think it's better to increase the volume.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   You can decrease the volume.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   You can see that the volume is reduced.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   You can see that the volume is reduced.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   Let's listen to it again.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   It seems better.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   But Tony's voice is still very low.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   So I will increase the volume.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   I will increase the volume.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   Press 5.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   Let's listen to it again.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   It's better.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   Maybe...
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   When Tony speaks,
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   the background should be quieter.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   But the beginning of the background is very good.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   I don't want to increase the volume.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   I don't want to reduce the volume.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   What should I do?
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   Can I just increase the volume?
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   Yes, you can.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   But if you increase the volume,
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   the sound will be too loud.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   You should reduce the volume.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   There are two ways.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   First,
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   you can turn the audio
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   into two audio.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   You can turn the audio into two audio.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   You can keep the same sound in the beginning.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   You can reduce the volume in the end.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   But the sound will not be as beautiful.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   Because the sound will be very awkward.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   The sound will be very awkward.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   How can you slow down the sound?
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   How can you slow down the sound?
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   First,
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   put the timeline cursor
