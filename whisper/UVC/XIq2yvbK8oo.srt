1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 to bring the word to us.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 Does love have an open door?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 Welcome stranger

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 Give us your tired and poor

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 All those in need

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 Come every weary soul

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 Find your haven, liberty is

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 For all who can breathe free

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 Oh what a beautiful world, what a beautiful world

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 Oh what a beautiful world, what a beautiful world

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Welcome to America!

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Does love have an open door?

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Welcome stranger

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 Does love have an open door?

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 All those in need

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 Oh what a beautiful world

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 We're here!

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 Oh what a beautiful world

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 Oh what a beautiful world, what a beautiful world

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 Welcome stranger

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 Welcome stranger

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 Welcome stranger

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 Well it's great to be with you here today.

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 I feel like it's been a while though

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 when I realized pulling into the parking lot that

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 there was another church that had parking and there were signs about where I could park and couldn't park

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 and you know even being in this time post-pandemic and yet new waves of the pandemic

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 ministry has just changed tremendously during this time.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 The video that you saw really represents what my work is these days with World Relief.

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 World Relief is a local global organization so we are based here in Chicagoland

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 but we have offices in 16 locations around the United States.

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 I'm off to the Sacramento office to speak here coming up.

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 Mark I know has some root there.

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 And then we have 20 offices around the globe

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 so we're involved in quite a few settings.

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 But the subject matter that I'm speaking to you today about is really something that is dear to my heart

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 not just something that I do for my job.

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 And yet I also respect the fact that we're in a pulpit here

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 that this is a place where God's word is conveyed.

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 So you don't want to, I don't want you to hear me doing an infomercial.

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 I really want you to hear the scriptures today as we speak together.

42
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 And yet I think it will weave well with the conversations that we have around

43
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 what's happening in our world and the mass displacement of people.

44
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 You may have heard this famous quote before.

45
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 I'm wondering if it's one you're familiar with.

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 The quote is, "Each of them is Jesus in disguise."

47
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 Each of them is Jesus in disguise.

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 This was Mother Teresa's explanation of her ministry serving the poorest of the poor

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 in Calcutta, India.

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 This is what she said of the vulnerable people that she encountered

51
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 amidst her own struggles and doubts about her faith.

52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 Her life's work, no matter how poor or destitute those she worked with were,

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 was to see them as they truly are, as blessed children bearing God's image

54
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 no matter where they've come from or who they are.

55
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 Brandon Heath, a contemporary Christian artist known for at least two hits,

56
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 "Give Me Your Eyes" and "The Light in Me,"

57
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 was moved by Mother Teresa's words to write a song in 2008 called "Jesus in Disguise."

58
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 Yet today, when I hear the words "disguise" and "vulnerable people,"

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 it's not about ministry these days.

60
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 It's about fear.

61
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 Fear of people who have been displaced.

62
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 They are labeled as a haven for terrorists who are intent on harming us

63
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 but disguising themselves to sneak into our country.

64
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 In light of 9/11 this weekend, I can certainly see our reasons for caution here.

65
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 But a couple things I think that we should know,

66
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 and that is that it's not likely that our country would have that happen through those we serve.

67
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 Our country's track record on refugee resettlement is a strong and stable work.

68
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 Three million people have actually been brought into this country over the past 30, 40 years now,

69
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 since 1980 with the Refugee Act, and not one citizen has died at the hands of a refugee.

70
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 So that vetting process has been pretty thorough and extensive through the years.

71
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 Inciting fear of certain people in blanket ways to cast blame on them is bigotry and racism,

72
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 and it should not be tolerated and should not happen, especially among those of us that are Christians.

73
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 Our country and its leaders have not always gotten that right either, and for that I do apologize.

74
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 This is not an easy topic, though, I want to say to you to discuss,

75
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 so I pray that you hear what I say in the right spirit.

76
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 Just as it is the government's responsibility to properly vet people that are entering this country,

77
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 it is the Christian's responsibility to welcome the stranger.

78
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 If we expect the government to do their job, then we should do ours.

79
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 Most of us who identify as Christians have never really thought about migration or forced migration in particular,

80
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 but it's in the Bible. From its beginning, in the book of Genesis,

81
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 we find a man and a woman violating the laws of the land and placed in removal from the Garden of Eden,

82
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 which is forced displacement. At the end of the Bible, we find John writing the book of Revelation in Patmos,

83
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 where he is exiled as an expatriate for his beliefs.

84
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 The Bible is full of story after story of forcibly displaced people.

85
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 Joseph was forcibly displaced as a victim of human trafficking.

86
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 Moses was forcibly displaced for taking justice in his own hands.

87
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 Moses certainly carried that out. David was forcibly displaced as a political refugee on the run from King Saul for 12 years of his life.

88
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 And Jesus was forcibly displaced to Egypt with his family soon after his birth to find safety from profiling and ethnic cleansing as a refugee.

89
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 And the first missionary in the Bible, if we think of it this way, Philip ran from Samaria or ran to Samaria

90
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 because of religious persecution that had broken out in the city of Jerusalem.

91
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 Priscilla and Aquila, who were Paul's business partners and ministry partners together,

92
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 were forcibly displaced to leave Rome and go to Corinth because of their beliefs.

93
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 That's how Paul met them, is because Caesar had thrown out all of the Jews from Rome.

94
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 Forced displacement is in the Bible, but very few Christians have recognized it or understood what it means for us and how we treat them.

95
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 World Relief for Us has a 40-day Bible reading and prayer challenge just to help churches understand more of our responsibilities in this area

96
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 before God regarding the strangers that are in our midst.

97
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 Most Christians just have not had their eyes open to this reality.

98
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 I think one of the main reasons that we see that this day and these attitudes is because of a lack of biblical education around this area.

99
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 But the other thing that I see that we're living in today is a time of great media influence.

100
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 And media is extremely powerful in these days.

101
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 Polling data really tells us today that Christians are more influenced by media and by politics than they are by the Bible and by their faith

102
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 when it comes particularly to this issue.

103
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 I can tell you though story after story of lives that have been changed by welcoming our newer neighbors.

104
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 The Bible is clear. There is no question with the new society that Jesus brought in that we are to welcome strangers.

105
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 Matthew 25 is probably one of those signature texts, one of those greatest texts to point this out to us.

106
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 I believe the church needs to really wake up to this reality and our responsibility before God to do what we can to help.

107
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 So this morning I'd like us to look more closely at Jesus' words in Matthew chapter 25.

108
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 We're going to be looking at the end of that chapter beginning in verse 31 when God brings true justice to all of the world.

109
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 I'd like to read to you the words of Jesus beginning in verse 31 of Matthew 25.

110
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 It says there, "But when the Son of Man comes in His glory and all the angels with Him, then He will sit on His glorious throne

111
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 and all the nations will be gathered in His presence.

112
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 And He will separate the people as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.

113
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 And He will place the sheep on His right hand and He will place the goats on His left.

114
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 And then the King will say to those who are on His right, 'Come, you who are blessed by the Father,

115
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the creation of the world.

116
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 For I was hungry and you fed me. I was thirsty and you gave me drink.

117
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 I was a stranger and you invited me into your home. I was naked and you gave me clothing.

118
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 I was sick and you cared for me. I was in prison and you visited me.'

119
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 Then these righteous ones will reply, 'Lord, when did we ever see you hungry and feed you,

120
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 or thirsty and give you something to drink, or even a stranger and show you hospitality,

121
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 or naked and give you clothing? When did we ever see you sick in prison and visit you?'

122
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 And the King will say, 'I tell you the truth, when you did it for one of the least of these, my brothers and sisters,

123
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 you were doing it to me.'

124
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 Then the King will turn to those that are on His left and He'll say, 'Away with you, you cursed ones,

125
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and the demons.

126
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 For I was hungry and you didn't feed me. I was thirsty and you didn't give me a drink.

127
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 I was a stranger and you didn't invite me into your home.

128
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 I was naked and you didn't even give me clothing.

129
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 I was sick and in prison and you didn't visit me there.'

130
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 Then they will reply, 'Lord, when did we ever see you sick or thirsty or hungry or stranger or naked and not help you?'

131
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 And He will answer, 'I tell you the truth, when you refused to help the least of these, my brothers and sisters,

132
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 you were refusing to help me.'

133
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 And they will go away into internal punishment, but the righteous will go into eternal life."

134
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 So let me just break this apart a bit for us to think about what the teaching here that Jesus is giving.

135
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 Really the immediate setting that we see here is the passage is the throne room of God for the entire world.

136
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 It's the place where all of ruling of society will happen and that throne room is God's throne room.

137
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 There's a broader setting though here in this particular text and the broader setting is the end of time.

138
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 All things have been finished and time has come to an end.

139
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 But there's a greater challenge even being extended just beyond this section of Scripture in this whole chapter.

140
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 Because we have here the parable of the ten virgins, we have the parable of the three servants, all in this chapter.

141
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 And the broader challenge is that we need to be well prepared and using what we've been given wisely.

142
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 The characters introduced to us here, other than Jesus, are the angels who were with Him

143
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 and all the nations that have been gathered together in Jesus' presence.

144
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 Imagine that experience.

145
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 All of the nations gathered, I can't even fathom what it would be like to see all of the nations gathered together before Jesus.

146
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 And He is center stage in this.

147
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 He's center stage in the scene that we're hearing here in all of His glory preparing for the final judgment.

148
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 The opening scene and the only scene in this picture is Jesus sorting things out.

149
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 In particular, Jesus as the chief shepherd is separating the sheep from the goats, the blessed from the cursed,

150
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 those who will go into eternal punishment and those who will go into eternal life.

151
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 What's at risk?

152
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 Well, both futures and a vast inheritance that's been prepared before creation began.

153
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 But note this, very interesting.

154
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 An inheritance is not something that is earned, is it?

155
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 But it's something that's given.

156
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 So Jesus is sharing His Father's inheritance by His choice,

157
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 not as some earned income for what these people have done to deserve that inheritance that He's given them.

158
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 Yet the fundamental character of those who receive this inheritance and those who won't

159
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 are those who are blessed and those who are cursed, their character couldn't be more different.

160
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 The difference seems to center on those who are willing to help and those who are not.

161
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 Ones whose hearts are tender toward those who are vulnerable around them

162
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 and those whose hearts have become calloused, whose love has grown cold toward those hurting around them.

163
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 Today, we might call it compassion fatigue.

164
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 With all the suffering we see and are exposed to in our globally collected community,

165
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 it certainly requires of us great discernment, supernatural power,

166
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 and even seeing God as our source to respond appropriately to all of these situations that we see,

167
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 asking God to help us so that we might help others.

168
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 In what ways are we supposed to help?

169
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 Well, we might think about the grand things that we should be doing,

170
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 but really this passage of scripture is super practical.

171
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 Pretty much it means just meet basic needs, nothing very extravagant.

172
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 Give someone some food or give them some drink if they're hungry and thirsty.

173
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 If someone's a stranger, find a way to make them feel welcome.

174
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 If they don't have clothing, give them some clothes to wear.

175
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 If they're sick, care for them.

176
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 If they're in prison, go to see them.

177
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 These all sound like really simple actions, but they are essential for life.

178
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 But why should we do this?

179
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 Why should we be engaged in this kind of good behavior that we think is here?

180
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 And it's so interesting how Jesus really challenges us to think about it.

181
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 He says we should do this because he identifies so closely with these vulnerable people

182
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 that the very act of helping them is helping him.

183
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 What are the consequences?

184
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 Well, the consequences are pretty stark here.

185
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 The cursed are sent away empty-handed into eternal punishment,

186
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 and the blessed are invited to come to receive the inheritance of eternal life.

187
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 Pretty stark differences there.

188
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 So let me ask this really as we close here.

189
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 I want us to think about making sure that what I'm sharing with you is on good theological footing.

190
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 So I want to really draw my conclusions from Baker's Evangelical Dictionary of Biblical Theology.

191
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 It sounds a pretty credible source for finding this kind of conclusion.

192
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 And it's specifically the words of a Chicago theologian whose name is Scott McKnight.

193
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 And he says this about these Bible verses that we're looking at here today.

194
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 "Jesus demanded that his followers obey him,

195
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 and that those who were obedient to his will would be called the righteous.

196
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 It's also the case that he called his followers to live a life of love,

197
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 love for God and love for others.

198
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 As Jesus compared--showed his compassion for others by healing them and helping them,

199
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 so Jesus called on us to do the very same thing.

200
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 As Jesus was willing to reach out to help people of all nations,

201
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 so the disciples are charged to make their love transnational in nature.

202
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 Thus the foundation of the tension of the church that it had with Israel

203
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 over the symbolic value of the nation of Israel

204
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 may have really rooted Jesus' teaching to love and minister to all nations,

205
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 not just to Israel.

206
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 This universal love would be a fundamental factor we see here in the final judgment of God."

207
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 So what's he saying there?

208
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 He's saying, according to Jesus, loving God by loving others is the greatest commandment.

209
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 And doing it among the nations may be one of the greatest challenges for the church today.

210
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 Jesus said in John's Gospel that the world will know us by our love,

211
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 and our love for God is expressed in how we love our neighbor.

212
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 But who's our neighbor?

213
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 Well, fortunately, Jesus answers that question too, doesn't he, in the Scriptures.

214
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 In Luke's Gospel, Jesus says that a loving neighbor is best illustrated by the Good Samaritan,

215
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 a person who shows mercy to an injured person he doesn't even know,

216
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 maybe not even respected,

217
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 and doesn't even share his faith as the priest and the Levite did who passed him by.

218
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 May I say to you today, you and I are that injured person on the side of the road,

219
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 left for dead in our sins until Jesus showed up and showed us mercy.

220
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 He extended a helping hand to us and gave generously so that you might be well cared for

221
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 and enjoy the riches of eternal life.

222
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 The big question is this, though.

223
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 Should you and I do anything less for someone who's in a similar situation?

224
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 And how do we show our love?

225
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 Very simply, we meet real needs we see in very tangible ways.

226
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 Expecting nothing in return until the final judgment when Jesus will make all things right.

227
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 So may I suggest to you one way you might respond to this eminent need,

228
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 and an eminent need that's in our own backyard right now as people begin arriving this fall.

229
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 So please watch this video and consider what God would have you do.

230
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 By now we have all seen videos and photos of the evolving crisis in Afghanistan.

231
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 We have heard about the many thousands of people who have been forced to leave behind everything they have or have known.

232
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 People who bear the image of God.

233
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 If you are anything like me, it breaks your heart and makes you ask, "What can I do? How can I help?"

234
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 At Water Libra, we understand, we believe that you are meant to be a force for good right here in Chicagoland.

235
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 Over the past 20 years, we have guided churches and individuals to welcome, befriend,

236
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 and help support over 9,000 Afghan immigrants in vulnerable situations in communities all across our nation.

237
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 Over 500 here in Chicagoland.

238
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 Right now, Water Libra is actively preparing to accept 750 people from all over the world to Chicagoland in the coming year.

239
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 There's over 150 coming from Afghanistan.

240
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 We need you.

241
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 This is how you help.

242
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 Pray. Pray for people fleeing Afghanistan and other conflict zones around the world.

243
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 Pray for those who have recently arrived here in Chicagoland.

244
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 And pray that God will reveal how you should respond.

245
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 Volunteer. Gather others from your church to serve in high-need volunteer roles.

246
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 The most urgent needs are on our website.

247
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 Donate needed items.

248
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 Together, we can furnish the apartments of every refugee family who arrives to Chicagoland through Water Libra.

249
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 Give. Financial donations provide many of the vital services and ongoing supports needed by those arriving from Afghanistan and other parts of the world.

250
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 All of these ways to partner are outlined on our website, along with how to register for Here to Welcome, an ongoing way to learn more and get involved.

251
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 We believe in the church.

252
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 We believe that we are called to support in moments of crisis like the situation in Afghanistan and the earthquake in Haiti.

253
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 We look forward to continuing to share with you how you can help change the world.

254
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 There are displaced people all over the world.

255
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 In fact, the current numbers that I see are about one person every two seconds being displaced in the world,

256
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 which brings us to almost 80 million people.

257
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 People all across Asia, people across Europe.

258
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 We see famines that have created movements of people, earthquakes and hurricanes that move people around.

259
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 Maybe what we're talking about here locally is not where your heart is.

260
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 Maybe your heart is for another group of people who've been displaced, whatever part of the world you're in.

261
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 What's God calling you to do as a result?

262
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 How is he calling you to act to be his hands and his feet and really to care for him as you care for others?

263
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 Let me pray for us.

264
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 Father in heaven, we thank you so much for the challenge that we have from your son Jesus and how we care and love others.

265
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 Lord, we know that the world will know us by our love,

266
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 and so I pray that we would not be characterized as people who make stereotypes and maybe lay aside or turn the other way

267
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 when we see situations that are difficult, but we step into them and we act in ways that you've called us to act.

268
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 I love the way in the scriptures at the Church of Macedonia that it says that they helped with what they were able

269
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 and beyond what they were able because of the generosity of their hearts.

270
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 I pray, Lord, that our hearts would not be cold,

271
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 but that our hearts would be warm toward those who are vulnerable around us and find ways to help them

272
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 and bring glory to you and serve you as we serve them.

273
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 Thanks so much for this day, God.

274
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 Speak to us and instruct us, even as we saw at Pentecost, challenge our hearts to the things that you would have us do.

275
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 And I pray all of this now in Jesus' name.

276
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 Amen.

277
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:56,000
