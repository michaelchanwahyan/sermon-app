00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
 Today, we're going to begin our series on faith and time.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:10,280
 Think about it, your Christian faith, your walk in Christ,

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,460
 has so much to do with how you use your time,

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,880
 how you mark your calendar, right?

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,800
 How you, you know, check the clock.

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,200
 Faith and time, they go together.

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:29,760
 Sometimes, we think that Christian faith is all about,

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,420
 you know, our verbal confession, what we say.

9
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,360
 Do you believe in Christ?

10
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,840
 Yes, I do.

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,100
 Are you a Christian?

12
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:39,940
 Yes, I am.

13
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,960
 Verbal confirmation.

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,100
 Sometimes, we stay on this level.

15
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,720
 Hopefully, this will match what our heart says, right?

16
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,580
 Otherwise, it means nothing to all of us

17
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,520
 and means nothing to you.

18
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,160
 But, you know, think deeply about faith.

19
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,340
 Ask yourself whether your faith is biblical or not.

20
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,080
 Because, you know, you can invent

21
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,960
 your own version of Christianity, right?

22
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,120
 There's so many examples in the Bible,

23
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,900
 or, you know, outside of the Bible, in church history.

24
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,940
 People would create their own faith,

25
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:20,280
 create their own version of Christian faith.

26
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,240
 And they end up, you know,

27
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,280
 deviating from the teaching of Christ.

28
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,040
 That's why in Christianity, in biblical faith,

29
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,380
 it's the faith of book.

30
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,980
 You know, have you ever wondered?

31
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,380
 There's so many religions out there.

32
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:40,540
 They don't care much about, there's one book

33
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:43,000
 defining what they do and what they think

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,500
 and what they believe.

35
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,200
 So many religions in the world,

36
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,460
 so many worldviews in the world,

37
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,580
 even a religious worldview,

38
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:55,740
 they don't really have some sort of standard, right?

39
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,920
 It's pretty much anything goes.

40
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,220
 You like to define your faith,

41
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,360
 you like to set a standard for your faith,

42
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,200
 you know, it's all up to you.

43
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,240
 It's like going to Whole Foods, right?

44
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,060
 You go to Whole Foods and you pick and choose, right?

45
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:13,760
 Whatever you want, or whatever you feel like.

46
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,220
 Now, this kind of Whole Foods, you know, faith,

47
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,620
 has nothing to do with biblical faith.

48
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,260
 It has nothing to do with the Bible.

49
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,600
 So think deeply about it.

50
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,960
 Even you profess to be a Christian,

51
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,460
 even you were baptized, right?

52
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:33,600
 Couple weeks ago, we just returned from Israel

53
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,240
 and some of my team members,

54
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,480
 they were baptized in the River Jordan.

55
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,340
 You talk about holy water, it's right there.

56
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,840
 You know, everyone wants to, you know,

57
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,140
 get baptized there, right?

58
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,840
 There's something special about it.

59
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,260
 Even you do that, it really doesn't mean,

60
00:02:54,260 --> 00:03:00,000
 or not necessarily mean that you follow Christ.

61
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,540
 Think deeper in your faith, you know, think deeper.

62
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:08,360
 Because it's dangerous to come to the Bible,

63
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,700
 come to God, as if we go to Whole Foods,

64
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:16,920
 to pick and choose, you know, according to our own choices.

65
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,360
 That's why we need to think deeply

66
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,720
 about what faith really means.

67
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,480
 Faith and time, I want you to think about in this series.

68
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,140
 Faith and your time.

69
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:29,720
 What does it mean to follow Christ

70
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,780
 when it comes to how you use your time

71
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,480
 and how you see time?

72
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,320
 So this series is on faith and time.

73
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,780
 And we'd like to pick some of the passages,

74
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,640
 some of the content from the Bible

75
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,800
 that talks about biblical faith and time and festivals.

76
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,020
 There are certain markers in the Bible,

77
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:53,700
 especially in the Old Testament and New Testament as well.

78
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,420
 During the week, during the month, during the whole year,

79
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:01,580
 there are special markers, there are special dates

80
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:05,800
 during the year, during the month, during the week,

81
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,140
 that marks the grace of God,

82
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:12,760
 that tells the people of God, "You have to worship me.

83
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,380
 "You have to remember something

84
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,820
 "about your Christian journey.

85
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:20,880
 "You have to think about and to be reminded

86
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,780
 "your experiences of God."

87
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,620
 So think about dates, some of the dates

88
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,660
 that appear in the Bible that has to do

89
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,420
 with walking in the faith of God.

90
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:37,800
 And think about time, we are beings in time.

91
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,880
 We are all controlled by time.

92
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,300
 We are all managing our time.

93
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,180
 Think of birthday, all right?

94
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,660
 How many of you, whose birthday

95
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,540
 are in the month of September?

96
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,920
 Very important month, right?

97
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,960
 Very important month.

98
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,040
 (laughs)

99
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,280
 'Cause my birthday is in September, right?

100
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,540
 How many of you birthdays in, well, what's the date now?

101
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,440
 October, yes, October.

102
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,200
 October, all right, all right, all right.

103
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,340
 We got some hands here.

104
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:12,000
 So birthday, you know, it's a marker

105
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,220
 in your journey of life, right?

106
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,740
 You mark something important.

107
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,560
 You have done one year, right?

108
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,200
 You have gone through one year.

109
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,360
 And what you look for the next year, right?

110
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,740
 So in birthday, sometimes we have birthday cake.

111
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:28,540
 Do you know the origin, origin of birthday cake?

112
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,680
 Where did it come from?

113
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,580
 We all have birthday cake on our birthday, right?

114
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,060
 Where does it come from?

115
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,320
 Definitely not in times of Jesus.

116
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,200
 Definitely not in the Bible.

117
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,980
 Well, if you chase the history of birthday cake,

118
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:45,620
 it actually comes from the Middle Ages,

119
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,420
 when some of the people in Germany,

120
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,920
 they like to make cakes for their kids

121
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,680
 when they celebrate birthday.

122
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,760
 And then, you know, slowly and gradually,

123
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,700
 that tradition builds up, right?

124
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:01,340
 In the very beginning of the history of birthday cake,

125
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,880
 birthday cake was not very sweet.

126
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,560
 But as it imported to America, you know,

127
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,220
 we add more sugar, right?

128
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,460
 So that's why we have birthday cakes,

129
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,940
 very sweet birthday cake today.

130
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,940
 Think about other times in the year.

131
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,640
 Today is October.

132
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,460
 November.

133
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:27,280
 Thanksgiving, right?

134
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,260
 What do we do in Thanksgiving?

135
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,500
 Hot pot, right?

136
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,660
 Hot pot. (laughs)

137
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,640
 Hot pot, right?

138
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,560
 Not turkey.

139
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,680
 What is Thanksgiving all about?

140
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,320
 It's kind of like a national cultural story, right?

141
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,380
 How the pilgrims came in their first harvest,

142
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:47,240
 and then they celebrate the very first time

143
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,100
 God has provided for them, you know.

144
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,640
 That's a kind of a cultural memory,

145
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,360
 or cultural identity, right?

146
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,500
 All Americans, all Americans,

147
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,880
 Asian Americans, all kinds of Americans included,

148
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,480
 we all share that kind of identity, that kind of story.

149
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,300
 Christmas, right?

150
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,080
 December 25th, 24th,

151
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,280
 sign night.

152
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,180
 It's markers of memory,

153
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:17,960
 to remember something that God has done, right?

154
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,480
 What else?

155
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,060
 Important days during the year.

156
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:26,160
 Easter, Good Friday, right?

157
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,780
 You gotta remember that, right?

158
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:32,440
 Because those are the dates

159
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,440
 that reminds you the cross of Jesus,

160
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,360
 what he has done.

161
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,580
 So think about time and your faith.

162
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:45,080
 You don't wanna forget, right?

163
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,020
 For those who are married,

164
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:52,640
 you better remember the day of your anniversary, right?

165
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,140
 Sometimes I don't.

166
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,440
 (laughs)

167
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,280
 Forgot, yeah, I forgot, I confess.

168
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:02,060
 Sometimes I even forget my own birthday.

169
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:06,000
 So, I'm not very date-driven, you know?

170
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,960
 Sometimes I'm too busy.

171
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,540
 But, you know, it's all because of that.

172
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:13,700
 We're going through our daily life in busyness,

173
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,400
 you know, being distracted,

174
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,280
 and sometimes life becomes, you know, chaotic.

175
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,000
 That's why there are fixed dates in the calendar

176
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,540
 to remind you in your faith journey.

177
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:27,960
 So, the Bible has a lot of different dates

178
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,980
 that reminds the people of God

179
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,360
 and what following Christ or what following God

180
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,860
 is all about.

181
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,440
 Deuteronomy 16, 16.

182
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,900
 It says three times a year, three times.

183
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,340
 What are the three times?

184
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:47,120
 Three times a year, all of you, represented by men,

185
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,960
 must appear before the Lord, your God,

186
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,760
 at the place he would choose.

187
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,800
 You know, eventually it's Jerusalem, the temple.

188
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,080
 At the Feast of Unleavened Bread.

189
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,000
 First time.

190
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,180
 The Feast of Weeks, second time.

191
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:07,940
 And then the Feast of Tabernacles.

192
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:12,860
 No one should appear before the Lord empty-handed.

193
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,780
 You gotta bring something.

194
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,580
 Your offering, your sacrifices, your attitude,

195
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,840
 your whole being, each of you must bring a gift

196
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:26,600
 in proportion to the way your God has blessed you.

197
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,780
 So there are poor people, there are rich people,

198
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:32,940
 they come three times a year to the temple to worship.

199
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,680
 Right?

200
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,620
 Now, of course, every single week, you know, on Shabbat,

201
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,740
 they will worship.

202
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:42,580
 That is one of the most important marker of their calendar,

203
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:45,080
 a weekly reminder, the Shabbat.

204
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,540
 And then three times a year,

205
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,040
 there are three great festivals,

206
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,700
 three great dates that they must remember.

207
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,460
 It's kinda sound like our Good Friday,

208
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,540
 our Easter, and our Christmas.

209
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:03,080
 Three times a year, they must come before the Lord

210
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,580
 to praise him, to worship him.

211
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:09,920
 The first one is Feast of Unleavened Bread.

212
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,500
 That equals to Passover.

213
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:16,140
 Passover, one day, and then seven days afterward,

214
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,860
 they celebrate for seven days and eating unleavened bread.

215
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,440
 Passover.

216
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,740
 We'll talk about that more later.

217
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:28,300
 The Feast of Weeks, that is seven weeks after Passover.

218
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:32,460
 The 50th day after Passover is another day of harvest.

219
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:38,260
 They celebrate the harvest of barley and wheat,

220
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,720
 and wheat and all that.

221
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,200
 In New Testament term, it's Pentecost.

222
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,360
 Pentecost means 50, right?

223
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,020
 So it's the 50th day after Passover.

224
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,540
 That's the second time they must come

225
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,700
 before the Lord in the temple.

226
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,740
 The third time is Feast of Tabernacles.

227
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:00,580
 Tabernacles falls on the fall, the early fall.

228
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:04,360
 If you check the morning calendar, if you Google,

229
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,440
 Feast of Tabernacle, 2022, or Sukkot,

230
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,180
 S-U-K-K-O-T, Sukkot, 2022.

231
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:17,780
 It falls on, what's today?

232
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,960
 October--

233
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,780
 - [Audience Member] Second.

234
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,620
 - Second, right?

235
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,580
 Second, right?

236
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,640
 Sorry, yeah, second.

237
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,620
 The next week, actually, is Sukkot in Israel.

238
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,460
 Sukkot.

239
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:31,060
 It's the fall festival.

240
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:34,660
 So three times a year, they must bring something,

241
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:38,660
 some gift to this important worship opportunity.

242
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,640
 What do they do?

243
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:45,300
 Let me talk about the Sukkot starting today.

244
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,020
 Let's talk about the third festival,

245
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:51,600
 because it falls right on next week, right?

246
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,260
 Early October.

247
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,680
 Leviticus 23, 33.

248
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,700
 The Lord said to Moses,

249
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,220
 "Say to the people of God, Israelites,

250
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,080
 "on the 15th day of the seventh month

251
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,700
 "of the Lord's Feast of Tabernacles begins,

252
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,780
 "it lasts for seven days.

253
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:14,660
 "Live in the Sukkot, in our booths, Tabernacles,

254
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,400
 "for seven days.

255
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,920
 "All native-born Israelites are to live in the booths

256
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,520
 "so your children and your children's children,

257
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,620
 "your descendants, will know that I had

258
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,040
 "the Israelites live in booths

259
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,200
 "when I brought them out of Egypt,

260
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,840
 "through the wilderness, when they live in the desert,

261
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,680
 "when they live in the wilderness.

262
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,320
 "I brought them out of Egypt.

263
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,220
 "I am Yahweh, your God.

264
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,220
 "I am the Lord."

265
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:45,380
 Now, as I said, it falls on October 9th to 16th this year.

266
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:49,860
 And I told you last time, my wife and I,

267
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,960
 some years ago, we went to Israel

268
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,960
 for our two weeks vacation,

269
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:59,120
 and didn't know what festival fall in that two weeks.

270
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,760
 So the first week, it was the Yom Kippur,

271
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,480
 the Day of Atonement, when they confess their sins,

272
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,560
 so they shut down all the whole country, right?

273
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,600
 I told you that.

274
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,860
 And then the following week,

275
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:16,020
 it's a totally different mood, you know, on the streets,

276
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,960
 because it was the week of tabernacles, sukkot.

277
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,560
 It was a high holiday in Israel.

278
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,660
 It actually is probably one of the most important festivals

279
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,120
 that they celebrate.

280
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,280
 And so we did experience one of their sukkots that year.

281
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:39,280
 They call it sukkot.

282
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:43,440
 In Hebrew, that's the word for tabernacle, the tent.

283
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:47,060
 So during sukkot, we walk around the city,

284
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:50,820
 and I find it really, really interesting.

285
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:55,160
 Just like a non-Chinese walks into Chinatown, right?

286
00:13:55,160 --> 00:14:01,580
 Walks into the community of most of the Chinese people.

287
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:04,000
 They probably would be amazed

288
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,980
 by how we celebrate some of the dates, right?

289
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,760
 How we go about our daily lives, right?

290
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,160
 I used to have a Caucasian professor.

291
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,540
 He told me the first time he went to Chinatown

292
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,120
 when he was a kid.

293
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,220
 So he went to Chinatown, and he looked at one of the stores.

294
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,720
 And the storefront, there's a water tank,

295
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,420
 and there's some fish in there.

296
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,800
 So as a kid, he find it really amazing

297
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:34,000
 that the fish, live fish, is on display on the street, right?

298
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,960
 He walk into the store, and he find it so sad,

299
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,480
 because people are killing the fish.

300
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,000
 So he was amazed.

301
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,120
 As a white person, he had never experienced

302
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,720
 something like that.

303
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,640
 So kind of a same feeling that I had in sukkot.

304
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:54,900
 Finding the Jews, they were building different kinds

305
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:58,480
 of tents on the streets and in the balcony.

306
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:05,040
 So this is some of the pictures I took during sukkot.

307
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:10,120
 They built this kind of tent they call sukkah.

308
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,840
 So how do you build a sukkah?

309
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:16,120
 You need four by eight, some of the four by eight,

310
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,880
 and then you nail them together.

311
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,800
 And then on top of it, you put some branches

312
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,720
 or you put some plants to cover it.

313
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:29,760
 It's not very permanent, right?

314
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,360
 It's not very strong.

315
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,280
 Actually, if the weather goes bad, it may fall.

316
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,320
 So on the street, they build all kinds of sukkah.

317
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,840
 On the balcony, they build some sukkah.

318
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,200
 So this is what they do, because that's what the Torah says.

319
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,840
 You have to celebrate in the sukkah,

320
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,840
 in the tent, for seven days.

321
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,680
 So what do they do?

322
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,920
 They build some tents outside.

323
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,600
 It has to be outside, not inside your house.

324
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,360
 So they will dine under the tent.

325
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,960
 They will talk under the tent.

326
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,640
 They will drink under the tent.

327
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,520
 Now, it's very interesting, right?

328
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,560
 So we went to Western Wall.

329
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,080
 That is the day before Sukkot.

330
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,480
 So I saw some workers.

331
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,640
 They cut some of the branches from the palm tree,

332
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,920
 and then they were building sukkah.

333
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,040
 Very interesting.

334
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,720
 Building sukkah on Western Wall,

335
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,040
 you know, on the Western Wall Plaza.

336
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,080
 The Western Wall is actually an open-air synagogue,

337
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,880
 so people are meeting there.

338
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,640
 So they're building all these kind of things,

339
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,640
 and it looks like a hut,

340
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:48,480
 and it's very flimsy.

341
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,640
 But during seven days, they will eat and drink

342
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,060
 and even sleep in the sukkah.

343
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:57,760
 How many of you like camping trip?

344
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,840
 You know, go out to camping, maybe in Michigan

345
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,420
 or in some other national park.

346
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,160
 How many of you enjoy camping?

347
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,280
 How many enjoy camping?

348
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,120
 You do?

349
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,360
 Okay, then we'll have one hand only.

350
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,360
 Okay, okay, another.

351
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,480
 Okay, all right.

352
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,360
 So you don't like outdoor activities?

353
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,200
 Why not?

354
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,920
 Mosquitoes, right?

355
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,360
 Yeah, and then bugs in, you know, bathroom, right?

356
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,560
 Yeah.

357
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,960
 All right, so you guys are too spoiled.

358
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,960
 Urbanites.

359
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,760
 Too spoiled urbanites.

360
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,240
 I used to like camping, too.

361
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,360
 I used to like camping.

362
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:36,360
 But as I get older and older, I find myself,

363
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,040
 I can't do this anymore.

364
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,160
 Yeah.

365
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,720
 But you know, when you go camping, you know,

366
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,120
 it's kind of like living in a sukkah, right?

367
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:47,160
 You sleep in there, you eat in there,

368
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,200
 you play games inside the tent.

369
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,720
 It's kind of fun, right?

370
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,320
 When you were young, right?

371
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,400
 (laughs)

372
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,800
 This is what they do for seven days.

373
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:02,080
 And if you're not handy, this can be a challenge to you.

374
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,320
 How many of you are really handy here?

375
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,800
 You know, nails, woodworking, and all that.

376
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,200
 How many of you are really handy?

377
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,040
 Or me, okay.

378
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:10,960
 (audience laughs)

379
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,640
 Yeah.

380
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,200
 But when you think about sukkah,

381
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,120
 it really doesn't require you to be handy.

382
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:24,600
 Because in the Jewish literature,

383
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,520
 when they talk about building a sukkah,

384
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,720
 they actually dictate that you build a flimsy sukkah,

385
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,360
 temporary sukkah.

386
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,800
 It's okay if it falls.

387
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:45,280
 Because sukkah does not mean to stand forever.

388
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,560
 They are to be taken down.

389
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,240
 They are temporary dwelling place.

390
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,240
 Why?

391
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:00,400
 In fact, there's a story in one of the Jewish literatures

392
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,880
 that talks about two Jewish rabbis.

393
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,280
 They were debating how strong

394
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,600
 or how permanent a sukkah should be.

395
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:13,040
 And the story goes, two rabbis were traveling during sukkah.

396
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,800
 So they were not home.

397
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,360
 They were on a ship.

398
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:20,720
 They were on a, you know,

399
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,600
 on the Mediterranean Sea.

400
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,560
 During sukkah.

401
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,520
 And they find that, okay, it's time in the year

402
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,720
 to celebrate sukkah.

403
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:34,400
 So they need to build something, a sukkah, on the ship.

404
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,560
 One of the rabbis,

405
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:40,680
 he chose to build his sukkah on the deck of the ship.

406
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:46,640
 And then after he built it,

407
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,320
 during that night, wind came and blew down the sukkah.

408
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,000
 And then the two rabbis were debating,

409
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,080
 "See, how could you build such a flimsy sukkah?"

410
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,920
 Right?

411
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,520
 The wind came and then it fell.

412
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:05,800
 And the rabbi who built the sukkah on the deck,

413
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:10,800
 he said, "I built the sukkah the way it's supposed to be.

414
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,400
 "That's what our law says.

415
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,680
 "It has to be fragile.

416
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,960
 "It has to be flimsy."

417
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:22,160
 The Jewish literature, it's very funny.

418
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,160
 You know, talk about sukkah so much,

419
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,480
 you have to build three walls at least.

420
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,960
 And then you have to build your roof with branches only.

421
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,960
 You know, all sorts of details,

422
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,640
 or building code for the sukkah.

423
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,880
 Now, why did they do that?

424
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:44,240
 Because sukkah, the tent, the tabernacle,

425
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,560
 is a symbol of life.

426
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,360
 Life is transitional.

427
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,160
 Life is like a shadow.

428
00:20:55,160 --> 00:21:00,760
 Here today, but will be gone tomorrow.

429
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,200
 That's what sukkah is all about.

430
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:09,840
 Because when the Israelites, when they came out of Egypt,

431
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,880
 they spent 40 years in the wilderness.

432
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:16,280
 There were no permanent houses in the wilderness.

433
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,680
 There's no stone building in the wilderness.

434
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:25,040
 All they live in was temporary tents, right?

435
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,600
 And life is always transitional, right?

436
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,440
 Don't you think so?

437
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,760
 Sukkot is a reminder every year

438
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:37,360
 for the people of God to remind them

439
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:43,000
 how short their life is, how transitional our life is.

440
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,160
 Don't you think so?

441
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,000
 Life is short.

442
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,840
 Time flies.

443
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,840
 I went to a wedding not too long ago.

444
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,560
 I met some of the students I used to be counselor with.

445
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,920
 You know, now they grew up.

446
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:01,000
 They got married, right?

447
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,240
 And I met some of the friends,

448
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,080
 you know, some of the students that I used to be with.

449
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,480
 Now they grew up, right?

450
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,800
 They're working, or they have their own career.

451
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,600
 Now, I met different people,

452
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,080
 "Oh, long time no see," right?

453
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,600
 "Wow, long time no see, long time no see."

454
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,880
 You know, that's one of the tunes

455
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,880
 that I play the whole night, right?

456
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,800
 "Oh, long time no see, long time no see."

457
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,360
 It becomes automatic, right?

458
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,640
 Yeah, whoever you see, "Oh, long time no see," right?

459
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,600
 Because I haven't seen them for a long time,

460
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,560
 especially in the past three years because of the pandemic.

461
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:38,200
 I haven't seen those friends for a long, long time, right?

462
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,080
 So, and the other tune that we play, or I play,

463
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,280
 most of the time during the night, during the banquet,

464
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,920
 was that, "Wow, your kid is so big now.

465
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:54,880
 "Wow, you," talking to the kids,

466
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,880
 "Wow, you're so tall.

467
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,660
 "When I saw you last time, you were like, you know,

468
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:01,000
 "a tiny, tiny being, right?

469
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,600
 "Now you're so big," right?

470
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,880
 Then they, and then we update each other,

471
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,280
 and then I told them, you know,

472
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,600
 my son and my daughters are in college,

473
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,480
 and they say, "Wow, dang, I cannot believe that

474
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,920
 "because, you know, in my mind,

475
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,120
 "your kids are just kids," right?

476
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,080
 I said, "They're not kids, they're adults now.

477
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:27,080
 "They drive, they drink, they're adults."

478
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:32,560
 Life is fleeting, life is so short.

479
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:36,120
 That is one of the things we hear over and over again.

480
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,000
 Time flies.

481
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,040
 Sukkot, it's a reminder

482
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,500
 that your life is not permanent.

483
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,920
 Don't make it permanent.

484
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,080
 There's no need to make it permanent.

485
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,280
 But, you know, it's very interesting.

486
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:55,700
 Sometimes we spend most of our effort

487
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,340
 to make life permanent.

488
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:00,560
 Try to make it permanent.

489
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,240
 Try to make it look like it lasts forever.

490
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:08,300
 Sukkot tells you, "Don't pretend.

491
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,380
 "You can't do that.

492
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:13,400
 "Life is not permanent, it's transitional."

493
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,000
 And how much we invest in our lives,

494
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,400
 how much effort, how much thinking

495
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:25,520
 have we invest into just planning our life,

496
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,640
 building our life, it seems like our Sukkot

497
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,200
 would last forever.

498
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,240
 But no, it won't.

499
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:34,120
 Life is always transitional.

500
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:38,200
 You know, one of the scriptures

501
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:43,240
 the Jewish people would read during Sukkot

502
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,800
 in the synagogues is the book of Ecclesiastes.

503
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,800
 Ecclesiastes.

504
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,760
 If you haven't read this book,

505
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,120
 the book of Ecclesiastes in the Old Testament,

506
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,080
 you should read it.

507
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,520
 It talks about life under the sun.

508
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,520
 It's meaningless.

509
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,720
 Because of death.

510
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,840
 Because of death.

511
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,680
 And one day, we're gonna die, right?

512
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,880
 And the whole book of Ecclesiastes is to remind us

513
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,800
 where should we find meaning in our lives.

514
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,240
 Let me close with this last scripture.

515
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:26,240
 The Lord said to Moses, "On the 15th day of seven months,

516
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,720
 "the Feast of Sukkot lasts for seven days.

517
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,720
 "You live in Sukkah for seven days, all of you,

518
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:39,540
 "so that your children and your children's children

519
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:43,200
 "will know that you used to live in Sukkah,

520
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,420
 "in wilderness for 40 years.

521
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,880
 "I rescue you.

522
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,100
 "I provide for you.

523
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:52,100
 "I guide your way.

524
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,740
 "Your short life is under the hand of God."

525
00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:00,120
 Well, a reminder for us, life is transitional.

526
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,780
 And how much effort should we invest

527
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,940
 into something really eternal, right?

528
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,880
 Something really eternal.

529
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:11,820
 C.S. Lewis says something like,

530
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:17,260
 do not, something like do not,

531
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:20,460
 do not stress out for things that are not eternal.

532
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:26,420
 Do not be so stressed out about things that don't last.

533
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:30,900
 Change our attitude.

534
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:35,180
 You know, adjust our orientation.

535
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,940
 What is life all about?

536
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:39,740
 Especially we have the life of Christ.

537
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:44,740
 How should we invest our time in this short, short life?

538
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:47,800
 Invest into something that will last.

539
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,900
 Now, what will last in the Bible?

540
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,100
 Let me tell you this, okay?

541
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,020
 What will last in the Bible?

542
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,740
 I can think of three things

543
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,400
 that will last forever in the Bible.

544
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,060
 First, God himself.

545
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:03,740
 God himself is everlasting.

546
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,780
 All right?

547
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:11,740
 Second, is the soul, human soul.

548
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:19,620
 Human life will last forever, eternal life, right?

549
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:22,780
 Three, the gospel.

550
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:25,540
 Last forever.

551
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:30,060
 Worth our effort, worth our investment.

552
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:32,120
 Let's all pray together.

553
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,900
 Father, we give you thanks for the reminder

554
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,380
 that we are in Christ,

555
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:41,600
 that we have eternal life and eternal hope.

556
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,300
 And thank you for your grace.

557
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:48,420
 Thank you for the gift of eternal life.

558
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:52,300
 Remind us once and again, again and again,

559
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,060
 that this life is short.

560
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:58,500
 This life will not last.

561
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:04,440
 Yes, we are all like Israelites living in tents

562
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,360
 in the wilderness.

563
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:12,160
 When wind came, everything would be gone.

564
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,360
 Yes, life is transitional,

565
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,620
 but help us to anchor our life in eternity.

566
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:22,200
 Help us to fix our eyes

567
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:27,320
 in something that will last,

568
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,520
 to preach your gospel,

569
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:32,140
 to build up your kingdom, to serve you.

570
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:35,600
 Thank you for being our eternal God.

571
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,900
 In Christ's name, we pray.

572
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:40,600
 Well, thank you very much and we'll see you next week

573
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,880
 and we'll continue to talk about faith and time.

574
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,720
 God bless.
