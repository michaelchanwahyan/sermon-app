1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
 our time to John.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:02,600
 Let's welcome John.

3
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,760
 (audience applauding)

4
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,040
 - Everybody again at Urban Voice.

5
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,640
 And in fact, this is, you know,

6
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,320
 since I've been coming out monthly since August,

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,240
 this is the most of Urban Voice I have seen since August.

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,960
 So thank you for choosing to come on out today

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,800
 and join with your brothers and sisters in worship

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,080
 and in the hearing of God's word.

11
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,080
 With that, let's begin with just a quick word of prayer

12
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,160
 as we go into God's word, okay?

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,680
 Heavenly Father, thank you so much.

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,680
 We do thank you because not just 'cause it's Thanksgiving,

15
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,640
 but because this is an occasion to remind us

16
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,800
 to pause for a moment.

17
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,120
 Perhaps it's in the midst of a season of grumbling,

18
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,000
 of discontent.

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,680
 In a season where we're longing for more or better,

20
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:06,560
 help us now to stop and just recall

21
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,640
 all the great things you have done.

22
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,120
 And then to think about the great things

23
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,440
 you have done for us.

24
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:25,600
 And make those recollections cause us to draw near to you,

25
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:33,020
 to take a step forward, inch forward.

26
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:38,400
 And knowing as we're reminded today in the word

27
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,160
 that we are going to be looking into,

28
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,600
 that God, you have made a way through your son

29
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,320
 for us to draw near to you and to do it boldly.

30
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,440
 And we wanna do that today.

31
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,480
 And it's in Jesus' name we pray, amen.

32
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,680
 So brothers and sisters, you know,

33
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,800
 as already been mentioned a few times,

34
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:02,800
 this is a cause for great celebration today.

35
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,800
 A wonderful thing is happening today.

36
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,900
 I will call, you don't have to call it this,

37
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:13,040
 I will call it the new Urban Voice, okay?

38
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,600
 Don't change your signs, don't do anything like that,

39
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,760
 don't change your website, but the new Urban Voice,

40
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,080
 a new chapter for Urban Voice is starting today.

41
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,040
 You know, the Peniel Multiethnic Church

42
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,380
 is joining forces with Urban Voice Community Church.

43
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:33,040
 Two, what I believe genuinely,

44
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,840
 two great works that God has been doing.

45
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,720
 And you know, the world might call this a merge

46
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,240
 or a merger, but you know, let's face it,

47
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,160
 it's really more like two families that are coming together.

48
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,960
 It's like a marriage.

49
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,320
 It's two becoming one.

50
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,960
 And so praise the Lord for doing this great thing, amen?

51
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:58,040
 So I don't have a whole lot of time,

52
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,520
 'cause I know everybody is like, there's a luncheon today?

53
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,720
 So probably like, please, keep it short.

54
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,960
 And I will do my very best.

55
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,000
 In fact, I am gonna do more than my best.

56
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,360
 I'm actually gonna keep it short today.

57
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,480
 So there's a lot to say,

58
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,700
 but I'm gonna let the Holy Spirit speak to us

59
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,640
 through His word.

60
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,240
 So if you'll turn in your Bibles,

61
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,760
 or turn your Bibles on on your phone apps,

62
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,900
 to Hebrews chapter 10, verses 19 through 25.

63
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:30,760
 Hebrews 10, 19 through 25, and I'll read that for you.

64
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,360
 And it says, "Therefore, brothers and sisters,

65
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,040
 "since we have confidence to enter the most holy place

66
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,780
 "by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way

67
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,520
 "open for us through the curtain that is His body,

68
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,820
 "and since we have a great priest over the house of God,

69
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,760
 "let us draw near to God with a sincere heart

70
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,820
 "and with the full assurance that faith brings.

71
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:57,420
 "Having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us

72
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,580
 "from a guilty conscience,

73
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:02,380
 "and having our bodies washed with pure water,

74
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:06,360
 "let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess,

75
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,260
 "for He who promised is faithful."

76
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,880
 Then verse 24, "And let us consider

77
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,980
 "how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds,

78
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,700
 "not giving up meeting together

79
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,660
 "as some are in the habit of doing,

80
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,900
 "but encouraging one another,

81
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:28,020
 "and all the more as you see the day approaching."

82
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:33,100
 So there are three let us statements,

83
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,940
 three invitations, three exhortations

84
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,660
 that the author of Hebrews gives us.

85
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:44,660
 First, we see in verse 22, "Let us draw near to God."

86
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:48,840
 Then in verse 23, "Let us hold unswervingly

87
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,220
 "to the hope we profess."

88
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,880
 And then third, "Let us consider

89
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,160
 "how we may spur one another on

90
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,120
 "towards love and good deeds."

91
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,080
 But before we get to these invitations,

92
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,320
 let's stop for a moment,

93
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:09,320
 looking starting at verse 19 at the foundational conviction.

94
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,360
 You know, we're pointed to this in verse 23, right?

95
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,200
 What is this hope we profess?

96
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,520
 What is the foundation of this invitation?

97
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:28,360
 And it is this, the gospel of Jesus Christ

98
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,080
 is the foundation of the church's

99
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,400
 intimate relationship with holy God,

100
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,320
 and with one another.

101
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,040
 The gospel of Jesus Christ is the shared foundation

102
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,640
 of the church's intimate relationship

103
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,640
 with God and with one another.

104
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:53,680
 The church, we're told in verse 19, just by the address,

105
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,460
 "Who is the author talking to?"

106
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,360
 And he says, "Brothers and sisters."

107
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,040
 If you don't know who your brothers and sisters are,

108
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,560
 just look to the left, look to the right,

109
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,720
 look behind you, go ahead, you can do that,

110
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,320
 it's all right, look around.

111
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,160
 These are your brothers and sisters

112
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,160
 who share this foundational conviction

113
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,200
 in the gospel of Jesus Christ.

114
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:24,800
 Is the writer of Hebrews writing to a bunch of strangers

115
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,480
 who don't know each other, or some,

116
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,760
 just kind of like group of people

117
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,040
 that happen to be together one day?

118
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,520
 No, of course not, he's specifically addressing

119
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,120
 a known and exclusive, and I'll say it,

120
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,440
 an exclusive group of people.

121
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,880
 We hear a lot of people say about like,

122
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,720
 "Our church is inclusive, we want everybody to come."

123
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,040
 But the reality is, is the church is exclusive.

124
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,000
 You know why?

125
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,680
 Because you are not really a member of the church,

126
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,980
 the body of Christ, unless you are in Christ.

127
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:59,600
 And you have to have the gospel to be in Christ.

128
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,760
 You have to believe who Jesus is,

129
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:07,440
 believe in him and what he has done on the cross,

130
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,380
 to lay down his life for sinners like us.

131
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:16,460
 And then to rise again in victory on the third day.

132
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:21,840
 To give us new life, eternal life,

133
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,360
 to guarantee the forgiveness of our sins,

134
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,800
 and a relationship with holy God.

135
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,520
 I mean, who do we think we are?

136
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,400
 We know how messed up we are.

137
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,520
 We know how weak and flawed we are.

138
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,240
 Who do we think we are that we think

139
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,880
 we should have a relationship?

140
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:43,240
 And yet you know what the gospel writer John says?

141
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:48,360
 That we have the right, the right.

142
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,260
 We have the audacity because of Jesus

143
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,960
 to claim to be children of God.

144
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,720
 Let that sink in for just a second.

145
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,680
 That ought to just blow your mind.

146
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,680
 Who do we dare to be to say we are children of God?

147
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:13,720
 That we would have the right to be called children of God?

148
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:19,280
 Formally we might call one another members of a church

149
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,480
 or the church.

150
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,880
 Says therefore brothers and sisters,

151
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,760
 we have confidence to enter the most holy place.

152
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,960
 Here's the foundation, the gospel.

153
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,620
 It's probably maybe explained in a way

154
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,120
 that you haven't thought of it.

155
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,680
 But it says we have confidence to enter

156
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,840
 the most holy place.

157
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,860
 It's a picture of the temple.

158
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:43,220
 In the temple is the smallest room.

159
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:46,160
 It's called the Holy of Holies or the most holy place.

160
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,260
 And it's a place where one person once a year,

161
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:53,040
 the high priest gets to go in.

162
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,960
 Once a year.

163
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,960
 And if he's not worthy, if he has done,

164
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,680
 if he has not prepared himself to go into the presence

165
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,680
 of God, then he is to be killed.

166
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,880
 Killed.

167
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,840
 He would die.

168
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:17,680
 But it says we have confidence, not just the one person,

169
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,640
 but we have confidence to enter the most holy place

170
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,720
 by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way

171
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,000
 open for us through the curtain that is his body.

172
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,600
 Whose body?

173
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,040
 Jesus Christ.

174
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:38,040
 And since we have a great priest over the house of God,

175
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:43,080
 so Jesus is the high priest with a capital T,

176
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:47,040
 the capital H, capital P.

177
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,360
 He is a superior high priest.

178
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,440
 He's not like one of those of old.

179
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,400
 He is even better.

180
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,100
 You could say he is the super priest.

181
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:03,000
 He says because Jesus is our high priest,

182
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,080
 he says let us draw near to God with a sincere heart

183
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,520
 and with the full assurance that faith brings.

184
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,280
 And that's where the gospel comes in again.

185
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,160
 We don't claim this because we're good enough.

186
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,960
 We don't claim the right, this boldness,

187
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,240
 this confidence to enter into God's presence

188
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,300
 because we did enough, we measured up.

189
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:26,920
 No, it's because the high priest, Jesus,

190
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:31,000
 did everything necessary so that by faith

191
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,120
 in what he has accomplished for us,

192
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,760
 by faith in who he is, we ride on his coattails

193
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,720
 and we have confidence because the high priest

194
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,100
 has done what's necessary.

195
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:48,100
 So we boldly, confidently enter into this holy of holies,

196
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:53,780
 this most sacred place where even when the high priest

197
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:57,880
 doesn't do it right, he's at risk of losing his life.

198
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,260
 We go in confidently.

199
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:02,560
 And why?

200
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,880
 Because we're told our hearts have been sprinkled

201
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,660
 to cleanse us from a guilty conscience

202
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:12,520
 and having our bodies washed with pure water.

203
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,280
 Because the church has this great high priest

204
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,400
 in Jesus Christ, let us draw near.

205
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,240
 Here's the first invitation.

206
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,720
 Let us draw near to God.

207
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,160
 How many in this room have been away at college

208
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,560
 and you're back for Thanksgiving break?

209
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,720
 There's about a half dozen people in the room.

210
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,560
 My daughter's back from college too.

211
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,360
 I know what college is like.

212
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,520
 I was at college.

213
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:44,540
 And if you have gotten real busy with studying,

214
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,800
 playing, sleeping, whatever it is,

215
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,660
 and it has drawn you away from God,

216
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:55,520
 let me call you back.

217
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,120
 Let me invite you.

218
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,640
 Draw near to God with a sincere heart

219
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,760
 and with the full assurance of faith,

220
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,820
 absolute trust in Jesus.

221
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:13,920
 On that day of atonement when the high priest

222
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,820
 goes into the temple, the people of God together

223
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,980
 experienced a national revival.

224
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:27,660
 They had confidence to say, now we can face another year

225
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,360
 and we can expect God to bless us.

226
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,960
 We can expect God to be present.

227
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:37,960
 We can expect God to show us favor and prosperity.

228
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:43,120
 We can expect, on the other hand, God will not kill us.

229
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:47,640
 For our sin, he's forgiven us.

230
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:51,760
 They could collectively breathe a sigh of relief

231
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,380
 like, oh, it's all good with God.

232
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:58,680
 And what does this passage tell us?

233
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,800
 If you read this whole section of Hebrews,

234
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,800
 it's just this whole explanation of,

235
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,320
 look at all that the Old Testament prophets

236
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,680
 and priests have done.

237
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,200
 All the animals that were sacrificed,

238
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,360
 and it had to be done every year over and over again

239
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,080
 because sin became a problem over and over again.

240
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:24,440
 But now we have this high priest who does it once and for all

241
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,680
 and his sacrifice is so superior,

242
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,580
 he never has to do it again.

243
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:33,540
 Once and for all, Christ has died for his church.

244
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:38,240
 Once and for all.

245
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:45,840
 That's as long as there's a high priest

246
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,960
 who has done it right.

247
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:52,360
 A high priest that was acceptable to God,

248
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:56,940
 who followed every law,

249
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,880
 obeyed every command to the utmost.

250
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:05,560
 But the church, as I said,

251
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,740
 has an even greater high priest,

252
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,880
 the Son of God, the Son of Man.

253
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:17,000
 The superior high priest, the super priest.

254
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 For sinners, we cannot move forward.

255
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 We cannot move forward in a relationship with God.

256
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,880
 We cannot go boldly into God's presence

257
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,400
 without great danger.

258
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,440
 We just cannot unless we have a great high priest.

259
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,640
 And for those who don't know, I'm here to tell you,

260
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:49,520
 there is a great high priest and his name is Jesus.

261
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,520
 If you have not trusted in him,

262
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:55,640
 don't you dare even think about approaching God.

263
00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:00,140
 It's nothing but danger.

264
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:04,300
 But if you have Jesus as your high priest,

265
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:08,680
 your Savior, who didn't slaughter a lamb,

266
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:13,360
 he himself was slaughtered.

267
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,360
 He shed his own blood, his own body broken for us.

268
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:23,560
 Trust that high priest 'cause he has made us a way.

269
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:31,380
 He's made us guilt-free and he has purified us from sin

270
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:36,380
 so that the righteous judge might declare us righteous.

271
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,920
 Righteous.

272
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:44,480
 And that's what he does when we have put our faith

273
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,820
 in the righteous one, Jesus.

274
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:53,040
 He has made us new, or he has made a new and living way

275
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,240
 for sinners to have intimate relationship with holy God.

276
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,560
 This is the gospel of Jesus Christ,

277
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,280
 that he has secured God's forgiveness for us,

278
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:07,280
 that he has secured for us on the cross a birthright.

279
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,540
 As I said before, the birthright that we would dare

280
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:14,880
 to claim to be sons and daughters of God.

281
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,480
 Sons and daughters of God.

282
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:24,860
 This is the gospel of Jesus and this is that foundation

283
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,840
 that we share together.

284
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:31,840
 So let us draw near to God with a sincere heart

285
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,800
 and the full assurance of faith.

286
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,720
 When you have trusted Jesus,

287
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,520
 you don't have to walk carefully,

288
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:44,960
 you don't have to walk sheepishly shy, afraid.

289
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:49,560
 No, we can approach him as our God and father.

290
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:56,160
 Second, in verse 23, let us hold unswervingly

291
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,440
 to the hope we profess.

292
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,880
 That same gospel, for he who promised is faithful.

293
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,780
 The church is holding unwaveringly

294
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,360
 to the gospel of Jesus Christ,

295
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,320
 her hope and her conviction and her claim.

296
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,360
 The church is unshakable trust in the faithful one.

297
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:16,280
 We trust the Lord Jesus Christ, that he has done enough,

298
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,400
 that he has done it right.

299
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,480
 We trust his finished work on the cross.

300
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,360
 There's no one else that we trust, is there?

301
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:28,840
 There's nothing we can add to perfectly finished work,

302
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,840
 is there?

303
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:36,680
 Whose gospel is the power of salvation

304
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,780
 for those who believe?

305
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:41,200
 It's the gospel of Jesus.

306
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,500
 It's the gospel of Jesus, amen?

307
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,240
 Do we really believe that?

308
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:53,040
 Do we really believe that without this gospel,

309
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,820
 we are doomed, we are hopeless?

310
00:17:55,820 --> 00:18:01,880
 So then we are able to spur each other on.

311
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,640
 We are called to push and to press,

312
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,020
 to encourage and to inspire, to provoke each other,

313
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:13,020
 to move forward because we share this fundamental commitment

314
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:16,580
 to Jesus Christ and his gospel.

315
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:21,820
 How many times in recent days have you heard somebody

316
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,240
 call people to unity?

317
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,640
 We have to stop being so divided.

318
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,880
 I just heard it recently.

319
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,860
 You know, when the Kyle Rittenhouse verdict was read,

320
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,680
 there was a call for peace and unity.

321
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,000
 Let's not fight about this.

322
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,760
 Let's be united.

323
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,360
 Let's hold together.

324
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,200
 And you know what?

325
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,800
 No matter who makes that call, whether it's the president,

326
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,220
 whether it's somebody influential in your life,

327
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:57,220
 a celebrity, no matter who makes that call, it's hopeless.

328
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:01,140
 We can't be united.

329
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,700
 There's too much that divides us.

330
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:07,320
 Being a Chicagoan doesn't unite us.

331
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,440
 Being an American doesn't unite us.

332
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,620
 Being Chinese doesn't unite us.

333
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:15,020
 A person, a citizen of the world doesn't unite us.

334
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,260
 It all divides us.

335
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,000
 But you know what unites us?

336
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,200
 Our hope, the gospel of Jesus Christ.

337
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,180
 It's the only thing that unites the church.

338
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:32,320
 So here's a little warning.

339
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,620
 I'm not a prophet, so later on don't say,

340
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,360
 "Man, that John Yee was a prophet.

341
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,100
 "He knew what was coming."

342
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,260
 I just know, and you know human nature.

343
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:45,980
 There is going to be things that will come up

344
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,620
 that will divide us.

345
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:52,700
 There are gonna be things that will happen

346
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,740
 that will cause us to say,

347
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:57,260
 "I don't wanna be with that person anymore.

348
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,300
 "I don't wanna have anything to do

349
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,560
 "with those people anymore."

350
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:05,860
 But the question we need to ask ourselves is,

351
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:08,460
 but do we agree?

352
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:12,280
 Are we united in the gospel?

353
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:17,020
 Are we all one in Christ?

354
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:20,820
 Are we?

355
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:29,820
 Only the gospel of Jesus Christ can unite people.

356
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:36,620
 Only Jesus is worthy of such commitment,

357
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:39,440
 loyalty, and devotion.

358
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,080
 Only Jesus.

359
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,080
 So when division appears again and it's imminent,

360
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,920
 let's hold together.

361
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:54,640
 Hold on to the hope we profess, the hope we claim.

362
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,420
 I know the gospel is preached here at least once a week.

363
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:06,200
 Hold to that hope we profess.

364
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:11,600
 Hold on to the promises of God in Jesus Christ

365
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,080
 to give us that new life, eternal life,

366
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,520
 to forgive us for our sins, to declare us righteous,

367
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,620
 and to say, "You are my children.

368
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:24,460
 "You are my son, you are my daughter."

369
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:27,320
 Let us hold together to the one faith,

370
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,240
 Jesus, our superior high priest.

371
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,360
 Let's hold on to him.

372
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,080
 Third, let us consider in verse 24

373
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,820
 how we may spur each other on towards love and good deeds,

374
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,600
 not giving up meeting together

375
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,200
 as some are in the habit of doing,

376
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,120
 but encouraging one another,

377
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,200
 and all the more as you see the day approaching.

378
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,680
 Mark, I'm about to say something

379
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,240
 that is probably gonna,

380
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,000
 that could potentially lead to saying,

381
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,960
 we wanna cancel your December visit.

382
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:02,880
 Folks, what excuses are we making?

383
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:10,720
 People at home, what excuses are you making

384
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,680
 that seem like a good enough excuse

385
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,020
 to forsake meeting together?

386
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:28,760
 There are people all around the world,

387
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:33,480
 COVID or not, who have imminent threats to their life,

388
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:38,720
 and they are still meeting together.

389
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,720
 I think it's time that a lot of people,

390
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,720
 the church needs to repent for all the excuses

391
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,560
 that they make for not meeting together.

392
00:22:50,560 --> 00:23:01,400
 I'm gonna say it right here, enough is enough.

393
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:10,120
 Mark, people need to just give up their membership

394
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,480
 and say, you know what, I'm not coming back.

395
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,640
 Stop making excuses.

396
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,240
 Stop saying it's gonna be next month,

397
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,520
 or when the next wave of COVID is passed,

398
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:22,680
 or whatever it is, when my toe doesn't hurt anymore,

399
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,840
 or when I get a new pair of pants

400
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,520
 that I can wear to church.

401
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,460
 Let's stop making excuses.

402
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:31,440
 Gather together.

403
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,080
 Let's stop forsaking the meeting together.

404
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,920
 How are we gonna spur each other on

405
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,940
 when we are not together?

406
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:45,640
 How?

407
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:50,280
 How are we gonna encourage each other

408
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,660
 when we're not meeting together?

409
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:59,720
 The church faced all kinds of dangers.

410
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,720
 And you know, I always find it interesting

411
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,720
 when I speak to my friends who come from places

412
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,280
 where the church was severely persecuted,

413
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:12,600
 and you're one of them, people who come from China,

414
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,960
 people who come from Vietnam, Romania,

415
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:20,360
 and so many other countries around the world.

416
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:25,120
 You know when it's the most dangerous to be a Christian?

417
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,640
 When you're meeting together.

418
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,880
 It is.

419
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,880
 And yet they still do everything possible

420
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,380
 to meet together.

421
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:44,880
 Because they know that there is a day coming

422
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,880
 when the Lord will return,

423
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,400
 and he will set all things right.

424
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,920
 The earth will be his footstool.

425
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,000
 He will sit on his throne as the righteous judge,

426
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,460
 and all will be well.

427
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:02,980
 And those who are members of his body,

428
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:06,420
 those whose names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life,

429
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,820
 have nothing to worry about.

430
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:13,020
 We encourage each other towards that day.

431
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:16,340
 I know it's hard right now, I know you're suffering right now

432
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:20,580
 but the day is coming when Jesus will make all things right.

433
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:26,900
 Let's hold firm to our hope together.

434
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,920
 Let's hang on to his promises together.

435
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:33,740
 Let's spur each other on to good works.

436
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:37,100
 Let's spur each other on towards love,

437
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:41,220
 not giving up meeting together.

438
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:50,900
 You know in Acts chapter two, verse 42,

439
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:54,180
 there's this description of the church.

440
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:57,260
 They devoted themselves to the apostles' teachings

441
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:00,660
 and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer.

442
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:04,140
 Everyone was filled with awe at the many wonders

443
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,620
 and signs performed by the apostles.

444
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:10,480
 All the believers were together and had everything in common.

445
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,460
 They sold property and possessions

446
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:16,140
 to give to anyone who had need.

447
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:19,040
 Every day they continued to meet together

448
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,320
 in the temple courts.

449
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,340
 They broke bread in their homes

450
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:26,460
 and ate together with glad and sincere hearts,

451
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,940
 praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people

452
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:32,740
 and the Lord added to their number daily

453
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,600
 those who were being saved.

454
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,980
 Until the Lord returns,

455
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:43,000
 the church is encouraged by being united.

456
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,540
 They encourage each other when they are united

457
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:50,220
 by being together.

458
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:55,020
 Don't forsake gathering as some are in the habit of doing.

459
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,220
 Yes, worship together on Sundays

460
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:59,900
 and yes, study the word together on Mondays

461
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:03,580
 and then yes, break bread and pray together on Tuesdays

462
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:07,300
 and let's make sure that every day of the week

463
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:11,020
 we are sharing and caring, then breaking bread again.

464
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:17,460
 Let's make sure that we keep worshiping together,

465
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:20,100
 encouraging each other, spurring each other on

466
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,420
 towards love and good works.

467
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:26,500
 Do this until the day of the Lord.

468
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,740
 The gathering of believers,

469
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:33,500
 which is what the word church literally means,

470
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,880
 ecclesia means gathering,

471
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:41,280
 it should give us a taste of heaven.

472
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:45,780
 I'm not overstating that,

473
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:48,720
 it should give us a foretaste of heaven.

474
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,260
 Gloria and I, my wife and I,

475
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:54,540
 we experienced that when we were in seminary.

476
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:58,300
 Wow, how amazing it is to be in a place

477
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:02,060
 where everybody's kind of running in the same direction.

478
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:06,540
 And then we've experienced that in churches

479
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,680
 we've been members of.

480
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,500
 We've experienced that when we're surrounded

481
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,540
 by like college students,

482
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:15,180
 when we were going to college together

483
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:18,220
 and all the different things that college students go through

484
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:21,700
 and we're all running together because of Jesus.

485
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:27,860
 An urban voice, 2.0,

486
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:32,400
 can and does experience this foretaste of heaven too.

487
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:39,500
 Experience Jesus and all his benefits.

488
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:47,260
 And so many of those are right here in the body of Christ.

489
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:53,020
 Right here in the body of Christ.

490
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:55,820
 I'm gonna ask you to bow your heads with me and pray.

491
00:28:55,820 --> 00:29:06,020
 I wanna give you a chance to just tell God

492
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:12,620
 how thankful you are for the gospel of Jesus Christ.

493
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:18,700
 And if you don't know Jesus,

494
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,900
 then you don't yet have that to be thankful for.

495
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:31,140
 But if you wanna experience the power of the gospel

496
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:35,860
 to change your life, to give meaning to your life,

497
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:39,460
 have you been wondering about your own identity?

498
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:42,400
 Who am I and why am I here?

499
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,180
 What's the meaning of all this?

500
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:47,820
 Jesus has that answer.

501
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,280
 He is the answer.

502
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:53,180
 And I'm inviting you to come,

503
00:29:53,180 --> 00:30:00,100
 come, taste and see how good Jesus is.

504
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:12,780
 And you can pray something like this.

505
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:18,280
 God, I don't need that preacher to tell me I'm a sinner.

506
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:24,460
 I know there's so much wickedness in my heart.

507
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:26,840
 There is rebellion in my heart.

508
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,980
 There is hate in my heart.

509
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:35,160
 There's jealousy in my heart.

510
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:41,060
 There are all these things that I wish were not there,

511
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,200
 but it's true.

512
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,380
 There's so much sin in my heart.

513
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:50,500
 And I cannot carry it anymore.

514
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,820
 I cannot carry that guilt anymore.

515
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:58,420
 And I'm asking you, Jesus, I'm trusting you by faith

516
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:02,900
 that you will relieve me, you will save me from that guilt.

517
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:06,740
 And that's not all.

518
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:13,460
 That you will unite me with the creator of the world,

519
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:17,980
 the one who knit me together in my mother's womb,

520
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:21,060
 the one who has fearfully and wonderfully made me,

521
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:25,580
 that I can know my creator, the God of the universe.

522
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:31,800
 Lord Jesus, I want to know you.

523
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:37,940
 I want to be a child of God.

524
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:42,140
 Forgive me for my sin.

525
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:44,380
 Forgive me for my offenses.

526
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:50,620
 And declare me by faith, declare me righteous,

527
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:53,200
 pure, and holy.

528
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:59,600
 And God, would you show me the new life that you promise?

529
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,080
 The new life today and tomorrow,

530
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,300
 but also the new life that comes

531
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,840
 when the day of the Lord comes,

532
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,840
 when all things are made right,

533
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:14,420
 that on that day I will be counted

534
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:17,360
 among the children of God too.

535
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:28,500
 Thank you for Jesus, the perfect high priest

536
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:32,980
 who laid his own life down on the cross for me,

537
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:38,280
 paying the penalty for my sin,

538
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:41,580
 although he was without sin.

539
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:46,360
 And thank you that he proved

540
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:49,440
 that he even has power over death

541
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,940
 when he rose again on the third day.

542
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:59,560
 And I join the body of Christ, the church,

543
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,960
 the people who are around me, my brothers and sisters,

544
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,080
 in longing and waiting for that day,

545
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,580
 the day of the Lord, when you will return.

546
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:13,140
 And you will claim me as your own.

547
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:20,840
 God, as Urban Voice Community Church continues forward,

548
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:24,880
 I pray that you will bring them

549
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,100
 into a new season of fruitfulness,

550
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:34,760
 a season where many, many hear the good news

551
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,680
 and come to faith.

552
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:41,680
 People who speak English and Mandarin and Cantonese

553
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:46,340
 speak all manners of languages

554
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:49,280
 that are around us in Chicagoland,

555
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:52,480
 so many, too many to count,

556
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,880
 that they will hear the good news

557
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,520
 and they too will be saved.

558
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:01,760
 Lord, protect this church

559
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:08,120
 because there is an evil one who roars

560
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:13,480
 and he is like a lion looking for whom he might devour.

561
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:19,860
 But we know that we have Jesus.

562
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:24,860
 The Bible calls him the Lion of Judah, a greater lion.

563
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:30,120
 And we ask you, Lord, hold your church together.

564
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:33,820
 Unite us under Jesus.

565
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:37,960
 Lord, as we go to lunch today,

566
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,440
 I'm just gonna pray it right now.

567
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,400
 Let us have a great meal together and great fellowship.

568
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,440
 Thank you for the bounty that will be on the table.

569
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:52,320
 Thank you for the bounty that is around the table,

570
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,640
 the family of God.

571
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,080
 Lord, we praise you, we celebrate you.

572
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,320
 We thank you for the cross.

573
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,640
 We thank you that because of Jesus,

574
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:06,980
 we are a family, the Urban Voice family.

575
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:10,240
 And it's in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
