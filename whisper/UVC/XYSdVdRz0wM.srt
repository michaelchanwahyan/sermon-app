1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
上一次我們提過出埃及這件事

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,400
是在公元前1500至1200年間發生

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,400
當時的世界都是面臨史無前例的動盪

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,800
近東有很多人正在遷徙移居

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,000
想找一個安居之所

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
我們舉個例子就是海人Sea People

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,600
其中一組人就是菲利士人Philistines

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:33,000
在大歷史圖畫中以色列人是其中一群在遷徙

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,200
他們在埃及被欺壓多年

10
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,200
離開時前無去路後有追兵

11
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,800
但有特別的地方是他們發現上帝親自帶領他們

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,800
對於今天你和我面對社會政局的不穩

13
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,800
有一種被迫的感覺流散在世界不同的地方

14
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,400
同樣面對很多改變身份改變和未知之數

15
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:04,200
這樣看出埃及這個故事對我們來說是非常切身

16
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,200
但當我們看出埃及這個技術時

17
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,600
我們一定要梳理一下歷史的問題

18
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,600
為什麼呢?因為在舊約聖經中

19
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,600
經常提到出埃及這件歷史事蹟

20
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,400
可以這樣說在舊約歷史中出埃及這件事

21
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,600
就有如新約的耶穌基督從死裡復活

22
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,400
歷史性都是這麼重要

23
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:32,600
但在過去幾十年越來越多人質疑

24
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,800
為什麼沒有證據證明出埃及這件事

25
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:42,200
或者可能出埃及是很後期虛構的故事

26
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,800
我記得好幾年前在香港電台上受過訪問

27
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,800
主持人問了一個問題很有道理

28
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:55,800
他說出埃及這麼大件事總會有少少線索

29
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,200
居然一點線索都沒有

30
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,400
有些道理我們必須承認

31
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,600
暫時到現在都沒有直接的歷史證明

32
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,800
但我們這樣說也好

33
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,600
我們都需要留意幾點

34
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,200
第一就是證據的不存在

35
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,400
不一定等於不存在的證據

36
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,400
這個你動高床板就要想一想

37
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,800
The absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence

38
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,800
因為很多歷史事跡

39
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,000
包括聖經或聖經以外的歷史事跡

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,800
都未必找到考古的證據

41
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,400
我們不能夠踏時光機回去以前

42
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,800
將歷史放在化驗室裡面去證明多一次

43
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,800
何況當時的背景

44
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,400
埃及帝國是獨裁的政權

45
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,800
他們不會將失敗的事跡寫下

46
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,200
第二件事我們需要留意

47
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,200
當我們想起考古證據的時候

48
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,200
我們對考古證據的要求一定要實際

49
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,600
假設以色列人出埃及的話

50
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,400
你想一下他們會帶著什麼

51
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,400
他們好像難民一樣離開埃及

52
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,400
我不知道你有沒有做過服務難民的工作

53
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,800
我記得有一次我參與一個難民服務的工作

54
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:20,800
去到機場接一家六口從剛果難民營來的難民

55
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,600
六個人他們入境下機的時候

56
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,800
每個人你想一下他們帶著什麼

57
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,200
他們只是帶著一個小的膠袋

58
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,800
就是這麼多

59
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,400
所以你再想一想

60
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,200
作為難民甚至作為平民百姓也好

61
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,000
過了一百年之後

62
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,400
你看我們這班平民百姓的人

63
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,800
都一定是蕭聲匿跡的

64
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,800
就是說在考古歷史裡面是看不到我們的

65
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,600
所以為什麼有這麼多皇帝想建皇陵

66
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,200
大墳墓有兵馬俑金字塔等等

67
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,800
因為他們想留芳百世

68
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:00,000
所以沒有考古證據不代表你不存在

69
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
再有一點需要留意

70
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,200
如果你真的按照聖經所說

71
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,000
以色列人在埃及裡面住了好幾代

72
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,400
如果他們出埃及的時候

73
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,400
你想一下他們帶著什麼實物出來

74
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,000
衣服、瓷器、日用品等等

75
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,800
但這些全部的東西

76
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,000
都必定是埃及製造的

77
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,600
是在埃及製造的

78
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,000
所以他們到曠野就算留下這些實物

79
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,200
我們找到的

80
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,600
我們只會當有一班埃及人

81
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,600
他們經過留下過

82
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,200
舉個很簡單的例子

83
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,400
我的子女都是在美國出生長大的

84
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,600
我看遍他們擁有的實物

85
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:47,600
我找不到哪一樣可以直接表明他們是華裔第二代

86
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,400
除了他們現在在生的樣子

87
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,000
像亞裔的人

88
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,400
但他們說話、吃東西、想的東西

89
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,000
都是美國本土化的

90
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,200
所以我想如果他們真的化了灰的話

91
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,000
他們的實物跟其他白人、黑人

92
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
這裡的美國人是沒有任何分別的

93
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,800
所以我們對考古證據的要求

94
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,600
是需要實際一點的

95
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,000
我們不會找到一塊石頭

96
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,400
上面寫著摩西到此一遊

97
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:30,000
你說沒有直接的歷史考古證據

98
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,400
是不是就這樣算了

99
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,600
其實也不是的

100
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,200
在歷史的探索裡面

101
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,000
我們再問一個問題

102
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,600
有沒有間接性的、情況性的、背景的旁證

103
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,600
即是circumstantial background的evidence

104
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,800
如果這樣問的話

105
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,200
可能真的有

106
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,200
因為如果出埃及記

107
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,200
真的是後期虛構著作

108
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,000
即是到波斯時代、公元前500年的時候才寫

109
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,600
他的描述裡面一定會用一些後期的字眼

110
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,200
但是如果出埃及記

111
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,800
真的寫當時的歷史事跡

112
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,400
他的描述一定是配合當時的語言

113
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,200
當時的環境

114
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,400
如果是這樣的話

115
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,800
歷史可靠性就會高很多

116
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,000
你問前前後後

117
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
又說早期又後期的描述

118
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,800
好像很難明白、很抽象

119
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,800
其實一點都不難明白

120
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,400
我播一下一個短片

121
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,400
你就知道有什麼問題

122
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,600
是,駱Sir

123
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,600
失憶的大軍要二十天才到達白里浦

124
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,800
但每日的軍餉二十萬兩

125
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,600
我們的國庫已經所剩無幾

126
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,200
浸暫時不能給太多

127
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,200
為今之計

128
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,600
只要交了十五、十六和十七這三天的軍餉

129
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,400
其他的就慢慢想辦法

130
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,200
駱Sir,讓盧平替你換一盆熱水

131
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,400
周兄長,跟浸再檢查一下

132
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,400
看各地各省還有沒有人欠稅

133
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,000
浸要把水行一次過追回來

134
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
實不相似

135
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,200
明眼人一看就明白

136
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,600
因為浸是不會用check這個字

137
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,600
看起來好像很好笑

138
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,400
但其實這裡點出了一樣東西

139
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:10,000
就是如何鑒定一個歷史文件可靠性的原則

140
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
古話說出埃及記

141
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,400
如果歷史可靠的話

142
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:18,600
它裡面的描述一定是吻合公元前1500至1000年之間

143
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,600
那時是New Kingdom Period

144
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,600
是古埃及帝國的新王國時期

145
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,400
那時是埃及最後輝煌的時期

146
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,000
看當時埃及的歷史文件

147
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,600
用什麼字眼

148
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,200
描述什麼地理

149
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,200
然後再比對一下

150
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:42,200
出埃及記我們就知道歷史的可靠性

151
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,800
舉幾個例子

152
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,800
出埃及記一章第十一節

153
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,000
於是埃及人派督公管轄他們

154
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,200
即是以色列人

155
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,200
加重他們的負擔和害他們

156
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,200
他們為法老建造兩座積火城

157
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,400
就是彼東和蘭室

158
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,800
使他們因做苦工覺得命苦

159
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,400
無論和禮 造磚 做田間各樣的工

160
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,800
在一切的工上都嚴嚴待他們

161
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,600
這裡細緻的描述

162
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,000
造磚 和禮和一切的工

163
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,400
我帶你去一個埃及的墓穴

164
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,800
叫做Tomb of Rekhmire

165
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,000
雷克米爾墓穴

166
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
這個人是公元前15世紀

167
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,600
即是1400多年的時候

168
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,800
在埃及做大官

169
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,600
在他的墓穴有很多壁畫

170
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,800
裡面描述很多奴隸

171
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,400
包括戰俘

172
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,400
他們在田間做很多事

173
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:49,600
這個跟出埃及記的描述非常吻合

174
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,000
你看到圖畫這一部分

175
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,200
有人在池裡取水

176
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,600
有些奴隸在和禮

177
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,800
有些在造磚

178
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,400
包括田間各樣的工作

179
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,400
細緻地看的時候

180
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:12,400
埃及的督工是拿著木棒來管轄他們

181
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,200
另一方面我們可以看地理

182
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,600
一章第十一節

183
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,600
兩座積火城

184
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,000
叫彼東和蘭室

185
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,400
蘭室是法老的名字

186
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,400
有一個很出名的法老王

187
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,600
叫蘭室二世 或蘭室大帝

188
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,600
Ramesses II

189
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,000
蘭室城真的存在

190
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,200
Ramesses 或 Ramesses

191
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,000
在舊約聖經裡只提過五次

192
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,600
都是在摩西五經裡提過

193
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,600
而我們知道蘭室城

194
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,600
Pyramuses 城市

195
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,400
在埃及的文獻裡出現過

196
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:56,600
也是蘭室二世的法老所建的京都

197
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,600
說起蘭室二世的法老

198
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,800
他就很有名

199
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,200
因為很多人都認為

200
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,800
這個很可能是出埃及的法老

201
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,200
但說到考古

202
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,400
蘭室城我們知道的

203
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,000
只有二百年的歷史

204
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,600
由公元前1270至1070年之間

205
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,200
為什麼最後會被荒廢呢

206
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,200
因為當時利羅河在三角洲平地經常改道

207
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,400
利羅河對埃及人來說

208
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,600
是很重要的

209
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,400
等於今天的高速公路

210
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:36,200
交通 貿易 軍事的輸流都是靠利羅河

211
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,600
所以利羅河改道

212
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,200
城市在兩百年之後就被荒廢

213
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,600
埃及人很會復原

214
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:49,600
他們就把本身在蘭室城的石碑

215
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,200
有蘭室二世的名字的石碑

216
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,000
搬到北面十二英里

217
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,800
建另外一個城鎮

218
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,000
那個城鎮叫索安

219
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,800
Zoan 或希臘文是丹尼斯

220
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:09,000
說起索安城或丹尼斯

221
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
如果你記得或接觸過

222
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,200
1981年有一套電影叫《奪寶奇兵》

223
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,800
In the End of Jones' Waders of the Lost Ark

224
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,000
裡面提及過丹尼斯的古城

225
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,800
電影裡的橋段是二次大戰時

226
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,800
德國納粹黨要法國考古學家

227
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:36,800
去丹尼斯索安找藥櫃

228
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,800
你看看以下短短兩三分鐘的片段

229
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,800
你告訴我有什麼真有虛構

230
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,800
Dr. Jones, I've heard a great deal about you.

231
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,800
Have you?

232
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,800
Professor of Archaeology,

233
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,800
Expert on the occult,

234
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,800
and I just want to say it,

235
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,800
obtainer of rare antiquities.

236
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,800
One way of saying it,

237
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,800
why don't you sit down,

238
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,800
you'll be more comfortable.

239
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,800
Thank you.

240
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,800
Yes, you're a man of many talents.

241
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,800
You studied under Professor Ravenwood

242
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,800
at the University of Chicago.

243
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,800
Yes, I did.

244
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,800
Dr. Jones, you must understand

245
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,800
that this is all strictly confidential.

246
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,800
I understand.

247
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,800
Yesterday afternoon,

248
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,800
our European sections intercepted

249
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,800
a German communique

250
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,800
that was sent from Cairo to Berlin.

251
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,800
You see, over the last two years,

252
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,800
the Nazis have had teams of archaeologists

253
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,800
running around the world

254
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,800
looking for all kinds of religious artifacts.

255
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,800
Hitler's a nut on the subject.

256
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,800
He's crazy.

257
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,800
He's obsessed with the occult.

258
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,800
And right now,

259
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,800
apparently there's some kind of

260
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,800
German archaeological dig

261
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,800
going on in the desert

262
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,800
outside of Cairo.

263
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,800
We've got some information here,

264
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,800
but we can't make anything out of it,

265
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,800
and maybe you can.

266
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,800
Tannis Development Proceeding

267
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,800
Acquire Headpiece

268
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,800
Staff of Ra

269
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,800
Abner Ravenwood, U.S.

270
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,800
Nazis have discovered Tannis.

271
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,800
What does that mean to you, Tannis?

272
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,800
Well, the city of Tannis

273
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,800
is one of the possible resting places

274
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,800
of the Lost Ark.

275
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,800
The Lost Ark?

276
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,800
Yes, the Ark of the Covenant,

277
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,800
the chest the Hebrews used to carry

278
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,800
around the Ten Commandments.

279
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,800
What do you mean, Ten Commandments?

280
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,800
You're talking about the Ten Commandments?

281
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,800
Yes, the actual Ten Commandments,

282
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,800
the original stone tablets

283
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,800
that Moses brought down out of Mount Harab

284
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,800
and smashed, if you believe in that sort of thing.

285
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,800
Did you guys ever go to Sunday school?

286
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,800
Well, I...

287
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,800
No, look.

288
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,800
The Hebrews took the broken pieces

289
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,800
and put them in the Ark.

290
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,800
When they settled in Canaan,

291
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,800
they put the Ark in a place

292
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,800
called the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem,

293
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,800
where it stayed for many years

294
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,800
until all of a sudden, whoosh, it's gone.

295
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,800
Where?

296
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,800
Well, nobody knows where or when.

297
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,800
However, an Egyptian pharaoh...

298
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,800
Sisak.

299
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,800
Yes, invaded the city of Jerusalem

300
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,800
around about 980 B.C.,

301
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,800
and he may have taken the Ark

302
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,800
back to the city of Tannis

303
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,800
and hidden it in a secret chamber

304
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,800
called the Well of Souls.

305
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,800
Secret chamber?

306
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,800
However, about a year after

307
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,800
the pharaoh had returned to Egypt,

308
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,800
the city of Tannis was consumed by the desert

309
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,800
in a sandstorm which lasted a whole year,

310
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,800
wiped clean by the wrath of God.

311
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,800
What does this Ark look like?

312
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,800
I don't know.

313
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,800
There's a picture of it right here.

314
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:22,800
That's it.

315
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:30,800
Good God.

316
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,800
Yes, that's just what the Hebrews thought.

317
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,800
What's that supposed to be coming out of there?

318
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:41,800
Lightning, fire, power of God or something.

319
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:46,800
You don't understand Hitler's interest in it.

320
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,800
Oh, yes.

321
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,800
The Bible speaks of the Ark leveling mountains

322
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,800
and laying waste to entire regions.

323
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,800
An army which carries the Ark before it

324
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,800
is invincible.

325
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,800
What is the truth?

326
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,800
If you've been to Sunday School,

327
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,800
you'll know that there's a Ark.

328
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,800
And you'll know that

329
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,800
900 years before the Temple was built,

330
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,800
there was a pharaoh named Shishak.

331
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,800
He really attacked Jerusalem

332
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,800
and took away the treasures

333
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,800
from the Temple and the palace.

334
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,800
This is what the 14th chapter of the Book of Kings

335
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,800
has told us.

336
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,800
The Ark's whereabouts

337
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,800
is another big topic.

338
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,800
We won't talk about it today.

339
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,800
But anyway,

340
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,800
when it comes to Tennis,

341
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,800
Denis, Soin, Zouan,

342
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,800
these cities,

343
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,800
it's true that since 1928,

344
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,800
the French archaeologists

345
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,800
have been excavating.

346
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,800
They've been doing it for years.

347
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,800
In the early years,

348
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,800
the French archaeologists

349
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,800
thought that Soin, Zouan, and Tennis

350
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,800
were the epicenter of the Egyptian War.

351
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,800
They found the remains of the dead

352
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,800
and the stone tablets.

353
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,800
But now they know that it's not true.

354
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,800
Soin and Tennis

355
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,800
are an ancient city of 1,000 years.

356
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,800
But they were built in 1070.

357
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,800
So it's a post-historical city.

358
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,800
The later books of the Bible

359
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,800
also mention Soin and Tennis.

360
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,800
In the 12th chapter of the 78th chapter of the Book of Psalms,

361
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,800
it says that God was in Soin,

362
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,800
the fields of Soin,

363
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,800
the fields of Tennis,

364
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,800
and was doing a miracle

365
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,800
in front of the Pharaoh.

366
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,800
This is very important.

367
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,800
The 78th chapter of the Book of Psalms

368
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,800
is about the plague in Egypt.

369
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,800
But it says that the place where the plague happened

370
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,800
was Soin, not Nanset.

371
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,800
So when the poet wrote this poem,

372
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,800
he recalled the plague.

373
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,800
He wrote it after 4,500 years

374
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,800
after the plague.

375
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,800
At that time, Nanset had already ceased to exist.

376
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,800
So the poet only knew

377
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,800
that the plague had happened

378
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,800
in the city of Soin near Nanset.

379
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,800
But when you go back to the time of the plague,

380
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,800
you see the details of the geography

381
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,800
mentioning Nanset.

382
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,800
This town really existed at that time.

383
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,800
So when it was recorded,

384
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,800
the reliability of history was shown.

385
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,800
You may think it is very complicated.

386
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,800
But it is not complicated at all.

387
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,800
It is also very simple.

388
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,800
For example,I have lived in Chicago for 20 years.

389
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,800
I only know the geographical location and geography

390
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,800
of Chicago in the past 20 years.

391
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,800
You can ask some old Chinese here.

392
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,800
They can tell you that

393
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,800
40 or 50 years ago,

394
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:53,800
the name of the restaurant in the same place

395
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,800
was "Meng".

396
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,800
Today we have really determined

397
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,800
the location of Nanset.

398
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,800
It is a small village in Alibaba

399
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,800
called Cantia.

400
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,800
Here we find the stone wall of Nanset.

401
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,800
It also has its royal name.

402
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,800
There are Nanset's great soldiers on the stone wall.

403
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,800
They are attacking its enemies.

404
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,800
It is said that the Bible often mentions

405
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,800
the new-made shield of the great man.

406
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,800
It is the political idiom

407
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,800
that the French used at that time.

408
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,800
In Nanset,we also find

409
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,800
the military horse-drawn carriage.

410
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,800
There are also many large stones for horse-drawn carriages.

411
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,800
It is estimated that the horse-drawn carriage

412
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,800
can stop 500 horses

413
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,800
and more than 200 chariots.

414
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,800
 Nanset is estimated to be

415
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,800
as large as 10 square kilometers.

416
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,800
Now it is a field.

417
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:57,800
But it was the largest city in the world at that time.

418
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,800
The Egyptian Bible also contains

419
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,800
many special idioms and words

420
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,800
that the Egyptians used at that time.

421
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,800
But there is no word for the Persian period.

422
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,800
On the contrary,the books written later

423
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,800
such as the Book of Ezekiel and the Book of Nehemiah

424
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,800
often contain Persian words.

425
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:37,800
We have just spent about 15 minutes

426
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,800
to talk about the historical reality

427
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,800
of the Egyptian Bible.

428
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,800
We don't need to doubt it.

429
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,800
Now we can see

430
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,800
the Egyptian route of the Israelites.

431
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,800
How did God lead the Israelites to Egypt?

432
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,800
They set out from Nanset.

433
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,800
In the 13th chapter of chapter 17,

434
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,800
it is mentioned that when Pharaoh went there with his people,

435
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,800
the roads to Philistine were narrow.

436
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,800
God did not lead them where to go.

437
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,800
Because God said,

438
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,800
"I am afraid that when the people see the battle,

439
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,800
they will regret it and turn back to Egypt."

440
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,800
So God led the people to go astray

441
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,800
and went the way of the Red Sea.

442
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:24,800
Here is a road called the road to Philistine.

443
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,800
This road was also mentioned

444
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,800
in the Egyptian documents at that time.

445
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,800
The other name of Egypt is

446
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,800
the Way of Horus.

447
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,800
It is the way of Horus, the Egyptian god.

448
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:45,800
The way to Philistine was the most convenient way.

449
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,800
It took a few days to reach the land of Philistine.

450
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,800
But the Bible says

451
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:56,800
God did not lead the Israelites to the fastest way.

452
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,800
Why?

453
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,800
Because God said,

454
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,800
"I am afraid that when the people see the battle,

455
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:07,800
they will regret it and turn back to Egypt."

456
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,800
 This is a good example.

457
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:15,800
On the road to the northwest of the Mediterranean,

458
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:20,800
we found a lot of soldiers from the New Kingdom.

459
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,800
 More than ten soldiers.

460
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:27,800
 There were Egyptian war horses on this road

461
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,800
to guard the land.

462
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,800
It was a military stronghold.

463
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,800
So the Bible tells us

464
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:38,800
that if the Israelites took this shortest way,

465
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,800
they would not have been well equipped

466
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,800
and would not have fought well.

467
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,800
They would have regretted it and turned back to Egypt.

468
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,800
The way God led people to go

469
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,800
was not necessarily the shortest and fastest.

470
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,800
It was not necessarily our plan.

471
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,800
Sometimes it was not even in line with the law.

472
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,800
The other way to Egypt

473
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:05,800
was the way to the shore in the Bible.

474
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,800
This is what we saw in Genesis.

475
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,800
Do you remember the story?

476
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,800
When Haggai went out,

477
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:15,800
he walked on the way to the shore.

478
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,800
So the Israelites started from Lancester

479
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,800
and walked to the southeast.

480
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,800
 According to the Bible,

481
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,800
they should have gone out of Egypt through the Shu'i Basin

482
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,800
and then went to Galilee.

483
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,800
But what did the 14th chapter say?

484
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,800
 It said, "And suddenly there was a great storm.

485
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,800
And God commanded the Israelites to turn back."

486
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,800
It means to go north.

487
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,800
They went to the sea of ​​red.

488
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,800
It was actually in front of the sea of ​​grass.

489
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,800
The Israelites were afraid of the storm.

490
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,800
So they turned back to Egypt.

491
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,800
So they walked on the way to the south.

492
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,800
God suddenly called them to turn back.

493
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,800
Why?

494
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,800
When they were about to go out,

495
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,800
God called them to turn back.

496
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,800
What was God's will?

497
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,800
In the 14th chapter, verse 3,

498
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,800
God said, "And Pharaoh said,

499
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:14,800
 'The Israelites were lost on the ground,

500
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,800
and the wilderness had trapped them.'

501
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,800
 In the 14th chapter,

502
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,800
God said, "I will make Pharaoh's heart strong,

503
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,800
and he will chase them.

504
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,800
And then I will be glorified

505
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,800
in Pharaoh and his whole army."

506
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,800
The Egyptians knew that they were in the wilderness.

507
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,800
So the Israelites walked on.

508
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,800
God's command seems to be very complicated.

509
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,800
It's not humanly reasonable.

510
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,800
But what is the ultimate goal?

511
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,800
It is to be glorified to God.

512
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,800
God's purpose is not to make us feel sad and empty.

513
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,800
It's not that people think

514
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,800
they are doing well and that's it.

515
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,800
God's command is needed

516
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,800
to make us learn to trust Him.

517
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,800
 At the beginning, we said that

518
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,800
there are many changes in life.

519
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,800
 Especially in the pandemic,

520
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,800
we have encountered many unideal situations.

521
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,800
 We all want to go to an ideal place.

522
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,800
 We always say that we don't like this situation,

523
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,800
don't like this place,

524
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,800
don't like this context.

525
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,800
 So we want to walk away.

526
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,800
 We think that's OK.

527
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,800
 Of course, this is humanly reasonable.

528
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,800
 But this story seems to tell us

529
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,800
what is the most important thing in God's eyes.

530
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,800
 The most important thing is not what we think.

531
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,800
 Everything is fine and good.

532
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,800
 In chapter 14, verse 30,

533
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:47,800
 it says, "On that day, Jehovah saved the Israelites

534
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,800
and took the hands of the Egyptians."

535
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:53,800
 It says that they crossed the Red Sea.

536
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,800
 What did the Israelites see?

537
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,800
 They saw Jehovah's victory.

538
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,800
 What did the Israelites see?

539
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:03,800
 They saw Jehovah's great deeds to the Egyptians.

540
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,800
 They knew how to glorify Him,

541
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:10,800
 how to trust God and His divine power.

542
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,800
 When we encounter difficulties,

543
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:20,800
 we think that we are leaving this unideal situation.

544
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,800
 We are looking for an ideal place.

545
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:28,800
 If God really wants to lead us to our ultimate goal,

546
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,800
 without disasters, without worries, without sickness,

547
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,800
 we can retire and live happily,

548
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:41,800
 I think God is the most unsuccessful prophet.

549
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:46,800
 The most successful one should be Jehovah.

550
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,800
 Because in the Egyptian Empire,

551
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,800
 if you put your trust in Him, you can live in peace.

552
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,800
 So, you see, when the Israelites left Egypt,

553
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:59,800
 they were not able to enjoy their eternal peace.

554
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,800
 In fact, after the Israelites left Egypt,

555
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,800
 they crossed the Red Sea and the Sea of ​​Grass.

556
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,800
 It was a trial.

557
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,800
 Because God's purpose was to prepare us

558
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:17,800
 to become a group of people who were faithful to His will.

559
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,800
 This is the greatest blessing.

560
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,800
 The greatest blessing is not that we have no disasters, no sickness,

561
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,800
 no epidemic.

562
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,800
 The greatest blessing is that we can become the children of God,

563
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,800
 and be with Him.

564
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,800
 We can be so glorious

565
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,800
 that we can become people who serve God.

566
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,800
 We are now facing different disasters.

567
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,800
 Whether it is an epidemic or a downturn in life,

568
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,800
 we may need to ask

569
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,800
 whether we will still be loyal to God

570
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,800
 after these disasters and downturns.

571
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,800
 We just need to be there to answer the call.

572
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:55,800
 We have not learned to be more faithful to God.

573
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,800
 Or when we have passed the command of God,

574
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,800
 we will be more faithful to God.

575
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,800
 Personally, the same is true for the Church.

576
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:08,800
 God said, "Do not waste the path He has led us on."

577
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,800
 No matter what the disaster is,

578
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,800
 let us, the Church,

579
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,800
 be able to experience new lessons.

580
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,800
 Let us, the Church,

581
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:20,800
 become a Church that is more in line with His will.

582
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,800
 Some scholars said it was very interesting.

583
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,800
 They said, "The main thing that God wants to do in the Exodus

584
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:29,800
 is to take Israelite out of Egypt."

585
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:33,800
 God did not want to take the Israelites out of Egypt.

586
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,800
 After they left Egypt,

587
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,800
 they still had a heart for Egypt.

588
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,800
 They wanted to return to the Egyptian Empire

589
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,800
 because there was a stable and prosperous place.

590
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:53,800
 God wanted to take Egypt out of the Israelites

591
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,800
 and take the Pharaoh out of Egypt

592
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:03,800
 and take the Pharaoh out of Egypt

593
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,800
 and take away the idols

594
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,800
 like Moses,

595
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,800
 who was a prosperous man

596
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,800
 and a man of peace.

597
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,800
 So that we can truly return to God

598
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,800
 and be faithful to Him

599
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,800
 and serve Him,

600
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,800
 and be faithful to Him

601
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,800
 Are we willing to do that?

602
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,800
 Let God take away these idols

603
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,800
 and let our hearts truly return to Him.

604
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:36,800
 Let us pray with our hearts.

605
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,800
 God, we know that Your way

606
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,800
 and Your great command

607
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,800
 is not what we humans think.

608
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,800
 Your ultimate goal

609
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:49,800
 is to make our lives belong to You.

610
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,800
 God, we pray that You take away

611
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,800
 the things we long for in our lives

612
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,800
 like stability and prosperity

613
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:01,800
 and the benefits that the land can give us.

614
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:05,800
 God, let our lives truly belong to You.

615
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,800
 Let You be our true Lord.

616
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,800
 You continue to lead our lives

617
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,800
 and the path ahead of us.

618
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,800
 No matter what we are going through,

619
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,800
 let us know that the ultimate goal

620
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:24,800
 is not only to be free and carefree

621
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:28,800
 but to be faithful to You.

622
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,800
 Continue to train us,

623
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,800
 continue to help us,

624
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,800
 and nurture us

625
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,800
 so that we can become

626
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:37,800
 more fit for Your will.

627
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,800
 Let us pray.

628
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,800
 God bless you.
