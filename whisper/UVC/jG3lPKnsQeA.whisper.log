[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600]   from the word of God.
[00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.400]   - Thank you, James, thank you.
[00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.440]   Well, as you can see, I'm ready to fly,
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.480]   and the plane going to Israel for me
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.520]   is around five o'clock, I guess.
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.120]   I haven't checked, but we'll be there.
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.040]   And there was a connecting flight in Vienna,
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.920]   and we're gonna stay there, lay over for three, four hours,
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.880]   play some music in Vienna,
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.820]   and we're ready to go to Tel Aviv, all right?
[00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.840]   So yeah, thank you for praying for us,
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.060]   and I wanna say a note of thanks to the church
[00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.720]   and the leaders and the pastoral staff, especially,
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.320]   because all of the things that they are doing,
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.000]   trying to fill the gap while I'm gone,
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.160]   and it's very helpful,
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.320]   so that I can be sent to go to Israel
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.280]   to lead a group of people.
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.040]   And this round, we have 27 people in total.
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.040]   Only 10 people are from our church,
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.720]   and all the rest of the 17 are from Hong Kong, Canada,
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.380]   a lot of different places, yeah.
[00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.340]   Actually, a few of them already arrived,
[00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.000]   so thank God, all right?
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.680]   Thank God they already arrived safely, all right?
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.040]   I just got a text not too long ago.
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.000]   One of our members forgot to bring her credit card,
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.120]   and she had to go back home and grab the credit card
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.720]   before going to the airport.
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.040]   Yeah, that is very important.
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.960]   Trust me, going to Israel, you only need two things.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.880]   One is the valid passport, US passport,
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.560]   valid US passport or visa,
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.800]   and second thing is a credit card, all right?
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.760]   That's all you need, all right?
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.200]   You don't have to bring anything, just two things, right?
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.240]   Just a passport and a valid credit card,
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.280]   and then you'll be good, yeah.
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.600]   And yeah, I'm looking forward to this trip,
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.920]   and by the way, I'm not a tour guide.
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.160]   I don't charge, I don't get any tips, you know?
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.120]   I don't live off--
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.720]   - You should.
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.560]   - I should, right?
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.480]   I should, yeah, I should, I know, but I don't take it.
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.320]   I don't take it.
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.160]   I do it for, you know, as a service,
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.040]   as a teaching service to other people.
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.080]   So God has blessed us with some resources,
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.600]   and we can share with some other sisters and brothers
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.040]   in Christ, some other people who are interested.
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.120]   In fact, this round, we have 27 people.
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.200]   One person is a non-Christian,
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.200]   and he's just interested to go to Israel, right?
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.740]   Who's not interested to go to Israel, right?
[00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.720]   Yeah, it's exotic, exotic place, yeah, exotic place.
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.480]   Yeah, it's gonna have a lot of fun.
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.680]   I'm gonna buy you something, okay?
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.920]   I'm gonna buy you some ajava hand cream, okay?
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.160]   So you come back Tuesdays, I'll have a big bottle
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.160]   of ajava dead sea, dead sea extract hand cream, all right?
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.200]   How about that?
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.120]   Anyone?
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.920]   No, you don't want it?
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.120]   Do you want it or not?
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.560]   All right, all right, okay, I'll bring you something.
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.120]   I'll bring you something, all right?
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.520]   I'll bring you something we can share, okay?
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.440]   Lotion is welcome, all right?
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.120]   Anyways, I may bring you a bottle of water,
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.080]   you know, holy water from Jordan River.
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.400]   How about that?
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.560]   So yeah, right?
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.760]   And we can take that in the chameleon, right?
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:21.960]   Everyone can take a sip.
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.240]   It's good for your health, yeah.
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:30.200]   Anyways, we'll continue with our topic on worship.
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.040]   We talked a little bit about worship last week
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.040]   when Brenda was here, Sun Music was here.
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.600]   And I think it's appropriate to continue to think
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.720]   about what worship is all about.
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.720]   And I think in our generation, worship is a lost art.
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.640]   You know, if you think about it,
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.520]   when you come to church to worship,
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.440]   when you come to worship today,
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.840]   what did you do to prepare yourself?
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.000]   What did you do to prepare yourself to worship?
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.060]   All right, talk to your neighbor.
[00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.600]   How did you prepare for today's worship?
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.000]   What did you do?
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.840]   What did you do?
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.240]   What did you do?
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.800]   What exactly did you do, you know, okay?
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:23.520]   Maybe a cup of coffee,
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.520]   maybe, did you brush your teeth?
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.760]   Yes, I hope so.
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:33.000]   You change, and you walk into a place of worship,
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.120]   and you wanna offer praises to God.
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.500]   And as I said, worship is a lost art today.
[00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.940]   We take things for granted.
[00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.800]   We often approach worship with a mindset
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.120]   that we don't need to prepare.
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.400]   There's nothing for us to do
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.580]   to prepare ourselves to worship.
[00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.080]   When we think of preparation,
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.320]   we think of someone else is doing the preparation, right?
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.080]   The worship band, the worship people,
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.620]   they gotta prepare, right?
[00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.300]   Did they practice?
[00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.760]   Well, you can tell, right?
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.220]   They did practice, right?
[00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.160]   Couple days ago, they practiced here,
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.960]   and that's why we have a worship set, right?
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.280]   And in the backstage, they got the lyrics on,
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.800]   they got the cameras on, they got everything,
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.800]   PowerPoint and stuff like that,
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.880]   and the temperature of the room is just
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.680]   to a comfort of my level.
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.780]   There are many things we can think about,
[00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.320]   preparation of worship, but so often,
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.240]   we shift the focus to someone else
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.120]   doing the preparation for us.
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.940]   And for us to come to worship,
[00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.940]   we often think that we don't need to do anything to worship.
[00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:43.280]   You need to understand, some of the ancient architecture,
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.280]   when the ancient people, they built a temple,
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.800]   a place of worship, a sacred place, or ancient church,
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.440]   they always have stairs going up to a temple
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.400]   or a church building.
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.440]   And so often, you realize the architecture
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.780]   is a little interesting, because the steps going up
[00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.000]   to the place of worship, the sacred place,
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.720]   is often uneven steps, some longer, some shorter,
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.080]   and then some longer, some shorter.
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.440]   What are they trying to do?
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.960]   They're actually trying to design the building
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.120]   in such a way that when people, worshipers,
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.000]   approach the sacred place, they will approach
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.980]   with care and slowly.
[00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:32.360]   And that's why the steps are uneven at times.
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.120]   Those are called processional steps.
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.660]   So you have to be careful.
[00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.920]   Not every step is even.
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:44.360]   And you have to take care when you go up to the temple
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.960]   or go up to a sacred place.
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.400]   It's a matter of preparation.
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:54.600]   I have been to Israel so many times, since 2008.
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.280]   Sometimes I go there two times a year,
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.600]   sometimes once a year.
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:04.280]   I was fascinated by another culture,
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.480]   not so Western culture,
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:13.280]   how they approach this sort of sacred place,
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.040]   worship place.
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.680]   I remember one time, I was, a couple years ago,
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:22.680]   before the pandemic, I took a sabbatical
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.400]   a couple weeks off from the church,
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.840]   and I went with my wife to Israel,
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.600]   and we were on the Temple Mount.
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.080]   You know the Temple Mount, the golden thing?
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.080]   The golden dome?
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:35.920]   The golden dome?
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:36.760]   Yeah, the Temple Mount.
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.840]   So we went up to the Temple Mount,
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:43.080]   and then, of course, it's a beautiful place, right?
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.180]   And then we were trying to take pictures,
[00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:46.640]   and my wife was next to me,
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:50.540]   and I put my hand on her shoulder,
[00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:53.240]   and then trying to take a selfie, right?
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.960]   And then the security guard hit my hand.
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.500]   And say, "You don't do this here."
[00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:00.340]   I said, "What?"
[00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:06.980]   He said, "You don't display affection or intimacy
[00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:08.260]   "on the Temple Mount."
[00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:09.660]   I said, "What?"
[00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:12.540]   You know, I've never been to Israel.
[00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:15.460]   It was our first time going together as a couple, right?
[00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:18.540]   I've never been to a person I can put my hand around, right?
[00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.340]   So I just want to seize the moment, right?
[00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:24.340]   So I just take a selfie, and hit my hand really hard,
[00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:28.300]   and then say, "Give me your camera, or give me your phone.
[00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.240]   "Delete that picture.
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.980]   "Delete it right here, delete the picture."
[00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:32.820]   I said, "What?
[00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:33.880]   "Okay, don't shoot me, all right?
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:34.900]   (audience laughing)
[00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:36.480]   "I'll delete that picture.
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.500]   "Too bad, right?"
[00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:39.540]   And there was another time,
[00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:42.420]   you know, I was doing some YouTube video and all that.
[00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:43.700]   I'm doing my selfie, right?
[00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:44.740]   I have my selfie stick,
[00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:48.020]   and just outside of an ancient church building,
[00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:50.580]   I'm trying to record what this is,
[00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:52.660]   and give a short introduction,
[00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:54.940]   and then slowly I walk from outside
[00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:58.540]   into the ancient church building.
[00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:01.980]   I walk in, and it was so quiet, because no one was there.
[00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:06.240]   And I keep filming, you know, the ceiling,
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:11.020]   and all the side wall, and the church environment.
[00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:15.260]   And then a monk came after me and hit my head.
[00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:16.340]   (audience laughing)
[00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:17.940]   Hit my head right here.
[00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:20.140]   I said, "What is going on?"
[00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:24.540]   He said, "You don't wear hat in the church, all right?
[00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:26.360]   "You take off your hat."
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.860]   I said, "Okay, man, what's the big deal, right?"
[00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:31.740]   It's very interesting, right?
[00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:34.460]   You go to a Christian church in Israel,
[00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:37.900]   you take off your hat,
[00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.500]   but you go to a synagogue,
[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:43.720]   or Jewish, like Western Wall, Jewish sacred place,
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:47.420]   you have to put on your hat, or a kippur, right?
[00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.020]   The kippur, the Jewish, right?
[00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:50.000]   The Jewish man.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.940]   You know, my point is,
[00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:56.660]   I'm just fascinated by, in other culture,
[00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:01.660]   how they prepare themselves to worship, right?
[00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:04.100]   Now, of course, this sort of things,
[00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:07.980]   we modern people, or Western people,
[00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:09.820]   we try to laugh at, right?
[00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:11.100]   "What's the big deal, right?
[00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:11.940]   "What's the big deal?
[00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:15.400]   "I can wear a tank top, right?
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:16.440]   "To the church, right?
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.280]   "Yeah, right?
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:18.640]   "It's democracy.
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.140]   "It's freedom."
[00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:21.420]   No, you don't do that, right?
[00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:26.420]   So, as I prepare the people, 27 of us, to go to Israel,
[00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:29.380]   we had some Zoom online sessions
[00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:32.900]   to prepare ourselves to go.
[00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:36.860]   And one of the most frequent asked questions is,
[00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:39.260]   you know, what to wear, right?
[00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:40.700]   What to wear?
[00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:43.320]   You know, like this, what I'm wearing,
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:48.320]   I can go to anywhere, sacred place, synagogue, churches,
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.700]   any place, I can go, right?
[00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:52.980]   But you can't wear tank top.
[00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:57.980]   You can wear shorts, go into a church or a synagogue.
[00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:59.860]   So, it's a matter of preparation, right?
[00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:01.460]   Sometimes we've lost that.
[00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:03.820]   We lost that kind of, you know,
[00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:08.460]   the art of preparing ourselves to worship.
[00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:11.980]   Now, if you think about preparing for worship,
[00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:16.840]   preparing ourselves to go into the presence of God,
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:19.380]   there are many scriptures you can think of.
[00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:22.900]   Probably you can think of what Jesus said
[00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:24.100]   in Sermon on the Mount.
[00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:27.860]   In the sermon, Jesus said,
[00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:31.340]   "Before you offer sacrifice in the temple,
[00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:36.340]   "you have to be in a reconciling with your neighbors."
[00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:37.580]   Right?
[00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:40.140]   You gotta do something to prepare yourselves.
[00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:42.260]   And one of the things you need to do
[00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.980]   is to be at peace with your neighbors,
[00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:47.220]   as much as possible, right?
[00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:48.440]   As much as possible.
[00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:52.780]   The best of your ability to keep peace with other people
[00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:55.220]   before you approach God to worship.
[00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:57.780]   Now, one of the Psalms,
[00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:00.460]   there are 150 Psalms in the Book of Psalms.
[00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:05.300]   One of the Psalms that taught us about worship is 95.
[00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:06.140]   Okay?
[00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:06.960]   Psalm 95.
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:10.220]   It's equally divided.
[00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:13.260]   Very short, 11 verses, Psalm.
[00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.100]   First half, one to seven.
[00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:17.220]   First half right here.
[00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:21.080]   It's about who to worship and why we worship.
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:26.320]   And the second half is about the voice of God, right?
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:29.980]   Now, for worship song, it's very typical.
[00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:34.480]   It's very typical to begin with some call to worship.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.800]   Call to worship.
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.420]   Now, what call to worship means
[00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:40.420]   is that some sort of phrases or some things
[00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:44.680]   that the Psalmist singing
[00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:49.440]   or calling attention to the people of worship.
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:53.020]   Call for attention.
[00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:54.960]   It says what?
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:59.420]   Come, let us sing to the Lord.
[00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:01.800]   Let us shout joyfully to the rock of our salvation.
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.800]   Let us come to Him with thanksgiving.
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.740]   Let us sing Psalms of praise to Him.
[00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:09.580]   Can you trace how many,
[00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:13.480]   can you point out how many verbs there are?
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:14.840]   Come, right?
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:17.700]   Literally it means walk, right?
[00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:20.080]   Walk, physically you walk.
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:23.120]   You move yourself to some place.
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:26.240]   And then singing, shouting, right?
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:31.240]   Shouting in both Psalms is often victory, war cry.
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.600]   Victory.
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:34.900]   God is the victory.
[00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.200]   God has won the war for us.
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:41.680]   And it requires you to have some energy, right?
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:43.680]   Shout, right?
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:45.660]   It's an active verb.
[00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:49.200]   It's the active things that we do.
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.280]   And the call to worship so often
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:54.360]   will tell us why do we worship.
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:55.800]   The reasons for worship.
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.360]   Why do we come here?
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:58.840]   Have you ever asked yourself this question?
[00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:01.080]   Why do we come here, right?
[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:01.920]   Why do we come?
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:05.000]   It's more than a routine.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.140]   It's more than a spiritual habit
[00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:09.360]   that all Christians should have.
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:12.920]   It's so much more than a ritual that we do.
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:17.540]   It says we worship God who is great.
[00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:19.440]   And in fact, the greatest.
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:22.720]   For the Lord is the great God,
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:24.680]   great King above all gods.
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:26.440]   He is the greatest.
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:29.740]   He holds in his hands the depths of the earth,
[00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:32.800]   the highest of the mountains,
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:34.480]   the mightiest mountains,
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.640]   and the sea belongs to him,
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:39.200]   for he created it.
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:42.200]   His hands formed the dry land too.
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:45.480]   The depths of the earth,
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.840]   the lowest part of the world,
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:49.520]   which is the Dead Sea, by the way,
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:52.560]   in the land of Israel.
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.940]   And then the highest of the height, right?
[00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:57.880]   The highest mountain.
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:58.920]   And then the sea.
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:03.540]   So he's trying to capture the entire cosmos,
[00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:05.640]   which is under the creative power of God.
[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:10.800]   The sea, in an Eastern culture,
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.760]   Oriental culture,
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:15.360]   is the untamable forces.
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:18.040]   When you think of sea, the ocean,
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:19.980]   it's always unconquerable.
[00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:22.540]   It's untamable by man, right?
[00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:25.360]   A couple days ago,
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:29.200]   a deep sea research company
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:34.200]   produced a 3D scan of the Titanic, right?
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.580]   The unsinkable vessel.
[00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:41.900]   What year did it sink into the ocean?
[00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:43.460]   Atlantic?
[00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:44.380]   1912.
[00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:47.980]   That's like more than 100 years ago, right?
[00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:51.980]   So this event, this tragedy,
[00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:56.980]   has fascinated many people for so many years.
[00:15:56.980 --> 00:16:00.540]   And finally, we got some 3D scans.
[00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:05.540]   I think the company captured about 700 images
[00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:08.080]   from a deep sea scan.
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:10.140]   And it took about 200 hours
[00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:14.740]   for computer to compile them
[00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:19.140]   and create it into a 3D scan.
[00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:20.400]   That is the Titanic.
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:23.200]   1912, right?
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:26.460]   It's haunting images
[00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:28.780]   at the depth of the ocean.
[00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:32.300]   With today's modern technologies,
[00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:36.740]   we still feel that the sea, the ocean,
[00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:38.580]   is untamable, right?
[00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:41.260]   It's just haunting images, right?
[00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.180]   Yeah, can you,
[00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:46.740]   just can't imagine if you suffer
[00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:50.320]   from this sort of tragedy, right?
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.140]   Crazy.
[00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:54.260]   And this is a haunting image.
[00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:58.380]   So much more realistic than this,
[00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:00.240]   Jack and Rose, yeah.
[00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:06.300]   My point is, the creation is untamable, right?
[00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:09.820]   For even for modern culture,
[00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:11.900]   or for the culture of the Bible,
[00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:15.500]   the sea, the oceans, the highest of the mountain,
[00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:16.900]   the depths of the earth,
[00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:19.420]   we cannot conquer it,
[00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:23.820]   but God holds it in His power, right?
[00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:25.420]   God holds it in His power.
[00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:30.220]   All the forces that threaten our well-being
[00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:32.420]   is all under God's power.
[00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:35.940]   I attended a few funerals recently.
[00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:40.940]   One is younger than me.
[00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:43.500]   The other one is older than me.
[00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:48.820]   Even today, with our modern technology, right?
[00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:50.420]   Healing takes time,
[00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:53.300]   and sometimes it doesn't happen, right?
[00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:54.860]   No matter how much money you have,
[00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:56.860]   how much technology you have,
[00:17:56.860 --> 00:18:00.260]   no, we feel, we still feel,
[00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:03.660]   or we have to face the final enemy,
[00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:05.460]   the forces of death, right?
[00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:12.180]   But the Psalm says, "God holds everything in His power,
[00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:15.860]   "and He has power over you, power over me."
[00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:20.340]   The Psalm talks about the power of God, the Creator.
[00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:25.340]   And to many people, and to maybe your theology,
[00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:27.260]   your understanding of God,
[00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:30.300]   is that, okay, this powerful man is like some old guy,
[00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:32.940]   some old white guy out there, right?
[00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:35.220]   It's distant from us, it's like an absentee father.
[00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:37.340]   He created the world, boom, okay, it's right there,
[00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:39.660]   and that machine will continue to work
[00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:41.820]   according to His physical principles and all that.
[00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:42.660]   And then God, where is God?
[00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:44.340]   You know, God has nothing to do with us.
[00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:48.500]   You know, kind of deistic, you know, deism.
[00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:51.500]   It's not atheism, but deism, right?
[00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:56.740]   Some sort of deistic concept of God, and He's not here.
[00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:59.220]   But the Psalm says otherwise.
[00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:02.780]   The Psalm says God has everything to do with us.
[00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:07.140]   Listen to what the Psalm says, verse six and seven.
[00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:09.780]   "Come, let us worship and bow down.
[00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:14.780]   "Let us kneel before the Lord, our Creator, our Creator,
[00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:17.180]   "for He is our God."
[00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:19.180]   We have a relationship with Him.
[00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:21.740]   And we are the people He watches over.
[00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:23.800]   He takes care of us.
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:28.300]   We are like flock under His care, right?
[00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:31.900]   Notice how the verbs of worship going from action verbs,
[00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:36.140]   shouting, making praises, and dancing and all that,
[00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:40.340]   and finally come to stillness, bowing down,
[00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:44.580]   kneeling before Him, right, on our knees.
[00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:47.500]   Number seven is a familiar picture, right?
[00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:52.500]   God is His shepherd, and we are His flock, His sheep.
[00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:57.100]   Now, again, most of us, modern readers of the Bible,
[00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:00.980]   we don't know how to appreciate this kind of imagery.
[00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:03.860]   We always think of sheep and lambs, right?
[00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:05.460]   What do you think of?
[00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:06.700]   Food on the table, right?
[00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:09.660]   Cook and done well, right?
[00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:13.100]   Right, in a pot, and then we can consume it.
[00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.660]   You know, in the Oriental or Palestinian culture,
[00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:20.660]   or nomadic culture, you rarely sacrifice a lamb, right?
[00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:23.020]   Just like you don't sacrifice a dog, right?
[00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:24.140]   You don't.
[00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:26.580]   You pet it, you take care of it, right?
[00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:30.820]   They don't, they don't sacrifice a lamb.
[00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:32.580]   Very rarely that happens.
[00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:37.460]   Maybe once a year, in Passover, right, with deep meaning.
[00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:42.420]   To the first audience, to the Oriental people,
[00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:47.300]   shepherd and sheep, it's a tight relationship, right?
[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:52.140]   Shepherd and the sheep, because the sheep listens
[00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:55.240]   to the voice of the shepherd only.
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:58.300]   No one other than the shepherd.
[00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:02.140]   There was a news story some years ago.
[00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:07.140]   The Israeli army took over or captured some Palestinian lands
[00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:12.140]   and then they raided and they got all the properties
[00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:17.620]   they seized them, and one of those is a huge flock
[00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:20.580]   of sheep, hundreds of sheep.
[00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:25.580]   So the Israeli soldiers put all the sheep into the ranch.
[00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:30.580]   And how many of them?
[00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:35.680]   200 or 300 sheep in one ranch.
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:40.420]   And then a certain Palestinian shepherd came
[00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:43.540]   to the Israeli army and asked the soldier
[00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:47.220]   who's guarding the door of the ranch,
[00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:50.180]   and the shepherd said, "Can I have my sheep back?"
[00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:54.420]   And the Israeli soldier, "How many sheep do you have?"
[00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:58.060]   And the shepherd said, "I have 20, 25, 25 sheep
[00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:00.980]   "in the ranch."
[00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:03.020]   And this Israeli soldier, a young soldier,
[00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:07.220]   laughed at the Palestinian old guy, the shepherd,
[00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:08.820]   and said, "Well, you can try.
[00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:10.780]   "There are 300 sheep here.
[00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:12.220]   "Go ahead and find your own sheep.
[00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:14.420]   "Everyone looks the same, right?"
[00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:17.580]   And the shepherd walks to the door
[00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:20.220]   at the entrance of the ranch,
[00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:23.020]   and he started to raise his voice.
[00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:26.740]   It's like, "Come, come, come."
[00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:28.980]   Something like, "Yalla, yalla," right?
[00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:30.260]   You know what yalla is?
[00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:33.460]   Yalla is hurry up, Arabic, yeah.
[00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:34.300]   Yalla, yalla.
[00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:38.940]   And then, three, four minutes later,
[00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:42.380]   25 sheep came to the door,
[00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:48.060]   and the shepherd said, "These are my sheep."
[00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:49.180]   It's very interesting.
[00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:50.100]   All the rest of the sheep,
[00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:53.540]   they're just doing their dumb things.
[00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:55.700]   They don't listen to the voice of this shepherd,
[00:22:55.700 --> 00:23:00.380]   but this 20-some sheep followed the voice of the shepherd.
[00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:01.880]   It's a true story.
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:04.300]   (stammering)
[00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:08.600]   The sheep will listen to the voice of the shepherd.
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:11.560]   Remember Jesus said that, right, John 10?
[00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:13.600]   "I am the good shepherd,
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:16.520]   "and the sheep listens to my voice."
[00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:22.320]   And that's why this image of shepherd and sheep
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:24.200]   is a tight relationship.
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:26.600]   It's a relational metaphor,
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:30.000]   and that's why at the end of verse seven,
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.340]   it goes into another theme,
[00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:37.440]   not unrelated, it's actually very related,
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.640]   talking about the voice of God.
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:42.680]   If only you would listen to the voice of God,
[00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:43.940]   His voice today.
[00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:47.160]   The Lord says, "Do not harden your hearts
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:49.320]   "as Israel did at Meribah,
[00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:54.480]   "as they did at Masar in the wilderness.
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:56.640]   "For there your ancestors, your fathers,
[00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:59.960]   "tested me and tried my patience,
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:02.440]   "even though they saw everything I did.
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:04.880]   "For 40 years, for one entire generation,
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.560]   "I was angry with them,
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:11.360]   "and I said, 'They are a people whose hearts are hardened,
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:13.580]   "'turns away from me.
[00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:16.280]   "'They refuse to do what I tell them to do.'
[00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:19.440]   "So in my anger, I told and oath,
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:23.480]   "'They will never enter my place of rest.'"
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:26.760]   Now in the beginning, I said Psalm 95 had two parts, right?
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:29.560]   It's actually a pretty strange psalm, right?
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:32.120]   If you write a worship song today,
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:33.840]   you probably would end your song,
[00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:38.280]   like the chorus or the ending, on a positive note, right?
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:42.360]   You kind of wrap around, going back to, you know,
[00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:47.040]   what you call it, tonic, right?
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:50.780]   Yeah, you always end the song nicely.
[00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:53.240]   Psalm 95 doesn't do that.
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:57.200]   It opens with a joyful sound, making noises.
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:00.280]   "Come on, guys, make some noises, shout for joy
[00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:02.880]   "for our maker is here, we're gonna worship him."
[00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:04.760]   But then the second half, the ending,
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:08.920]   ends with a serious warning, a serious lesson, right?
[00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:15.400]   We often don't think a song is a good vehicle of education.
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:19.720]   We don't do that because a song
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:23.840]   usually is three, five minutes long, it's very short.
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:26.600]   But it can be a powerful vehicle
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:28.920]   for the message of God.
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:30.760]   When we think of the Old Testament stories,
[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:34.560]   or the entire Old Testament scripture,
[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:37.640]   39 books, if I asked you what stories
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:43.840]   would tell you the tension between God and Israel,
[00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:50.160]   what are some of the stories?
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:52.320]   The stories in the wilderness,
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:54.640]   when God saves his people by grace,
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:57.320]   out of the land of slavery, out of the land of Egypt,
[00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:59.600]   and he walked with them and led them
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:01.920]   through the wilderness for so many years,
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:03.920]   but after they came out of Egypt,
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:06.600]   they complained and they grumbled against God,
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:09.880]   and they distrust what God is doing.
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:13.960]   And God is patient, God is always long-suffering.
[00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:17.920]   Those are the stories you can think of.
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:20.840]   And in fact, that's what Psalm 95 does,
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:25.000]   to bring us back to the history of God's patience.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.400]   Now, so often we read through the Bible,
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:29.720]   we always get the impression,
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:32.240]   "Okay, God is so mean, right?
[00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:35.920]   "How can you have so mean of God, right?
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:38.760]   "And he doesn't like the people,
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:41.200]   "he yelled at the people," and all that, right?
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:43.320]   But if we read scripture like that,
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:46.960]   I think we are doing some selective reading,
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.120]   selective understanding.
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:52.280]   If you read the Bible, at least the Old Testament,
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:53.680]   or maybe you add the New Testament,
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:55.800]   the entire Bible, 66 books,
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:59.640]   you realize that the story is not about God's wrath,
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:04.120]   it's about God's grace, how God is so patient
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:06.640]   with those who are rebellious.
[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:10.560]   We rebel against him all the time,
[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:13.120]   but God is always patient, right?
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:17.200]   And Moses is always the mediator between the two, right?
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:19.520]   And God is always faithful.
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:22.920]   And that's what Psalm 95 wants to get at.
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:28.160]   It is one of the best psalms on worship.
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:33.400]   The ending of Psalm 95 does not cater to our preference.
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:39.080]   We always think, "Okay, we come to the face of God,
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:42.040]   "we come to worship God in the presence of God."
[00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:45.480]   When we worship, yeah, it has to be,
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:48.120]   but you come out of it, you come out of worship
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:50.120]   feeling peaceful, right?
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:54.680]   Feeling a little bit comfortable, right?
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:56.600]   That is our misunderstanding.
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:59.800]   Sometimes the best worship is that we come before God
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:01.300]   and we are warned.
[00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:07.440]   We receive a serious warning to our lives.
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:12.400]   But we stop listening, then we'll go astray, right?
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:15.480]   And we'll end up in curses, in death,
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:18.760]   and separation from God.
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:21.840]   Psalm 95, second half, the last half,
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:26.760]   is telling you, you must direct your attention
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:32.120]   to the voice of God, because God is a speaking God.
[00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:36.600]   God still speaks, speaks to your heart through the spirit,
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:41.000]   and speaks to you in warning and in teaching.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.840]   If we refuse to accept or listen to the voice of God,
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:48.960]   then we suffer the consequence.
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:51.680]   But God is always the gracious one.
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:54.680]   He wants us to listen, right?
[00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:58.840]   Sometimes the best worship doesn't cater to our preferences.
[00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:03.780]   It caters to God's preferences.
[00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:09.200]   That your attention is always on God and on God alone,
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:10.800]   nothing else.
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:15.520]   God is God speaking to you, and you are ready to listen.
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:17.480]   Now C.S. Lewis says something really interesting
[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:21.040]   and fun to say about all things, about all things.
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:25.000]   I really started to enjoy his writings.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.160]   He compares true worship with a pair of good shoes.
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:32.000]   A pair of good shoes.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.800]   Let me give you that quote.
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:36.300]   He said, "A good pair of shoes
[00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:40.980]   "are the ones you don't notice.
[00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:46.520]   "The perfect church worship service
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:49.860]   "would be one we were almost unaware of.
[00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:54.740]   "Our attention would have been on God alone."
[00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:57.380]   That makes sense.
[00:29:57.380 --> 00:30:00.840]   You're wearing a good pair of shoes now.
[00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:02.840]   Do you pay attention to them?
[00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:04.120]   No.
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:08.640]   A good shoe will not get your attention, right?
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:13.320]   But it will carry you through, right, while you're walking.
[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:14.880]   But you don't pay attention to them
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:18.960]   because you're unaware of the existence of shoes.
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:23.000]   A true worship is kind of like that.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.840]   Unaware of everything else, right?
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:31.540]   But we are fully aware of the presence of God.
[00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:35.700]   So I invite you today to polish your craft of worship.
[00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:41.620]   Psalm 95 is not written to clergy.
[00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:43.620]   It's not written to the worship band.
[00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:47.140]   It's not written to those who are in charge of the worship,
[00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:50.220]   the worship personnel, the religious workers
[00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:51.900]   who prepare the worship service.
[00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:55.180]   It's written to all the people of God.
[00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:56.840]   It's written to you.
[00:30:56.840 --> 00:31:01.100]   How do you craft your art of worship
[00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:04.440]   so that your worship is pleasing to God?
[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:09.940]   How do you prepare your heart, right?
[00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:12.780]   You know, the most terrible sins
[00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:16.820]   that the Israelites committed in the wilderness
[00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:19.260]   were not breaking any laws.
[00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:21.860]   They were not doing horrible crimes.
[00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:23.180]   Do you get that?
[00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:26.640]   They never do really horrible things.
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:28.680]   They were not criminals.
[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:32.000]   The most horrible thing, the most terrible thing
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.300]   that the Israelites, the people of God did
[00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:39.280]   was being hard-hearted, not willing to listen.
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:41.640]   They're not willing to open their hearts.
[00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:42.800]   So how do you prepare your hearts?
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:46.040]   How do you prepare your art of worship?
[00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:49.040]   It's to pray.
[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:51.080]   Sometimes a simple prayer,
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:54.840]   to pray that the Spirit will speak to you, right?
[00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:57.880]   Even for myself, sometimes I attend worship service.
[00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:00.540]   Someone else is speaking, right?
[00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:04.740]   I pray that God will speak to me, right?
[00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:10.800]   That I will have a softened heart to come before Him,
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:14.960]   to acknowledge, to be totally aware of His presence.
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:17.160]   Let's all pray together.
[00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:20.240]   And I ask the worship band to come back up here
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:22.480]   and sing our last song.
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:26.640]   And let the song be our worshipful response to God.
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:30.960]   And most importantly, as Psalm 95 says,
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:33.960]   come before God with listening ears.
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:39.960]   Let our heart be open to Him.
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:41.320]   Let's all pray.
[00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:44.080]   Father, we give You thanks for the fact
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:46.800]   that You are worthy of our worship.
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:49.760]   Yes, You are worthy, because You are our Creator,
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:50.840]   our Redeemer.
[00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:55.240]   We praise You, we make song, we shout.
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:58.840]   For You, and joyfully we do so,
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:03.440]   because You are worthy of our praises.
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:08.520]   And yes, we ask that Your Spirit will open our hearts,
[00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:11.760]   humble us, so that we'll listen to You.
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:18.000]   Thank You for being our God, for Your love, for Your grace.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.580]   In Christ, we pray.
[00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:25.100]   (upbeat music)
