[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600]   All right, today we will start a new series.
[00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.260]   Last weekend I was not with you.
[00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.800]   I know Pastor Sam Johnson was here
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.960]   and I really appreciate for his World Ministry Award
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.060]   and I was in Minnesota for the weekend
[00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.980]   and from Friday to Sunday, yes, Friday to Sunday,
[00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.580]   I was speaking in the church retreat over there
[00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.800]   and as always, sometimes I go to different churches
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.520]   and get to know some of the people
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.380]   and sisters and brothers in Christ
[00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.860]   and learn about their stories
[00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.280]   and I was encouraged by their experiences
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:45.160]   and one of the couples who host me
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.440]   and pick me up from the airport
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.280]   and drive me to the retreat center
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.620]   which is two and a half hours away
[00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.800]   from the airport from Minneapolis
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.380]   and they are such an inspiration, you know,
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.560]   just retire and they have been working as expats
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.520]   in China, in Hong Kong, in Singapore
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.580]   and very successful people and very resourceful people
[00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.740]   and they have been working tirelessly for the gospel,
[00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.740]   preaching the gospel, you know,
[00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.540]   shepherding the church, helping out with ministries
[00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.520]   and they just settled down in Minnesota
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.860]   for less than a year and they are working
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.420]   and they are one of those faithful people
[00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.580]   who continue to inspire you, you know,
[00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:40.440]   in the small church and they continue to serve faithfully
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.040]   and use their resources to advance the ministry there.
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.520]   So I was really, really touched by this couple
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.160]   and of course, by many other brothers and sisters.
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.960]   This church is without a pastor for some time
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.380]   and as you can understand, all the elders
[00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.680]   and all the lay leaders have to just contribute
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.740]   a little bit more, you know, stretch themselves
[00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.740]   and serve in the church and some of the brothers
[00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.020]   because they're without a pastor,
[00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.000]   so they have to preach.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.800]   They have to learn how to preach.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.100]   So that's pretty tough for them
[00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.940]   but I'm so inspired by the ministry.
[00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.180]   Can you imagine, you know, there's no pastor,
[00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.240]   there's no one preparing the message for Sunday service
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.820]   and you have to take turn, right?
[00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.740]   And you have to take turn next time you're gonna preach,
[00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.960]   next time you're gonna preach, right?
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.620]   It's pretty tough but, you know,
[00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.280]   I'm really inspired by their faithfulness
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.020]   and that's what got me thinking about
[00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.560]   this next series of messages
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.280]   and what should I preach on.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.420]   You know, during the retreat, I have been thinking a lot
[00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.580]   and praying a lot about what should be the sermon series
[00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.900]   from this Sunday onward,
[00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.780]   at least for the next six, seven Sundays
[00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.300]   and I've been thinking about, okay, New Testament letters,
[00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.220]   maybe Old Testament, maybe the Book of Daniel
[00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.940]   because I've been working on the Book of Daniel
[00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.440]   for quite a long time because in November,
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.700]   I'm going to another church to preach in Toronto.
[00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.660]   So I've been working on the Book of Daniel.
[00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:25.740]   So, you know,
[00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.880]   checking this passage and that passage
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.900]   but, you know, in my prayer, in my desire,
[00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.560]   I come to this point that I want to
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.700]   focus on one topic for all of us,
[00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.380]   one topic for all of us,
[00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.880]   is that what Christ thinks of the church, right?
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.040]   Now, we come to church, of course,
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.380]   we carry our own opinions and preferences
[00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.460]   about the church, right?
[00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.880]   Or what is my role in the church, right?
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.640]   Maybe I see myself as such a, you know, just attendee,
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.740]   one of the attendees, right?
[00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.060]   I'm not part of this, right?
[00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.500]   I don't want to get involved or something like that.
[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.400]   What is my role in the church, right?
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.980]   You can ask, you know, each and every one of us
[00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.820]   and we will give you different answers, right?
[00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.500]   But, you know, ultimately, what matters most
[00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.920]   is not how you and I see the church, right?
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:28.080]   What matters most is what Christ thinks of our church, right?
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.720]   He is the head of our church, right?
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.940]   He is the leader.
[00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.480]   It's not so much about what the passage says,
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.540]   it's not so much of the core team member
[00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:37.960]   that the lay leader said,
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.140]   it's not so much of what you say
[00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.000]   or how you see the church.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.560]   And your role in the church
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.160]   is also depends on this question,
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.840]   what Christ thinks of your role in the church.
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.540]   And this series takes us to the last book
[00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.420]   of the New Testament, of the entire Bible.
[00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.560]   You know, the Old Testament have 39 books, right?
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.300]   Old Testament, 39 books.
[00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.380]   And the New Testament has 27 books, right?
[00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.280]   It's a collection of 27 books and letters.
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.420]   The last book of the entire Bible
[00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.020]   is called the Book of Revelation.
[00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.820]   That is the last book of the Bible.
[00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.980]   And this Book of Revelation contains seven letters
[00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:21.640]   written to seven churches in Asia Minor
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.820]   at that time, in the first century.
[00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.120]   Now, as we come to the Book of Revelation,
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.360]   I remember when I was so much younger,
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.680]   you know, I wanted to know what is going on in the future,
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.760]   right?
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.840]   Kind of like apocalypse, you know,
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.720]   kind of, you know, doomsday scenario.
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.200]   What is going on, right?
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.640]   And what does the Bible have to say
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.540]   about the end of the world, right?
[00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.280]   So I flipped the pages to the Book of Revelation
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.240]   and I read some of the passages.
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.560]   And I must admit, I could not understand it.
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.040]   It's just so strange, right?
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.540]   It opens up another, you know,
[00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.720]   another box of mystery.
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.560]   And I did not know how to interpret it.
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.600]   I did not know how to read it.
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.520]   And that is the Book of Revelation, right?
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.240]   Now, first of all, when we come to the Book of Revelation,
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.780]   please understand that the Book of Revelation
[00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:16.820]   is not so much about prediction of the future, right?
[00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.260]   It's not weather forecast,
[00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.680]   whether it's gonna rain tomorrow at 3.23 p.m.
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.420]   That's not what Revelation is all about.
[00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:28.000]   That's not what the Book of Revelation is all about.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.240]   What it is about is that it was written
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:35.120]   to a particular situation,
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.060]   to a group of Christians at that time.
[00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:42.220]   And that was the late first century, about A.D. 90s.
[00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:47.620]   You know, the time of Jesus died and rose again.
[00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.960]   It was about A.D. 30, right?
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.060]   About A.D. 30.
[00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.080]   And then the apostles and the early Christians,
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.460]   they went from Jerusalem to other parts of the world,
[00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.960]   including Paul himself, right?
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.980]   Went to different cities and towns
[00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:04.820]   and preached the gospel and established churches, right?
[00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:08.600]   Small churches, small group house churches.
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.840]   Now, that was about 30s, 40s, and 50s, right?
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.940]   And then we come to the Book of Revelation
[00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:16.280]   is the end of first century.
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:21.140]   You know, if you calculate the years, the number of years,
[00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:24.060]   by this time, the end of first century,
[00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:27.060]   the second generation Christians are
[00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:32.360]   almost 70 years after the time of Jesus.
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.840]   And at that time, particularly at that time,
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:39.220]   the Roman Empire, they were still under the Roman rule,
[00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:43.580]   right, they have been promoting, you know, emperor worship.
[00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:46.420]   You know, you can imagine, if you,
[00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:49.420]   if you have a time machine,
[00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:52.900]   we can go back to the first century, the late first century.
[00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:55.040]   If we go to one of the house churches,
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:59.460]   they have the political pressure from the top, right?
[00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:03.200]   From the emperor, from the Roman Empire.
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:07.360]   They want the churches to worship the emperor, right?
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:11.980]   You can imagine walking to the church
[00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:14.140]   in the late first century,
[00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:19.340]   situation is kind of like the church is always
[00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:22.420]   under the pressure of the government.
[00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:27.700]   If you join the late first century church
[00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:33.120]   in the Roman Empire, probably you will find some people,
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.880]   they have to sing the national anthem
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.560]   before they sing praises to Jesus.
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:39.560]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.140]   Do you, will you like it?
[00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:44.120]   If you walk in this church, you have to sing
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:47.980]   the national anthem before you do anything else, right?
[00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:50.740]   Or you will find the picture of the emperor,
[00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:52.400]   you know, next to the cross,
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.100]   or right at the center of the sanctuary,
[00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:59.060]   and the cross is put on the side, you know?
[00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:03.420]   And that was the kind of situation the early Christians,
[00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:05.820]   the first century Christians were facing.
[00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:09.660]   They were facing wave and wave of persecution.
[00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:13.120]   And of course, the pagan people,
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.360]   if they don't believe in Christ,
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.200]   they were okay with that, right?
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:21.360]   Because emperor was just one more god
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.400]   on top of many other gods, right?
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.080]   But for churches, it's not okay.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.300]   Because, you know, the gospel,
[00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:31.700]   the gospel, the good news of Jesus Christ
[00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:35.240]   proclaims that there's only one king in this universe,
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:39.400]   and that is Jesus, who died and rose from the dead, right?
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:43.260]   And for this reason, Christians are often, you know,
[00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.660]   being marginalized and being pressured,
[00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:48.600]   or being persecuted.
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.320]   And John the apostle, you know,
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.420]   Jesus had 12 apostles, right?
[00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:57.820]   And the last one who died should be John the apostle.
[00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:00.160]   And he wrote the book of Revelation
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.200]   under the inspiration of God.
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.620]   And he said this,
[00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:08.200]   right off the bat in chapter one, verse nine.
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:12.200]   It says, "I, John," it should be apostle John, right?
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.940]   "Your brother and companion in suffering and kingdom
[00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:19.200]   "and patient endurance, there are hours in Jesus.
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.700]   "I was on the island of Patmos
[00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:23.960]   "because of the word of God
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:27.300]   "and because of the testimony of Jesus."
[00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:31.460]   So he was being persecuted,
[00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:35.540]   and he was exiled to a small island called Patmos
[00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:37.980]   in the Aegean Sea.
[00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:41.400]   He said, "On the last day,"
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.200]   which means he was worshiping, right?
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.000]   On the last day, on Sunday,
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.740]   "I was in the spirit, and I heard behind me
[00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:51.700]   "a loud voice like a trumpet,
[00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:55.440]   "which said, 'Write on a scroll what you see
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.940]   "'and send it to seven churches,
[00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:00.620]   "'to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamon,
[00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:03.660]   "'Tirethea, Thyatira,
[00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:08.940]   "'Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.'"
[00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:13.300]   So seven cities, there were churches in these seven cities.
[00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:16.340]   And John's being commanded to write letters
[00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:19.520]   to each of the seven churches.
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:20.720]   And where are they?
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:21.940]   You see the map.
[00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:24.980]   You see all of the seven cities and seven churches
[00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:29.640]   are located in the western part of today's Turkey, right?
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:33.500]   And you can see the island of Patmos, right?
[00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:34.940]   Can you see that?
[00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:36.120]   Island of Patmos.
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.340]   And John received the revelation,
[00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:40.720]   which is written in the book of Revelation,
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:45.260]   on this island because he was a political exile,
[00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.800]   and the Romans were going after him.
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.780]   And during his suffering, during his isolation
[00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:53.780]   on the island of Patmos,
[00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:57.620]   he received the revelation from God.
[00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:59.960]   And he wrote seven churches,
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:05.540]   wrote seven letters to the seven churches.
[00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:09.920]   And of course we know seven is a symbolic number, right?
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.420]   It's a complete number, right?
[00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:14.480]   I'm Chinese.
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.700]   The symbolic number eight, you know,
[00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:20.200]   it's very important, right?
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.660]   You drive around in the city,
[00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:24.560]   you see a license plate with 888 on it.
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.740]   Most likely it's a Chinese driver, right?
[00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:28.240]   Chinese owner.
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:31.920]   For the Hebrew culture, or even for the Christian culture,
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:33.960]   seven is the complete number, right?
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.160]   Seven is the complete number.
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:36.480]   So that means the seven churches
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:39.000]   represent all the churches, right?
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.160]   And the first few chapters of the book of Revelation
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:48.220]   contain letters addressed to the particular
[00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:51.360]   faith communities and apply to them, right?
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.860]   And this letter, we shall see,
[00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:56.620]   we will read letter after letter,
[00:12:56.620 --> 00:13:01.660]   and we shall see the format of each letter is similar.
[00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:06.020]   Christ, first of all, he will introduce himself,
[00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:10.760]   and then he will give an evaluation of the church,
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:13.920]   saying that I know what is going on in your church.
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:17.760]   And then, thirdly, the letter, which is very short,
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:20.840]   Christ, Jesus, will advise the church
[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:24.560]   to change the course of action,
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:26.800]   or keep on doing some of the good works
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.560]   they have been doing.
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:32.140]   And then the letter will close with a promise,
[00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:36.300]   a promise particularly relevant to the local church,
[00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:42.420]   and advise the audience to listen and to obey the word.
[00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:44.120]   To obey the message.
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:48.420]   So today, we're going to go through the first letter first.
[00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:49.260]   Okay?
[00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.520]   The first letter is written to Ephesus,
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:55.560]   to the Christians in Ephesus.
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.420]   It says chapter two, verse one.
[00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:02.340]   "To the angel of the church in Ephesus write,
[00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:05.720]   'These are the words of him who holds the seven stars
[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.540]   in his right hand and walks among
[00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:11.560]   the seven golden lampstands.'"
[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.700]   So these are all symbols, right?
[00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:15.200]   Symbolic language.
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:19.540]   And they represent some of the reality, right?
[00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:22.760]   And Christ introduced himself as someone
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:27.420]   who holds the seven stars in his right hand, right?
[00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:28.540]   And what does it mean?
[00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:31.860]   You can try to imagine Christ himself,
[00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:34.900]   who is king over the entire cosmos,
[00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:38.580]   and his right hand is holding seven stars, right?
[00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:41.820]   Now we know, in the late first century,
[00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:46.200]   if you go to different archeological sites,
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:50.360]   and you find some of the coins mint by the emperor,
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:56.080]   and one of those coins, if you look at it,
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:00.080]   there is the image of the emperor in the center,
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:03.460]   and there are seven stars surrounding him.
[00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:06.320]   And that emperor is called Domitian.
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:09.300]   And he ruled the Roman Empire and persecuted Christians
[00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:11.860]   in the late first century.
[00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:14.600]   So verse one of chapter two says,
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:18.760]   "It is not Domitian, it is not the emperor
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:20.740]   that holds seven stars.
[00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:23.500]   Christ is the one who holds seven stars.
[00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:26.000]   Christ is the one who holds the entire cosmos
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.700]   in his sovereignty.
[00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:31.200]   He is someone who is in absolute control."
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:38.720]   And Jesus introduced himself as someone who is walking
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:42.400]   among the seven golden lampstands.
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:45.820]   Now the golden lampstand, called menorah,
[00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:49.540]   is one of the oldest symbols of Judaism, right?
[00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:51.680]   You can see the picture on the right.
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:55.840]   When you go down to the Western Wall in Jerusalem,
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:16:00.480]   you see a huge, life-size golden menorah
[00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:04.280]   to remember this symbol, right?
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:08.600]   This represents the nation of Israel, the people of Israel.
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:12.360]   And this is applied, now this menorah is applied
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:15.880]   to the people of God in the church.
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:19.580]   Now for the Israelites, or for the Jews,
[00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:22.780]   menorah reminds them they are being called by God
[00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:26.040]   to be the light unto the nations, right?
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:30.540]   Israel, or the Jewish people, are being elected by God.
[00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:33.620]   It's not because they're better.
[00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:36.120]   They are just like other pagan nations.
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:41.120]   But they are specially elected by God to be the channel,
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:44.520]   to be the instrument of God among the nations.
[00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:46.780]   And they will be like the menorah.
[00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:49.880]   They will be the lampstand to shine the true light
[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:52.820]   to all the nations around them, right?
[00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:55.900]   And that was Israel was supposed to be.
[00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:59.900]   However, here, Christ is saying that the church
[00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:02.900]   is the true Israel, right?
[00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:08.840]   The church is the true Israel, composed with believers
[00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:14.960]   who are Jewish and who are Gentiles.
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:21.060]   So Jews and Gentiles together, they proclaim that Jesus
[00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:25.260]   is the true Lord, and now they are like the menorah, right?
[00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:28.340]   They should be used by God to shine the light
[00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:30.280]   to the nations.
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:32.580]   And Christ introduced himself in such a way,
[00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:37.540]   and he command the church in Ephesus to do such and such.
[00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:40.740]   Now remember the format of the letter?
[00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:44.700]   This is the first letter to the Ephesian Christians, right?
[00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:47.520]   After introducing himself as someone who holds the seven
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:51.020]   stars and walk among the seven lampstands,
[00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:56.640]   in verse two, Christ says, "I know your deeds,
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:59.760]   "your hard work, your perseverance.
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:02.280]   "I know you cannot tolerate wicked men,
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:05.980]   "and you have tested them, those who claim to be apostles
[00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:10.320]   "but are not apostles, and found them to be false.
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:14.620]   "And you have persevered and have endured hardship
[00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:17.880]   "for my name, and have not grown weary."
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:22.120]   So is it praise or is it condemnation?
[00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:24.780]   It's not praise, right?
[00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:26.700]   It's very positive, right?
[00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:29.680]   So Christ looking at the church in Ephesus,
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:33.540]   and he praises them for their hard work,
[00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:35.840]   for their good work.
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:38.560]   So the Ephesian Christians are very, very busy
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:41.620]   and hard-working Christians, and they build a ministry.
[00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:44.340]   They block by block, right?
[00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:45.640]   Break by break.
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:49.480]   And the Christians in Ephesus have been trying
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:54.020]   to building the body of Christ.
[00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:59.240]   And by the time John writes the letter of Ephesians,
[00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:02.660]   by the time John writes this letter,
[00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:06.760]   the book of Revelation, it was in the late first century,
[00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:09.320]   right, 1890, and the Ephesian church
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:12.520]   was already 40 years old, right?
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:17.320]   Yeah, the church was already 40-some years old, right?
[00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:20.640]   Remember I told you last weekend I went to the other church
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:21.720]   in Minnesota.
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:25.600]   They have 40 years of history.
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:28.660]   They have a long history, right?
[00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:31.420]   Much longer than our church, right?
[00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:35.120]   Our church is only eight years old, right?
[00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:38.540]   We are like a little kid, right?
[00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:41.140]   We are not grown, right?
[00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:42.700]   They have, right?
[00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:47.100]   And the church in Ephesus is also a grown church.
[00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:49.860]   And you see, in this community, there are many, many people
[00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:53.520]   who are working so hard to build a ministry.
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:20:00.420]   When we first started Urban Voice, it was hard work.
[00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:04.560]   It was very hard work.
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:10.700]   Physically difficult because you have to set up
[00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:13.860]   and you have to do running around.
[00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:16.220]   And mentally, it was challenging.
[00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:18.060]   Spiritually, it was challenging.
[00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:21.040]   Emotionally, it was difficult.
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:24.100]   I really appreciate, eight years ago,
[00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:28.260]   many of the leaders who started this church with me,
[00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:31.920]   and I really appreciate their perseverance,
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:34.040]   their hard work, right?
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:37.220]   When we first started this ministry, we wanted to raise,
[00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:39.020]   we had nothing back then.
[00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:43.200]   We wanted to raise, well, we calculate some of the numbers,
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.400]   right, we punch in some of the numbers,
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:46.840]   this is what we need, right?
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:49.840]   So we had to raise, in order to start this church,
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:53.100]   we had to raise 120K to get us started.
[00:20:53.100 --> 00:21:00.280]   I remember it was late 2015, and we had zero, we had zero.
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:09.180]   But within six weeks, we raised that amount, right?
[00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:13.840]   Praise God for the commitment, right?
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:17.080]   And the perseverance, the contribution of the people
[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:20.180]   who started the church, right?
[00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:22.960]   And Christ will get the church in Ephesus.
[00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:26.920]   Yes, you guys are very, very good, you know, way to go.
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:29.300]   Your perseverance, the hard work, right?
[00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:31.480]   And I wanna encourage all of you.
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:35.020]   We still need to do all the hard work.
[00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:39.300]   We still need to work harder to persevere, right?
[00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:42.080]   Because all we do is the good work,
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:44.280]   we try to hold fast to the gospel,
[00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:46.360]   we try to preach the gospel, we try to build the church,
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:49.080]   and it's not an easy task, right?
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:51.660]   And there's no quick fix, right?
[00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:54.420]   All ministries require hard work.
[00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:59.920]   And you see the Ephesian Christians,
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:03.980]   not only they work hard, but they know the truth, right?
[00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:08.060]   They know who are the, who the wicked men are, right?
[00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:10.600]   Some of the apostles, some of the people
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:13.820]   who claim to be apostles, but they are not.
[00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:15.860]   Indeed, they are not apostles.
[00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:18.920]   You know, we find some of the early documents
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:21.000]   that we know some of the early churches,
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.160]   they're trying to tell which guy is the true apostle
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:29.540]   and which guy is not the true guy, the false apostle, right?
[00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:31.880]   And some of the criterias they lay out
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:36.380]   for the leadership team is to test whoever come our way
[00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:39.800]   to preach the gospel and their behaviors.
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:43.300]   And one of the criterias says,
[00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:46.900]   if the preacher, the itinerary preacher,
[00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:50.700]   comes to your church and you're gonna host them, right?
[00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:53.980]   You're gonna host this preacher,
[00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:56.900]   and if you host him for three days,
[00:22:56.900 --> 00:23:00.760]   and he ask to be staying longer,
[00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:07.400]   the document says he is the false apostle,
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:10.180]   because he's trying to take advantage of you.
[00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:13.620]   And after preaching, if he ask for money,
[00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:16.280]   he is definitely a fake apostle.
[00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:19.440]   And we have some of the early documents
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:22.820]   that help the early churches to discern
[00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:26.700]   who is true apostle and who is false apostle.
[00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:29.660]   And for the church in Ephesus, they tested them
[00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:32.420]   and know their doctrines, right?
[00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:33.640]   They know what they believe in,
[00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:36.180]   so that's why they can discern what is right
[00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:40.220]   and what is wrong, what is orthodox and what is cultic,
[00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:42.660]   what is not orthodox.
[00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:45.260]   And Christ praises them.
[00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:48.820]   And this letter continues, after praising them,
[00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:52.660]   Christ said, "However, I hold this against you.
[00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:55.480]   "You have forsaken your first love.
[00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:59.040]   "Remember the height from which you have fallen.
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:02.640]   "Repent and do the things you did at first.
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:04.880]   "If you do not repent, I will come to you
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:08.620]   "and remove your lampstand from its place."
[00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:12.320]   This is a very stern warning, right?
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:13.940]   Yes, they are hardworking.
[00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:17.280]   However, there's one thing Christ holds against them
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:21.440]   is that this is a church that has abandoned love, you know?
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:28.020]   Abandoned love for God, abandoned the love for others, right?
[00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:31.960]   And it says, what kind of love?
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:33.460]   First love, right?
[00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:35.260]   First love.
[00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:40.480]   Somewhere in the past, you had that, right?
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:44.680]   First love, talking about love in the past.
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:48.040]   Now, we all have similar experience, right?
[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:52.120]   For those of us like me, you know, I have been in Christ,
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:56.520]   I have known Christ and served Christ for many years.
[00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:59.680]   In my faith journey, there were a time
[00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:03.560]   I was really touched by the love of God
[00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:12.620]   and I was motivated and compelled by God's love.
[00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:17.360]   So I'll do everything out of my experience of God's love
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:20.220]   and I'll do everything out of love, right?
[00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:22.900]   I want to care about other people, right?
[00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:25.800]   And not asking for some benefits.
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:27.740]   I want to invite other people to the church.
[00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:29.640]   I want to invite other people to experience
[00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:33.340]   the grace of God, all because I have taste
[00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:35.260]   the love of God, right?
[00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:38.980]   The redeeming grace of Christ.
[00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:43.120]   But the church in Ephesus has lost it all.
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:46.520]   How old is this church, remember?
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:48.060]   40 years, right?
[00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:50.040]   More than 40 years.
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:53.040]   And this is kind of a mature church.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.960]   But Christ says, "I have this against you.
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:00.880]   "You have forsaken the first love."
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:05.680]   You remember there were point in your faith journey
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:09.280]   that you're so compelled by the love of Christ, right?
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:13.020]   Maybe when you were younger, maybe there were
[00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:17.180]   different period of time in your past journey in faith.
[00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:21.960]   You were so touched by the love of God
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:26.260]   and you are willing to do everything because Jesus loves you
[00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:28.740]   because you know that God loves you, right?
[00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:32.740]   The Christians in Ephesus have forsaken the first love.
[00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:35.680]   And these are very, very strong words.
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:40.340]   And it doesn't mean that they're being forgetful,
[00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:43.540]   like you lost a wallet or something.
[00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:45.720]   You have forsaken your first love.
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:47.480]   These are very strong words.
[00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:50.640]   It's like intentionally you trash it.
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:54.380]   There's something very valuable,
[00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:57.380]   but you throw it into the trash can.
[00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:00.720]   You say, "I don't care anymore."
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:01.780]   Right?
[00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:04.580]   That kind of action, that kind of attitude
[00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:06.860]   that they're holding.
[00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:10.660]   There's no wonder why that Jesus write this letter
[00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:13.160]   to the church and warns them,
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:16.100]   "Hey, if you do not recover this first love,
[00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:18.200]   "I will remove you.
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:20.540]   "You are no longer my lamp stand
[00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:24.540]   "and you cannot shine the light to the nations."
[00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:26.840]   Jesus continues.
[00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:32.040]   He says, "Remember the height from which you have fallen
[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:34.960]   "and you have to repent
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:37.780]   "and do the things you did at first.
[00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:39.840]   "If you do not repent, I will come to you
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:42.140]   "and remove your lamp stand from its place."
[00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:45.460]   These are very, very strong warning words.
[00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:48.400]   If the church is without love,
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:51.040]   it is no longer a church, right?
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:52.540]   You agree with that?
[00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:56.700]   If a Christian is no longer motivated by the love of God,
[00:27:56.700 --> 00:28:01.440]   he is not a follower of Jesus Christ anymore.
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:03.400]   Right?
[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:07.300]   You're just going through some motions, right?
[00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:08.560]   Routine, right?
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:11.480]   Muscle memory.
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:16.860]   Jesus said, "If you do not recover that,
[00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:19.700]   "you cannot be the lamp stand."
[00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:23.860]   If we do not recover that, we cannot be God's church.
[00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:26.720]   I remember some years ago,
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:30.140]   I attended a regional meeting for pastors
[00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:34.300]   in the network in Chicago.
[00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:38.900]   There were about 30, 40 pastors and church planters.
[00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:42.820]   We gathered together in north side of the city.
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:47.880]   We invited a Jewish rabbi to give a testimony.
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:52.500]   He's a very, very old rabbi.
[00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:57.040]   He believed Jesus is Christ,
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:58.980]   and what we call Messianic Jew.
[00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:01.580]   He was invited to give a testimony.
[00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:04.240]   He lived in Skokie, north of us.
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:08.580]   I don't know the real number now,
[00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:13.160]   the number of Messianic Jews in the Skokie community.
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:16.160]   Back then, I heard it was about 100,
[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:20.720]   about 100 Jewish people who professed
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:23.360]   Jesus is the Christ, the Messiah.
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:24.840]   I don't know the real number now,
[00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:27.920]   but this rabbi, very old and retired,
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:32.760]   and came to faith, came to know Jesus as his Lord,
[00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:34.140]   and he shared his testimony.
[00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:38.140]   He lived in Skokie, and he had broken marriages,
[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:43.160]   and had not seen his daughter for over 10 years,
[00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:46.120]   because of broken relationship.
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:50.040]   In his brokenness, in his pain, in his darkness,
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:55.260]   a Christian came along and cared for him,
[00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:58.080]   and stayed with him.
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:01.760]   It's not imposing the Bible upon him.
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:05.080]   It's not using the Bible to bang on his head.
[00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:09.240]   This Christian man just came along to this old man,
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:11.480]   and cared for him, and listened to his story,
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:13.720]   and tried to be his friend.
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:20.020]   And that's how this Jewish man came to faith,
[00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:24.300]   came to know Jesus, all because of love.
[00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:30.360]   You know, I think the biggest threat in our church
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:34.340]   is indifference, indifference.
[00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:37.920]   Indifference, the spirit of indifference.
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:40.020]   It says, "I don't care."
[00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:43.060]   Well, you have Bible study, I don't care, right?
[00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:45.380]   You have this good work, or that good work,
[00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:47.300]   you know, I don't care.
[00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:49.920]   You can share the gospel, and preach the gospel,
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:51.600]   build a ministry, build a youth ministry,
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:53.580]   or whatever happening in the church,
[00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:55.660]   I just don't care, right?
[00:30:55.660 --> 00:31:00.860]   I just follow motion, and you know, in and out, right?
[00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:04.700]   I think this is the biggest threat to our life.
[00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:07.340]   Not just the church community, but to every one of us,
[00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:10.260]   our individual spirituality.
[00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:13.440]   That is the biggest threat, the biggest danger.
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:15.100]   It's not because you're anti-gospel,
[00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:19.460]   it's not because you're anti-Bible, or anti-God.
[00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:21.880]   It's just indifference, right?
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:29.340]   And that's what Christ is saying to the Christians
[00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:30.820]   in Ephesus.
[00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:33.380]   I hold this against you.
[00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:36.140]   Yes, you are doing very, very good works,
[00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:40.300]   but this I against you, because this will destroy you.
[00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:44.940]   This will take you, remove you from the lamp stand.
[00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:48.700]   Now, I like the English paraphrase translation
[00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:51.100]   called Message.
[00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:52.540]   You heard about it?
[00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:54.780]   Message by Eugene Peterson.
[00:31:54.780 --> 00:32:00.340]   Back in the '90s, I was in Regent College, Vancouver,
[00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:03.060]   and Eugene Peterson was the professor
[00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:05.620]   of spiritual theology there.
[00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:08.460]   And he translated the whole Bible,
[00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:12.660]   and the translation is called paraphrase,
[00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:14.780]   because it's not a literal translation.
[00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:17.820]   It's not like, kind of like word for word,
[00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:21.980]   very close to the original language, like ESV, or NIV.
[00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:27.860]   But he did his translation with paraphrase.
[00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:32.020]   It's very loose, but you still get the meaning
[00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:35.260]   of the phrases and of the language.
[00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:40.140]   And in Message, Eugene Peterson translate this verse
[00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:42.640]   as this, and let me read this.
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:45.020]   Christ said to the church,
[00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:47.860]   "But you walk away from your first love."
[00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:49.380]   Why?
[00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:51.740]   What is going on with you anyway?
[00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:55.260]   Do you have any idea how far you've fallen?
[00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:56.500]   A Lucifer fall.
[00:32:57.500 --> 00:32:59.160]   Let's read it again.
[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:02.300]   Jesus said, "I have this against you,
[00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:04.620]   "because you walk away from your first love."
[00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:05.460]   Why?
[00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:08.260]   What the heck is going on with you?
[00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:11.860]   Do you have any idea how far you have fallen?
[00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:13.700]   Do you have any idea how far,
[00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:15.900]   what the distance of your fall?
[00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:18.140]   It's a Lucifer fall, right?
[00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:22.180]   You know, in the Jewish mind, especially in time of Jesus,
[00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:23.900]   they had this tradition saying,
[00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:26.740]   you know, Satan fell from the sky
[00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:31.340]   to the ground, to the earth, right?
[00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:35.260]   And that is the biggest distance of one's fall.
[00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:39.460]   Because of his pride, he was the angel of light,
[00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:42.180]   but he was being cast down from heaven
[00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:43.940]   and fell to the earth.
[00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:48.180]   That was part of the Jewish tradition and their theology.
[00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:52.340]   And they believe Satan, Lucifer, fell to the earth.
[00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:55.500]   He fell in such a way.
[00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:58.760]   And that is the biggest distance of fall
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:04.540]   in history, in the entire cosmos, right?
[00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:07.540]   No one thought so much as Satan did.
[00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:12.540]   And Eugene Peterson, I think he got it right.
[00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:14.780]   In his kind of loose paraphrase,
[00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:17.100]   "Do you have any idea how far you have fallen
[00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:21.260]   "if you have forsaken, you have abandoned the first love?"
[00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:25.580]   It's like the fall of Satan, right?
[00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:27.940]   It's a huge deal here, right?
[00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:31.500]   It threatens your whole life, your eternal life,
[00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:35.020]   your eternal destiny, your position,
[00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:38.260]   your role in the kingdom of God.
[00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:41.260]   So Christ says, "Remember the height
[00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:44.780]   "from which you have fallen,
[00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:48.780]   "and repent and do the things you did at first."
[00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:54.180]   Please, sister and brother, I want to urge you today.
[00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:58.580]   Remember how far we have fallen
[00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:01.500]   if we have forsaken the first love.
[00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:07.300]   Remember how the love of God has touched you before, right?
[00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:11.420]   Perhaps years ago, perhaps some months ago,
[00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:15.100]   but along the way, you have tasted the real love of God,
[00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:18.600]   right, but somehow you have fallen, right?
[00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:21.000]   Right?
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.880]   Repent and do the things you did at first, right?
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:26.520]   If you do not repent, Jesus said,
[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:30.520]   "I'll come to you and remove you from the lamb stand.
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:33.560]   "You're no longer my people.
[00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:36.720]   "You're no longer my lamb, my menorah."
[00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:41.600]   This letter closes with this verse.
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:44.520]   You have this in your favor,
[00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:47.680]   you hate the practices of liquidation,
[00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:49.600]   liquid, the Goliathans.
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:52.400]   This group probably is the cultic group
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:53.760]   that infiltrate into the church
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:57.920]   and using the gospel as an excuse for sexual immorality.
[00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:01.280]   And that's much we know, right?
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:04.560]   Again, they know the truth, right, the Ephesian Christians.
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:09.040]   However, they have fallen from the first love,
[00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:12.920]   and it has threatened them as a church.
[00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:16.400]   The last verse, "He who has an ear,
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:19.280]   "let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:22.360]   "To him who overcomes, we cover our first love,
[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:24.760]   "repent and do the things we did at first.
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:26.360]   "I will give you," Jesus said,
[00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:29.160]   "the right to eat from the tree of life,
[00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:31.000]   "which is in the paradise of God."
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.200]   All right?
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:35.000]   You are the menorah, and we are the menorah.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.760]   The church is the menorah.
[00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:39.920]   But in order for us to play this role,
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:45.880]   to be the light to our neighbors, to the world,
[00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:50.520]   we need to recover our first love.
[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:52.720]   Let me close by asking you,
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:55.560]   when was your first love with God?
[00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:59.600]   When did that happen, right?
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:03.040]   Maybe you were a student.
[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:07.240]   Maybe before you had a family, right?
[00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:12.520]   Somewhere along the line, you know.
[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:14.840]   Where is that first love?
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:17.120]   And Jesus said, "We cover that."
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:19.120]   You know, we cover that.
[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:22.800]   We repent and change our course.
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:26.160]   Let's all pray together.
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:33.360]   I want to spend some minute to pray to God,
[00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:41.840]   to remember the heights from which we have fallen.
[00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:45.240]   Repent and do the things we did at first.
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:56.720]   Our loving God, how much do we call?
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:38:02.220]   We call in our past, sometime in the past.
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:10.960]   We were touched by your grace, touched by your love.
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:15.920]   But somehow we have forsaken it.
[00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:21.520]   Help us to remember, remember that your love is still real.
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:25.300]   Your grace is still glorious.
[00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:30.960]   Your love is so authentic, and still changes us.
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:32.640]   It still changes us.
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:39.860]   Remind us where we have fallen.
[00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:45.800]   We come before you to repent.
[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:47.360]   Thank you for being our loving God
[00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:49.280]   and forgiving our sins.
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:52.040]   Forgiving our forgetfulness,
[00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:56.200]   forgiving our intentional abandonment of your grace.
[00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:00.780]   Help us to repent.
[00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:08.020]   And help us to redo the things that we did at first.
[00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:11.880]   Help us to recover that first love,
[00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:14.960]   that pure love, that pure motivation.
[00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:19.680]   Purely compelled by the love of God.
[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:22.860]   To serve you, to follow you.
[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:29.560]   God, I pray that you have mercy on us.
[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:31.220]   Mercy on our church.
[00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:35.900]   Help us to remember, to repent, and redo.
[00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:41.080]   And thank you for being our gracious Lord.
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:44.400]   And you are always there, walking among us.
[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:46.320]   And know our situation.
[00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:50.120]   Yes, we come before you.
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:52.120]   We change and we repent.
[00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:57.120]   Help us to taste your grace and your love once again.
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:58.880]   Anew.
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:01.480]   Renew our spirit,
[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:04.980]   so that we can be your faithful followers.
[00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:08.120]   To continue to serve you,
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:09.720]   continue to love you,
[00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:12.280]   and to love other people.
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:14.440]   In Christ's name, we pray.
[00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:18.920]   Well, thank you for worshiping with us.
[00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:20.040]   I hope to see you next Sunday,
[00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:24.120]   when we continue to serve God with our first love.
[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:25.280]   God bless you.
