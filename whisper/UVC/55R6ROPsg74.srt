00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
 Good morning family. It is great to be together again. Last week we finished up

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,080
 Matthew chapter 5 and so this week we're going to be beginning Matthew chapter 6.

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:17,200
 And Jesus opens Matthew chapter 6 talking about hypocrisy and he actually

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,840
 talks about it for quite a few verses. He gives us three really powerful

5
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:27,120
 illustrations of how damaging hypocrisy is to our lives as subjects of the

6
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,600
 kingdom. And so we'll be talking about this topic for the next few weeks

7
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,560
 because we're going to go through these these verses. It's a pretty big section. But

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,320
 today we're just going to kind of introduce it and scratch the surface.

9
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,600
 We're going to look at the first verse of Matthew 6. As usual I have some

10
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,280
 footage for you to look at today. It's hiking footage but I'm going to let you

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,680
 know it's not from Cook County. All the other hikes that you've seen in the

12
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,480
 past few weeks have been from Cook County, mostly the forest preserves right

13
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,960
 here around the city of Chicago. And most of them are in southwest Cook County

14
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,640
 because that's close to where I live. But there are places you could get to in 30

15
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,120
 minutes or so from the city. But this week we're going to have something

16
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:12,800
 different. On the last week of September, Jessamyn and I took the Z's to Great

17
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,440
 Smoky Mountain National Park and we really enjoyed it. We stayed in the North

18
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:21,360
 Carolina side. It was really quiet there, not many people, easy to social distance

19
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,120
 and it was very peaceful. And we did a lot of hiking with the kids in the park.

20
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,480
 So I'm going to share some footage of that with you. But as you see it you'll

21
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,160
 probably see some things you'll say, "Wait a second, I don't think that's anywhere

22
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,280
 around Chicago." It is really beautiful and it was a beautiful time of year to

23
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,040
 be there. And so I just want to encourage you, as I often do, to get outside and

24
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,200
 enjoy God's creation. It's something that's really healthy for us, especially

25
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,600
 during times of uncertainty. And it helps us to connect with God and gives

26
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,880
 us a sense of peace. And this is a great time to do it. Autumn is coming and so

27
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,600
 the trees are changing colors. Everything is really beautiful. So I encourage you

28
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:03,880
 to do that right here close to home. Find a place with not many people and stay

29
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:08,560
 safe and wear a mask if you need to. Do whatever you need to do. But get out and

30
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,320
 enjoy God's creation. It's an encouraging and uplifting thing.

31
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:18,760
 Back to Matthew chapter 6. Let's read verse 1 of chapter 6 together. In Matthew

32
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:23,160
 6 1 Jesus says this, "Beware of practicing your righteousness before

33
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,640
 other people in order to be seen by them. For then you will have no reward from

34
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:34,720
 your Father who is in heaven." Now as I said, Jesus goes on in this passage to

35
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:41,040
 give some illustrations of hypocrisy and of what this looks like. But in this

36
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:47,480
 first verse, Jesus is kind of laying out a general truth about hypocrisy. That we

37
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:53,720
 should be careful and avoid doing things for people rather than God. Caring about

38
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,680
 what people think of us rather than God. Caring about what the appearance, what

39
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,760
 the image of what we're doing is rather than the reality of our hearts and our

40
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,800
 lives. And that's what Jesus is pointing us to. And I want to call us back real

41
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,840
 quickly as we start to talk about this to the last verse of Matthew chapter 5

42
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,920
 Matthew 5 48. Remember we talked about that verse last week where Jesus says

43
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,680
 you therefore must be perfect as your Heavenly Father is perfect. And we kind

44
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,040
 of scratched the surface of talking about some of our responses to that

45
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,420
 verse. And we spent most of our time last week talking about the right response to

46
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:33,880
 that verse. The correct response that is to surrender to the fact that we can't

47
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:39,280
 live up to Matthew 5 48. We can't be perfect in the way that our Heavenly

48
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,400
 Father is perfect. We can't live up to God's standard. And so we need to

49
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,880
 surrender to that and we need to realize that Jesus wants to live through us. And

50
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,200
 that's the way that we begin to be who God wants us to be. And we begin to be

51
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,160
 who we want to be. But what I want us to see this week as we start to think about

52
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:02,600
 what it looks like to avoid hypocrisy in our lives. I want us to see that when we

53
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,960
 are confronted with the fact that we can't live up to God's standard. That we

54
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:10,920
 are imperfect as humans. That we make mistakes. That we sin. That we fall short.

55
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:15,800
 There are a few different responses we can have. And we mentioned this last week

56
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:20,240
 but we didn't dig into it as much. And the first response that we could have

57
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:24,960
 is just kind of a response of rebellion. Basically of saying, "Okay God I don't

58
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,640
 measure up to your standard and I don't want to. And I'm not gonna try and I'm

59
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,520
 gonna turn away and just do my own thing and live my life." And that's honestly the

60
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:39,000
 response that most of the world around us has to God's standard and to realizing

61
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,360
 that they fall short. Or maybe they don't even believe that they fall short and

62
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,400
 they say, "You know what I don't think I fall short." But their response is saying,

63
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:53,240
 "I want to rule my own life. I want to do what I want to do. And I'm not interested

64
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:58,080
 in listening to God. I'm gonna rebel against whatever God has said in this

65
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,120
 world and I don't care." That's one response that many people have. And that

66
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,480
 we have probably had at different times in our lives. Where we said, "God I don't

67
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:11,760
 measure up to the standard and I'm not gonna try. I want to just go my own way."

68
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,640
 Another response that we did mention last week is the response of despair.

69
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:22,600
 Just saying, "Well I can't measure up." And really allowing that to call into

70
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,560
 question our self-worth and attacking ourselves and getting to a point of

71
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,480
 condemnation and shame and saying, "I'm just a bad person and I can't do it and

72
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:35,920
 and I'm just gonna fall into despair and hopelessness." And obviously that's not

73
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:41,880
 the response that God wants us to have. God desires for us to grow close to Him

74
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:47,480
 and to change, to be transformed, to be made into His image. So God doesn't want

75
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:52,160
 us to get stuck in a place of despair or hopelessness. But that is something that

76
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,640
 can happen to us. And we've probably all been there as well in our journey as a

77
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:01,200
 believer. Where we said, "Okay I'm just struggling and I'm not who I want to be.

78
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:07,760
 And I feel hopeless and I want to give up that place of despair." Another

79
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:12,240
 unhealthy response is this response that Jesus is going to focus on in Matthew

80
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,280
 chapter 6. And that's the response of dishonesty or hypocrisy. And that's when

81
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,840
 we basically say, "You know what? I am going to pretend that I measure up and

82
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:27,680
 I'm going to tell a lie about the fact that I fall short." And we can tell that

83
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,320
 lie to different people. Sometimes we tell that lie to ourselves and we say,

84
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:36,960
 "Yeah I don't fall short. I do measure up. I am everything that God wants me to be

85
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,400
 and everything that I want to be." Sometimes we tell that lie to ourselves.

86
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,440
 Sometimes we tell it to God. Sometimes we say, "God I don't need you in my life

87
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:49,440
 because I'm good enough on my own." But sometimes we tell it to other people and

88
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,360
 we try to put forward this image that we are something that we're not. We try to

89
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:59,800
 put forward this perception, this illusion that we are keeping God's law

90
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,040
 and we're living right and we're doing all the right things in life even when

91
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:09,120
 that's not the reality of our heart. And that's a pretty good working definition

92
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,280
 of what hypocrisy is. Hypocrisy is when we are pretending, when we are acting,

93
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:19,320
 when we are giving off an image or creating some illusion that we are

94
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,480
 something that we're not. And when we're pretending to be something we're not.

95
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:28,120
 When we're pretending to be someone that we're not. That's when we fall into

96
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:33,640
 hypocrisy. And we know that hypocrisy is so hurtful, it's so damaging. And

97
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:39,760
 hypocrisy in relationship to our faith and our following of Jesus is probably

98
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:45,680
 some of the most damaging of all because it causes people to just discard God's

99
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,560
 truth. And people look at someone's life who's hypocritical and they say, "Well you

100
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,000
 know there's some things there, I've heard some truth about Jesus that

101
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,740
 maybe I might be interested in but then I see hypocrisy in someone's life and it

102
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:03,760
 just turns me away. I just want to discard, even the good things, I

103
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,280
 don't want to listen to them anymore because of hypocrisy." And so we know it

104
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,280
 can be really unhealthy and we've probably all been hurt by it in our

105
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:17,640
 lives. We've probably been hurt by someone who held us to some standard

106
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,080
 or told us that we were supposed to be a certain way but then they didn't live

107
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,800
 that out themselves. And their words and their actions didn't agree and that

108
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,060
 hypocrisy, that dissonance bothered us and hurt us and made us upset. We've

109
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:35,040
 probably all experienced that. And the reality is all of us as humans are

110
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:42,000
 hypocrites. We've all acted out hypocrisy. All of us have. It's something that's

111
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,760
 easy for me to talk about because I'm an expert in it. We all are experts in

112
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,640
 hypocrisy. We're all really good at pretending to be something we're not.

113
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,760
 We're all really good at trying to make other people think that we are someone

114
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,920
 that we are not in our heart and on the inside. It's something that all of us do.

115
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:07,000
 And last week we talked about the one right response to Matthew 5:48 and that

116
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,480
 is that response to surrender. We really covered that last week so I'm not going

117
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,720
 to get into it again but I just want to draw one thing as we move on this week

118
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,520
 and that is the fact that surrendering to God and allowing Jesus to live

119
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:25,840
 through us is really a journey and not a destination and that's so important for

120
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:30,160
 us to understand. And it's important that we understand that in order to avoid

121
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:35,800
 hypocrisy in our life because sometimes as followers of Jesus, as Christians, as

122
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:40,200
 subjects of the kingdom, we can think that surrender is a destination. That we

123
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,360
 get there once and once we've arrived that we're there for the rest of our

124
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:49,000
 life. That we get there and we say, "God, I'm gonna surrender. I'm gonna give it all

125
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,040
 up to you." And then after that it's done. And maybe we think that happens when we

126
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,520
 begin a relationship with Jesus when we're saved or maybe we think that

127
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,680
 happens when we have some type of experience in church where God really

128
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,960
 moves on our heart and we say, "Okay God, I'm gonna surrender everything to you."

129
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:09,720
 And those are beautiful moments and yes when that surrender happens it's real

130
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:17,160
 and it's complete but we still have this natural part of us, what the

131
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,800
 scripture calls the old man or the flesh, this part of us that's still

132
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,480
 really selfish and really sinful and that part of us fights against the

133
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,600
 spiritual part of us. The New Testament talks about this and that part of us

134
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:35,360
 wants to grab control back that we surrender to God. And so we don't just

135
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,040
 surrender once. It's not something that we get to that point and we surrender

136
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,520
 and then we never have to surrender again. No, we have to surrender and we

137
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,920
 have to surrender over and over again. It's a journey. It's a constant

138
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,840
 journey of surrender. We have to daily surrender to God's control and moment by

139
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:57,360
 moment when that part of us rises up and says, "No, I want to be selfish and I want

140
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,440
 to focus on me and I want to do what's right for me instead of trying to obey

141
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,240
 God." We have to surrender again and again and again throughout life. And that

142
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:12,120
 process, that journey in church, a lot of times people call it sanctification. It's

143
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,400
 just a big church word that means that we're becoming more like Christ.

144
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:21,120
 And as we continue to surrender, that's what happens. As we surrender more and

145
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:26,320
 more of our life and we surrender in those areas that we struggle in again

146
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,160
 and again, we begin to become more like Christ. We begin to be more of who God

147
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:35,600
 wants us to be and more of who we want to be. And our behavior changes, our

148
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,680
 attitudes change, the way we treat other people changes. Those things happen, but

149
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,880
 it's a process. It's not just a destination. And so if you find yourself

150
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:51,320
 saying, "Okay, I see that I fall short. I do want to surrender to Jesus, but then

151
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,720
 what about next week when I struggle again? What about a month from now when

152
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:01,360
 I'm still having problems with the same issues?" That's okay. It's a journey

153
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,000
 of surrender whereby we continue to walk in those things. We continue to repent of

154
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,640
 our sin. We continue to give control to Jesus and we continue to release control

155
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:14,080
 from our own hands. We continue to try to abide in Him like we talked about last

156
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:19,040
 week in John 15. It's a journey. It's a process. And that's important for us to

157
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,160
 know because sometimes in the church we say, "Well, I surrendered. I think I'm done.

158
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,400
 I've got it all figured out." And we start to walk in our own strength again. And

159
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:32,560
 once we do that, we start to fall into hypocrisy. We start to become someone who

160
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,760
 is acting like we're something that we're not. So today as we kind of

161
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,260
 introduce and think about hypocrisy, I want us to think about a few kind of big

162
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:47,200
 ideas about hypocrisy and maybe they'll help us to be aware of it in our

163
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,440
 life and to avoid it. And the first thing I want us to think about is why we're

164
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:57,200
 tempted towards hypocrisy. Why as humans there's such a strong temptation towards

165
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,880
 it. And I think the biggest reason that we're tempted towards hypocrisy, if we're

166
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:06,160
 honest with ourselves, is pride. We don't want to believe that we fall short of

167
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:11,400
 God's standard. We don't want to believe that we're something less than who we

168
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,960
 want to be. We don't want to believe that we're something less than perfect. And we

169
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:20,880
 don't... Our pride tells us, "No, don't let anybody know that you make mistakes. Don't

170
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,520
 let anybody know that you're less than perfect. Don't let anybody know that you

171
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:29,080
 could have a weakness or that you could struggle in any way." And so our pride

172
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:34,320
 puts us in this position where even though in our heart often we know that

173
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,120
 we we're broken and we struggle and we're not perfect, we don't want others

174
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,040
 to know that. And so we try to hide that. We put up a facade. We begin to build

175
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,640
 that image, that illusion that we're something that we're not. And our pride

176
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:53,000
 really tempts us towards hypocrisy. And there are other things that can tempt us

177
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,120
 towards that as well. Sometimes it's fear. It's fear of what other people will

178
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:00,720
 think or how other people will treat us. If they know that we make a mistake or

179
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,720
 if they know that we've failed in some way or if they know that we're imperfect,

180
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:10,120
 sometimes it's fear of the consequences. If someone finds out that we've made

181
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,680
 some mistake, what will happen and what will happen to us? And we might be afraid

182
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:18,720
 of that. Sometimes it's... Maybe it's just deception. Maybe sometimes we

183
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:24,120
 really are convinced that putting forth an image that is not really who we are

184
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:29,280
 is the best way to to live life or that maybe we actually are convinced that

185
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,560
 that's gonna help us or it's gonna protect someone else. There's a lot of

186
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,760
 reasons that we can do that. But I think a lot of them go back to that sense of

187
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:42,120
 pride. The fact that we don't want other people to know that we need any help. We

188
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:46,960
 don't want other people to know that we could struggle. We don't want other

189
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:51,760
 people to know that we fall short of God's standard. And the reality is the

190
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,040
 Bible tells us all of us fall short and that's why all of us end up being

191
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:01,120
 hypocrites because we all try to hide the fact that we fall short. We all try

192
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:07,040
 to hide it from one another. Now what is hypocrisy? When we talk about it in a

193
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:13,160
 biblical sense, I think we understand that what hypocrisy is, it's when we

194
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:18,480
 pretend to meet God's standard and we don't. None of us can meet God's standard

195
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,680
 on our own. Only through Christ can we meet that standard. We talked about that

196
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:27,280
 last week. And so anytime we start to pretend, whether it's just in our own

197
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:32,200
 mind or in the words or the actions that we display before others or the

198
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:36,040
 impression that we give other people, when we start to pretend that we're

199
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:40,520
 meeting God's standard and we're doing it, I'm doing it, when I pretend that I'm

200
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:46,520
 doing it, that's hypocrisy. I can't meet God's standard. Jesus can. And because of

201
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:51,360
 His love for me and His forgiveness and His grace, He can live through me and I

202
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:57,800
 can meet His standard with the power of Christ in my life. But on my own, I cannot.

203
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:04,240
 But oftentimes we begin to act like we can and do meet God's standard on our

204
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:10,360
 own, apart from Christ. We begin to act like we are making all the good choices

205
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,760
 and we're doing everything right and we are figuring everything out in life and

206
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:18,920
 that something is happening in our life because of our own goodness and that

207
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:24,680
 we've done all these things. That's just not true. It's when we pretend to

208
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:30,320
 meet God's standard, even though we don't and we can't, that's hypocrisy. And Jesus

209
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,960
 gets after the hypocrisy that we sometimes live out in our faith and He

210
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,080
 gives us these illustrations that we'll talk about in the next few weeks of

211
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:43,600
 people who do things to try to impress others. Sometimes we can get the idea

212
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,400
 that, well, if that's wrong, then maybe the way to avoid hypocrisy is just to

213
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:52,160
 hide everything I do. But that's not what Jesus is trying to say. Remember

214
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:57,520
 Matthew 5:16, the verse that we talked about a few months ago, it says

215
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,920
 we're supposed to let our light shine before men that they can see our good

216
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:05,000
 works and glorify our Father in heaven. Now the distinction here is that in

217
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,520
 Matthew 6:1 Jesus tells us, "Don't do things to please men," and in Matthew 5:16

218
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,840
 Jesus tells us, "Do things to please God." It's not really about hiding your

219
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:21,920
 actions from other people. It's about having the right heart motivation as you

220
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,800
 do them. And so that's another thing we need to understand about what hypocrisy

221
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:31,200
 is. Hypocrisy is when we undertake actions, even good actions, in order to

222
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,560
 give ourselves an image in front of other people rather than in order to

223
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:40,040
 please God. So how can we avoid hypocrisy? How can we avoid doing this? How can we

224
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:45,320
 avoid doing things for the wrong reasons? How can we avoid doing them to please

225
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:49,760
 other people or because other people are watching instead of doing them for God?

226
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,800
 How can we avoid giving other people an image of ourselves that doesn't agree

227
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:59,520
 with who we actually are in our heart? Well, Jesus has already given us a pretty

228
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,560
 good formula in the Beatitudes. Remember the first Beatitude, Jesus talks about

229
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:08,800
 poverty of spirit, and we talked a lot about what that is, that it's

230
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,000
 understanding your own spiritual bankruptcy and your own spiritual

231
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,600
 brokenness before God. And I think that's a foundational value that will help us

232
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,320
 to avoid hypocrisy. If we're operating from a place of humility where we

233
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:27,520
 understand our own need for God and we understand how broken we are, then we

234
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,760
 won't be trying to show other people that we're better than them. We won't be

235
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,200
 trying to give someone else an image of our own greatness or our own goodness or

236
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,760
 our own righteousness, because we'll understand who we really are. And I think

237
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,920
 that's a really important place for us to start as we think about how to avoid

238
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:50,840
 hypocrisy. But I think also, as I said, all of us as humans are hypocrites. All of us

239
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,960
 don't want other people to see that we might make a mistake or that we

240
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,720
 might be less than what we want to be. And so another important part of

241
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,360
 avoiding hypocrisy is being able to repent, being able to look at our life

242
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:08,320
 and say, "You know what? I wasn't fully honest with the people around me about

243
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:12,720
 who I am. I tried to give them a perception or an image that I'm

244
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,720
 something that I'm not, and I need to repent of that." Be honest and repent

245
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,880
 before God, first of all. Take that to God and say, "God, that wasn't right. I know

246
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:25,680
 it was wrong. Will you forgive me? Will you help me not to do that in the future?"

247
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:31,040
 But also, if you need to repent before someone else, and what I mean by that is

248
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:36,600
 you can ask their forgiveness. If you've done something that was hypocritical

249
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,760
 and it's been hurtful to someone in your life and you know that it's been

250
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,920
 hurtful to them, then you should go to them and ask forgiveness and say, "Hey, I

251
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:50,160
 know I represented myself as this and that's not who I am," or "I know I asked

252
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:55,400
 you to live to some standard that I didn't live up to. I know I asked you to

253
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,280
 to do things and respond in a certain way, and then I didn't respond in that

254
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:05,640
 way. I know I got frustrated at you for getting upset or for struggling in

255
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:10,320
 this area, and that's the area where I struggle, and I get upset about those

256
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,840
 same things all the time." If your hypocrisy has harmed someone else, then

257
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:19,920
 repent to them. Go say, "Hey, I'm sorry, and that wasn't right, and I want to

258
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,400
 be more transparent in the future, and I want to be more honest about my

259
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,320
 struggles, and I don't want to present myself as something that I'm not."

260
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:32,520
 Obviously, we can always ask God, and we can say, "God, can you really help me?"

261
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:37,360
 This is an area where you struggle, where you find yourself a lot of times

262
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,240
 presenting yourself to other people as someone that you're not, and trying to

263
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,880
 show yourself as better than others, or trying to show yourself as more

264
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,760
 righteous than others, or whatever it is. If you struggle in that area, ask for

265
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,600
 God's help, and say, "God, can you help me to stay humble? Can you help me to be

266
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,640
 honest and transparent about my struggles in my life, and not to hide

267
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,040
 that from other people? Can you help me to not try to put some image out there,

268
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:05,560
 to not act like I don't make mistakes?" Then, obviously, the truth

269
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:09,520
 that we talked about last week, that surrender, whereby you say, "God, I know

270
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:14,280
 the reality is I'm not going to be perfect as my Heavenly Father is

271
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,360
 perfect. I'm not going to live up to your standard, and I'm going to surrender to

272
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,800
 you, and let Jesus live through me, so that when people look at me, they will

273
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:27,840
 see the reality of the situation. They will see the reality of what it means to

274
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,000
 be a Jesus follower, to be a subject of the kingdom. Here's the reality that

275
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,120
 people should see in our lives. Here's the reality that I pray people see in my

276
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:41,680
 life. When someone looks at my life, I want them to see me as a broken person.

277
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:46,760
 I don't want them to see me as some type of great spiritual giant. I want them to

278
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:51,240
 see me as a broken person, but I want them to see the love of Jesus and the

279
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:55,640
 attributes of Jesus shining through me. That's what we should pray for, and

280
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,920
 that's what we should surrender to. We should say, "God, I want Jesus to live

281
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:04,040
 through me, so that when people look at me, they won't see my perfection. They'll

282
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:09,040
 see Jesus' perfection." Because when we are hypocritical and we act like we're

283
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:14,120
 something we're not, we put the focus on us. It's hard for people to see Jesus.

284
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,840
 Even if they buy into our hypocrisy, they're just going to think we're the most

285
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,000
 amazing person that ever lived, and they'll never see Jesus. We don't

286
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,960
 want that. We don't want that. It's unhealthy, and it puts us on a pedestal

287
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:29,640
 we were never meant to be on. It puts us on a pedestal that, once we fall

288
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:34,080
 off, it disappoints and discourages people. We don't want to live that way. We

289
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:40,160
 should want people to see our brokenness and to see the perfection of Jesus.

290
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:44,920
 As John the Baptist said, we should be decreasing so that Jesus can be

291
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:50,560
 increasing. That point of surrender will help us to avoid hypocrisy in our

292
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:54,280
 life, to say, "God, I want to surrender to you and let you live through me, so that

293
00:22:54,280 --> 00:23:00,800
 people are seeing you and not me." Let's pray. God, thank you for the reality of

294
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:04,680
 your truth. Thank you for the way you don't let us get away with our mess.

295
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:11,120
 God, our hypocrisy is mess. It is a problem. It is so toxic and so hurtful.

296
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,360
 It's so hurtful to us to pretend that we're something we're not. It's so

297
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:20,840
 hurtful to the people around us, and it's definitely hurtful to our witness in the

298
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:25,200
 world as believers, as we try to share the gospel and share your love. If we are

299
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:30,280
 being hypocrites, then it destroys our witness. God, I pray that you would

300
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:36,440
 really work in our hearts. Help us to see the reasons that we act that way. Help us

301
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:41,640
 to see our pride or our fear or ways that we've been deceived and to turn away

302
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:46,040
 from those things. God, help us to see that we can't meet your standard and we

303
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:52,000
 shouldn't act like we do. God, help us to see that you desire for us to live

304
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,600
 in a way that's pleasing to you, not just trying to please other humans. God,

305
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:02,440
 help us to live in a place of poverty of spirit, humility, repentance. God, help us

306
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:07,000
 to live from the place of surrender so that Jesus is able to live through us.

307
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,800
 God, help us to avoid hypocrisy. Help us to avoid putting out an image that we're

308
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,680
 perfect or that we are doing everything right or that we're something that we're

309
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:21,640
 not. Help us to live in an honest and transparent way so that our witness is

310
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:25,880
 amplified and so that when people look at our lives, they see less and less of

311
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:33,840
 us and more and more of Jesus. God, we just ask these things in your name. Amen.
