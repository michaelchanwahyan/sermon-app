[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960]   Hey brothers and sisters, good to see you guys again.
[00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.200]   Especially the college adults,
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.800]   it's good to see you guys back.
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:13.780]   Oh yeah, I have been cutting my hair for the last two years
[00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.380]   and I kinda messed it up, so I gotta start over again.
[00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.680]   Yeah, so I did save a lot, but I appreciate it.
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.560]   Let's bow our heads, let's get ready for God's message.
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.120]   Father, we thank you
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.220]   that you are the everlasting God,
[00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.560]   that you have so much
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.800]   that you probably need to take care of, Lord.
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.940]   But yet, you would spend Sunday,
[00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.940]   a day that you command us,
[00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.000]   where we need to pay attention to you, Father.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.380]   Lord, it's for our own good and it's for your glory, Lord.
[00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.140]   And we pray that everyone here,
[00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.480]   may your spirit be with us,
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.380]   may you open our hearts, Lord, to receive your message.
[00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.120]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.820]   Well, a couple of time ago,
[00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.800]   I probably told you guys that I had a family feud
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.540]   between my uncles, you know, who, over some inheritance,
[00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:12.940]   it's not like 100 million or anything,
[00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.500]   it's like, it's like child change, you know.
[00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.340]   Because of my grandmother died, you know.
[00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.140]   It's feel like these relationships are broken right now,
[00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.640]   because of greed and pride.
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.320]   They're still not on talking terms as of now,
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.160]   as I know.
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.520]   But I just want you guys to think about the church.
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.100]   How are relationships broken or strained in the church?
[00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.560]   Think about that.
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.400]   What caused these broken relationships?
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.800]   What caused these strains?
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.280]   Well, I can tell you, I mean, based on my experience,
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.420]   probably a lot of you guys have been through it too.
[00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.480]   A lot of things could be like gossiping, you know,
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.380]   being arrogant, being prideful of yourself,
[00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.260]   or even it could get to a point like being unable
[00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.560]   to share power between the leaders and the congregants,
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.120]   right, how things should be done.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.220]   These could cause a lot of disunity.
[00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.840]   But the reality is that, as we are in the fallen world,
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.260]   I mean, the way how we do things,
[00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.540]   I mean, a lot of times it leads to our,
[00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.780]   I mean, prideful arrogance, which leads to sin, you know,
[00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.080]   which cause friction among the body of Christ.
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.840]   That God, I mean, that God,
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.920]   he did everything he could to establish this church,
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.760]   this body.
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.520]   Therefore, do we just accept the way it is?
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.960]   Well, the world is broken, right, it's fallen.
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.740]   The way how we act, is this the way we should accept
[00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:47.740]   this reality?
[00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.840]   Absolutely not.
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.000]   Because God expects more of us than this.
[00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.460]   So today, I want to
[00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.940]   talk about the relationship in the church.
[00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.640]   How do we conduct ourselves?
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.780]   In the past semesters, I talked about how did Jesus Christ
[00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.540]   establish this church, right?
[00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.880]   How, at the end, we have to be united
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.240]   and be mature inside the church,
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.720]   but how do we relate to each other?
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.380]   Today, I want to talk about that.
[00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.220]   (papers rustling)
[00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:28.380]   This is the thought, yeah, how we conduct ourselves.
[00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.060]   Okay, the first point I want to talk about is like,
[00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.320]   do not give the devil a foothold.
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.420]   Do not give him a stronghold in your life.
[00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:41.820]   So, starting on Ephesians chapter four, verse 25 to 28,
[00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.700]   it says, "Therefore, each of you must put off falsehood
[00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.000]   "and speak truthfully to your neighbors.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.380]   "For we are a member of one body.
[00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.500]   "In your anger, do not sin.
[00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.180]   "Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry.
[00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.780]   "And do not give the devil a foothold.
[00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:05.820]   "Anyone who has been stealing must steal no longer,
[00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.620]   "but must work together, do something useful
[00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.060]   "with their own hand, that they may have something
[00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.660]   "to share with those in need."
[00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.960]   Now, right here, Paul starts with,
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.960]   "Therefore," that means there's a relationship
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:20.460]   from a previous passage to this one right here.
[00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:23.340]   Yes, the previous passage, which is chapter four,
[00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.040]   verse 17 to 24, talks about the general principle
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.780]   of the difference between the old man,
[00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.380]   which is your old identity, your pagan identity,
[00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.740]   comparing it to the new identity, which is in Christ.
[00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.260]   So, it's a very general comparison, telling us
[00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.380]   we must put on our new man, our new person,
[00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.300]   get rid of the old person.
[00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.160]   Right here, Paul is giving us some specific guidelines
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.060]   of how we should conduct ourselves among brothers
[00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.900]   and sisters in the church.
[00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.200]   So, let's take a look at this.
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.640]   Here, Paul gives a list of actually,
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.740]   a list of vice and virtues, of what we shouldn't do
[00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.380]   and what we should do.
[00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.480]   So, virtues are things that kinda like unite us,
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.860]   and in contrast, vice are things that disrupt
[00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.220]   the unity of the community.
[00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.420]   So, the first thing that you see in verse 25
[00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:19.220]   is basically, it says, you gotta put off falsehood.
[00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.620]   The first vice is lying.
[00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.220]   This is the mark of the old person,
[00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.600]   which is corrupted by sin.
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.200]   But, Paul says, this is not enough.
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.400]   We can't just stop lying.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.440]   You have to replace it with a virtue,
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.340]   and that virtue right here is that we must speak truthfully.
[00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.980]   But, why?
[00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.020]   I mean, the motivation is that because we,
[00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:46.020]   as the second part, it says, we are all members of one body.
[00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.560]   We are part of the body of Christ.
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.420]   We have to put on this new person here.
[00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:55.020]   So, besides that, speaking the truth to each other
[00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.560]   is also a direct quote that Paul uses from Zacharias.
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.960]   It's a old, Zacharia, the book of Zacharia
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.800]   is a Old Testament book.
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.000]   It talks about what God's promised about the new Jerusalem.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.340]   So, these are, this is what happened.
[00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.540]   During that time, they were allowed to come back
[00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:13.980]   during the Persian Empire.
[00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.880]   They have been exiled for 70 years.
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.180]   They came back, and God's telling them,
[00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.120]   you guys will inherit Jerusalem again, right?
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.120]   Since Paul is using this quote here,
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.220]   it seems like he's talking to us.
[00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.100]   We're the recipient of that promise.
[00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:34.440]   And, these are the promises that the prophets
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.000]   and apostles are making known to us right now.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.100]   I mean, us in terms of what I'm talking in their context
[00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.300]   to the first generation Christians
[00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.740]   that no one knows until they reveal it to them right now.
[00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.220]   So, it is significant for us.
[00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.440]   It's just that we are the recipients of this.
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.880]   We have to behave accordingly to who we are.
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.860]   Therefore, speaking the truth is a sign of this new person
[00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:02.700]   because God is truthful.
[00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:07.600]   As we move on to verse 26,
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:12.600]   the second thing is sinning in your anger.
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.040]   That's the thing Paul wants us not to do.
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.100]   We should stop sinning when we're angry.
[00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.840]   Paul is also quoting, actually, from Psalms 4.
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.780]   You know, he's quoting about Psalms David wrote,
[00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:27.680]   claiming that he is being slandered
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.320]   because of crimes that he did not commit.
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.520]   He is sure of that.
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:33.560]   Therefore, what does he do?
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.760]   He cries out to the Lord,
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.560]   and his anger turned to joy and peace.
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.560]   Now, this peace and joy,
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.760]   despite the situation you're in,
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.360]   is a mark of a new person.
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.560]   Now, as we continue to take a look,
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:52.580]   it seems like anger, seems like it's permitted.
[00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:56.380]   So, is anger in general okay, we're asking?
[00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:00.880]   Well, I would tell you being angry for the wrong reason,
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.920]   of course, is obviously not right.
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:07.880]   However, can we be angry for a righteous cause?
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.420]   Like, if you see oppression,
[00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:14.500]   or you see injustice, of course we can.
[00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:16.560]   There's such thing as a righteous anger, right?
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.160]   God has righteous angers.
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:24.300]   But I could tell you, rarely our angers are righteous.
[00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:28.740]   Even if it is, do not let it boil.
[00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:32.420]   So, because as the second part says, right,
[00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:34.920]   do not give the devil a foothold, right?
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:37.720]   Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry.
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.460]   So, you gotta get rid of it quickly.
[00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:43.960]   So, because our natural,
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:47.060]   we still have our old person within us, you know?
[00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:50.700]   It's suddenly kinda like, let us feel like,
[00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.740]   oh, whatever we always experience, our anger,
[00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:56.240]   must be righteous, but other people's anger
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.440]   is always like a tantra, bad temper, right?
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:02.860]   So, they must be wrong, I must be right.
[00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:05.800]   But I'm telling you guys, brothers and sisters,
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.100]   better assume the worst in us.
[00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.680]   When you have anger, I mean, better assume
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.740]   it might mostly not be righteous,
[00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.020]   because it could be damaging to relationship.
[00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:17.940]   Let me give you an example.
[00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:21.480]   For me and my son, right, I told you guys,
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.320]   I mean, my son is here, but you know.
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:27.660]   During this time, I feel like he's in a terrible three,
[00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:30.960]   right, whatever I tell him to do, he does not do.
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.900]   If I tell him not to do it, he will do it.
[00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:36.500]   Even when I feel like I have to talk to him,
[00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:39.800]   I yell at him, whatever, I feel like I'm right.
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.000]   But in the heated moment, I could tell you,
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.300]   my discipline will not be the best,
[00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:47.140]   because I'm very emotional at the time.
[00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:49.420]   Like, it's quite personal, right?
[00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:50.520]   Let's talk a little bit about more
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:52.720]   that we could relate to the body of Christ.
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.320]   Like, I remember, not remember,
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.080]   it's still happening right now, right?
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:57.680]   The last couple years in Hong Kong,
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.380]   there's some social unrest, right?
[00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:03.320]   I'm not talking about commenting
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.560]   on anything political right here,
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:07.520]   but more of like, during that unrest,
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:08.960]   during these couple years,
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:14.500]   I mainly look at how we respond as Christians, right?
[00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:18.600]   Especially, they kinda, what I saw,
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:22.140]   is that there became two factions, right?
[00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:24.940]   One has a different, has one viewpoint,
[00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:26.740]   the other has a different viewpoint.
[00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:29.780]   The thing is that, what I saw is that,
[00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:33.320]   despite that emotion, that anger,
[00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.580]   at the end, they were at each other's throat,
[00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:38.720]   and they did not talk to each other, right?
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:42.020]   I even see that from some of my own brothers and sisters,
[00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:45.420]   and man, that was tough to see.
[00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.400]   What I'm trying to tell you is that,
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:49.700]   even with the best intention,
[00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:52.000]   our emotion will cloud our judgment.
[00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:57.380]   So, as I said, if you continue to look at verse 27,
[00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:00.520]   it seems to suggest that anger is not caused by the devil,
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.880]   but Satan will use it against you
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.360]   to disrupt the body of Christ.
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.420]   But let's come back to this issue in a moment.
[00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:09.960]   Let's go to verse 28.
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:14.800]   The third vice is stealing,
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:18.760]   and the virtue is not just to not steal anymore,
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:21.340]   that's not enough, Paul is saying.
[00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:23.540]   We need to work in order to have something
[00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:25.100]   to share with others in our community,
[00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:26.500]   that's what he's saying.
[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:30.700]   Instead of having something that you have negative,
[00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.780]   we just don't turn it to zero,
[00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:35.380]   we don't just neutralize it, as a Christian.
[00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:38.340]   A lot of things, we have to have a plus,
[00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:41.260]   from negative, not just a zero, but a plus.
[00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:45.060]   And right here, as you see the word work,
[00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:48.620]   in this context, it means to labor extremely hard
[00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:51.160]   to the point of fatigue.
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.260]   So we have to do our best with our abilities,
[00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.660]   with our mind, to work, so why?
[00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:01.760]   It says so we can have something to present to others,
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.160]   especially the ones in need.
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:06.040]   Why?
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:07.740]   Because we have to make contribution to the body of Christ,
[00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:10.240]   for the sisters.
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:15.240]   Now, this letter didn't address any specific problems
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:19.520]   towards the Ephesian church, mainly,
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:21.180]   but it's also a circulating letter.
[00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:23.080]   I mean, other churches will read this.
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:27.560]   These vice might be like a general practice
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:29.820]   that Christians, during that time,
[00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:32.260]   after they have been converted to the new person,
[00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.920]   they might continue to be engaging
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.900]   in some of these activities.
[00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:38.740]   I mean, stealing, along with other things,
[00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:41.760]   are probably still acceptable during that time.
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.440]   Why?
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:44.700]   They don't have social programs
[00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:46.200]   during that time in the Roman world.
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.640]   I mean, you have to make a living somehow, right?
[00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:51.640]   But the thing is that, what Paul is saying,
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.640]   but we have to get rid of those things.
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:56.140]   If you are gonna be a new person,
[00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:57.480]   you have to get rid of these things.
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:58.740]   These are not acceptable.
[00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:04.480]   Because these things are causing harm
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:06.180]   to brothers and sisters, right here.
[00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:07.680]   Now, let's get back to verse 27.
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:09.880]   This kind of summarizes the points right here.
[00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:14.160]   Giving a foothold, right?
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.320]   I could tell you, right,
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.460]   Satan do not want anyone to be Christians
[00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:19.860]   or to live in a Christian manner.
[00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:24.100]   It means when we give him a foothold,
[00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:29.780]   that means we do not reflect the new person.
[00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:31.900]   We do not reflect Christ-like behavior.
[00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:36.880]   Our lies, our angers, our stealing, you know.
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:38.920]   This is what the devil needs.
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:40.380]   He need you to do these things
[00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:43.920]   in order for him to infiltrate the church.
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:48.620]   I mean, one of the reasons why relationship is so difficult,
[00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.420]   because Satan attacks them.
[00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:55.320]   He wants to undermine what God has created.
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.700]   So, what in the world is really a foothold?
[00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:58.960]   Take a look.
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:02.760]   Imagining yourself being chased by a bad person,
[00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:04.440]   and you get to a point, you get to your house,
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.680]   and you close the door and shut 'em off.
[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:10.780]   But no, this person is able to stick one foot in the door.
[00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:13.480]   And think about it, when his foot is here,
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.880]   you can't close that door completely.
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:19.220]   So, basically, this is what the devil is doing every time.
[00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:21.380]   When you can't close the door,
[00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:23.920]   he's able to come in, give you a whisper.
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:27.420]   Hey, do this, this is good, stealing is good.
[00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:29.800]   You're just doing a little stealing, it's okay.
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:32.760]   It's nothing, you're not gonna hurt anyone.
[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:35.060]   He's continuing to influence your life right here
[00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:37.000]   with that foothold.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.200]   So, in conclusion, brothers and sisters,
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.280]   we need to get rid of the devil's foothold
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:43.280]   at the church door.
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:51.080]   Therefore, we gotta produce these virtuous behavior
[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:53.280]   that will serve others in the community.
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:55.720]   This is a practical step to continue
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:57.460]   to maintain this unity in Christ.
[00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:01.900]   The second point I wanna talk about
[00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:03.840]   is don't grieve the Holy Spirit,
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:06.300]   which consists of verse 29 to 32.
[00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:11.640]   Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouth,
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:14.000]   but only what is helpful for building others up
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.780]   according to their needs.
[00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:18.580]   That it may benefit those who listen,
[00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:21.420]   and do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God,
[00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:24.780]   with whom you were seated for the day of redemption.
[00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:28.860]   Get rid of all bitterness, rage, and anger,
[00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:32.860]   brawling and slander, along with every form of malice.
[00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:36.000]   Be kind and compassionate to one another,
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:42.560]   Now in the second point,
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:47.060]   after talking about these lies, these angers, these stuff,
[00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:50.940]   Paul seems to returning to the first topic of speech.
[00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:55.080]   The first topic of speech is speaking the truth in love.
[00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:58.580]   Here, Paul's telling us not to engage
[00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:02.220]   in unwholesome or harmful speech.
[00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:06.120]   But the thing is, our culture makes that a norm.
[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:08.020]   It kinda infiltrates into our church.
[00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:09.860]   Think about it, here's some examples.
[00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:15.420]   I always see, especially with ones with a consumer mindset.
[00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:19.100]   Wow, our church, look at that nursery, man, it's so small.
[00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:21.540]   You know, I wish there was a slide in there.
[00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:23.660]   It would make the nursery way better.
[00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:25.400]   You know those Sunday school teachers?
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:26.740]   It's not passionate at all.
[00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:30.140]   If they were more passionate, we have better curriculums,
[00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:33.240]   I think my kid would join, so I can't come to church.
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:37.520]   Oh, my church doesn't have a coffee machine, you know?
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:39.920]   I can't get free coffee, man, that sucks.
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:42.980]   Or come on, we need some sofa here, you know?
[00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:46.460]   I mean, it's always consuming, like what we don't have,
[00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:48.860]   what we don't have, this or that, you know?
[00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:51.560]   This is that consumer mindset.
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:54.700]   Another thing is that, I would say, I don't know,
[00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:58.000]   I hear this a lot from the Chinese churches.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.940]   If I have a problem with someone,
[00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:02.000]   I have a problem with person A right here,
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.200]   I will not talk to them,
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.840]   I cannot confront them directly.
[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:09.420]   It's always like, hey, do you know what person A did to me?
[00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:11.420]   Hey, do you know what person A did to me?
[00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:13.980]   But it's never confronted, face to face, you know?
[00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:15.580]   You never resolve the problem.
[00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:19.820]   And one more thing I wanna say is that
[00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:24.860]   we always like to criticize our leaders and pastors.
[00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:29.100]   Only if the pastor could do this or that, right?
[00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:32.160]   Only if the pastor could preach better.
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:33.740]   Dude, I'm telling you guys,
[00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:36.040]   the pastor is just a human being like us, right?
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:39.840]   He has his talent, he has his shortfall also.
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:42.480]   I can't expect a Pastor Mark to do everything perfectly
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:43.840]   and everything good.
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:46.780]   That's why you guys are here.
[00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:48.580]   That's why you guys are here.
[00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:51.980]   The body of Christ gave you guys give, right?
[00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:54.560]   We all have some special gifts,
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:57.060]   so you can't expect the leaders and the pastor
[00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:58.860]   to do everything and you're just sitting here
[00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:00.160]   complaining this and that.
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:05.000]   Now, instead of engaging in these harmful speech,
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.200]   engage in helpful speech, right?
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.800]   Speech that is beneficial.
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:14.940]   We need to build up our community according to our needs.
[00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:17.600]   Well, I would say this is what we should do.
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:19.580]   We gotta think about how we speak to each other,
[00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:23.640]   especially how we cannot harm other with these speeches.
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:26.440]   Watch out for our tones, for our demeanor,
[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:30.060]   so as we talk to each other, be wise and sensitive.
[00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:32.360]   Learn when and where is the right place
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.420]   to say what you want to say.
[00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:36.980]   How about encouraging each other?
[00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:41.880]   I feel like we as Asians, we like to criticize,
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:43.720]   but how about saying good job?
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:46.360]   I'm glad you did a good job, right?
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:47.360]   Nice try.
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:51.220]   We are all ever asked,
[00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:52.860]   hey, how are you guys doing these days?
[00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:54.960]   How are you guys doing emotionally, right?
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:57.900]   I mean, these are things we have to do more,
[00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:01.040]   something more positive to lift up our brothers and sisters
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:02.480]   with our speech.
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:05.280]   I mean, in this case, if we look at this context,
[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:08.780]   verse 29 flows well with verse 28,
[00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:11.180]   because both of these verse
[00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:12.880]   is to seek the benefit of others.
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:16.420]   Verse 28 is to seek the benefit of others with our actions,
[00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:20.100]   and verse 29 is to seek the benefit of others
[00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:21.720]   with our speech.
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:24.300]   These are really essential things
[00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:27.200]   for the good and the growth of the church.
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.400]   As we are obedient to scriptures,
[00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:33.180]   the concern of the growth and the good for the church
[00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:35.960]   should be natural to every one of us
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:37.920]   who profess faith in Jesus Christ.
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:40.820]   So think about it.
[00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:43.260]   Next time you see someone getting baptized,
[00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:45.740]   are you happy for that person?
[00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:48.740]   You're happy because that person
[00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:51.740]   pledged obedience to Jesus Christ,
[00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:55.240]   and Satan's kingdom is crumbling.
[00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:58.520]   Are we happy when someone else is shining up here
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:19:59.340]   besides us?
[00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:02.620]   Are we happy when we see someone
[00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:04.420]   is maturing in their Christian life?
[00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:06.560]   We should be happy.
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:07.660]   These are natural for us.
[00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:09.020]   It should be natural for us.
[00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:10.500]   Let's move on to verse 30.
[00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:15.400]   Besides trying to maintain this unity,
[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:17.700]   verse 30 also gives us another motivation
[00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:20.400]   to achieve that,
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:22.340]   which is to not grieve the Holy Spirit.
[00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:26.840]   We should not make the Holy Spirit sad or feel sorrow.
[00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:29.080]   Now, the Holy Spirit of God right here
[00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:31.420]   is a link to Isaiah, the book of Isaiah,
[00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:34.940]   in Old Testament, chapter 63, verse 10.
[00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:38.420]   I mean, right here, the Israelites are constantly sitting.
[00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:40.180]   Isaiah is a prophet, he's trying to tell them,
[00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:41.420]   you better come back to God,
[00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:43.460]   if not, bad things are gonna happen.
[00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:48.200]   So right here in this chapter,
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:50.620]   he's reminding the Israelites,
[00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:53.440]   how God saved you guys from the Egyptians
[00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:55.100]   and brought you into the wilderness,
[00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:56.640]   yet you guys are unfaithful.
[00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:02.680]   And God became their enemy and told them,
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:05.380]   you guys, this first generation of Israelites,
[00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:07.540]   will not enter the promised land.
[00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:11.120]   Hey, this same idea is applied to this verse
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:13.480]   of God's new people, the body of Christ.
[00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:16.220]   Hey, we have been sealed with the Holy Spirit.
[00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:17.920]   It's dwelling within us.
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:22.820]   We have been blessed with every blessing from Christ,
[00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:24.900]   and we are on to full redemption
[00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:27.860]   when all things are under the authority of Christ,
[00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:30.940]   when God bring that to one day.
[00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:33.900]   No, this taste, the taste of this glorious day,
[00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:36.780]   theoretically, should be seen in the church.
[00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:37.600]   It should be.
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:42.720]   But Satan is doing everything to undermine it.
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.580]   But guess what, brothers and sisters?
[00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:46.880]   It's useless.
[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:51.420]   Yes, we seem to be stumbling back and forth, right?
[00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:55.200]   We probably seem to be losing a battle there and here, right?
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.560]   But we didn't lose the war.
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:59.800]   Because the Spirit is greater than the devil.
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:04.000]   For the things that we still behave like the old person,
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.400]   the devil's foothold will still be on us.
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:08.880]   That grieves the Holy Spirit.
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:12.880]   So we need to behave like the new person.
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:15.740]   Build up the church, and when we build up the church,
[00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:19.020]   it simultaneously tears down the devil's stronghold.
[00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:22.980]   Let's move on and continue to verse 31 and 32.
[00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:26.020]   The next two verses is a summary of the way
[00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:28.480]   we should live by not grieving the Holy Spirit.
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:33.000]   If you take a look at 31, it gives a broad list of vice.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.400]   It's talking about bitterness, rage, and anger.
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.940]   These are very internal and personal.
[00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:41.060]   And from there, it goes to brawling and slander,
[00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:43.200]   to verbal and outward.
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:49.000]   And this results to every form of malice, of wickedness.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.620]   But in turn, Paul is saying right here in verse 32,
[00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:56.080]   we should be kind, compassionate to one another,
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:57.720]   forgiving one another.
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:02.960]   And Paul is saying, the motivation is found, right,
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:07.960]   at the end of verse 32, just as in Christ God forgave you.
[00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:11.560]   So basically, this is the higher order of command,
[00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:14.260]   of encouragement, you know.
[00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:16.040]   God demonstrate forgiveness,
[00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:19.080]   so you must also demonstrate forgiveness.
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:23.440]   Paul is referring back to his theology
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:26.380]   of what God has done for us in the first three chapters
[00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:27.580]   of Ephesians.
[00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:31.140]   What Christ has done for us,
[00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:33.680]   what God is currently doing in our lives,
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:36.180]   then we should be motivated to live the right way.
[00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:42.960]   So, if we're not motivated, this is how it would look like,
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.860]   I would say, if we grieve the Spirit.
[00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:49.940]   You're in a relationship, a lot of us are couples,
[00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:54.040]   if you're not in, probably you will have an idea.
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:56.380]   Relationships are complicated.
[00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:59.220]   As I know a person who lives in the state,
[00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:01.080]   recently, the wife
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:08.920]   found out that he was committing pornography
[00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:11.120]   since whenever, you know.
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:14.700]   And the wife found out,
[00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:18.160]   he told the congregation and the leaders,
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:19.860]   and this person had to step down.
[00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:24.860]   I'm so glad the wife did that,
[00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:26.960]   because it made this person, this friend,
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:28.340]   came to his sense.
[00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:33.740]   He still feel like, it did not hurt anyone,
[00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:35.200]   but myself, it's okay.
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:38.680]   But it hurt his wife,
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:41.080]   and other people in the congregation
[00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:42.380]   once they found out,
[00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:44.740]   because he deceived others in the church.
[00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:47.900]   So, the wife is obviously mad.
[00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:51.380]   I would say the main emotion is sad.
[00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:52.500]   But the thing is that,
[00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:55.640]   the wife is still there,
[00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:56.940]   but the wife says,
[00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:59.140]   "I don't trust whatever you're saying right now."
[00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:00.320]   You know?
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:01.920]   So, at nine o'clock,
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:04.080]   the computer is gonna be on a password.
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:08.280]   And they have to go to counseling, right?
[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:10.020]   The wife is really mad.
[00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:11.820]   If I could tell you one good thing
[00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:14.060]   that comes out of this, brothers and sisters,
[00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:18.120]   if the wife or the husband is still grieving,
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:20.060]   that means they're still in it, you know?
[00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:22.720]   They're still in this fight with you.
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:24.100]   If the Holy Spirit is still grieving,
[00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:26.260]   they're still in this fight.
[00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:27.800]   If one day your wife or your husband
[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:30.260]   or your girlfriend or a boyfriend said,
[00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:32.200]   or they don't have any emotion,
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:33.800]   "Oh, I don't care.
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:35.700]   "I don't care about that person anymore."
[00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:37.840]   Then you worry.
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:38.680]   Then I'm gonna tell you,
[00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:40.040]   your relationship is over.
[00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:42.380]   Do you wanna get to that point?
[00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:45.580]   I don't think the Spirit will get to that point
[00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:49.440]   in terms of our theology that we know.
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:54.420]   But grieving God's Holy Spirit is just like that, right?
[00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:57.820]   Let's not get to that point, right?
[00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:15.040]   And the last part I wanna talk to you about,
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:16.980]   the last point is point three, is imitate God.
[00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:18.620]   This is actually the conclusion
[00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:21.720]   Paul uses to end this passage.
[00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:26.620]   Now, after he's giving us
[00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:33.160]   Roddy's specific points of we should not steal,
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:37.200]   lie, or anger, he sums up his main point right here.
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:41.940]   He says, "Follow God's example.
[00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:43.940]   "Therefore, as dearly loved children,
[00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:45.640]   "and walk in the way of love,
[00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:48.880]   "just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:51.820]   "as a fragrant offering and sacrifice for God."
[00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:58.880]   As we identify as God's children,
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:02.360]   we are to walk in love, Paul is saying.
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:04.620]   And where's that motivation coming from?
[00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:06.220]   In verse two, it says,
[00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:10.160]   "Just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:13.040]   "as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God."
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:17.780]   We are to do the same, we are to have the same attitude.
[00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:19.700]   We are to imitate God.
[00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:25.440]   We are to walk by love by displaying sacrificial love
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:28.120]   to others, to our brothers and sisters.
[00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:32.420]   But you're saying, you might be thinking,
[00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:34.560]   it sounds impossible, right?
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:36.220]   But I want you to remember two things,
[00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:37.760]   my brothers and sisters.
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:40.560]   Number one, the Spirit is within us.
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:46.900]   He will complete the sanctification work within us.
[00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:49.980]   Therefore, we could speak truthfully to each other.
[00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:54.180]   Therefore, we can quickly subdue our anger.
[00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:56.280]   Therefore, we can supply others
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:28:01.280]   with our work to supply their needs.
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:05.280]   I mean, these are a couple of important virtues
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:07.960]   that Paul is talking about to build up the church.
[00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:12.860]   But the general principle Paul is saying is that
[00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:15.800]   the Spirit is greater than the devil.
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:18.540]   We can overcome any other sins
[00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:22.340]   that prevent us from maintaining this unity in Christ.
[00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:25.000]   The second thing I want you guys to understand is that
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.480]   this is the expectation of a normal church.
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:31.080]   This is what a church should look like, Paul is saying.
[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:32.180]   And God commands it.
[00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:35.420]   If God commands it, that means it's doable.
[00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:38.360]   And God will give you the resource to complete the job.
[00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:45.320]   Now think about a guy tearing down buildings.
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:49.040]   In 2004, during Hurricane Katrina,
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:51.260]   I had a chance to go down to New Orleans.
[00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:56.040]   My main job of ministry is to tear down houses
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:59.500]   because it was flooded and they need to tear down the walls.
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:03.280]   All I do is need a sledgehammer.
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:04.640]   It's not like rocket science.
[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:09.660]   I never majored in any sort of engineering.
[00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:11.860]   I know how to break stuff.
[00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:13.720]   It's so easy to break stuff, right?
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:15.820]   We're so natural.
[00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:17.260]   Breaking things is so easy.
[00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:19.560]   I've been breaking stuff.
[00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:21.200]   I have a good timeline.
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:22.660]   I can break things and not get in trouble.
[00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:23.500]   All right, good.
[00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:29.480]   But think about building something.
[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:33.840]   Building something, you really need to go to school for.
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:36.320]   You really need to know what you're doing.
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:39.080]   Your measurement has to be correct.
[00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:42.020]   Even if you layer these bricks,
[00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:44.520]   these bricks have to be very careful in building.
[00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:49.260]   Exactly what it is.
[00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:52.960]   Satan, stronghold in our lives,
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:55.160]   we could destroy things so easily.
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:59.400]   But maintaining this unity in the body of Christ is hard.
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:01.400]   It's really hard, brothers and sisters.
[00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:05.100]   But I want you to do one thing today.
[00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:09.340]   I want you to think about behavior that you could improve
[00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:13.120]   and do better to maintain the unity within the church.
[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:15.860]   One thing, I can't tell you to do a million things.
[00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:19.020]   I mean, we have a lot of work, but work on one thing.
[00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:21.480]   What is one thing that you could do better
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:24.020]   to contribute to the church to maintain this unity?
[00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:28.000]   Hey, since we know we are God's children
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.400]   and we know what he did for us,
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:33.160]   we therefore live like a princess
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:35.300]   or a prince of the king of king.
[00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:39.280]   Live like your truthful identity, brothers and sisters.
[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:41.180]   We have to choose to imitate God
[00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:43.540]   by walking in love towards each other,
[00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:47.280]   towards our fellow brothers and sisters in Christ
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:50.280]   with our speech and actions.
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:52.020]   So we could maintain this unity
[00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:54.960]   and at the same time be in a manifestation
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:58.060]   of what the glory of God would look like
[00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:00.700]   when the church operates normally.
[00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:01.520]   Let's pray.
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:04.860]   Father, we thank you.
[00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:08.260]   We thank you for the job of unity
[00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:09.660]   is already done through you.
[00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:13.980]   Thank you for giving us some specific instruction
[00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:18.980]   of how we can continue to maintain this unity, Lord.
[00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:24.180]   Father, as you gave us all the tools already,
[00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:25.780]   the spirit is within us.
[00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:29.320]   Help us continue to tear down
[00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:30.980]   those strongholds from the devil.
[00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:35.460]   Those footholds are very damaging, Lord.
[00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:38.520]   I pray nothing more, Lord,
[00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:43.500]   that we do not demonize our brothers and sisters
[00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:45.240]   for any other reasons, Lord,
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:49.400]   because our main identity is in Christ,
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:52.340]   not because I am a Chicagoan
[00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:56.340]   or I am from Hong Kong, I'm Chinese, or whatever.
[00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:58.120]   That's secondary.
[00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:01.580]   Our citizen in heaven is primary, Lord,
[00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:03.320]   and help us hold dear to that,
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:05.520]   knowing that we might have differences,
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:07.760]   but help us love each other.
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:10.960]   Help us have that sacrificial love, Lord,
[00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:13.960]   toward each other even though we might not have,
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:15.700]   we have different points of view, Lord.
[00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:19.600]   Help us walk like Jesus, Lord.
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:21.500]   Help us be like Jesus.
[00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:23.420]   We thank you for today and the message.
[00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:24.860]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
