[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.840]   - Well, good morning.
[00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.640]   It's fantastic to be here and enjoying worshiping
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:05.480]   with you all.
[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.280]   Thank you to the worship team for leading us
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.980]   in worship this morning.
[00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:09.820]   I'm excited to be here.
[00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.360]   I love being at UV.
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.500]   I love Christmas time.
[00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.500]   This is a really fun time of the year.
[00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.520]   And to begin with, I'm gonna ask you
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.320]   to use your imagination for just a moment
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.680]   and imagine one of the announcements that we just heard,
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.600]   the Christmas dinner, the UV Christmas dinner.
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.940]   It's been a few years since I've been to one,
[00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.400]   but I used to be at the UV Christmas dinner every year.
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.320]   And so just imagine that in your mind,
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.280]   or if you haven't been to one,
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.400]   you can imagine another feast that you've been at.
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.400]   Think about all that food that is there
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.420]   just spread out on the mini tables,
[00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.340]   and it's so amazing and so good.
[00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.440]   One of the problems that I have
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.160]   when I get to a feast like that
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.680]   is there's so much good stuff and I wanna eat all of it,
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.240]   but I know that I physically cannot,
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.120]   so I have to kind of choose what I'm gonna eat, right?
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.060]   And there's so many options, so many choices.
[00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.620]   And the reality is we all have favorites.
[00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.540]   We all have kind of our go-tos,
[00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.300]   especially at a big feast like that,
[00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.860]   the things that we want.
[00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.460]   And so sometimes, at least what I do,
[00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.820]   is I go to the things I know I really enjoy,
[00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.260]   to my favorites.
[00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.420]   And even though there's other really good stuff,
[00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.420]   I never actually get to it.
[00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.060]   I never try some of those other things
[00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.460]   just because I always end up eating my old favorites
[00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.900]   and I can't eat it all.
[00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.560]   And so there's something off to the side
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.440]   that I forget about.
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.900]   And sometimes that happens to us
[00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.840]   with the themes and the stories of Christmas and Advent.
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.420]   It's literally like a feast.
[00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.200]   There's so much to think about
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.360]   in terms of theologically and spiritually
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.960]   in terms of Advent and Christmas.
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.400]   And there's so many beautiful themes here
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.300]   of Jesus coming to earth.
[00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.720]   We have the marvel of the miraculous virgin birth,
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.640]   supernaturally conceived by the Holy Spirit.
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.800]   We think about the miracle, the incarnation,
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.560]   that the word was made flesh,
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.320]   God was made human, Emmanuel, God with us.
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.920]   That's one of my favorite themes, such a powerful theme.
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.840]   We think about the unveiling of Jesus as Savior
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.680]   and the verse that we heard earlier from the worship team
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.400]   where the angel spoke and said,
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.660]   "This is good news for the whole world."
[00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.040]   All of those themes are so beautiful
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.520]   and they're the heart of the gospel.
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.120]   And so we should enjoy them,
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.220]   just like our favorite foods at the feast.
[00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.520]   We should go to those places every year
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.600]   and be encouraged and blessed by them.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.040]   But we can't forget about some of the other themes.
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.680]   And that's what we're gonna talk about today,
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.880]   a theme that is here in the story
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.060]   that maybe sometimes we just forget about
[00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.240]   because some of the other themes are so thrilling to us.
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.180]   And that is that Jesus came as king.
[00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.400]   That when Jesus came to the earth,
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.120]   the king was born, the king of the kingdom.
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.480]   And what that means for us,
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.800]   because the incarnation and the nativity story is beautiful,
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.440]   but it didn't just stop there.
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.080]   It went on, obviously, to the cross.
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.340]   But during the ministry of Jesus,
[00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.000]   he talked about the kingdom of God a lot.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   He talked about the kingdom that was and is and is coming.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.720]   And Jesus gave us this theme.
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.400]   So that's what we're gonna consider this morning.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.920]   We're gonna look at it in Matthew chapter two,
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.480]   because interestingly enough,
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.520]   even though there's a lot of people in the Christmas story
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.940]   who didn't say anything about the king,
[00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.880]   didn't seem to get that,
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.180]   this one group of people did.
[00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.560]   These people from a whole 'nother land,
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.820]   these Gentiles from another land, they were not Jewish,
[00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.480]   but they understood that the coming of Jesus
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.320]   was the coming of a king.
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.920]   And they traveled all this way to come see him
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.480]   as the wise men or the magi.
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.120]   So we're gonna look at the verse 12 verses
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.160]   of Matthew chapter two.
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.240]   It says, "Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.680]   "in the days of Herod the king,
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.720]   "behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem,
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.860]   "saying, 'Where is he who has been born king of the Jews?
[00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.560]   "'For we saw his star in the east
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.480]   "'and have come to worship him.'
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.760]   "When Herod the king heard this,
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.440]   "he was troubled and all Jerusalem with him.
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.060]   "And assembling all the chief priests
[00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.040]   "and scribes of the people,
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.560]   "he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.520]   "They told him, 'In Bethlehem of Judea,
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.120]   "'for so it is written by the prophet,
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.520]   "'and you, O Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.140]   "'are by no means least among the rulers of Judah.
[00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.640]   "'For from you shall come a ruler
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.160]   "'who will shepherd my people Israel.'
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.960]   "Then Herod summoned the wise men secretly
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.040]   "and ascertained from them what time the star had appeared.
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.200]   "And he sent them to Bethlehem,
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.640]   "saying, 'Go and search diligently for the child.
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:41.720]   "'And when you have found him,
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.520]   "'bring me word that I too may come and worship him.'
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.240]   "After listening to the king, they went on their way.
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.400]   "And behold, the star that they had seen when it rose
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.440]   "went before them until it came to rest
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.660]   "over the place where the child was.
[00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:54.800]   "When they saw the star,
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.480]   "they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy.
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.660]   "And going into the house,
[00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.640]   "they saw the child with Mary's mother.
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.860]   "And they fell down and worshiped him.
[00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.040]   "Then opening their treasures,
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.620]   "they offered him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh.
[00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.620]   "And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod,
[00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.900]   "they departed to their own country by another way."
[00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.220]   Well, these guys, this is an amazing part
[00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.940]   of the Christmas story and supernatural and miraculous,
[00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.180]   like so many other parts of the Christmas story.
[00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.500]   And there's a lot of stuff we could talk about here.
[00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.860]   We could talk about the star.
[00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.020]   That's one of my favorite parts
[00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.200]   of the story of the wise men.
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.860]   We could talk about just them.
[00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.100]   They're very interesting
[00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.260]   'cause there's so little information about them.
[00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.780]   Obviously, in tradition,
[00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.380]   people assume there was three of them,
[00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.780]   but that's not told to us in the scripture.
[00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:45.860]   It's just the three gifts.
[00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.740]   So people assume there was three people.
[00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.340]   But there probably actually were more.
[00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.200]   They probably would have traveled in a much larger group.
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.700]   And even if there were just three,
[00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.320]   they would have had a lot of servants with them.
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.660]   So this was not just a couple of people.
[00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.780]   This was a large group of people,
[00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.500]   which is one of the reasons that it says in verse three,
[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.460]   "When Herod the king heard this,
[00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.400]   "he was troubled in all Jerusalem with them."
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:10.740]   Whatever was going on was big enough
[00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.220]   that throughout the city of Jerusalem,
[00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.680]   people were taking notice.
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.260]   So this was a large group of people that came.
[00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.960]   But think about the journey that they went on.
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.620]   These are not Jewish people.
[00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:24.920]   We don't know exactly where they're from.
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:25.800]   They're from the east,
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.160]   but probably from the region of Persia,
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:33.220]   which there was a large Jewish community in Persia
[00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:35.500]   that had been there since the time of the exile.
[00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:40.080]   And so that's probably how these men had been exposed
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.560]   to the scripture and to the prophecies.
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:47.560]   But they traveled an enormous distance at enormous cost,
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:53.800]   gave up months of their life to pursue something
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.160]   that they couldn't see,
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:01.160]   that they didn't really know what they were pursuing after.
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.000]   And they were doing it on the basis
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.980]   of their faith and belief
[00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:10.060]   in the prophecies of the Hebrew scripture.
[00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.940]   And so these are actually pretty extraordinary individuals
[00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:16.760]   in an extraordinary part of the story.
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.560]   And one of the things that's really interesting
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.420]   is that here they come into Jerusalem
[00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:24.380]   with all these people who are Jewish,
[00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:25.600]   who know the scriptures,
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:30.540]   who have been anticipating the Messiah,
[00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:33.020]   and yet they're not getting it.
[00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:36.140]   They're not seeing that the king is being born
[00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.180]   and that this is happening right now.
[00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:41.740]   And the guys who do get it are these people
[00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:43.740]   from a distant land
[00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:46.300]   that God has supernaturally drawn and brought.
[00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:50.060]   And one of the things that lets us know
[00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:52.060]   when we think about the king,
[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:55.420]   Jesus as the king and the kingdom that he came to bring,
[00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:57.780]   is that if we're gonna see the king
[00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:00.060]   and know what's happening,
[00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:02.260]   we've got to believe in the kingdom.
[00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:03.820]   That was one of the real differences
[00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:06.380]   between the wise men, the Magi,
[00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:09.260]   and the rest, Herod and the rest of the people
[00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.700]   who just didn't know what was going on.
[00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.380]   The Magi obviously had been drawn by the spirit of God.
[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:17.020]   They didn't just come up with these things on their own.
[00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:19.960]   God drew them through the scriptures
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.400]   and drew them towards God's truth,
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.620]   and they believed it by faith.
[00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:29.840]   They had to have enormous faith to begin this journey
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.980]   and to continue on this journey.
[00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:34.380]   When you think about how long their journey was,
[00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:38.540]   they had to start at some point,
[00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:39.980]   had to have a lot of faith just to start,
[00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:41.740]   but then they traveled through the desert
[00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:43.300]   and traveled and traveled and traveled,
[00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:46.280]   and they had a lot of faith to keep going, to continue,
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:49.380]   to not say, okay, this was a fun camping trip,
[00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:51.160]   we enjoyed it for a while, but it's time to go back
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.460]   because it's not making sense to me anymore.
[00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:55.580]   Things are getting tough, things are getting challenging.
[00:08:55.580 --> 00:09:00.580]   These men believed in the kingdom.
[00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:02.980]   They believed that it was real.
[00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:04.500]   They believed that they were going to see,
[00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.580]   as they said in verse two,
[00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:08.900]   where is he who's been born king of the Jews?
[00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:11.940]   They believed that this king was being born.
[00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:14.340]   That's why they were traveling.
[00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:17.140]   And if they didn't, they wouldn't have made this journey.
[00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:22.300]   But the other people who didn't see it, who didn't get it,
[00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:24.580]   didn't believe in this kingdom.
[00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:29.300]   They thought the kingdom of the Jews was Herod.
[00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:30.940]   They thought the king of the Jews was right in front of them.
[00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.660]   Herod certainly thought that.
[00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:37.380]   They didn't see the kingdom that God was beginning,
[00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:39.460]   and so they didn't have any idea
[00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:41.180]   that the king was being born.
[00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:44.100]   They didn't believe it, they didn't see it.
[00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.100]   Now, that's not surprising.
[00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:50.500]   Jesus, in John 18, 36, he's talking to Pilate.
[00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.340]   This is at the very end of his life.
[00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:56.340]   Jesus answered, "My kingdom is not of this world.
[00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:57.700]   "If my kingdom were of this world,
[00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.020]   "my servants would have been fighting,
[00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:01.780]   "that I might not be delivered, O, to the Jews,
[00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:04.460]   "but my kingdom is not from this world."
[00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:06.580]   So it's not surprising that a lot of people missed it
[00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:08.980]   because Jesus was coming to set up a spiritual kingdom,
[00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:10.180]   not a physical kingdom.
[00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:13.260]   But that's something that we need to understand.
[00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.220]   That's a challenge for us, too.
[00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:17.540]   Because the kingdom of God is not a physical place,
[00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.500]   it's not a country on the map,
[00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:25.940]   we can miss out on how significant it is,
[00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:28.520]   and the world around us certainly doesn't see it,
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:30.660]   certainly often doesn't believe in it.
[00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:32.940]   The kingdom of God is a kingdom that has come,
[00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:35.700]   and that is coming, and that will come.
[00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:39.220]   It's the rule and reign of God,
[00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:42.580]   and it's existed since before the world began,
[00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:45.540]   and Jesus made it real in every way when he came to Earth
[00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:48.540]   and perfectly lived out the values of the kingdom of God,
[00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:51.100]   and by his life and death, opened the way for us
[00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:52.660]   to have relationship with God.
[00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:55.940]   The kingdom has come in that sense,
[00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:59.600]   but it is coming because it is not yet
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.780]   fully manifested here on Earth.
[00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:06.500]   It is partially manifested in us.
[00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:11.500]   Since Jesus came and died and started this new group
[00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:17.540]   of people, this new kingdom that we call the church,
[00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:20.620]   as we live under the rule and reign of God in our lives,
[00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:23.100]   and we live out the values of the kingdom,
[00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:26.260]   the love, the joy, the peace that God has called us to,
[00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.320]   we manifest the kingdom of God, right?
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.740]   We manifest the rule and reign of God in our lives,
[00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:34.900]   but there's a whole lot of people on our world
[00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:38.480]   who are not living under the rule and reign of God,
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.700]   and so the kingdom of God is not fully manifest,
[00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:44.140]   and that's why we continue to have a lot of problems,
[00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:48.140]   a lot of brokenness, a lot of injustice and war
[00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:49.220]   and all these terrible things,
[00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:52.140]   because the kingdom of God is not fully manifest,
[00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:55.740]   so even though it has come in Christ, it is still coming.
[00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:57.300]   It is not fully manifest yet.
[00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.780]   It will be fully manifest one day in heaven,
[00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:02.180]   and we know what the scripture says
[00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:05.100]   in Revelation chapter 21, these verses that say,
[00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:07.140]   in verse four, "He will wipe away every tear
[00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:09.180]   "from their eyes, and death shall be no more.
[00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:10.860]   "Neither shall there be mourning nor crying
[00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:13.820]   "nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.
[00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:15.280]   "And he who was seated on the throne said,
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.220]   "Behold, I am making all things new."
[00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:22.860]   The kingdom will be fully manifested in the future,
[00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:26.580]   and every brokenness will be healed,
[00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:28.660]   and there will be no more tears,
[00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:32.580]   and there will be no more death or sin or injustice,
[00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:36.940]   but we're not there yet, so the kingdom has come.
[00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:39.180]   It is coming right now through us,
[00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:41.860]   and it's coming in the future in heaven,
[00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:46.860]   but because it's not a physical kingdom,
[00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:48.900]   to believe in it requires faith,
[00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:51.180]   just like the wise men had to really believe
[00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:52.760]   that at the end of their journey,
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:54.180]   they were gonna find this king,
[00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:56.920]   otherwise they would have never stayed on the journey.
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:02.820]   We have to believe by faith that God's kingdom is real,
[00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:05.900]   and we have to believe that what God has said
[00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:10.380]   in his word is true, that God did lovingly create us
[00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:14.460]   in his image, that we have fallen away because of our sin,
[00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:16.660]   that we need a redeemer and a savior,
[00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:20.220]   that God in his love sent Jesus to be that savior.
[00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:22.260]   We have to believe those things by faith.
[00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.340]   If we don't, we're not gonna see the kingdom.
[00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:25.660]   We're gonna miss it.
[00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:27.500]   We're gonna miss what's happening right in front of us,
[00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:29.460]   just like Herod and all the other people.
[00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:30.820]   It was happening right in front of them,
[00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:32.620]   and they totally missed it,
[00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:35.420]   because they weren't looking with eyes of faith
[00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:36.700]   to see what God was doing,
[00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:39.540]   and so we have to look with eyes of faith and say,
[00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:41.580]   yeah, we believe what God is saying.
[00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:43.260]   There is a kingdom here.
[00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.040]   It's a spiritual reality that's bigger
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:48.540]   than anything in our physical reality,
[00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:53.540]   but it's not visibly manifested right in front of us,
[00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:56.720]   but we believe it by faith,
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:01.720]   and because we believe it by faith, we can know the king.
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:04.380]   That's the next thing that we see here,
[00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:06.260]   is that if we want to know the king,
[00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.460]   then we have to surrender to his reign.
[00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:13.000]   It's one thing to believe in the kingdom and to say,
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.180]   okay, I believe that it's real,
[00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:20.220]   but it's a whole 'nother matter to say,
[00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:22.000]   not only do I believe the kingdom is real,
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.120]   but the king is my king,
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:29.060]   and I'm gonna surrender to the reign of this king in my life,
[00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:32.620]   and if we think about what it means
[00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:33.840]   to be a follower of Jesus,
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.380]   that's what it means to follow after him.
[00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:38.760]   That's what it means to be a Christian.
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:42.440]   To come into the kingdom is what happens by grace
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.620]   through faith, where we acknowledge and say,
[00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:46.820]   I know I've sinned, I need a savior,
[00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:50.260]   and we trust in Christ to be our savior.
[00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:51.520]   That's how we come into the kingdom,
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:56.100]   but to live day by day as a follower of Jesus,
[00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:59.500]   we have to consistently, moment by moment,
[00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:02.060]   live out this process of surrender and saying,
[00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:04.300]   God, you're the king of my life,
[00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:07.300]   and I wanna live under your rule and reign,
[00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:09.340]   and that means I'm gonna live according to your values
[00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:12.520]   and your ideas, not my own or not anyone else's,
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:17.560]   and if we're gonna know the king, that's what we have to do.
[00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:21.960]   Now, that makes us uncomfortable, right?
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:24.920]   Even thinking about living under someone's reign
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:26.720]   makes us uncomfortable.
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.080]   There's a lot of reasons for that.
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:31.860]   Part of that is cultural, 'cause we live in America
[00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:35.640]   where we're very uncomfortable with monarchs, right?
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:36.640]   And there's nothing wrong with that.
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.800]   We're uncomfortable with monarchs for a good reason, right?
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:42.760]   Because we're very familiar with tyrannical forms of rule,
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:45.040]   and we're very uncomfortable with that,
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.100]   but this is a different type of kingdom.
[00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:51.000]   The kingdom of God is a perfect reign
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.160]   from a perfect kingdom with a perfect king.
[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:56.800]   There's no tyranny involved at all.
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:00.540]   In Matthew 20, Jesus speaks about the type of leadership
[00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:01.380]   that he gives.
[00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:02.400]   He's talking to the disciples.
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:03.880]   He says, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:05.340]   "lorded over them, and their great ones
[00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:06.760]   "exercised authority over them.
[00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:07.960]   "Shall not be so among you,
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:10.800]   "whoever would be great among you would be your servant."
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:12.960]   And then he says, "Even as the Son of Man
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:15.040]   "came not to be served, but to serve,
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.520]   "and to give his life as a ransom for many."
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:21.600]   Jesus himself said he didn't come to dominate people.
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.320]   He came to serve.
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:25.760]   This is a different type of king.
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:27.040]   But just because he's a servant,
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:29.120]   don't think that he's not a king.
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:32.280]   We sang that Andrew Peterson song earlier, "Is He Worthy?"
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:35.200]   And that song quotes some of the scripture
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.680]   from Revelation 4 and 5.
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:39.680]   In Revelation 4 and 5, you have this vision.
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:42.720]   John has this vision of heaven and what's going on there.
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:45.680]   And in chapter four, he talks about the throne
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:47.360]   and the worship of the creator.
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:48.320]   I'm not gonna read it right now,
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:49.480]   'cause there's a lot of verses.
[00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:51.620]   But if you have time, you can look at it later.
[00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:55.120]   And he describes these amazing creatures,
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:57.800]   these amazing angelic creatures,
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:01.640]   that are worshiping God every moment of every day.
[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:04.920]   It says they do not cease to worship God
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:06.760]   in verse eight of chapter four.
[00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:08.520]   And all they say is, "Holy, holy, holy
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:09.680]   is the Lord God Almighty,
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:12.000]   who was and who is and who is to come."
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.380]   And there's just this amazing scene
[00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:19.960]   of power and majesty and worship going on.
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:21.680]   And then in chapter five,
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:26.640]   it describes Christ, who's sitting on the right hand of God.
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.160]   And there's this angel in verse two
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:29.600]   who's proclaiming with a loud voice,
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.720]   "Who's worthy to open the book and to break the seals?"
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:33.240]   And it says, "No one," verse three,
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:35.320]   "No one in heaven or on the earth or under the earth
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:37.700]   was able to open the book and to look into it."
[00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:40.820]   No person, no human, no angel, no demon,
[00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:45.560]   no force, no power, anyone in the entire universe
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:47.680]   has the power to open this book.
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:51.440]   And John begins to weep in verse four,
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:54.480]   because no one can open the book.
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:55.880]   And one of the elders says to him, verse five,
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:56.720]   "Stop weeping.
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:59.880]   Behold, the lion, this is from the tribe of Judah,
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:02.440]   the root of David, has overcome,
[00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:04.980]   so as to open the book and its seven seals."
[00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:07.740]   And then we go on in the chapter,
[00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:12.360]   and the book is opened, and in verse 11,
[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:14.040]   it says, "And I looked and I heard the voice
[00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:15.440]   of many angels around the throne,
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:16.840]   and the living creatures and the elders,
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:18.440]   and the number of them was myriads and myriads
[00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:20.880]   and thousands of thousands, saying with a loud voice,
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:22.440]   "Worthy is the lamb that was slain
[00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:24.480]   to receive power and riches and wisdom
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.280]   and might and honor and glory and blessing."
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:32.240]   Every being, every power in heaven
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:38.120]   begins to praise Jesus, because of his worthiness,
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:41.480]   the worthiness of his sacrifice, the lamb who was slain.
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:43.480]   And then verse 13, "And every created thing,
[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:44.760]   which is in heaven and on the earth
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:46.720]   and under the earth and on the sea,
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.000]   and all things in them, I heard saying to him
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.360]   who sits on the throne unto the lamb,
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:53.080]   be blessing and honor and glory and dominion
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:54.800]   forever and ever."
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:58.360]   Everything else in creation joins this song of worship.
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:00.760]   First you have all of the heavenly beings
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:03.960]   and the heavenly powers praising Jesus,
[00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:08.160]   and then you have everyone on earth and every creature
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:12.600]   and everything on earth begins to join this song of worship.
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:16.060]   Verse 14, "And the four living creatures kept saying,
[00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:19.080]   "Amen, and the elders fell down and worshiped."
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:24.080]   Every thing in the universe worships the king.
[00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:29.960]   So yes, Jesus is a servant.
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.400]   He loves us, he cares for us,
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:35.320]   but don't think that he's not a king, because he is.
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:37.180]   Scripture makes that so clear.
[00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:43.880]   And the world tempts us to choose to surrender
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:47.760]   to other things and tries to get us to serve
[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:51.540]   other imposter kings, other false kings.
[00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:54.240]   And the world lies to us, the world says,
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:56.920]   "Well, the choice is between either serving God
[00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:59.800]   "and obedience to God and freedom."
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:03.220]   It gets old to serve God, it gets old to be a part of church,
[00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:05.740]   there's stuff that you're supposed to try to live right,
[00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:07.040]   and that's not fun.
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:09.960]   Be free and come over here and do whatever you want, right?
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:13.200]   That's the false choice that the world gives us.
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.340]   Well, that choice is a lie.
[00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:18.200]   It's a lie because there's no freedom from
[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:20.240]   without a freedom to.
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:24.800]   And it's not a choice between serving God and being free.
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:26.720]   It's a choice between serving God
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:29.620]   and serving some other imposter king, that's the choice.
[00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:33.160]   Are you gonna serve the true king,
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:36.040]   who by the way as we just read is a loving and good king,
[00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:39.680]   who will lead you into, in a loving and good way,
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:43.160]   into abundant life, or are you gonna serve
[00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:44.420]   some imposter king?
[00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:47.540]   Are you gonna serve self, or serve materialism,
[00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:51.720]   or serve power, or money, or achievement,
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:55.200]   or the influence of other people?
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:58.520]   You're gonna serve somebody, right?
[00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:00.640]   Bob Dylan wrote a song about it.
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.680]   It's actually a pretty good song if you've never heard it,
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.040]   you can listen to it sometime,
[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:05.280]   called "Gotta Serve Somebody,"
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:06.400]   and that's the point of the song,
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.600]   is saying listen, you're either gonna serve God
[00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:11.120]   or the devil, but it doesn't matter who you are,
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:12.680]   you can't get around it.
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:15.080]   You're gonna serve somebody in the end.
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:16.620]   And it's true.
[00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:18.680]   That's the choice.
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:21.400]   It's not between surrender to the reign of the king
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:22.920]   and freedom.
[00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:25.480]   It's between surrender to the reign of the king
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:28.400]   and serving somebody else, or someone else.
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:30.040]   And what we will find is that every one
[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:33.080]   of those imposter kings, no matter what it is,
[00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:36.280]   will end up being a tyrannical ruler in our lives,
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:40.080]   and will harm us and ultimately destroy us.
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:44.860]   The only good king is King Jesus.
[00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:46.200]   He's the only one.
[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:52.400]   And the New Testament talks about the kingdoms,
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.680]   it uses this metaphor of the kingdom of darkness
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:56.480]   and the kingdom of light.
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.360]   Colossians 1, 12 to 14 says this,
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:00.160]   "Give me thanks to the Father who has qualified you
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:02.280]   "to share in the inheritance of the saints in light.
[00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:04.600]   "He has delivered us from the domain of darkness
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:07.400]   "and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son,
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:11.360]   "in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins."
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:17.120]   And that's the king and the kingdom that we wanna be in.
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:19.560]   The kingdom of light, the kingdom of his Son.
[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:22.160]   Now this passage doesn't tell us
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:24.640]   that the wise men made this surrender.
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:26.080]   We know they believed in the kingdom enough
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:26.960]   to come see the king.
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:30.480]   We don't know necessarily if they, by faith,
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.200]   trusted in Jesus.
[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.560]   Perhaps they did.
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:37.400]   I think you could make that argument, certainly.
[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:38.880]   We don't know for sure.
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:42.480]   They certainly were sensitive to God and obedient to God.
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:47.480]   But for us, obviously salvation is a one-time event.
[00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:50.200]   We don't have to do that over again.
[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:51.840]   We come and we put our trust in Christ.
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:52.840]   That happens once.
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:56.960]   But the surrender to the king is a moment-by-moment process.
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.080]   That's not a one-time event.
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.600]   We don't say, "Okay, Jesus, I wanna follow you.
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:02.120]   "I'm surrendering to your reign.
[00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:02.960]   "I'm done.
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:06.200]   "I'm never gonna be tempted to walk out
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:07.400]   "out of bounds ever again."
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:10.520]   No, it's a moment-by-moment process of saying,
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:13.920]   "God, I need to surrender to you in this area of my life.
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:17.020]   "I'm tempted to follow some other imposter king.
[00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:18.400]   "Maybe it's me.
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:21.720]   "Maybe it's something else, but I've gotta surrender to you."
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:26.720]   We've gotta constantly be checking where our allegiance is.
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:30.920]   And it's a repeated surrender.
[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:32.600]   And if we live under the reign of the king,
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:35.800]   then we experience the blessings of the kingdom.
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:37.360]   There's so many things that we could talk about,
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:40.000]   and the most significant ones are the forgiveness of sins,
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.920]   the transformed life that comes through Jesus,
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:43.840]   the eternal life that's promised.
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:46.480]   But even if you think about the advent themes
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:48.880]   that we often talk about during advent,
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:51.960]   the candles that represent hope, peace, joy, and love,
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:54.560]   those are things that come to us
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:56.160]   as we live under the reign of the king.
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:58.820]   We have hope because the kingdom has come,
[00:23:58.820 --> 00:23:59.660]   and it is coming.
[00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:03.360]   We have peace because the king who loves us
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:06.520]   is in perfect control of our world, and we are his.
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:07.400]   That gives us peace.
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:11.280]   We have joy because every need is met
[00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:12.880]   in our relationship to the king.
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:16.680]   We have love because we're freed
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:20.520]   from the transactional nature of broken relationships
[00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:22.440]   that we experience in this world,
[00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:25.520]   and we're free to truly love the king and others
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:26.980]   without fear.
[00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:28.500]   We can experience true love.
[00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:31.280]   Now, the world desperately needs the blessings
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:32.120]   of the kingdom.
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:32.940]   We want 'em as individuals,
[00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:34.560]   but the world desperately needs that, right?
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:36.600]   We look at our world, and we see war,
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:38.320]   we see suffering, we see injustice,
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:40.000]   we see all these terrible things,
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.120]   and sometimes our heart cries out,
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:45.400]   and we say, "God, why is this happening?
[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:46.240]   "How long?
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:48.300]   "When are you going to change things?
[00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:50.260]   "If only there was some way
[00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:52.360]   "that we could be changed as human beings.
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:56.080]   "If only we could be transformed to be a lot less selfish
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:59.060]   "and stop hating each other and fighting each other.
[00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:01.480]   "If only there was a way for this to happen."
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:05.480]   And God says, "Yeah, I've made a way,
[00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:09.400]   "but if you wanna experience the blessings of the kingdom,
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:12.040]   "you gotta surrender to the reign of the king."
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:14.180]   And we need to understand that.
[00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:15.840]   We desire the blessings of the kingdom.
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:17.340]   We crave them.
[00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:19.400]   We chase after them.
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:20.680]   But we all wanna find them
[00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:23.100]   by building our own tower of Babel to heaven
[00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:25.720]   instead of just going and surrendering to the king
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:28.580]   who is gonna offer those blessings to us.
[00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:33.240]   So as we close out, I just wanna be practical for us.
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.280]   How do we continue in this process
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:36.480]   of surrender to the reign of the king?
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:38.160]   If it's a process, moments by moment,
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:40.360]   we say, "Okay, well, if I'm a follower of Jesus,
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:41.200]   "I wanna do that."
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:42.620]   What does that look like in our lives?
[00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:43.720]   How do we do that?
[00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:47.520]   In the scripture, in the Old Testament and the New Testament,
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:49.680]   there's this metaphor that's used so much
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:51.640]   about the path or the way
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:54.400]   that describes the lifestyle of following Jesus.
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.360]   And the early Christians actually were called
[00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:58.440]   followers of the way.
[00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:02.280]   And so that metaphor is really strong in our faith.
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:04.800]   I think that's a good illustration for us
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:08.720]   to think about following Jesus kind of as a map,
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:10.240]   as a pathway, right?
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:12.480]   And scripture gives us turn-by-turn directions.
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:15.280]   Like if you think about GPS or your Maps app,
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:16.600]   it tells you how to get somewhere,
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:18.440]   it gives you turn-by-turn directions, right?
[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:21.200]   Scripture gives us all kinds of turn-by-turn directions
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.760]   about how we're to relate to God,
[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:24.000]   how we relate to one another,
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.400]   how we're to live our lives
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:28.000]   in all these different areas of our lives, right?
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.360]   And God's given us the Holy Spirit to speak to us
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:33.800]   about staying on course
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:35.360]   and staying in fellowship with Him,
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:38.240]   just like the Map app talks to you, right,
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:40.280]   when you miss a turn
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:42.600]   and tells you that you missed the turn, right?
[00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:46.680]   The problem is a lot of times we don't,
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:49.720]   in the illustration that we're using here,
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:51.320]   we don't consult the Map app
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:52.840]   and we don't listen when it tells us
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:53.680]   we've made a wrong turn.
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:55.800]   We just keep doing our own thing, right?
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:59.080]   And that's what it means for us
[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:01.180]   to moment-by-moment surrender to the King,
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:05.120]   to continue to soak ourselves in Scripture
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:06.880]   and go back to what God has said and say,
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:10.840]   "God, am I living under your rule and reign,
[00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:13.260]   "or am I following some other alternate map
[00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:16.160]   "that's provided by me or by my friends
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:19.140]   "or the world around me or culture or some celebrity?
[00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:23.240]   "Am I following another map, or am I following your map?"
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:24.920]   And we listen to the Holy Spirit,
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:26.700]   and the Holy Spirit is good,
[00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:29.200]   and He lets us know when we're out of fellowship
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.700]   and we feel spiritually distant from God
[00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:34.560]   or we don't wanna be in church, we don't wanna worship.
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:35.560]   God lets us know.
[00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:38.800]   But we have to listen to that
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:42.000]   and not be like I am sometimes when I miss my turn
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.980]   and then I drive 10 more miles, right?
[00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:47.520]   Sometimes in life, I get out of fellowship with God
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:51.080]   and six months later, everything's unhealthy,
[00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:54.560]   and I finally figure out, oh yeah, something's wrong.
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:56.120]   And God's like, "Yeah, I've been trying to let you know
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:58.120]   "for the last six months.
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:01.160]   "You made a wrong turn back there, way back there."
[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:02.000]   Right?
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.380]   And so that's how we surrender
[00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:06.700]   to the reign of the King moment by moment.
[00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:09.020]   We keep going back to Scripture and saying,
[00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:13.300]   "God, am I aligning with what your map is for my life?"
[00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:14.460]   We listen to the Holy Spirit.
[00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:17.100]   "God, can you communicate to me in my heart
[00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:18.840]   "and let me know when I'm making a wrong turn
[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:20.860]   "and get me back on course?"
[00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:22.740]   And then we surrender to it, we obey it.
[00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:24.220]   We say, "God, you know what?
[00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:26.380]   "I don't really like what I'm reading right now.
[00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:28.260]   "I don't really like what the Holy Spirit's telling me.
[00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:29.740]   "I don't want to be unselfish.
[00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:31.920]   "I don't want to care about someone else.
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:33.460]   "I wanna make this about me,
[00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:37.360]   "but I'm gonna surrender to it because you're the King
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:42.340]   "and I wanna live under your rule and your reign."
[00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:44.800]   Let's pray.
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:49.440]   God, we just thank you that you came as Savior.
[00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:52.240]   You came to rescue us, to redeem us.
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:54.620]   But we also thank you that you came as King.
[00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:58.640]   Help us to not just receive you as Savior
[00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:02.340]   and rejoice in the forgiveness of our sins and stop there.
[00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:06.740]   Help us to go on to acknowledge that you're the Lord,
[00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:08.580]   you're the King, you're the ruler,
[00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:10.860]   and help us to choose to live under the rule
[00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:13.420]   and reign of your kingdom,
[00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:15.720]   to manifest the values of your kingdom in our lives
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:17.140]   to those around us, God.
[00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:18.840]   In Jesus' name, amen.
