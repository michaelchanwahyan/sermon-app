[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080]   - Thank you, Pastor Mark.
[00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.420]   - Hey, how's it going guys?
[00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.040]   I know it has been a long weekend
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.440]   and this is a Labor Day weekend
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.100]   and a lot of us are out of town.
[00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:17.520]   And then for some of you,
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.100]   yesterday was a very, very long day, right?
[00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:27.600]   Well, one applause for all of you.
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.040]   Sometimes you have to say thank you to yourself.
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.320]   In any case, today we're going to talk about Psalm 19.
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:45.320]   Now you remember last week we went to the Botanical Garden
[00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.240]   and we had a very good time, right?
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:54.040]   So I kept on thinking about this psalm
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.040]   and it says, let me read maybe the first verse.
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.480]   "The heavens declare the glory of God
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.240]   and the skies proclaim the work of His hands."
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:11.800]   And then the creation is like a preacher.
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.760]   It's like someone who's preaching a sermon to you
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.240]   and proclaiming the greatness of God
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.480]   to all people everywhere, all the time.
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:25.760]   And like this psalm says,
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.880]   the heavens and the creation do not speak our language.
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.360]   There's no voice.
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.480]   Yet they speak a language
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.800]   that everyone of us can understand.
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.040]   That's amazing.
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.400]   Day after day, night after night,
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.680]   creation keeps on pointing us
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.440]   back to the glory of the creator.
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:52.360]   And as you can see,
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.960]   these new images came out 2022 by James Webb Telescope.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.720]   And you know, 100 years ago,
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.880]   we, people thought that there was only one galaxy.
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.120]   But now with this pictures,
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.200]   with this all kinds of new images,
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.200]   there were countless of galaxies in space, in deep space.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.160]   And some of the lights we see today
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.680]   has traveled like 13 billion years of time
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.520]   before reaching us now.
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:44.360]   Now this tells us, like the psalm says,
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.960]   you know, how small we are
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.040]   and how great our God, how vast the universe is.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.160]   And the heavens stretch out beyond our imagination.
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.720]   And yet, this is only what we see today in nature.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.720]   It's only a reflection of the majesty of our maker.
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:16.080]   Now the psalm, psalm 19,
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.360]   highlights one of the factors, the sun.
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.480]   Now you can ask the question, why the sun?
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.120]   Why focus on the sun?
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.600]   Because, you know, everyone see the sun.
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.480]   You saw the sun today, right?
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.920]   You came in and you saw the sun and you woke up.
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.440]   It's like a bridegroom coming out of his wedding canopy.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.800]   You know, it's like a look of triumph,
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.240]   like a champion running with joy and with energy.
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.240]   That is the sun.
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.040]   The sun rises every day.
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.840]   It runs its courses across the sky with power.
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:04:07.240]   And you can tell, even in Chicago,
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.520]   we don't have a lot of sun,
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.520]   but when the sun comes up, nothing escapes its heat.
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.520]   And the same way, the psalm's telling us,
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.640]   no one should escape,
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.520]   no one can escape the weakness of creation.
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.160]   And the glory of God is unmistakable.
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.160]   And we acknowledge the existence of the savior, our maker.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.160]   And not only in the vastness of the space,
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.640]   but even in the smallest detail in creation,
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.320]   it tells us the existence of God.
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.360]   Now, some years ago,
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:00.440]   a photographer tried to magnify the snowflakes
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.400]   and under the camera and took a lot of pictures.
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.920]   And as you can see,
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:09.800]   every single snowflake look different, right?
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.800]   Everyone, every snowflake has a unique signature
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.080]   and they are all masterpiece.
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:29.040]   And this is how amazing God's creation is.
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.040]   And from the blazing sun, we all can see,
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.280]   to the delicate snowflake, right?
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.720]   Snowflake.
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.960]   In the smallest detail,
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.000]   the creation keeps telling us God is glorious.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:56.760]   Now, this is what the theologians of the Bible tells us.
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.720]   This is general revelations,
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.440]   because God left his fingerprint,
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:04.960]   his signature everywhere,
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.120]   every single inch of the creation.
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.560]   And no one can say, "I never heard of the creation,
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.160]   never heard of the creator."
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.800]   Creation is always speaking.
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.800]   And the only thing is whether you would listen or not.
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:30.760]   And I remember some years ago,
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.720]   there was a debate going on
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:37.720]   between a British rabbi called Jonathan Sachs.
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:42.800]   And he was debating the most famous atheist,
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.800]   Richard Dawkins, over online.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.760]   And this is one of the conversation
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.560]   they had between each other.
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.720]   And I can translate first.
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.560]   - Okay.
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.120]   - And Sachs, during the debate,
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.600]   he said to the atheist, Dawkins,
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.960]   he said, "Richard, religion is music,
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.360]   but you are tone deaf."
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.360]   And then Richard Dawkins, responding to the debate,
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.280]   says, "Yes, it's true.
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.840]   I'm tone deaf, but there's no music."
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:25.760]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:37.360]   - And Psalm 19 reminds us, there is music all the time.
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.200]   There's music.
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.960]   Can you listen to the music?
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:40.880]   It is playing.
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.160]   The music is playing all around us.
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:47.520]   And the music of creation declare the glory of God.
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:51.440]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:57.040]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.240]   - And that's the first point you have to listen.
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.560]   You have to try to listen to the music of creation,
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.080]   the voice of creator.
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.080]   And the second point here is listen
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.080]   to the voice of the creator.
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:11.720]   And God does not only speak through creation.
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:15.040]   He also speaks to us, every single one of us,
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.800]   directly through His word.
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.440]   And that's what the Psalm is trying to describe.
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.600]   It is the beauty and the power of the word of God.
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.520]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:38.680]   - And in verses seven, eight, and nine,
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:42.080]   it says that God's law is so perfect,
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.720]   and it revives our soul,
[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.760]   and His testimony gives wisdom.
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:49.240]   His precept gives us direction for our lives,
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:53.880]   and His commands gives clarity into our lives,
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:56.920]   and His judgment are always true and righteous,
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:59.880]   and the fear of the Lord is pure and eternal.
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.800]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:17.800]   - And in short, God's word gives you wisdom,
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.960]   gives you life, gives you joy and light,
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.240]   and it is reliable, unchangeable,
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:26.640]   and unlike any of our words, our human words.
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:30.560]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:38.960]   - And the Psalms keeps on telling us
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:43.720]   that the word of God are more than precious,
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:47.640]   than gold, and much, than much pure gold,
[00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:51.160]   sweeter than honey, and than honey from the comb.
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:56.200]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:08.520]   - It is more precious than gold,
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:12.680]   and you know, you remember in the history
[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:15.440]   of the United States, many, many years ago
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:20.440]   in the 19th century, 1850s, there was a gold rush, right?
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:22.680]   And all the people around the world
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:26.440]   fled to San Francisco, right?
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.440]   San Francisco, that's why we call San Francisco
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.040]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.600]   Okay, and they came for gold,
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:38.000]   and they tried to, you know, sift through the soil
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.480]   and to find a few flecks of gold.
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:44.400]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:56.000]   - And there was a story going around
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   about the gold rush, and the story goes,
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.800]   three men, they discover a gold mine,
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.280]   but they pledge to other people
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:06.560]   that we're not gonna tell anyone
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.800]   because it's absolutely secret, we wanna get the gold, right?
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.040]   So they promise each other never to tell anyone,
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:15.160]   but then when they walk into a bar, these three men,
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:18.720]   and then other people immediately come to them
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.440]   and telling them, "Oh, you guys must have found
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.760]   "the gold mine."
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:26.680]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:36.520]   - Now, the three men were shocked
[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:39.800]   because they never tell anyone,
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:44.800]   and they ask, "How do you know that we found the gold mine?"
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:47.120]   And the people respond by saying,
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:49.680]   "It's all written over your face
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.480]   "because we see how you smile,
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.480]   "so you must have found the gold mine."
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:58.400]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:06.360]   - Now, this is what the word of God should do to us, right?
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.720]   We are filled with the word of God
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.760]   and then we can taste the sweetness
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.840]   and the treasure of all the treasures of the law of God.
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:17.320]   And people around us, you know, eventually should feel
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:20.640]   the power of the word of God, the joy of the Lord, right?
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.560]   Shining on our faces.
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:27.480]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:38.360]   - So this psalm's telling you to listen
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.000]   to the music of creation
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.760]   and to listen to the voice of the creator,
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:43.800]   the word of God.
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.720]   And thirdly, from 11 to 14,
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:49.600]   it tells us to respond to this God who loves us.
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:53.680]   And after creation speaks, after God's word speaks,
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.720]   and what we make is our response, right?
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.440]   And the psalm is telling us,
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:02.560]   to show us how we should answer to the word of God.
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.440]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.840]   And the psalm says,
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.840]   "By them your servant is warned,
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:14.840]   and in keeping the word of God, there is great reward."
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:17.840]   And he immediately responds saying,
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:22.840]   "Who can discern their own sins, their own errors,
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:27.840]   and ask God to forgive our hidden sin and faults."
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:31.760]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:35.920]   And ask God to forgive our hidden sin and faults.
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:39.920]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:49.080]   Now this is an honest confession.
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:54.520]   Seriously, sometimes we cannot see all of our sins.
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:59.240]   So we must ask God to forgive us, to protect us,
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:03.840]   and to free us from pride and rebellion from sin.
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:07.760]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:16.520]   And the psalm says,
[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:20.080]   "Keep your servant also from willful sins.
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:23.840]   May they not rule over me, and I will be blameless.
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:28.160]   I will be clean and innocent of great transgression."
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:32.240]   And his desire, as you can see, is to be free from sin,
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:35.280]   not to be ruled by sin, but shaped by the word of God,
[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:36.800]   the very word of God.
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:40.720]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:59.560]   Finally, the last line is the most precious response.
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:02.520]   It says, "May the word of my mouth,
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:06.800]   the meditation of my heart, be pleasing in your sight,
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.840]   Lord, my rock and my redeemer."
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:13.760]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:24.240]   Now the word pleasing here, acceptable,
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:27.000]   how this translation was used often in the Old Testament
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.040]   to describe a sacrifice, sacrifice we offer to God.
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:33.960]   You know, a sacrifice is only meaningful
[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:36.320]   if only God accept it.
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.320]   And that is the word here.
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:41.640]   In the same way, true worship here is not about,
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:45.040]   you know, asking, okay, do I like it or not?
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:45.960]   Do I like the song?
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:46.800]   Do I like the sermon?
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:49.400]   Do I like, you know, here or whatever?
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:50.320]   It's not our preference.
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:54.080]   It's that whether God would accept my worship.
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:58.000]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:13.280]   And that's what meditation is all about, right?
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:16.720]   Your thought, you know, your thought life matters.
[00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:18.120]   You know, I wonder if you can,
[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:21.760]   you would take time every day to meditate
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:24.880]   on the word of God, not rushing through the Bible,
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:27.520]   but, you know, let the word of God sink deep,
[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:29.960]   deep into our hearts.
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.240]   And then our words and our thoughts and our lives
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:37.240]   will become offering that will give God glory.
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:43.440]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.520]   So here, Psalm 19 is like music itself.
[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:49.200]   It has three movements, right?
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:52.240]   To listen to the voice, the music of creation,
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:53.880]   listen to the voice of God,
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:56.520]   and our response finally to God.
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:58.120]   So there are three movements here,
[00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:00.240]   from creation, the word, to response.
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:05.240]   And each of the parts calls to God.
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:08.760]   So the first part is the word of God.
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:11.200]   And the second part is the word of God.
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:16.200]   The parts calls to you and me to listen carefully
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.840]   and then to step out of faith.
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:22.760]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:33.320]   So here's my homework for you this week.
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.160]   You know, slow down and try to listen
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:36.920]   to the voice of creation.
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:40.880]   You know, look up the skies and look at the sun,
[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:42.880]   not directly, right?
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:46.560]   Even the snowflakes, okay, not right now, I hope not.
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:49.880]   But the smallest details would declare the glory of God
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:53.960]   and the music of creation is always playing around us.
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:57.880]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:08.000]   And then secondly, is to listen to the voice
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.360]   of the creator, 7 to 10, verses 7 to 10.
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:15.200]   And God's word is more precious than gold,
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:17.560]   sweeter than honey.
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:20.880]   We need to taste it, we need to experience it.
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:22.840]   It's a treasure that is hidden,
[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:26.360]   but it will fill you with joy and life.
[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:30.280]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:38.680]   So this week, spend some time every day
[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:40.760]   to listen to the voice of creation
[00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:42.720]   and listen to the voice of creator.
[00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:45.560]   And then with confession and prayer,
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:50.120]   making our lives pleasing in the sight of God.
[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:54.040]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:19:00.800]   So here it tells us creation points us to God.
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:04.320]   So let creation point us to God.
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:07.600]   And then the word of God will transform us.
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:11.880]   And our only fitting response is to bow down
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:16.280]   and worship in repentance and joyful obedience.
[00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:20.200]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:30.360]   Well, at this point, why don't we conclude with a prayer?
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:32.560]   And in this prayer, I want you to come
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:37.560]   into the presence of God and to pray to him.
[00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:41.520]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:44.280]   Let us pray.
[00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:46.520]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:51.520]   Lord, thank you for your creation that declares your glory.
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:56.000]   And we wanna thank you for your word that give us life.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.920]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:05.000]   And forgive our hidden sins and keep us from rebellion
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.600]   and let our words and our meditation,
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.680]   our thought be pleasing to you
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:13.240]   because you are our rock and our redeemer.
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:17.160]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:26.320]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:27.760]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.000]   Amen.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.680]   So remember the homework this week.
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:33.480]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.520]   Go out to creation, not your screen,
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:36.880]   not your screen, not your phone.
[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:38.160]   Go out to the creation and listen
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.400]   to the music of the creation.
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:42.720]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:45.920]   Okay, and then spend some time in the word of God
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:48.040]   that gets singed into your lives.
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:51.640]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:53.360]   Okay, and God bless you this week
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:56.320]   and hope to see you next Sunday.
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:58.000]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.640]   All right, yeah, put it in your heart, yes.
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:03.440]   Okay, go in peace, guys.
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:07.440]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:11.920]   (gentle music)
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:15.320]   (gentle music continues)
[00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:18.720]   (gentle music continues)
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:22.120]   (gentle music continues)
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:25.520]   (gentle music continues)
[00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:28.920]   (gentle music continues)
[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:32.320]   (gentle music continues)
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:35.720]   (gentle music continues)
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:39.120]   (gentle music continues)
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:42.520]   (gentle music continues)
[00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:46.320]   (gentle music continues)
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:49.720]   (gentle music continues)
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:53.720]   (gentle music continues)
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:57.120]   (gentle music continues)
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:00.920]   (gentle music continues)
[00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.720]   (gentle music continues)
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:16.120]   (gentle music continues)
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:22.920]   (gentle music continues)
[00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:30.320]   (gentle music continues)
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:34.120]   (gentle music continues)
[00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:41.520]   (gentle music continues)
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:47.920]   (gentle music continues)
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:54.320]   (gentle music continues)
