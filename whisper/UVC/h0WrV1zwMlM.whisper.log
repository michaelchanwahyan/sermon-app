[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680]   Today, we're going to go through our preaching series,
[00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.200]   our sermon series, and if you have your Bible,
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.480]   please turn to the last book of the Bible,
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.200]   the book of Revelation, all right?
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.100]   Book of Revelation.
[00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.800]   We are in this series called,
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.320]   "What Christ Thinks of the Church."
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.320]   What does Jesus think of our church?
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.720]   You know, just imagine, if Jesus is gonna write us an email,
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.600]   if he's going to text us,
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.680]   if he's gonna write a letter to us,
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.040]   and to each and every one of us,
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.920]   what will the letter be saying?
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.520]   You know, imagine, you know,
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.640]   if Jesus write a letter to all of us, to our church,
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.640]   what does he think of our church?
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.640]   So that is the whole idea of this sermon series
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.000]   on the seven letters to the seven churches
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.240]   in the first century,
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.240]   and we caught it in the book of Revelation.
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.720]   And as I said before, this seven letters
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.600]   were sent to seven churches
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.160]   located in today's Western Turkey, right?
[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.440]   Did I mention to you I wanna organize a New Testament tour
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.040]   to Turkey and Greece?
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.040]   Did I, did I say that?
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.080]   Yeah, I did, right?
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.320]   I did.
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.400]   Last week, I did, yeah.
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.280]   And, you know, because of the war there,
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.100]   because of the instability there,
[00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.320]   we could not go this year.
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.800]   But I usually go to the Middle East once a year
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.360]   to lead some church group and to visit different sites.
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.720]   Hopefully, next year, we're gonna have a New Testament tour
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.440]   for the first step of Paul,
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.900]   and we're gonna visit Turkey and Greece.
[00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.440]   And anyways, this seven churches
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.780]   in the book of Revelation, the first few chapters,
[00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.160]   we caught a seven letters written by Jesus,
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.680]   the head of the church, to all the churches,
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.120]   to seven churches.
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.180]   And we went through the letter to,
[00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.420]   Ephesus, and then Smyrna.
[00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.780]   And today, we are at the third city.
[00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.620]   You follow that line,
[00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.620]   possibly a postal delivery route of the day.
[00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.260]   And the seven churches are written to these seven cities
[00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.220]   where there were whole churches in there.
[00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.640]   And today, we are in the third city, Pergamon, Pergamon.
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.700]   Now, back in the first century,
[00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.000]   Pergamon was a thriving city.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.500]   And listen to this.
[00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.180]   According to different estimation,
[00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.180]   Pergamon had a population of 150,000 people.
[00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.460]   And that considered a big city in the first century.
[00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.860]   It's a huge city, huge population.
[00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.140]   150,000, it's a thriving city.
[00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.120]   And today, when we go there,
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.460]   you see a Roman theater on the left,
[00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.460]   and the Roman theater can seat more than 10,000 audience.
[00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.160]   And then on the right, you can see the aerial picture.
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.400]   And then down there, you see the modern city of Pergamon.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.400]   And this letter, Jesus is writing to the church in Pergamon.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.960]   Let's take a look.
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.440]   212, 212 of Revelation.
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.720]   "To the angel of the church in Pergamon write,
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.720]   "these are the words of him who has a sharp double-edged sword."
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.220]   Now, as I said, in all three, all seven letters,
[00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.840]   Jesus introduced himself in a special way
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.300]   that is relevant to the city, to the Christians,
[00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.940]   to the church in that particular city.
[00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.540]   And writing to the church,
[00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.940]   writing to the Christians in Pergamon,
[00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.800]   Jesus introduced himself as having
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.780]   the sharp double-edged sword.
[00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.340]   Now, this kind of sword,
[00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.580]   archeologists have dug up so many of them in Roman sites
[00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.540]   in the Mediterranean world in the first century.
[00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.500]   It is a well-known weapon of the Roman Empire.
[00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.500]   It is symbol of political might, military might.
[00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.580]   And politics in today and back in the first century
[00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.980]   was a highly debated topic, right?
[00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.980]   Because politic is the greatest power on earth, right?
[00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:20.660]   The country, whoever is the boss in the Roman Empire.
[00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.140]   And it was a highly debated topic,
[00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.940]   and everyone is so concerned about it.
[00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.660]   Just like today, we are very concerned
[00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.740]   about the upcoming presidential election.
[00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:32.980]   It's a very important subject,
[00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.660]   and politics is usually a very relevant subject
[00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:36.500]   in the first century.
[00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.260]   And the Roman emperor and governors of the province,
[00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.020]   including the governor of the city of Pergamon,
[00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.780]   often carry this kind of double-edged sword, you know?
[00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.060]   This kind of double-edged sword.
[00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.300]   It's about probably more than 18 inch long.
[00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.260]   It's a double-edged sword to symbolize their power.
[00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.980]   They have the power to execute the Roman authorities.
[00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.420]   They have power to punish criminals
[00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:09.540]   and anyone against the order of the empire.
[00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.100]   You remember in the Gospel of John
[00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.860]   when Jesus was standing on trial before Pilate,
[00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.540]   the Roman governor in Palestine, in Israel.
[00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.980]   And you remember in the Gospel of John
[00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:26.380]   recorded the conversation between Jesus and Pilate.
[00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.220]   This is what they talk about.
[00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.380]   John 19, 10.
[00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.140]   Now, Pilate, the governor,
[00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.460]   representing the power of the Roman empire,
[00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.980]   he said to Jesus, "Don't you realize I have power
[00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.740]   "either to free you or to crucify you?"
[00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.740]   And then Jesus said, and that's amazing what he said.
[00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.960]   He said to Pilate, "You will have no power over me
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.100]   "if it were not given to you from above."
[00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.940]   Right?
[00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:02.180]   It's a subversive challenge to the Roman authority.
[00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.860]   You have power to crucify me and to penalize me
[00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.980]   because there is a power above you.
[00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:09.980]   There's a bigger power.
[00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.020]   There's a greatest power above you who is God himself.
[00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.580]   So Jesus is essentially saying, "Sorry, Pilate.
[00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.260]   "I know you're gonna have the power
[00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.420]   "to crucify me or to free me,
[00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:26.820]   "but I and my God have the power above you."
[00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:27.660]   Right?
[00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:30.500]   And essentially, that's what Jesus is saying
[00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.300]   in this letter to Pogomon.
[00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:37.300]   Jesus said, "I am the only one who has the double-edged sword.
[00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:41.660]   "I have the political power, the power above."
[00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:46.200]   In chapter one, we see that Jesus holds the seven stars.
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.040]   Right?
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.540]   Just like the Roman emperor would hold seven stars
[00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:50.620]   in his hand.
[00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:51.540]   Right?
[00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:54.580]   In chapter one, we also see that Jesus,
[00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:59.580]   out of his mouth came a sharp, double-edged sword.
[00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.940]   And what does it mean?
[00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:03.860]   It means Jesus has a weapon,
[00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:06.940]   but this is not a physical weapon.
[00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.060]   This is not guns and tanks.
[00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:13.460]   It is the word of truth, the word of the gospel,
[00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:18.340]   and the gospel can conquer the Roman power.
[00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:23.020]   The gospel can conquer death and Satan and evil.
[00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:25.300]   That's essentially what Jesus is saying.
[00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:26.400]   Right?
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.380]   Because Jesus rose from the dead.
[00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.500]   He conquered death, the greatest power of all.
[00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:33.340]   Right?
[00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:35.220]   In fact, the New Testament reminds us
[00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:39.540]   death is the final enemy for each and every one of us.
[00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.740]   You will die.
[00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.340]   I will die.
[00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.380]   Death is the final enemy,
[00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:48.720]   but Jesus has conquered this final enemy.
[00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:53.740]   And Jesus is saying he has all the power.
[00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.620]   He has the power from above.
[00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:57.940]   So the Bible is proclaiming that,
[00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:01.280]   yeah, of course we need to concern about the earthly politics
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.220]   but we are not isolating ourselves, of course.
[00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:05.060]   Right?
[00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:07.420]   We need to concern about what is happening in the world,
[00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:12.420]   but we must be occupied most of all
[00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:15.060]   in our conversation, in our thoughts, in our actions,
[00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:20.060]   by the real power, the highest power, the real king.
[00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.220]   Jesus himself, right?
[00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:24.700]   He has the double-edged sword,
[00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:27.020]   not the Roman guys, right?
[00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:28.660]   Not the United States president.
[00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:33.340]   Jesus has the real double-edged sword.
[00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:35.980]   And we must be concerned about that power,
[00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:38.620]   concerned about the gospel,
[00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:41.500]   concerned about preaching the word of truth,
[00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:45.300]   concerned about witnessing the name of Jesus, right?
[00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:50.260]   That is what we must occupy ourselves most, right?
[00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.700]   Let me remind you as the election coming up, right?
[00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.060]   What is occupying our time?
[00:08:56.060 --> 00:09:00.660]   What is occupying our thoughts most of the time?
[00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:04.180]   It should be, the Bible says, Jesus himself, right?
[00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:09.100]   The church, his people, his authority, his kingdom.
[00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:12.220]   Just like the Lord's prayer, "Thy kingdom come."
[00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:16.620]   On earth as it is in heaven.
[00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:20.460]   We're gonna bring God's kingdom on earth, to the earth,
[00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:25.460]   to our circle of inference, to help people see Jesus.
[00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:29.380]   That should occupy most of our time, most of our energy.
[00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:33.340]   So Jesus introduced himself, he has the highest power.
[00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:35.980]   He has the sharp double-edged sword.
[00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:39.300]   And he continues to talk to the church in Pergamon.
[00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:41.780]   He said, "I know," remember this formula
[00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:42.900]   in every single letter?
[00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:44.860]   He said, "I know your situation.
[00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:46.140]   "I know everything about you."
[00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:50.220]   He said, "I know where you live, where Satan has his thorn.
[00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:53.460]   "Yet you remain true to my name.
[00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:55.700]   "You did not renounce your faith in me,
[00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:59.900]   "even in the days of Antipas, my faithful witness,
[00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:04.180]   "who was put to death in your city, where Satan lives."
[00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:06.220]   How many times Satan is repeated here?
[00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:09.100]   Two times, right?
[00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:10.980]   Yeah, two times.
[00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:14.020]   So looking at Pergamon, this thriving city,
[00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:17.140]   of course, he says, "I know where you live," right?
[00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:19.900]   Your physical address, right?
[00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:23.740]   You can punch it in, in your Google Earth,
[00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:25.460]   Google Earth or Google Map, right?
[00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:28.020]   You can go there, where you live, of course, is Pergamon.
[00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:29.120]   It's the ancient city.
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.940]   That's the physical location, just like Chicago, right?
[00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:34.100]   I know where you live, Jesus says.
[00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:37.540]   But Jesus is talking about not your physical location,
[00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:39.380]   it's just spiritual location.
[00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:43.420]   Spiritually, Pergamon was the throne of Satan,
[00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:45.860]   the throne of the evil.
[00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:49.500]   Now we have archeology uncover some of the truth
[00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:50.800]   about the city for us.
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:56.820]   Pergamon, in the last hundred some years,
[00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:01.620]   the Germans were there to dig up some of the things
[00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:04.580]   from the city, Pergamon.
[00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:07.620]   And Pergamon, we know, had a large altar,
[00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:10.460]   or temple, built for Zeus.
[00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:14.540]   And this huge altar, you can see it now
[00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:18.800]   in Pergamon Museum in Berlin, Germany.
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:24.220]   And because when the Germans went to today's Turkey,
[00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:25.860]   they dig up some of the stones,
[00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:28.020]   some of the stones of the altar and the temple,
[00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:31.540]   and they move it piece by piece back to Berlin
[00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:33.920]   and put it in the museum.
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:36.220]   And this is a huge pagan altar.
[00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:41.060]   This huge pagan temple, hundred some feet long
[00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:46.060]   and hundred some feet wide and 40 feet plus deep.
[00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:48.900]   It's a huge altar.
[00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:52.940]   And what we found in Pergamon was this huge altar.
[00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:56.780]   And you can see it in Germany.
[00:11:56.780 --> 00:12:01.780]   And the story goes, as the German move the entire altar
[00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:05.300]   stone by stone to Berlin, and they reassemble it together
[00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:08.420]   in their own museum.
[00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:13.420]   And then it was 1930s, and the Pergamon Museum in Berlin
[00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:16.060]   was open to the public.
[00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:19.840]   And a few years later, the German Nazi party,
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:24.060]   they had some rallies, some political gatherings,
[00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:27.980]   and they are trying to design and build
[00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:31.960]   some of the huge plazas for the political rally.
[00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:38.180]   And in one of those, the Nazi party commissioned
[00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:43.180]   an architect to design a special plaza, Sibel and Phil.
[00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:48.380]   And in that plaza, the architect, the chief architect,
[00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:52.660]   got the inspiration from Pergamon altar.
[00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:57.220]   From this altar, he built that low right,
[00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:00.120]   Sibel and Phil, in 1930s.
[00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:06.060]   And they turned to Pergamon altar for inspiration.
[00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:09.020]   And of course, as you know, in the following years,
[00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:12.680]   Hitler descended down the steps.
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:15.860]   Now this altar is what the Bible is talking about.
[00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:18.700]   This altar at Pergamon is believed to be
[00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:22.140]   the throne of Satan, the seat of Satan.
[00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:27.220]   And it's very interesting to think about this verse,
[00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:31.140]   verse two, 13 and 14.
[00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:35.180]   Jesus is saying to the church in Pergamon,
[00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:39.420]   "Don't just look at the surface.
[00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:41.840]   "You need to look behind your city.
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:45.480]   "And you look behind the city, you know the power of Satan
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:49.140]   "is working behind, is working there.
[00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:51.120]   "There's a spiritual darkness,
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:54.020]   "dark forces behind what you see."
[00:13:56.020 --> 00:14:01.020]   You know, from your sight, you can see a gigantic building.
[00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:05.980]   You can see a big, huge altar and temple.
[00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:07.860]   But behind, Jesus said,
[00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:11.800]   is the evil, destructive force of Satan, right?
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:16.500]   And we need to develop that kind of spiritual insight,
[00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.780]   that spiritual perspective.
[00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:20.900]   When we see something from the outside,
[00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:23.920]   we have to look behind the scene.
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:26.060]   Just like what Jesus did here.
[00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:29.200]   Chicago is a beautiful city, isn't it?
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:30.120]   Right?
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.260]   It's a beautiful city.
[00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:36.300]   Especially weather is good, all right?
[00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:37.600]   It's very, very beautiful.
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.820]   It's just a magnificent building.
[00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:42.220]   Magnificent buildings and magnificent city.
[00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:46.340]   But you need to look behind.
[00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:50.700]   Chicago is known to be one of the toughest places
[00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:53.000]   for churches.
[00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:55.120]   Do you know that?
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:15:00.020]   You know, not too far away from us, in our network,
[00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:03.900]   one of the Baptist churches was trying to fight
[00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:08.500]   for zoning permit to build a church.
[00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:11.860]   They tried to fight legal battles,
[00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:14.800]   not to be kicked out from their rental place.
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:18.460]   You know, the government is not friendly
[00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:20.820]   or even hostile to the gospel.
[00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:23.760]   Yes, this is a beautiful city,
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.400]   but you look behind the scene,
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:28.480]   you know there's something else working, right?
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.240]   The power of Satan.
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.960]   And the city needs the gospel.
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:36.840]   The city needs you to go in there,
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:40.840]   to bear the name of Jesus, to witness to other people
[00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:43.660]   about the wonderful name of our Lord, right?
[00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:46.160]   Same thing for Pergamon.
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:50.600]   Now, this letter says there was one martyr
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:53.100]   called Antipas, right?
[00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:54.500]   Antipas.
[00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:58.640]   And he's being described as my faithful witness.
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:01.560]   Now, we don't know much about Antipas here.
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:06.520]   Perhaps he was a leader in the church in Pergamon,
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:08.360]   and he was a martyr not too long ago,
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:11.880]   before this letter was written.
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:16.460]   Now, at the time of revelation, it was the first century,
[00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:19.960]   the late first century, which is AD 90s.
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:24.080]   And we know from other sources that some Christians,
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:27.960]   and in fact, quite a few Christian leaders
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:31.200]   have been martyred in the first century.
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.740]   Can you name some of them?
[00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:35.280]   Stephen is one of them, right?
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:37.360]   The bold ax, chapter seven.
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:38.620]   He was stoned to death.
[00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:44.400]   James, who wrote the epistle of James.
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:48.920]   Peter, who was martyred in the 60s.
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:53.920]   Paul as well, he was martyred in Rome in the 60s.
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:57.560]   And now when revelation was written,
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:02.360]   it was late first century, AD 90s.
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:03.960]   Antipas was one of them.
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.640]   And that implies he was a faithful witness.
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:11.600]   That implies that he was interrogated by Roman authorities,
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:14.300]   and he was ordered to be executed
[00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:18.280]   when he refused to curse Christ, curse Jesus,
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.440]   and worship the Roman emperor.
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:23.780]   When Antipas gave his testimony in the court,
[00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:28.160]   and he was being asked to reject Jesus,
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:32.740]   and to renounce his faith, and to curse Christ publicly.
[00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:36.960]   Antipas, that's for sure, he refused to do that,
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:40.080]   because he only worshiped Jesus himself.
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:43.560]   Now, in the midst of intense persecution,
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:47.120]   the small church in Pokémon needs a lot of encouragement.
[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:50.200]   And Jesus said, "I know you guys.
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:51.660]   "I know what is going on with you.
[00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:54.560]   "I know you're suffering for the faith."
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:57.440]   'Cause that I know, that two words in English,
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:02.440]   that I know offers encouragement and comfort
[00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:07.120]   to those who are suffering for the faith.
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:09.000]   Jesus said, "I'm gonna protect you.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.040]   "I know your situation."
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:14.840]   Now, Jesus never promised us to follow him,
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:16.280]   there will be no suffering.
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:20.280]   But he promised us to save us through suffering, right?
[00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:23.400]   So he said, "I know your suffering.
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:25.440]   "I know what you're going through, right?
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:30.300]   "I'm not sure what you're going through right now, right?
[00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:33.600]   "Possibly in the past few weeks, or past few months,
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.240]   "you have been going through some suffering.
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:36.440]   "But remember this."
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:41.440]   Jesus said, "I know, I understand, I'm with you.
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:43.320]   "I know your suffering."
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:46.160]   He spoke to, he spoke the same word to
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:50.880]   the Christians in Pergamon, at the throne of Satan, right?
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.800]   They were under attack.
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:57.600]   And Jesus today is speaking to you the same thing.
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:59.980]   I know what you are going through.
[00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:03.500]   Let's continue, verse 14.
[00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:07.560]   "Nevertheless," Jesus said, "I have a few things
[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:11.140]   "against you guys, the church in Pergamon.
[00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:14.960]   "You have people who hold to the teaching of Balaam,
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:19.820]   "who taught Balak to entice the Israelites to sin
[00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:22.120]   "by eating food, sacrifice to idols,
[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:24.600]   "and by committing sexual immorality."
[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:27.180]   Verse 15, "Likewise, you also have those
[00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:31.000]   "who hold to the teaching of Nicolaitans."
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.360]   Now, what is going on here?
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:35.320]   It's using some Old Testament example
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:41.360]   to describe what is going on in,
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:44.780]   among some of the Christians in Pergamon church.
[00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:48.840]   He said, "First of all, some of the Christians there
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:52.300]   "held to the teaching of Balaam."
[00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:55.640]   Balaam is an Old Testament guy,
[00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:57.560]   and he's a very famous guy.
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:00.840]   And Balaam, as you remember from the book of Numbers,
[00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:03.120]   when the Israelites was trying to pass through
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:06.480]   the land of Moab, and they come in closer
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:09.080]   to the promised land, land of Canaan.
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:11.720]   And as they pass through the land of,
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:15.200]   outskirt of the land of Moab,
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:20.200]   the king of Moab called Balak, right, Balak.
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:25.220]   And he hire a prophet, a false prophet named Balaam
[00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:28.120]   to curse Israel, to curse Israel,
[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:30.920]   to not to blots them, but to curse them
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:34.400]   to bring calamities over the Israelites
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.800]   as they pass through the land of Moab.
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:40.360]   But God protected the Israelites, right?
[00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:44.840]   And he turned curses into blessings.
[00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:48.360]   Now, what is going on in the Christians,
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:50.560]   some of the Christians in Pergamon was that
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:55.560]   they hold to the cultic teaching of Balaam.
[00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:58.240]   Now, I think what it means is that
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.240]   some of the Christians there
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:05.240]   were preaching for financial gain.
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:08.720]   Now, Balaam was hired, remember?
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:13.060]   He was hired for money, and he tried to curse Israel.
[00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:17.520]   And that is the figure of Balaam in the Old Testament
[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:20.320]   and in the Jewish tradition, in the biblical tradition.
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:25.240]   Balaam is a false prophet, and he does God's ministry,
[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:28.760]   or speaking the word of God, for money, right?
[00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:31.160]   To gain money, for material gain.
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:37.160]   And I'm sure this phrase here, or this description here,
[00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:39.160]   to describing some of the Christians
[00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:43.280]   who was trying to distort the gospel
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:47.400]   for their personal gain, just like what Balaam did.
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:50.560]   And second thing he has against the church in Pergamon
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:53.680]   was that they were eating food sacrificed to idols
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:57.880]   and commit spiritual, sexual immorality.
[00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:00.860]   I think it's likely at that time
[00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:05.140]   that Christians joined some of the local pagan associations,
[00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:08.000]   local pagan religious temple associations
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.020]   for financial benefits, right?
[00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:12.560]   Because if you join them, right, join the club,
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:15.600]   then you will have a better business
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:18.820]   and better job opportunities for financial gain, right?
[00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:23.700]   But in joining some of the pagan anti-Christian associations,
[00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:25.640]   they had to renounce their faith,
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:30.320]   or they have to renounce their faith for a moment, right?
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:32.220]   And they come back to church and they praise Jesus
[00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:34.620]   and say Christ is the Lord.
[00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:35.940]   But Monday to Saturday,
[00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:38.840]   they're worshipping the false gods, right?
[00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:41.860]   I think that's what happening here.
[00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:46.720]   It is turning Christian faith into making money.
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:50.760]   Turning Christian faith for our own benefit, right?
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:53.100]   Sexual immorality, right?
[00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:56.580]   For our own sexual satisfaction, right?
[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:00.960]   If you think about it,
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:03.380]   this letter was not just written
[00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:05.720]   to Christians in the ancient world.
[00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:09.660]   It's also written to us, right?
[00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:14.040]   Turning our faith into making profit for ourselves, right?
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:17.960]   To satisfy ourselves, right?
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:19.780]   Don't we see that a lot?
[00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:22.660]   We believe in Christ, but ultimately,
[00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:26.660]   you know, at the bottom of our heart, we want benefit.
[00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:29.100]   We want material gains, right?
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:31.560]   We have faith, yeah,
[00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:34.600]   but we want that faith to be twisted
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:37.840]   so that we have freedom to commit sins, right?
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:41.540]   And that is a crisis of faith, right?
[00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:46.680]   That's what American culture does to all of us, right?
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:49.360]   It's consumerism, right?
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:53.200]   We go to church just like we go to Walmart, right?
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:55.680]   We go to church just like we go to Whole Foods.
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:58.840]   We like to pick and choose,
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:02.820]   and then ultimately, it's for our own benefit.
[00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:04.940]   If we do that, if we have that kind of spirit,
[00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:08.240]   if we have that kind of mentality distorted,
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:12.260]   we're no longer following Jesus, right?
[00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:16.800]   We are simply, in the name of faith,
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:21.800]   we want to gain some financial benefit, right?
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:24.000]   Some satisfactions for ourselves.
[00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:25.700]   And that's what Jesus said,
[00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:27.840]   "I have a few things against you," right?
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:33.220]   Even some of you who hold to the teaching of Balaam
[00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:36.300]   for financial gain in the name of faith, right?
[00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:37.620]   "I have this against you."
[00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:43.100]   He continues to say, "Repent, therefore."
[00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:44.200]   Repent.
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:46.140]   You gotta turn around, you know?
[00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:50.560]   You see what faith is all about, what Jesus is all about.
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:54.060]   Otherwise, Jesus said, "I will soon come to you
[00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:56.740]   "and fight against them with the sword of my mouth.
[00:24:56.740 --> 00:25:00.020]   "He who has an ear, let him hear
[00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:02.040]   "what the Spirit says to the churches.
[00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:03.360]   "To him who overcomes,
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:06.260]   "I will give some of the hidden manna.
[00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:08.480]   "I will also give him a white stone
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:10.440]   "with a new name written on it,
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:13.820]   "known only to him who receives it."
[00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:15.400]   Now, this is a stern warning,
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:19.600]   stern warning of twisting the gospel
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:21.480]   into self-seeking religion.
[00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:26.540]   If you understand faith in this way,
[00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:29.420]   if faith is simply self-seeking,
[00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:30.940]   looking for your own benefit,
[00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:33.320]   that is not biblical faith.
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:35.580]   That is Balaam.
[00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:39.880]   That is anti-faith, right?
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.820]   That is not biblical faith.
[00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:43.580]   And the judgment of God is severe.
[00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:47.980]   Jesus said, "I am coming to you," right?
[00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:49.640]   So you have to repent right now.
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:52.740]   But there's also reward.
[00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:56.880]   If you repent, if you follow Jesus with your whole heart,
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:59.820]   right, there's also blessing.
[00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:03.020]   The hidden manna, what is that?
[00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:04.360]   Manna.
[00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:07.780]   We caused you the story
[00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:10.740]   of the Israelites going through the wilderness.
[00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:14.460]   In the wilderness, they had no food, right?
[00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:18.480]   They had no water, but God gave them manna, right?
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:19.580]   God gave them manna.
[00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:25.740]   It symbolizes God's faithful provision.
[00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:28.420]   God is gonna provide for you, right?
[00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:31.060]   If you repent, if you follow Jesus wholeheartedly,
[00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:36.380]   you know that God is going to provide for you, right?
[00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:38.440]   Now think about it.
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:41.080]   Don't you think at times
[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:42.640]   we're not committing ourselves to Jesus
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:47.480]   because we just don't believe that God can provide?
[00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:51.300]   Sometimes in the bottom of our hearts,
[00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:53.700]   we just don't think God is so good, right?
[00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:56.980]   We just don't think God is so faithful, right?
[00:26:56.980 --> 00:27:01.140]   That's why we have to gain something, right?
[00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:06.380]   Just like the Israelites in the wilderness did, right?
[00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:07.620]   They just don't think that God
[00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:09.720]   will provide double on Friday.
[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:13.220]   So before Shabbat, some of those people,
[00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:16.800]   they get the double of the portion they need, right?
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:17.940]   Because in the bottom of their hearts,
[00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:20.540]   they just don't believe that God is so good,
[00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:22.200]   God is so faithful.
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:28.180]   Here Jesus affirms that God is the faithful provider,
[00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:31.580]   and you have to step out of your comfort zone.
[00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:34.680]   You have to take a step of faith
[00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:37.260]   and believe that God will provide.
[00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:40.180]   He has prepared for you manna,
[00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:43.220]   spiritual food to satisfy you, right?
[00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:45.620]   Which is better than other food.
[00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:49.860]   And he has also promised a name on white stone, right?
[00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:55.120]   We're talking about archeology because that's my area.
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:56.460]   If you go to the ancient site,
[00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:59.880]   you always find some big stone, a slab of stone,
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:02.780]   and with the name of Roman emperors
[00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:06.780]   and the famous people inscribed on them, right?
[00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:09.120]   Yeah, just like Hollywood, right?
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:09.960]   You walk on the street,
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:12.680]   you have this important names, right?
[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:14.340]   To step on, you can step on them.
[00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:19.100]   And they're permanently inscribed on stone
[00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:21.640]   and indestructible.
[00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:26.980]   And what Jesus promised us is that a name on white stone,
[00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:30.560]   a permanent remembrance of your name,
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:33.340]   a permanent memorial of your name, right?
[00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:35.620]   And that's a big deal in the ancient Near East.
[00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:37.400]   That's a big deal in the ancient society.
[00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:40.100]   My name wants to continue, right?
[00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:42.340]   That's why I have my son, my grandson,
[00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:46.260]   because I want to perpetuate my name.
[00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:49.940]   And Jesus promised you, if you're faithful,
[00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:53.460]   your name will be inscribed on white stone.
[00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:59.100]   But here, you must remain faithful.
[00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:02.620]   And you must remember, God is good.
[00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:08.280]   God is faithful and we can depend on him, right?
[00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:13.620]   I want to spend some moment to pray.
[00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:18.420]   The thing about who God is,
[00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:23.700]   who God is to you, is he such a faithful God?
[00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:26.300]   Is he just a good God that you can depend on?
[00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:29.540]   You can trust him wholeheartedly.
[00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:33.580]   Let's repent, let us come before him,
[00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:36.220]   knowing that he is indeed faithful and loving.
[00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:38.380]   Let's all pray.
[00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:41.300]   (soft piano music)
[00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:57.000]   Our loving Father, thank you for your word.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.380]   Thank you for your reminder,
[00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:03.900]   your evaluation and your commendation
[00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:07.620]   and even your teaching.
[00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:09.700]   To correct us.
[00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:13.380]   So we come before you,
[00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:18.700]   knowing that you are such a great God of grace.
[00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:23.220]   Thank you for your redemption.
[00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:28.220]   Thank you for your gracious provision.
[00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:35.460]   And the fact that your son, Jesus Christ,
[00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:38.660]   came to die for our sin
[00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:41.140]   and rose from the dead for all of us,
[00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:45.820]   to restore our relationship to you,
[00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:48.460]   this fact reminds us,
[00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:51.420]   you are such a good and faithful, gracious God.
[00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:54.380]   Forgive us for our little faith.
[00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:58.980]   Forgive us for sometimes in the name of you,
[00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:01.060]   in the name of faith,
[00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:04.460]   we are self-seeking.
[00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:07.940]   So we come before you as you admonish us
[00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:13.540]   to repent, to change our way, to change our attitude,
[00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:16.580]   to change our mentality, change our heart, please.
[00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:19.780]   May your spirit change us,
[00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:22.180]   help us repent and help us to come before you.
[00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:25.780]   Just know that, believe that,
[00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:29.340]   and trust that you are such a faithful and good God.
[00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:34.460]   Thank you for being our God.
[00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:37.540]   So I pray for all the brothers and sisters here,
[00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:38.620]   pray for myself,
[00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:44.260]   that you'll grant us this heart of purity.
[00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:47.700]   So wholeheartedly we will follow you,
[00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:50.900]   wholeheartedly we will obey you
[00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:55.620]   and help us to be renewed in your grace
[00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:58.620]   and our lives can be witnessed in this city,
[00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:02.500]   witnessed to how great you are,
[00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:05.740]   witnessed to the name of Jesus,
[00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:08.700]   to help people to be introduced into your presence,

[00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:26.860]   and we can trust you wholeheartedly.
[00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:30.780]   Father, in Christ's name we pray.
