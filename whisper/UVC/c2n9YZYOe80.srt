1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,520
 Alright family, we are back and we are once again in Matthew chapter 6.

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:11,680
 Continue to look at this kingdom values study that we've been going through for a while.

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:16,680
 Looking at the values of the kingdom of heaven that Jesus wants us, if we are his disciples,

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,760
 his followers, if we are subjects of the kingdom, then he wants us to live out these values.

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,960
 In the past few weeks we've been talking about hypocrisy and how Jesus in the first part

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,640
 of Matthew 6 is calling us to avoid hypocrisy.

7
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,520
 He's pointing out how damaging and devastating it is in our lives.

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,920
 He's also pointing out a little bit just how silly and foolish it can be for us to live

9
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,760
 as hypocrites and yet it's clearly something that all of us as humans do.

10
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,700
 And as we talked about a few weeks ago, as humans we're all experts at it.

11
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,160
 We all are hypocrites.

12
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:59,320
 That hypocrisy can also easily come into our life as followers of Jesus.

13
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:04,360
 It can easily come into our faith and when it does it can have absolutely devastating

14
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,660
 consequences.

15
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,520
 And last week we talked some about that.

16
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,720
 How if maybe we've been hurt by hypocrisy in the church, maybe we've been hurt by someone

17
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,960
 else who treated us with hypocrisy or someone who lived hypocrisy in front of us and maybe

18
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,720
 it damaged our faith in Jesus or maybe it just hurt us in some way.

19
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,800
 We talked about ways that we can get past that.

20
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:32,840
 We can redirect our focus back to Jesus and we can begin to experience forgiveness even

21
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,560
 for those who have hurt us.

22
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,920
 We can begin to take those misplaced standards and misplaced expectations and misplaced pain.

23
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,600
 We can see that Jesus is not the source of our pain.

24
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,560
 Jesus is not the source of hypocrisy or self-righteousness.

25
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,000
 That's never something that Jesus called his people to live out.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,560
 Jesus wants us to live out the opposite.

27
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:56,520
 He wants us to live out authenticity and transparency and honesty and love for one another.

28
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,400
 And we can learn to walk in forgiveness.

29
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,660
 And this week we're going to talk about something that's probably going to be a little bit more

30
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,880
 convicting for us, a little bit more challenging.

31
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,360
 It's going to hit a little bit closer to home for us and that is the hypocrisy that we exhibit

32
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,160
 in our own lives.

33
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,120
 Last week we were more talking about hypocrisy that someone else has exhibited and how that

34
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,360
 might have affected us.

35
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,240
 But this week we're going to focus on our own hypocrisy and how we live it out and how

36
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:27,680
 we are dishonest about the fact that we're living it out and how much it hurts us and

37
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,320
 hurts the people around us.

38
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,160
 So let's jump into this here.

39
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,800
 We're looking specifically at verses five and six of Matthew chapter six today, but

40
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,200
 we're going to go ahead and read the first four verses as well just to give us kind of

41
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,560
 a big picture of what Jesus is saying here.

42
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,680
 So it says this, "Beware of practicing your righteousness before other people in order

43
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,320
 to be seen by them.

44
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:53,000
 For then you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven.

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Thus, when you give to the needy, sound no trumpet before you as the hypocrites do, in

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,120
 the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be praised by others.

47
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,320
 Truly I say to you, they have received their reward.

48
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,800
 But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is

49
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,280
 doing, so that your giving may be in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will reward

50
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,360
 you.

51
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,480
 And when you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites, for they love to stand and pray

52
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:25,360
 in the synagogues and at the street corners, that they may be seen by others.

53
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,440
 Truly I say to you, they have received their reward.

54
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,840
 But when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in

55
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,920
 secret, and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.

56
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,600
 Now as we've discussed hypocrisy the last few weeks, we've kind of defined it out of

57
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,600
 this passage.

58
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,880
 And we've defined it in a few ways.

59
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:50,520
 We've defined it as pretending to be something we're not, or acting as if we are something

60
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,880
 that we're not.

61
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:57,040
 And we've defined it as deceiving ourselves or others into thinking that we can meet God's

62
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:03,400
 standard of holiness, that we can be who God wants us to be, when we can't meet that standard

63
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,400
 and we don't.

64
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,680
 Not on our own, not without Christ.

65
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,880
 With Christ living through us, we can, because Jesus lived the perfect life.

66
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,880
 But on our own, we can't.

67
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:16,360
 And when we deceive ourselves into thinking we can, that's hypocrisy.

68
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:20,640
 And then another great definition of hypocrisy that we pull straight out of scripture is

69
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,320
 from Luke chapter 18, verse 9.

70
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:28,020
 And this is Jesus telling a parable, and it says, "He also told this parable to some who

71
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:32,960
 trusted in themselves that they were righteous and treated others with content."

72
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,760
 And I think that's a great definition of hypocrisy as well.

73
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:40,440
 Trusting in ourselves that we're righteous and treating others with content.

74
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:46,040
 And we've also defined it as putting the spotlight on us, wanting to glorify ourselves instead

75
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,040
 of glorifying God.

76
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,140
 We talked about the distinction between Matthew 5, 16, where Jesus tells us to let our light

77
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:57,200
 shine before men so that they will see our good works and glorify our Father in heaven.

78
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:03,440
 And then here in Matthew 6, 1, where he says that don't do things to be seen by others.

79
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,920
 God doesn't want us to do things to glorify ourselves, to put the focus on us.

80
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:13,560
 He wants us to do things to glorify him and put the focus on him so that people will see

81
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:19,040
 him, so that Jesus will be seen through our lives and that God will be glorified and people

82
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,680
 will be drawn to Christ.

83
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,360
 And today I want us to think about a few different aspects of what we're actually doing when

84
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:31,360
 we live dishonestly, when we pretend that we're something that we're not, when we pretend

85
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,600
 to be more righteous than we are, when we pretend that we're the ones who are going

86
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,080
 to fulfill God's standard.

87
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,400
 When we do that, we're living out hypocrisy.

88
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,400
 But sometimes we think it may not be that big of a deal.

89
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,140
 It's okay if people think I'm a little bit better than I am.

90
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:51,100
 And we don't see how serious that can be in our life.

91
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,320
 We don't see what's actually at the root of it and what's actually taking place.

92
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,520
 So we're going to talk about that today.

93
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:03,080
 And the first thing I want us to see is that when we live out hypocrisy, there is a matter

94
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,360
 of stolen glory involved.

95
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,560
 Stolen glory.

96
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:13,600
 Because we know if we understand the scripture that all glory belongs to God.

97
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,000
 God is the creator.

98
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,440
 God is the redeemer.

99
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,280
 God is the one who loves us and gave himself for us.

100
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,200
 That's what the scripture tells us.

101
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,560
 The glory belongs to him.

102
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:29,480
 And yet we as humans have a desire to steal some of that glory for ourselves.

103
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,720
 We want the focus to be on us.

104
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,860
 We want the attention to be on us.

105
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,320
 We want to glorify ourselves.

106
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,320
 That's our pride.

107
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,200
 We talked about that the first week that we spoke about hypocrisy.

108
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,860
 How pride is the root of our hypocrisy.

109
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:51,280
 And that pride causes us to want to steal some of God's glory and redirect it at ourselves.

110
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,760
 And that was the sin of the devil in the beginning.

111
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:58,880
 Remember he wanted to be like the most high and that's why he rebelled against God.

112
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,300
 That's what he tempted Adam and Eve with in the garden.

113
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:06,880
 He said, "Hey, don't you want to be like God and know good and evil?"

114
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:12,160
 And that's a core temptation for us in our life every day.

115
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,800
 And it's certainly the root of hypocrisy is that temptation to say, "I want to be like

116
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,800
 God.

117
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,440
 I want to be the center of attention.

118
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,400
 I want to steal some of His glory.

119
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:26,960
 I want to be full of pride and focus everything on myself."

120
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,640
 And that's what we're doing when we begin to live in a way where we're pretending to

121
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,000
 be something that we're not.

122
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,900
 We're stealing the glory that belongs to God and trying to direct it on ourselves.

123
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:45,280
 We see this in this verse here where Jesus says that the hypocrites love to stand and

124
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:51,040
 pray in the synagogues and at the street corners that they may be seen by others.

125
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,360
 And all of us have that in us.

126
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,120
 We want to do our good works.

127
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,040
 We want to do things to be seen by others.

128
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,240
 We want others to see what we're doing.

129
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,880
 We want to do it in front of others.

130
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:09,760
 We want to do it before others so that they will see us and regard us as good and regard

131
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:14,840
 us as special, regard us as righteous, and in some way glorify us.

132
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,400
 That's what we want.

133
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,240
 That's at the root of our hypocrisy.

134
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,360
 We want to do those things before others.

135
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,000
 Now some of us may say, "Well, I don't do that."

136
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,120
 You know, the examples that Jesus gives us here are pretty over the top, right?

137
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,640
 When He talks about someone giving to the needy, He says that they're sounding a trumpet

138
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:41,320
 in the street to draw attention to themselves so everybody will see it and to amplify what

139
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,320
 they're doing.

140
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,400
 When He talks about people praying, He says they're standing and praying on the street

141
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,240
 corner loudly so that everybody will look.

142
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,600
 We may say, "Okay, wait a second.

143
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,600
 I don't do that.

144
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,360
 You know, when I help someone out, I don't sound a trumpet.

145
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:59,000
 I don't go out and pray in the middle of the street so that people will see what I'm doing."

146
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,880
 But Jesus is pointing out not just the specific situation.

147
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,040
 He's pointing out the heart behind it.

148
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,560
 And we definitely share that heart behind it.

149
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,560
 I mean, let's be honest.

150
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,360
 Probably none of us have ever gone out and sounded a trumpet before we did something

151
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,000
 to help someone else.

152
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,880
 But I can't think of very many ways at all to more powerfully and visibly focus attention

153
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:26,040
 on ourselves than to use some of our modern technology, right?

154
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,200
 And we do it.

155
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,020
 We go out to serve.

156
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:34,480
 We go out to help at the soup kitchen or the shelter or this place or that place.

157
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:41,840
 And we use our social media or some other form of technology to let everybody know what

158
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,000
 we're doing.

159
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,320
 That's really the modern equivalent of sounding the trumpet, right?

160
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:52,080
 And again, I'm not saying that it's wrong for us to let other people see our good works.

161
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,640
 Matthew 5:16 says we should let others see our good works, but they should see it in

162
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,960
 such a way that the glory is focused on God.

163
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,720
 So I'm not saying it's wrong for you to take a picture of something you're doing and share

164
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,720
 it with other people.

165
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,160
 That's fine.

166
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:10,760
 But if your heart motivation in doing that is to focus people on yourselves, to glorify

167
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,960
 yourself, then you're sounding a trumpet.

168
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,440
 You're doing it in order to glorify yourself.

169
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,640
 And that is wrong.

170
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,440
 That's what Jesus calls out in this passage.

171
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,320
 And we see this replete throughout our culture and our society.

172
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,320
 Think about it.

173
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:32,520
 The celebrities, all of the politicians, all of the people in our culture and society,

174
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,880
 that they won't even show up to help.

175
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,720
 They won't even do something unless the cameras are going to be there.

176
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,720
 If it's not a photo op, then to them it never even happened.

177
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,840
 It's not worth doing if no one's going to know about it.

178
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,160
 And sometimes we live that way ourselves.

179
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:52,440
 We think, "Well, yeah, I kind of want to be a part of this, but I'm so busy.

180
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,240
 Oh, but someone else is going to be there and they're going to see me doing it.

181
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,360
 Yeah, that makes it a lot more appealing to me."

182
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,600
 Or, "I'll have an opportunity to share it with other people and they'll know what I'm

183
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,600
 doing."

184
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,680
 Yeah, that makes it a bigger deal.

185
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,560
 And that shouldn't make it a bigger deal.

186
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,600
 We should be committed to doing the right and to living in obedience to God and to living

187
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,960
 out what God wants us to do, whether or not it gets noticed by anybody.

188
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:20,320
 And we should be committed to the fact that if it does get noticed by someone, we should

189
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,080
 direct that attention towards God, not towards ourself.

190
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:30,600
 But that's a difficult thing to do because we all want to do our good works before others.

191
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,040
 Now some of us might say, "Well, wait a second.

192
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,320
 I'm not even sure that I even try to do good works.

193
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:40,520
 I don't even know what that means or what that is or that I'm even interested in that."

194
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:44,640
 Now we've talked about this in the past few weeks, that as believers, as followers of

195
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,720
 Jesus, as subjects of the kingdom, that God is interested in the condition of our heart.

196
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,400
 We don't do good works to earn favor with God.

197
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,360
 We don't do good works to please God.

198
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,640
 We don't do good works to get to heaven.

199
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,780
 None of that.

200
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,600
 We do good works because God is changing our heart.

201
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,560
 If we really have relationship with God through Jesus, God is at work changing our heart.

202
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:10,120
 And out of that change, out of that transformation, good works come and beautiful good works come.

203
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,040
 But the good works are not the starting point.

204
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,280
 God's change in our heart is the starting point.

205
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,400
 And the good works flow from that.

206
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,200
 They come from that.

207
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,320
 But some people may say, "Well, I'm not interested in good works.

208
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,200
 I'm not interested in trying to be a good person.

209
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,040
 I'm not out there trying to please anybody.

210
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:30,600
 I'm just doing my own thing and I don't even care what people say about it."

211
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,360
 And that sounds good for a moment.

212
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,880
 It might sound like, "Okay, yeah, I mean, that kind of gets rid of some of the hypocrisy

213
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,320
 and pride, right?

214
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,320
 If you don't care, then you're not going to be a hypocrite."

215
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,440
 But that's not even really true.

216
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,800
 The reality is all of us have some standard of morality that we live by.

217
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,960
 We all have some things that we think are good as opposed to other things that we think

218
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,520
 are bad.

219
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:57,440
 Even if you say, "Okay, I'm an anarchist, so I don't think there should be any rules

220
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,880
 about what's good in society and I don't think there should be anything that should be a

221
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,800
 good work in society."

222
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:09,760
 Well, the reality is you have in that position defined a good work, right?

223
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,840
 Because you said that it's good to have no rules and that that's what's best.

224
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:19,400
 And that if you do try to have rules in society and enforce those rules on other people, then

225
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,400
 that's bad.

226
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:25,200
 So if you've, from your position, defined a good work and a bad work, even if you say

227
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,560
 that you're an anarchist and you don't care and you don't want any rules and you want

228
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:34,800
 chaos, you still believe that some things are good and some things are bad.

229
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,000
 All of us do.

230
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,600
 So we can't hide behind the fact that we may say, "Well, I'm not as interested in religion

231
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,880
 or I'm not really caught up in Jesus and so I don't really care, so I'm not a hypocrite."

232
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,680
 That's actually not true.

233
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:53,080
 All of us have some system of morality, some things that we think are good and some things

234
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,000
 that we think are not good.

235
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,400
 And the reality is whatever that system is for whoever you're talking about, all of us

236
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:05,120
 as humans want to do the things that we define as good in front of other people so they will

237
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,380
 see them and praise us.

238
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:12,700
 Even the anarchist wants to go out and create anarchy for other people to see so that other

239
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,000
 people can praise what they're doing.

240
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,040
 All of us do that as humans.

241
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,560
 All of us live in hypocrisy in that way.

242
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:24,640
 We want to steal God's glory and direct it to ourselves.

243
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:31,060
 Another way we really see our hypocrisy in stealing God's glory is in this human nature

244
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:36,040
 of always seeing the problem in someone else and not seeing our own issues.

245
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:41,640
 We always excuse ourselves and our sin and our injustice and we see the problems of others.

246
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,080
 Jesus talks about this later in the Sermon on the Mount when he talks about the fact

247
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:51,140
 that we as humans see the little specks of dust in someone else's eye and overlook the

248
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,640
 giant log that's in our own eye.

249
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,200
 And he makes that illustration for us.

250
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,480
 But we do that all the time.

251
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,120
 We say, "Oh, not me.

252
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,240
 I would never do that.

253
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,720
 I would never be a hypocrite.

254
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,360
 I would never do good works in front of others.

255
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,000
 I would never sound a trumpet.

256
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,800
 That's just not me at all."

257
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,800
 And yet we turn around and see what everyone else is doing and point out what they're doing

258
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,920
 and get frustrated about what they're doing.

259
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:21,040
 We see this so much in our culture all the time.

260
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:26,840
 You know, right now we're just weeks away from a big election and this is so heavy in

261
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,560
 our politics.

262
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,360
 Hypocrisy is so heavy in our politics.

263
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,760
 It's so heavy right now that you could literally cut it with a knife.

264
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,880
 It's so thick in the air.

265
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,440
 Every other commercial on TV is a political commercial.

266
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:47,200
 And if we use our definition from Luke 18, 9 where Jesus says that hypocrites are those

267
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:51,120
 who trust in themselves that they're righteous and treat others with contempt, man, that

268
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:56,340
 would be a great definition of every single political commercial we see.

269
00:15:56,340 --> 00:16:02,780
 Every commercial you see is a candidate demonstrating by their words and the pictures of themselves

270
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:08,480
 why they are righteous and why the person they're running against is contemptible.

271
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,320
 And that's exactly what our politics is full of.

272
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,080
 And our politics is full of this "not me" attitude.

273
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:18,840
 The reality is throughout our politics in both parties there are things that are deeply

274
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,800
 dishonoring to God.

275
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,800
 And yet both parties are full of people who are convinced that they are completely righteous

276
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,200
 and that all the hypocrites and all the sinners are in the other party.

277
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,200
 And that's how everybody acts.

278
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,400
 But the reality is it's not just in our politics.

279
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,180
 That's how we all act as human anyway.

280
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:40,300
 We are all convinced that the problem is with everybody else.

281
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,300
 It's not me.

282
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,280
 I'm doing right over here, God.

283
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,780
 It's not me.

284
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:48,960
 Because we have stolen God's glory and we have said, "You know what?

285
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,000
 I'm doing it right.

286
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 I'm getting it right.

287
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,080
 I'm being obedient.

288
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,080
 I'm righteous."

289
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:58,960
 It's all those other people who are deserving of guilt or shame or punishment or something

290
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,960
 like that.

291
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,080
 But I'm the good person over here.

292
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,580
 We've stolen God's glory.

293
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:09,120
 The other thing that we steal in our hypocrisy is we want to steal God's throne.

294
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,580
 We want to steal God's rule.

295
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,720
 We want to steal God's control.

296
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,600
 We want to take control of our image.

297
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,840
 We want to take control of how other people perceive us.

298
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:21,720
 We don't want to admit that we could have a weakness or a failing in any way.

299
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,660
 We don't want anyone to think or imagine that we could ever have a problem.

300
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,700
 So we try to hide it.

301
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,480
 We try to pretend we're something that we're not.

302
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,760
 We practice hypocrisy because we're trying to control our image.

303
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,320
 We're trying to steal God's rulership, God's throne.

304
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:42,680
 We try to control our success and not by defining success in the way that God has defined it,

305
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:48,740
 but defining it according to our own definition, which is how other people view us, how much

306
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:53,000
 we can accomplish and achieve here on the earth in this life.

307
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,580
 And we try to control our success by controlling what other people see of us.

308
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:03,940
 We try to make sure that we're successful because we give this tightly controlled image

309
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:06,880
 and perception of ourselves to other people.

310
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:12,080
 And we are taking away God's control over our life that rightly belongs to God.

311
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:17,100
 We try to control our righteousness and we do that by trying to redefine what is actually

312
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,100
 right and wrong.

313
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:21,600
 Like I said earlier, everybody has a standard of morality.

314
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,200
 The only distinction is where that standard comes from.

315
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,800
 Now Christians are unique because our standard comes from beyond ourselves.

316
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,280
 It doesn't come from within us.

317
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,040
 It comes from God's Word.

318
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,120
 It comes from God Himself.

319
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,520
 That's our standard of morality.

320
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:40,880
 And Christians also are unique because we understand that we can't live up to God's

321
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,160
 standard, that we all fall short and only through Christ can we achieve rightness with

322
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,280
 God.

323
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,440
 But for most people, their standard of morality comes from within themselves.

324
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,880
 They want to be in control of what righteousness is.

325
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,720
 They want to be in control of what right and wrong is.

326
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,640
 And they try to do that by defining it for themselves.

327
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,920
 And they're stealing that throne from God.

328
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,440
 God is the one who says what is right and wrong.

329
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,000
 God is the one who defines righteousness, not us.

330
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,640
 We try to define those standards for ourselves and as we do that, we are stealing away the

331
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,720
 authority that only belongs to God.

332
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,160
 The other thing that we try to steal is our destiny.

333
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,440
 The reality is that Jesus is the only way to God.

334
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:30,200
 The reality is that the grace of Jesus Christ is the only way to satisfy God's standards.

335
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,240
 Those things are so clear in the Bible.

336
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:37,440
 There is no other way that we can have relationship with God except through Jesus.

337
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,740
 There's no other way that we can achieve holiness and that we can be right except through Jesus

338
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,740
 Christ.

339
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,880
 And we don't achieve that holiness through our good works.

340
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:51,680
 We achieve it when we surrender to Christ and His righteousness washes over us and covers

341
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,680
 us.

342
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:58,360
 And there's no other way apart from that for us to be righteous and to be right with God.

343
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,080
 And yet we don't want that to be true.

344
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,560
 We don't want Jesus to be the only way to God.

345
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,760
 We want to make a way on our own.

346
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:10,080
 We don't want to believe that we might have to rely on the sacrifice and forgiveness of

347
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,660
 Jesus for righteousness.

348
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:16,440
 We want to somehow prove ourselves righteous apart from God.

349
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:21,560
 And as we do that, we try to take control of our eternal destiny in a way that we cannot

350
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,200
 because it only belongs to God.

351
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,940
 Jesus is the only Redeemer.

352
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:34,200
 And Jesus is the only way for us to experience health and shalom and healing in this world.

353
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,120
 And yet we try every other way.

354
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,520
 And we try to fix things in every other way.

355
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:45,080
 And it doesn't work, but we keep trying and keep wanting to pull destiny away from God

356
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,880
 and the future of what it means to be human.

357
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,080
 We want to pull that away from God and define it ourselves.

358
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,720
 And we keep failing.

359
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:00,760
 You know, Jesus in Matthew 5 and 6 and 7 throughout the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus is giving us

360
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:06,360
 this new way to be human, this way of love, this way to love God and love those around

361
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,360
 us.

362
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,800
 And it's really a new way because it's been around since the beginning.

363
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,960
 It's the old way that God called us to in the beginning that we never lived out.

364
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:18,280
 And so it seemed like a new way when Jesus was expressing it in Matthew 5.

365
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:24,360
 It seemed like a new way because what people had been living out was their own way.

366
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:28,160
 And that way was the way of vengeance and retribution.

367
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:33,120
 Ever since Cain, the first siblings, Cain and Abel, Cain decided, "You know what?

368
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,840
 The way to fix my problems is to take revenge on my brother, is to get him out of the way,

369
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,440
 is to make him hurt.

370
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,160
 And that's what's going to fix things."

371
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,800
 And ever since then, that has been the cycle of humanity.

372
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:49,880
 People have tried to fix problems with revenge, with retribution, with war, with fighting,

373
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,580
 with violence, with oppression, and with hurt.

374
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:56,760
 And when someone hurts someone else, people say, "Well, the way to fix that is to hurt

375
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,760
 them right back."

376
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,720
 That's been the story of humanity since the beginning of time.

377
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,600
 That's what we as humans have chosen again and again and again.

378
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:10,200
 And Jesus has said clearly in the Sermon on the Mount, "No, there's another way.

379
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:15,360
 I want you to choose the way of love, the way of peace, the way of relationship with

380
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,120
 God, the way of caring for one another."

381
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,280
 Jesus is calling us to that.

382
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,480
 But we don't want that destiny for ourselves.

383
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:28,020
 We say, "No, God, I want to go back to my way, which is revenge, retribution, getting

384
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,020
 even.

385
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:32,120
 It's taking my revenge on someone else."

386
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:37,280
 We try to steal destiny, and we don't have that authority.

387
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,700
 And when we try to do that, it ends in disaster every time.

388
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:46,540
 And sadly, even though we've seen it end in disaster a thousand times before, we still

389
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:49,840
 think we're going to try it one more time, and this time it'll actually work, and it'll

390
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,800
 actually come out right, and it'll actually make us feel better.

391
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,200
 And then it doesn't.

392
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:58,440
 But we still try it again, and we turn back to it again and again.

393
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:04,440
 We want to pull destiny away from God and try to pull it down to ourselves and think

394
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:08,160
 that we're going to fix our lives, we're going to fix our future, we're going to fix the

395
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,280
 world, we're going to fix everything.

396
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,280
 And we can't.

397
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:17,920
 Now, what Jesus is pointing out to us in this passage is that hypocrisy is so damaging,

398
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,280
 it's so devastating, it's so wrong.

399
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:25,240
 It's ultimately, as we discussed today, a direct attack on God's authority and on who

400
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,800
 God is.

401
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:32,200
 It's trying to steal from God, and that is completely wrong.

402
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:38,180
 And what Jesus is pointing us towards is the fact that we have got to avoid it as subjects

403
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:43,720
 of the kingdom, as followers of Jesus, because it is a powerful and constant temptation to

404
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:48,300
 us as human beings, and we've got to strive to avoid it.

405
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:54,080
 So I want us to think about how we can avoid it as we close out today, how we can avoid

406
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,080
 these things.

407
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:59,460
 We've talked before about the best way that we can avoid pride is by living in a place

408
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:04,900
 of poverty of spirit, living in a place of seeing and admitting our own spiritual bankruptcy

409
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:10,680
 before God, seeing and admitting our need for God and saying, "God, I understand that

410
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:17,400
 I am broken, that I am full of sin in my heart, that I'm full of selfishness, that if I just

411
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:23,200
 had my own way, I would be hurting other people, I would be trying to glorify myself, I would

412
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,480
 be trying to do all this stuff."

413
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:30,240
 And when we're able to be honest and transparent before God and see our own brokenness, our

414
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:36,840
 own need, then that gets rid of that pride and it gets rid of that hypocrisy.

415
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:42,280
 We've got to do what Jesus suggests in this passage, which is to hide our good works.

416
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:47,000
 That's actually a really good thing to do, is as much as possible, and this isn't like

417
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,960
 a law, you don't need to try to make it into some hard and fast rule that you have to follow

418
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:58,320
 in every instance, but as much as possible, when you go out to obey God, just do it in

419
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,680
 a way that other people aren't going to see or aren't going to notice, so that that temptation

420
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,920
 to glorify yourself doesn't take hold.

421
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:10,720
 When you go out to obey God, you should go out to obey God with the motivation of pleasing

422
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,920
 God and God alone.

423
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:17,000
 You should go out to obey God because it's the right thing to do.

424
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,800
 You should obey God in your life, whether it's in the privacy of your home or whether

425
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:24,600
 it's serving in your community in some way, you should do that because it's the right

426
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,240
 thing to do because you want to love God, you want to love others, you want to glorify

427
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,240
 God.

428
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,920
 Don't do it because other people are going to see it and notice it.

429
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,280
 As much as you can, do it in secret.

430
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,560
 Do it so that other people don't know.

431
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:41,800
 If you're going to go serve in your community, maybe you don't need to take all those pictures

432
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,360
 and post them online.

433
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,520
 Again, that doesn't mean it's wrong to do that, but just think about that.

434
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:53,680
 Just ask yourself, "Hey, can I do this in a way that the focus is not on me?"

435
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:58,520
 If someone does notice what you're doing, if someone does notice you serving and obeying

436
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:02,080
 God, then direct that attention towards God.

437
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,440
 Don't let people just say, "Oh, you're a great person.

438
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,320
 You do such a great job."

439
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,380
 That feels good and there's a part of us that is like, "Yeah, it doesn't really hurt for

440
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:16,480
 someone to glorify me a little bit, for me to get a little praise, but hey, it's going

441
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,040
 to be damaging to you and to them.

442
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:23,040
 It's damaging for others to glorify us and to think we're something we're not, and it's

443
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,040
 really damaging for us to think we're something we're not."

444
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:31,200
 So when you get a little bit of that praise, redirect it to God and be honest and say,

445
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,760
 "Hey, I'm just as broken as anybody else.

446
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,280
 I'm only here doing this because of God's work in my life.

447
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,280
 It's not me.

448
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,280
 I'm not a great person.

449
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,280
 Don't glorify me.

450
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,360
 It's because of God."

451
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,720
 Redirect that praise to Him.

452
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,440
 Don't steal God's glory.

453
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,920
 Don't steal God's throne.

454
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:51,760
 Don't try to steal God's control or God's rule in your life.

455
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:55,360
 Don't try to steal the destiny that God has for you.

456
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,400
 Don't try to redirect it into your own will.

457
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,120
 Remember Jesus, here in just a few verses, He gives us the Lord's Prayer.

458
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,040
 What does He pray at the end of the Lord's Prayer?

459
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:08,240
 "Father, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven."

460
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,400
 Don't try to make that into, "My kingdom come and my will be done."

461
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,800
 That's dangerous and that has devastating consequences.

462
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:20,760
 Don't steal the control of destiny from God.

463
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,040
 That belongs to God and God alone.

464
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,720
 The throne belongs to God and God alone.

465
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,200
 Glory belongs to God and God alone.

466
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:33,360
 If we will do these things, if we will seek to live in poverty of spirit, if we'll seek

467
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:40,720
 to take our hands off of God's glory and God's throne and the destiny that God has for us

468
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,760
 and let God be in control of those things, if we'll be honest and transparent about our

469
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:50,480
 own weaknesses and our own struggles and our own failings with the people around us, we

470
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,160
 will find ourselves living in a much more authentic way.

471
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:58,240
 We will find ourselves with very little hypocrisy in our life.

472
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,480
 And that's what Jesus is calling us to in this passage.

473
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,480
 Let's pray.

474
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,160
 God, I pray that you would give us poverty of spirit.

475
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:12,520
 You would help us to be aware of our own need for you, to be aware of our spiritual bankruptcy,

476
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:17,160
 the fact that we have nothing before you, the fact that we can't do anything on our

477
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,480
 own apart from you.

478
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:23,720
 God, I pray that you would help us to be honest about our own sins and our own struggles.

479
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,300
 Help us to be honest with the people around us.

480
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:30,680
 Help us not to cover things up or to hide things, but help us to be able to be honest

481
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,520
 and say, "Hey, I struggle as well.

482
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,680
 I'm imperfect as well.

483
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,680
 I've messed up too.

484
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,600
 But I need to repent too.

485
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,320
 I need God's help in my life."

486
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,800
 Help us to be honest and transparent with our struggles, God.

487
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:46,960
 Help us not to operate from a place of pride, but from a place of authenticity, God.

488
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,880
 God, help us not to steal any of your glory.

489
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,520
 Help us not to redirect any of the glory that should go to you towards us, God.

490
00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:00,240
 Help us to always point to you and always live in a place of humility.

491
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,380
 God, help us not to steal your throne, your control, God.

492
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:08,520
 Help us not to grab that and try to act like we are going to be in charge when we cannot

493
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,520
 be in charge.

494
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,120
 What a disaster that would be if we were in charge, God.

495
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:19,640
 God, help us not to steal the destiny that you have for us and our world and try to think

496
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,200
 that we should direct that.

497
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,720
 Help us not to think that our will should be done.

498
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,240
 Help us to always desire for your will to be done, God.

499
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:31,000
 Help us not to put ourselves in a place that we should not be in.

500
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,040
 Help us not to pretend to be something we're not.

501
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:37,320
 Help us not to think we are righteous and treat others with contempt.

502
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:43,800
 God, help us to avoid hypocrisy and to live honestly and openly as your disciples in a

503
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:50,000
 way that glorifies you, God, and that causes people to see you and to desire you and to

504
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,560
 want to know more of who you are because of what they see in our lives, God.

505
00:29:54,560 --> 00:30:00,720
 May you be glorified by the testimony of our lives, and may people see more and more of

506
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:06,800
 you in us. In Jesus name, Amen.
