 Hello, everyone! Welcome back to Family Sunday School!

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 Today is the last episode, the eighth episode.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 Last time, we talked about Good Friday,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 which is when Jesus died on the cross and was buried.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 Today, we're talking about something else.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Have you noticed what Mr. Becker is wearing?

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 What color did he wear last time?

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Yes, black!

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 What color is he wearing this time?

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 A shiny silver color!

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Huh, why?

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Last time, he wore black like a bride.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 But today, he's wearing a shiny color.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 Huh, why?

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 Today, we're going to talk about a story.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 But before the story, let's play a game.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Come on!

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Let's play Guess the Surprise!

 Let's go!

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 Behind this rock, there's a different surprise.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Take out each brick, each stone, and see what you can guess.
