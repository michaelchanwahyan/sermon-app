[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Hey guys, thank you very much for being here
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.740]   and we'll continue our series on Apostles' Creed.
[00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.400]   And my quiz for you is what is the Apostles' Creed?
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.140]   What is it?
[00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.000]   It's an ancient document,
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.020]   has been around for almost 1800 years,
[00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.520]   and it's a summary of our faith.
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.100]   It's a map of the Christian faith.
[00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.660]   And if people ask you, what do you believe in,
[00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.700]   or sometimes you may be questioning,
[00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.700]   what do I really believe in, and what should I believe in,
[00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.980]   you go to a summary or a quick document
[00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.300]   like the Apostles' Creed,
[00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.180]   and then you'll find out the basics, the core,
[00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.940]   the must do, the must believe,
[00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:53.780]   the core beliefs of our faith.
[00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.100]   Yesterday, I was blessed to attend a wedding
[00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.300]   in the West Suburb.
[00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.860]   I've never been to that neighborhood,
[00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.920]   never been to that part of the Western Suburb,
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.380]   so I turned to Google Maps.
[00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.380]   So I put in the destination, I put in the place,
[00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.660]   and I wanna find out where that is.
[00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.260]   And of course, in our days and age,
[00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.500]   and it is very convenient.
[00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.220]   You just key in the address
[00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.860]   and then you'll find out how to get there.
[00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.620]   So it shows me about an hour driving,
[00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.980]   passing through different neighborhoods,
[00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.780]   those are the details, right?
[00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.060]   I don't really care.
[00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.940]   And Google Maps doesn't show me that.
[00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.200]   It really show me is how to take a turn
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.600]   and what road to take in order to get me there, right?
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.220]   That is the summary, that is the quick,
[00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.580]   you know, core knowledge that I need
[00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.500]   to get to my destination, right?
[00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.060]   So I didn't get lost, I came back one piece, right?
[00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.580]   So that is the good thing about summary
[00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.700]   and Apostles Creek is doing something like this.
[00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.580]   Now, as the pandemic fades away, hopefully,
[00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.740]   I know we're all getting tired of it,
[00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.580]   but it is kind of being sort of under control, right?
[00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.740]   Those who are infected with COVID suffer,
[00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.180]   it depends on depending on your condition,
[00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.500]   suffer quite a bit.
[00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.420]   Or some people suffer slightly.
[00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.940]   But as the pandemic fades away,
[00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.800]   some of the people in this church are asking me,
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.280]   when are you going to Israel, right?
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.660]   When you're leading a group to Israel.
[00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.740]   And then I talk to some people, I talk to some of you,
[00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.300]   and say, yeah, I think it's doable, right?
[00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.900]   If you get enough people, we can go next week, you know?
[00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.740]   The border is open and it's very convenient.
[00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.540]   If you have a US passport, it's really convenient.
[00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.540]   I still remember talking to people
[00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.220]   about leading a group to Israel.
[00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.340]   I've been to Israel for more than 10 years,
[00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.760]   almost 20 times.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:13.220]   I still remember in the early days, 2008, 2009,
[00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:19.460]   when we go to Israel, it was not that convenient.
[00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.300]   I still had that atlas.
[00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.220]   Do you know what atlas is?
[00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.660]   Atlas of maps, right?
[00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.060]   No?
[00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.700]   Is that yeah?
[00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.700]   Atlas, you know, to print maps.
[00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.140]   It's like a book, okay?
[00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.060]   It's like a book.
[00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.380]   So it's different kinds of maps.
[00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.560]   And then, of course, you have the big map, right?
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.180]   So when you travel, when you're driving,
[00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.980]   especially in places that you are not familiar,
[00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.180]   you need those maps, right?
[00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.540]   And then you have to plan ahead of time
[00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.580]   in order to know where to turn and what road to take
[00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.580]   and how to get to your destination.
[00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.860]   But now, of course, it's a totally different ballgame, right?
[00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.200]   You go to the airport, you rent a SIM card,
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.380]   and then you plug into your smartphone
[00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.780]   and everything is there, right?
[00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.380]   You key in your address and you will get there.
[00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.180]   So it helps you with your navigation.
[00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.740]   Apostle's Creek is also a tool of navigation.
[00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.700]   Sometimes you may wonder,
[00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.620]   I know many of you, or maybe most of you,
[00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.940]   have not really read the whole Bible,
[00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.820]   cover to cover, right?
[00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.720]   Now, when people ask you, what do you believe in,
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.140]   sometimes you may wonder, you have a question mark,
[00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.220]   hey, what do I really believe in?
[00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:35.500]   What is the heart of the gospel?
[00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.100]   What is the heart of the Bible,
[00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.340]   of the heart of Christianity?
[00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.820]   And it is the Apostle's Creek.
[00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.900]   So last week, we were working through Psalm 19,
[00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.340]   the first part of Psalm 19.
[00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.740]   Now we come to the second part of Psalm 19.
[00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.140]   I told you the flow of Psalm 19 is very easy
[00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.460]   and it's very meaningful.
[00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.200]   The first part is the words of creation.
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.200]   The creation is singing and expressing their praises
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.620]   and worship to the creator.
[00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.620]   That is what we call general revelation.
[00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.020]   Everyone who walk in this world,
[00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.940]   every single square inch of this universe
[00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.900]   is the property of God, has a signature in it, right?
[00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.900]   Whether you look at the world in details,
[00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.500]   the micro perspective, or you look at the whole
[00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.900]   entire universe, the galaxies and all that stuff,
[00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.660]   the macro perspective.
[00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:42.660]   Every square inch of this creation marks the property
[00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.700]   of the creator, God himself.
[00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.820]   So the first six verses talking about general revelation,
[00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.860]   the universal revelation, everyone should know that.
[00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.700]   Everyone should be able to listen to the music
[00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.820]   of the creation, singing about the creator
[00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.220]   behind all of this, the intelligent designer
[00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.060]   of the entire universe.
[00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.300]   And then the second part is words from the creator.
[00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:13.780]   And that is what we call the special revelation.
[00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.940]   God is not just a distant creator.
[00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.280]   He created the world, boom, and it's there,
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:25.280]   and have his own mechanism and laws and principles,
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.020]   and then the universe run on itself.
[00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:32.900]   No, the Bible presents to us the God who is super involved
[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.500]   in every single thing since the first creation
[00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.020]   until now, his hand is there,
[00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.380]   even though it's invisible to our own eyes,
[00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:47.500]   but God is always involved in the creation.
[00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:51.760]   So we come to verses seven to 10, seven to 10.
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.680]   Okay, let's read that.
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:59.340]   The law of the Lord is perfect, reviving the soul.
[00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.820]   The statue of the Lord are trustworthy,
[00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.980]   making wise the simple.
[00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.040]   The precepts of the Lord are right,
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.220]   giving joy to the heart.
[00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.400]   The commands of the Lord are radiant,
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.380]   giving light to the eyes.
[00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:19.140]   The fear of the Lord is pure, enduring forever.
[00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:21.580]   The ordinances of the Lord are sure
[00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:23.540]   and altogether righteous.
[00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.260]   They are more precious than gold,
[00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.940]   much, than much pure gold.
[00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:32.100]   They are sweeter than honey, than honey from the comb.
[00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:36.480]   Now you can find three pairs of terms
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.700]   that describe the word of God.
[00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.300]   Can you find them?
[00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:42.940]   Three pairs, so a total of six terms.
[00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:46.580]   Six different technical terms from the Old Testament
[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.660]   describing the word of God.
[00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:49.980]   Can you find them?
[00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:53.260]   The first one being the law, right?
[00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:54.100]   Law.
[00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:58.980]   Now behind this English translation, law, L-A-W,
[00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:03.980]   is the Hebrew word Torah, Torah.
[00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:09.080]   Torah means more than, so much than the law, right?
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.480]   When we think of law today,
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.420]   well 55 miles per hour speed limit, right?
[00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:17.760]   Don't park there and all that stuff, right?
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.940]   You park there, your car get towed.
[00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:25.500]   Those are the connotation that we have today
[00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.260]   when we hear the word law.
[00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:32.180]   However, Torah means so much more than that.
[00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:37.020]   Torah means instructions, direction.
[00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:40.660]   You know, like your Google map,
[00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:43.900]   like a compass, compass on the map.
[00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:47.180]   You know, showing you the instructions
[00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:49.860]   to teach us to go the right way.
[00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:52.620]   The second term is testimony, right?
[00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:54.300]   Or a statue, right?
[00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:57.660]   Testimony, some of the English translation will do that.
[00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:01.180]   Statue or testimony.
[00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:05.580]   And the meaning of the word is reminder.
[00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:09.020]   Are you forgetful?
[00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:11.260]   You are, right?
[00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:12.960]   I am very forgetful.
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.420]   I'm very, very forgetful.
[00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:19.140]   You know, my family members can testify to that, right?
[00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:22.740]   I'm very forgetful because I'm so focused, you know?
[00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:24.180]   I'm so focused.
[00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:26.760]   I'm so focused on a few things, right?
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:31.260]   And then sometimes I need to forget other things, right?
[00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.400]   But testimony or statue is reminder.
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.060]   Some sort of reminder in our daily life
[00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:40.260]   to bring us back to the relationship with God, right?
[00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:45.100]   Number three is precepts, precepts.
[00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:49.580]   Now, all these six terms are pretty synonymous.
[00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:51.460]   They could point to the same thing,
[00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:53.460]   but their connotation, their meaning
[00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:57.020]   is a little bit, you know, distinguishable.
[00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:01.420]   You can just, by meditating upon different words,
[00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:03.260]   and you see how the word of God
[00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.500]   can be at work in your lives.
[00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:07.500]   So number three is precepts.
[00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:11.940]   Precept has the meaning of leading and overseeing.
[00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:14.140]   Overseeing.
[00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:16.060]   Are you a supervisor in your workplace?
[00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:19.140]   Or you work under a supervisor, right?
[00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:21.060]   Usually they suck, but.
[00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:24.060]   Usually, right?
[00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:24.880]   Usually they suck.
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:29.140]   But, you know, the word of God is the precept.
[00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:33.540]   It's to give us the leadership or give us the guidance,
[00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:36.460]   especially we get lost or confused.
[00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:38.500]   You go back to the word of God,
[00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:40.300]   he will give you the precepts.
[00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:43.220]   Number four is commands, right?
[00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:44.980]   Or commandments.
[00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:48.340]   Command is authoritative and clear.
[00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:51.940]   And this, especially so, I remind you many times,
[00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:54.140]   the Bible is not written to us.
[00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:57.260]   It's written to the ancient people in the Near East.
[00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:03.020]   What they used to believe in are those false gods, right?
[00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:06.660]   Babylonian gods and Assyrian gods, Egyptian gods,
[00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:09.220]   many gods, but none of them,
[00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:12.460]   none of them is clear about what they want.
[00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:14.360]   Sometimes they are like us, right?
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.100]   Because in the ancient Near East,
[00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:21.100]   in the pagan environment where ancient Israel was located,
[00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:24.940]   in their environment,
[00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:29.780]   the pagan gods are just like people.
[00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:32.580]   Because the gods, the false gods,
[00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:34.980]   are made in the image of men.
[00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:37.940]   All right?
[00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:40.140]   So you remember Genesis one.
[00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:43.460]   We are made in the image of God, right?
[00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:45.140]   But in the pagan environment,
[00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:49.520]   the gods are imagined by people, right?
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:51.440]   That's why they are like people.
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.720]   So they are unpredictable.
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:58.720]   So commandment has the meaning of God being clear
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:01.500]   about his moral view.
[00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:06.500]   His moral view is to help you live in holiness,
[00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:09.680]   righteousness, justice.
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:12.220]   Everything is spelled out in the Bible, right?
[00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:14.220]   Everything is spelled out in this word.
[00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:17.300]   God doesn't play hide and seek with us.
[00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:18.460]   So sometimes when we say,
[00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:20.500]   oh, what is the will of God in my life?
[00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.660]   Sometimes we got the question wrong.
[00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:26.380]   Of course, the will of God is clear.
[00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:31.380]   He wants you and me to live in his image,
[00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:34.620]   to live holy, right?
[00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:36.700]   To be righteous, right?
[00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:40.860]   Your relationship has to be holy.
[00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:47.120]   Your work ethics has to be holy.
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:51.260]   Somehow you can display the wisdom of God, right?
[00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:52.860]   The image of God.
[00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:54.420]   So commandment is number four.
[00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.460]   Number five is fear, right?
[00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:58.300]   The fear of the Lord.
[00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:00.660]   Now, if you're familiar with the wisdom literature
[00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:03.180]   in the Bible, which is right in the center,
[00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:06.220]   some Psalms and the book of Proverbs,
[00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:08.860]   Ecclesiastes, the book of Job,
[00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:11.600]   all of this are called wisdom literature.
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:15.780]   They often have a phrase, the fear of the Lord,
[00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:17.220]   the fear of the Lord.
[00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:19.060]   It means you have the right relationship
[00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:21.940]   with this holy God, right?
[00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:23.640]   Right relationship with him.
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:26.300]   Then you are living according to his will.
[00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:28.940]   The fear of the Lord, meaning wisdom.
[00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:33.420]   You will live in your practical situation having insights.
[00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:35.120]   And where that insight comes from?
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:38.740]   It's come from the Bible, the will of God.
[00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:42.740]   Number six is judgment.
[00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:47.060]   Now that has to do with God's judicial discernment.
[00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:50.780]   If you read the first five book of Moses,
[00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:55.480]   sometimes the five books of the law, right?
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.760]   You find some case laws.
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:01.600]   If this happen, then what is the judgment?
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:04.680]   If this happens, what should be the decision?
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:06.480]   And all those stuff.
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:11.480]   Judgment has a sense of God's wise discernment
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:14.040]   of different situations.
[00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:16.620]   So God's general will is always clear.
[00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:19.480]   To have the people of Israel in the Old Testament
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.680]   and the New Testament church like us
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:24.840]   to be walking in his way.
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:28.420]   And then this Psalm talks about the benefits,
[00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:32.200]   the effects of the will of God.
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:36.200]   Reviving the soul, making wise the symbol,
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:41.200]   giving you joy, giving you fulfillment,
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:46.240]   enduring forever, altogether righteous.
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:51.240]   So the Psalm is encouraging you to go into the will of God,
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:56.660]   to go into scripture, to find that treasure.
[00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:59.060]   It takes some work.
[00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:01.520]   It doesn't come to you automatically.
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:04.620]   You need to be trained, you need to learn, right?
[00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:08.560]   This is what every disciple needs to learn, right?
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:11.400]   From the first day you believe in Christ,
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:13.720]   from the first day you acknowledge,
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:17.000]   I come to believe and faith in Jesus Christ.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.640]   I need to learn how to interpret,
[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:24.540]   how to understand and apply the will of God, right?
[00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:30.800]   So that is what Psalm 19 trying to encourage us to do.
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:35.800]   And that's why one of the core in the Apostles' Creek,
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:40.000]   I wonder if you can notice that.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.800]   If you read through the Apostles' Creek,
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:47.840]   it gives you the very core of our belief.
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:51.180]   There are many things that can get you distracted,
[00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:57.280]   but these are the things that you always return back to.
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:01.140]   These are the things that you build your foundation upon.
[00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:04.520]   These are the most important things.
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:07.460]   That is what the Apostles' Creek is all about.
[00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:12.080]   I wonder if you read this, how many statements are there?
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.920]   12 statements, okay?
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:14.800]   12 statements.
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:18.940]   Do you notice what stand out to you?
[00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:22.320]   Now, let me tell you,
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:26.440]   what is not being said in Apostles' Creek
[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:32.080]   is how Christians behave.
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:34.720]   You don't find this statement,
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:37.880]   I believe in the good Christians.
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:43.520]   I believe in how good the church is.
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:48.600]   You don't find this statement in our Apostles' Creek, right?
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:54.840]   There's not a single mention of the Christian testimony
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:57.920]   or the examples Christians have.
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:04.260]   You don't build your faith upon people.
[00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.120]   You don't.
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:09.040]   I understand in recent years,
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:14.080]   churches, leaders, rise and fall.
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:15.940]   I understand that.
[00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:22.360]   Pastors, Christian leaders, they fail.
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:28.260]   And sometimes it shatters our faith, right?
[00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:31.180]   Because so often, we build our faith
[00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:34.860]   on broken people just like us, right?
[00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:37.840]   We do.
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:42.600]   There's a temptation to idolize institution,
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:47.600]   idolize the big institution, the big names, right?
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:54.640]   Here, the Apostles' Creek makes no mention
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.980]   how good the Christian behave, right?
[00:17:56.980 --> 00:18:02.720]   And what is being emphasized is what Jesus has done for us.
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:08.100]   Out of this 12 statements, there are five statements
[00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:12.760]   on Jesus himself, on Christ alone.
[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:15.820]   In fact, most of the statements,
[00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:20.420]   if you take it by proportion, are about Jesus.
[00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:25.420]   It really centers on the historicity of Jesus Christ,
[00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:30.280]   that he did something in human history,
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:34.680]   that Christ did something in our lives.
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:38.000]   Five out of 12 statements are on Jesus himself,
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.960]   the historical Jesus.
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:44.000]   He came to die on the cross.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.440]   He came to rise from the dead.
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:50.480]   He came to accomplish our salvation.
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:55.280]   He is our focus and he is our only foundation.
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:57.160]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:02.160]   You don't believe in the person of a Christian leader.
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:07.600]   You don't believe in any institution,
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:11.200]   any institution you can see today,
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:14.560]   or any institution or organization, churches,
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:19.080]   parachurch organizations that have come to pass.
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:20.920]   You don't believe in that.
[00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:23.240]   They all rise and be gone.
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:26.920]   What is eternal?
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:29.360]   What is most important is Jesus Christ himself.
[00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:36.160]   God speaks and he reveals himself.
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:39.000]   The Old and the New Testament are the historical record
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   of what God has done in human history.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.360]   And God is still active, doing his things.
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:52.300]   Maybe mysteriously, our eyes may not be able to pick it up.
[00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:58.100]   But God is and God will be.
[00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:01.980]   The focus is always on God himself.
[00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:07.860]   So let me remind you, if anyone or anything
[00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:13.180]   that has disappointed you in your Christian walk,
[00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:18.100]   seriously, who cares?
[00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:25.020]   What's most important is Jesus Christ and his cross
[00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:26.300]   and his empty tomb.
[00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:31.780]   Psalm 19 is telling us God is revealing himself
[00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:34.300]   in his word and the word ultimately
[00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:37.340]   is Jesus Christ himself, right?
[00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:40.980]   The word of God, ultimately, the revelation of God
[00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:43.100]   is his son, Jesus Christ.
[00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:47.500]   That's why the creek is on Jesus, centered on Jesus.
[00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:50.580]   So Psalm 19 is encouraging you,
[00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:53.980]   hey, put your faith in God and his word alone.
[00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:56.860]   It ends with a prayer.
[00:20:56.860 --> 00:21:00.260]   And I hope this is your prayer today.
[00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:01.540]   This is your response.
[00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:07.020]   The psalmist says, by them, the word of God,
[00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:11.020]   the revelation of God, right, ultimately is Jesus Christ.
[00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:13.080]   Is your servant wanted?
[00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:18.380]   In keeping your word, there is great reward.
[00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:21.140]   Who can discern his errors?
[00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:25.220]   Forgive my hidden sins, my hidden faults.
[00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:29.500]   Keep your servant also from willful sins.
[00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:31.940]   May they not rule over me.
[00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:32.900]   That's interesting.
[00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:39.220]   Then will I be blameless, innocent of great transgression.
[00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:43.980]   May the word of my mouth and the meditation of my heart
[00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:46.100]   be pleasing in your sight.
[00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:49.300]   Oh Lord, my rock and my redeemer.
[00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:53.620]   You can pick up the attitude of the psalmist
[00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:55.860]   as he ends the psalm.
[00:21:55.860 --> 00:22:02.380]   He realized his brokenness as well, right?
[00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:07.380]   He's tempted, a prone to great transgressions.
[00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:11.540]   Just like us, right?
[00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:14.980]   Look deeply into your inner life, right?
[00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:18.380]   We are all ultimately broken.
[00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:20.660]   We are all depraved.
[00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:22.660]   We are all sinners.
[00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:29.260]   I think about 400 years ago, there was a church reformer,
[00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:31.500]   what we call reformer.
[00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:34.660]   His name is Martin Luther.
[00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:38.780]   And he has something to say, really meaningful.
[00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:41.460]   He said, ask question.
[00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:48.820]   Because we're fully justified by the blood of Christ,
[00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:52.720]   by the cross, so we're 100% same.
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:58.340]   Because of the grace of God, I'm 100% same.
[00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:04.020]   Yet, I'm also 100% sinner.
[00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:10.100]   Even you come to saving faith in Jesus Christ,
[00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:15.100]   you are not from 100% sinner become 75% sinner, right?
[00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:19.420]   Doesn't take this account in our sinfulness.
[00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:21.900]   We're still 100% sinner.
[00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:25.300]   And yet, we are fully justified in Christ.
[00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:31.260]   The psalmist, how many times he described himself as servant?
[00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:34.460]   Servant.
[00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:36.420]   Two times.
[00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:39.140]   Two times in this short prayer,
[00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:45.420]   praying as a servant to the Lord, right?
[00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:51.740]   Center on the authority, right, of God.
[00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:55.980]   Not himself, humble himself before God.
[00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:59.700]   He realizes fallenness, he also realized he needed
[00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:02.540]   the instructions, the word of God.
[00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:08.460]   Now, in a sense, whenever we think of the word of God,
[00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:12.900]   whenever we think of God, we should not stand,
[00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:16.500]   and we must not stand above the word.
[00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:20.100]   We don't stand alongside with the word either.
[00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:23.220]   We stand under the word.
[00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:26.980]   When we get together to do Bible study,
[00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:30.580]   when you read the word, when you think and meditate
[00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:35.340]   on the word, you stand under, and always under,
[00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:36.260]   under scripture.
[00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:40.260]   You come before the word of God as a servant,
[00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:45.220]   ready to obey, ready to listen, ready to even wrestle
[00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:49.700]   with the meaning of what the word means for us today,
[00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:54.060]   always being teachable, always being teachable.
[00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:58.700]   Now, that does not mean we don't need to think.
[00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:01.620]   That does not mean we don't need to use our brain.
[00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:04.060]   We need to, right?
[00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:07.060]   Sometimes we have to read the word critically,
[00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:09.780]   not in the sense that we're against it.
[00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:13.420]   Critically means we're thinking it through, you know?
[00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:17.220]   We're using our intellect, God's gift to us, right,
[00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:22.220]   to reason, to struggle, to wrestle with the word, right?
[00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:28.220]   However, the ultimate position that we take
[00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:33.340]   in front of the Bible is to stand under the word of God,
[00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:36.020]   to be teachable, ready to obey.
[00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:38.260]   Let's all pray together.
[00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:42.780]   I pray that we'll come to God as servants.
[00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:47.900]   Dear God, you are the king.
[00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:50.100]   You are the leader.
[00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:53.180]   You are the Lord of all.
[00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:58.020]   And we stand under you.
[00:25:58.540 --> 00:25:59.860]   We sit under you.
[00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:03.540]   And we position ourselves as your servants.
[00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:07.140]   And we pray that as we meditate on your word,
[00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:12.140]   as we try to understand the contemporary relevance,
[00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:15.940]   how it applies to our lives today,
[00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:19.700]   we'll always stand under your authority.
[00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:24.020]   And we praise you because you speak to us.
[00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:30.180]   No mortal can speak about you
[00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:32.700]   because we are creatures.
[00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:35.220]   We are humble.
[00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:37.900]   We are actually nothing.
[00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:42.100]   Our existence depends on you.
[00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:46.980]   So we realize that we cannot speak about you.
[00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:53.740]   It's just because of your grace, you speak to us.
[00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:55.500]   You speak to us.
[00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:59.700]   You introduce yourself to us.
[00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:02.780]   And thank you for your revelation.
[00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:04.860]   Thank you for your word.
[00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:10.460]   From the time of ancient to our time modern,
[00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:12.780]   you are still speaking.
[00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:14.980]   And as you speak,
[00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:19.180]   we pray that you will speak in our lives as king,
[00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:21.660]   as the ultimate creator.
[00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:26.060]   And I pray that you will grant each and every one of us
[00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:29.300]   heart and spirit of obedience,
[00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:33.900]   the spirit of being your servant,
[00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:36.420]   ready to obey, ready to be taught.
[00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:41.220]   We pray that you will grow our church in your word,
[00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:45.660]   that we'll worship you, we'll follow and obey your will.
[00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:49.780]   And pray that in the rest of the week,
[00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:54.100]   you will send us into different situations,
[00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:58.100]   different positions, different ministries to serve you,
[00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:02.420]   to bring the impact of your gospel into our community.
[00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:04.420]   In Christ, we pray.
