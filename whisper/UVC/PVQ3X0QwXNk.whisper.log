[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.200]   Thank you very much for coming,
[00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.400]   and we're gonna worship God together,
[00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.760]   and we're gonna turn to our series,
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.320]   which is the festivals,
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.200]   the important days in the Old Testament.
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.600]   So we talk about the Sukkot, Tabernacle.
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.700]   We talk about Shabbat.
[00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.520]   Then today, we talk about another important festival
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.080]   that talks about in the Bible.
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.520]   So let's see.
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.160]   Let me start with these questions, okay?
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.320]   Now, we often know there's a relation or association
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.780]   with some festival or holidays with some food, right?
[00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.560]   When you think of some holidays or some festivals,
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.040]   you always think of some sort of food, right?
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.660]   Food items related to the festival.
[00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.200]   Thanksgiving, what do you think of?
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.200]   - Turkey.
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.240]   - Yeah, turkey, right?
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.080]   - Hot pot.
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.760]   - Hot pot, yes, hot pot, yeah.
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.300]   So when Thanksgiving comes,
[00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.880]   and you're gonna prepare some food
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.000]   that is related to the festival,
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.640]   Christmas, what do you eat?
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.560]   - Hot pot.
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.960]   - Hot pot, yes, hot pot, yeah.
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.760]   How about the New Year's?
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:13.600]   How about the New Year's?
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.440]   - Hot pot.
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.040]   (congregation laughing)
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.320]   - How about the Chinese New Year?
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.160]   - Dumplings.
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.560]   - Dumplings, yes, dumplings.
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.360]   Okay, finally, something other than hot pot.
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.480]   How about Valentine's Day?
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.520]   I asked my wife, what do we eat on Valentine's Day?
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.400]   - Steak.
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.160]   - Steak, oh, okay.
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.640]   I thought you were gonna say hot pot.
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.060]   (laughing)
[00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.740]   All right, so the food items related to the festival
[00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.300]   or the holidays of the calendar,
[00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.840]   and we think about what the Bible says about Passover,
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:51.840]   what do you think of?
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.680]   Food item.
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.480]   What food items are related to Passover?
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.720]   Yeah, unleavened bread, yeah.
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.600]   And lamb, yes, the lamb, right?
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.160]   In fact, one of those big items
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.960]   that they will prepare for Passover,
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.260]   at least for the Old Testament time,
[00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.360]   the ancient Israelites,
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.360]   they will do prepare lamb, Passover lamb, right?
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.160]   So one family will take one lamb,
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.600]   and they will consume it,
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.760]   and they will offer the rest of it to God.
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.400]   And this is right at the first Passover,
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.520]   right at the eve when they leave Egypt,
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.240]   when God is going to judge the nation,
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.120]   judge the nation of Egypt,
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.960]   to destroy Pharaoh and his empire.
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.280]   So judgment of God will come.
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.520]   And then right before it comes,
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.640]   the 10th plague, plague number 10,
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.760]   which is judging the firstborn sons
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.600]   of Egypt, right before the divine judgment
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.320]   comes to the land of Egypt,
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.800]   God said, "You're gonna prepare a meal,
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.000]   "because you're gonna go, you're gonna go in a hurry.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.180]   "You're gonna go in a hurry in the time of judgment,
[00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.960]   "and I'm gonna save you out of death and of judgment."
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.400]   So it says in Exodus chapter 12,
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.160]   "And now the whole community of Israel,
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.000]   "when they were still living in the land of bondage,
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.360]   "in the land of slavery in Egypt,
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.920]   "on the 10th day of this month,
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.680]   "each family, you would choose a lamb,
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.880]   "young goat, for a sacrifice,
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.560]   "one animal for each household."
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.320]   And this is the instruction.
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.320]   Be fully prepared, fully dressed,
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.320]   wear your sandals, carry your walking stick in your hand.
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.720]   Now, that's interesting,
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.220]   because the ancient Israelites,
[00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.640]   they go into someone's home,
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.040]   they will take off their shoes, just like us, right?
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.720]   Most of the Asians, we come to someone's house,
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.240]   or go back to your home,
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.360]   you take off your sandals, you take off your shoes.
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.880]   Here, when they eat inside the home,
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.820]   they need to put on their shoes, right?
[00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.840]   They need to get prepared,
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.900]   and dress themselves, fully dressed,
[00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.720]   so that they are ready to go.
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.280]   They are eating in a hurry, with urgency,
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.320]   because that night is gonna be the Passover of the Lord.
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.480]   Now, what does it mean?
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.480]   They would kill the lamb,
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.400]   and then they would take some blood,
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.400]   and smear on the doorpost, or the lintel of the door.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.560]   And then, when the angel of judgment
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.380]   passes through the entire land of Egypt,
[00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.160]   it will see the doorpost,
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.440]   it will smear with blood, and it will pass over,
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.260]   it will skip that house.
[00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.700]   And that is the story of salvation.
[00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.400]   In times of judgment, the angel of the Lord,
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.360]   the judgment of God, come to the land,
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.680]   and they will be safe, the Israelites will be safe.
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.040]   So it talks about blood, talks about judgment,
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.240]   talks about protection, talks about redemption.
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.040]   God's gonna save his people
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.840]   out of the land of darkness, out of the land of slavery.
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.520]   So they get prepared.
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.400]   So this is the first Passover,
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.600]   and then year after year,
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.520]   they're gonna celebrate this festival,
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.260]   which is one of the most important festivals
[00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.000]   of all other holidays,
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.960]   because it marks the most important acts of God,
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.040]   that they are being saved from slavery, from bondage,
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.000]   and they are being redeemed.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.680]   So year after year, Jews,
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:49.120]   wherever they live, in diaspora,
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.920]   in different parts of the world,
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.560]   they will go back to Jerusalem,
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.880]   go back to the temple, especially in Jesus' time.
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:00.360]   It was one of the highest holiday of the year,
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.440]   and right about the time of spring,
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.500]   March and April,
[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.560]   and they will come to Jerusalem for a week to celebrate.
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.720]   And in that week, the population of Jerusalem
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:18.720]   will skyrocket two times or three times of their population.
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.780]   And they will come around the city,
[00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.120]   and then they will go into the city,
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.080]   and they will arrange a big meal,
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.840]   which is the Passover meal, sacrificial lamb.
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.320]   They're gonna remember what God had done
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.400]   in their history, in their life.
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.160]   Now, we talk about the Passover,
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.400]   thinking of food item being the sacrificial lamb.
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.760]   But the Jews, the Israelites,
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.700]   when they think about the Passover,
[00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.640]   they think about what God had done in their lives.
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.200]   It's not just the lamb.
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.240]   They think about the whole package,
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.320]   the whole package of God's redemption.
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.960]   So let's do some review.
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.440]   When you think of the book of Exodus,
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.440]   when the Israelites came out of Egypt,
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:06.320]   what are the events follow after Passover?
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:07.800]   What are the events?
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.620]   Think about it.
[00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:10.680]   Huh?
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.520]   - Crossing the Red Sea.
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.400]   - Yeah, crossing the Red Sea.
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.500]   Crossing the Red Sea, and then after what?
[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.200]   What happened?
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.960]   Crossing the Red Sea, where did they go?
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.120]   Did they go to Chicago?
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.960]   - The wilderness.
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.480]   - The wilderness, yes.
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:28.320]   We have a Buddhist student here.
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.520]   We got all the answers.
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.560]   So after crossing the Red Sea, God split the Red Sea.
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:34.760]   There's a water miracle,
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:39.280]   and then they go into the wilderness for 40 years, right?
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.560]   And then they receive the Ten Commandments
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.080]   and all that stuff.
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.400]   And then in the wilderness,
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.720]   who is going to provide for them?
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.240]   What do they eat?
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.720]   There's nothing in the wilderness.
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:49.560]   What do they eat?
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:50.400]   - Manna.
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.840]   - They eat, yeah, they eat manna, right?
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:53.760]   Manna.
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.400]   So when they think about the Passover,
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.280]   they think about the story of Exodus,
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.040]   they don't just think about just one lamb and that's it.
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.800]   They think about a whole series of events,
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.160]   the entire process that God will bring about
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.400]   the salvation to his people from the start to the end.
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.960]   So from the start, Moses is gonna come, right?
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.360]   And lead the nation as a shepherd,
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:18.520]   and lead the entire people out of Egypt.
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.360]   Sacrificial lamb, we talk about it.
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.440]   And then for one week,
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.760]   they will celebrate with unleavened bread, right?
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.720]   Because you're in a hurry, right?
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.640]   You don't have time to wait for the yeast
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:32.200]   to take the effect, right?
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.960]   So they're gonna eat unleavened bread.
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:35.800]   And the,
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:43.880]   you know, if you have baked bread before, right?
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:47.040]   You know how many hours or how much time you have to wait
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.600]   for the yeast to take effect, right?
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.400]   The dough, you know?
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.640]   It's very time consuming.
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:57.080]   So when they are leaving Egypt in a hurry,
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.240]   God is saying to them,
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.840]   "You're gonna eat unleavened bread.
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.360]   "Don't wait, you gotta go.
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.080]   "You gotta go by my command."
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.920]   And then they go to the shore of Red Sea,
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:10.760]   and then God split the water, conquered the water,
[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:14.160]   and they go through it on dry ground,
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.240]   going to the wilderness,
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:19.320]   and the people grumble,
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.640]   complain about,
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.720]   "Hey, is God gonna provide for us what we need?"
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.560]   Right?
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.560]   And then through Moses,
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:31.560]   God sent food from heaven, manna, right?
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:33.400]   What's manna?
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:34.240]   What is it?
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.920]   Now, according to the description in the Bible,
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.200]   in the book of Exodus,
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.760]   it's something like a round stuff, you know?
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.000]   It's like a biscuit or something, right?
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.960]   Well, the point is we don't know.
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.840]   We just don't know what it is, right?
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:52.440]   In fact, the biblical story talk about the manna.
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:57.240]   The Israelite did not know what it is.
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:00.240]   So when the first time, the very first time,
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:05.240]   very first day, God sent the manna to the field,
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:10.000]   they go collect the manna,
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   what did they say?
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   They say, "Ma set, ma set."
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.480]   Ma set is in Hebrew.
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.080]   It means what it is.
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.120]   Ma is what.
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.480]   Set is this.
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:21.840]   And what the heck is this?
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:26.240]   So that's why you got the name manna, right?
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.360]   Ma set, manna, manna, all right?
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:34.360]   So the most important point is we just don't know what it is.
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:37.440]   But when they grumble, when they complain about it,
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:40.720]   God gives them food, rain from heaven,
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.520]   raining down from heaven, manna from heaven.
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:47.480]   And then as the story goes from the Old Testament,
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.600]   you know, go back all the way to Exodus
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.320]   and all the way down to the kingdoms
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.160]   and all the way down to the time of Jesus.
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:56.280]   And then the Jews, the ancient Israelites,
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:59.240]   will think about and remember Passover
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:01.440]   and adding a lot of stories to it.
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:04.600]   And one of the interesting stories they add
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:08.040]   around the time of Jesus is that they,
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:10.920]   because according to the story of the Old Testament,
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.280]   when they went through the wilderness for 40 years,
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:16.360]   God gave them manna day after day, right?
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:19.640]   And then right after they crossed the River Jordan,
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.480]   they entered into the promised land.
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:26.560]   In the book of Joshua, it says, there's no more manna.
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:29.180]   It stopped raining from heaven, no more manna,
[00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:31.980]   because they're gonna eat the produce
[00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:33.720]   from the land of Canaan.
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:37.680]   So some of the Jews around the time of Jesus,
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:42.680]   they would say, you know, because the manna stopped,
[00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:49.080]   because there was a bank, there was a treasury in heaven,
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:52.160]   raining down manna to all of them.
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:56.700]   And when they entered the land of Canaan,
[00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:01.200]   the bank is closed, the treasury, the storage is closed.
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.120]   And who closed it?
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:05.480]   Who has the power to close it?
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:06.320]   Moses.
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.840]   Moses has the key.
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:13.840]   So he opened the treasury for 40 years,
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:19.000]   raining down manna to the people of Israel in the wilderness
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.160]   for 40 years.
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.660]   After they entered Canaan, Moses closed it.
[00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:25.620]   So they eat the produce of the land.
[00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.400]   So when the Jews thinking about the story,
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:32.040]   they have the legend, they have a legendary telling
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:37.040]   that someday in the future, when God's salvation
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:41.240]   is gonna be fulfilled ultimately,
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:44.920]   then Moses will come again and open that bank.
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.120]   It's like an ATM, open it again,
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:53.000]   and manna will come from heaven again.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.920]   Now you think about the whole story,
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:59.840]   you can tie different things together,
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:03.600]   and you can think of some of the description
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:06.520]   that the gospel talks about Jesus.
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:10.040]   Talk about Passover, talk about what Jesus
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:14.880]   will ultimately do to fulfill the salvation.
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:17.720]   Now let's take a look.
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:21.080]   The gospel of John, John chapter six.
[00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:25.240]   Now remember what I said about what we thought about
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.640]   the entire Passover, the entire Exodus story,
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.040]   the entire package, the manna and all that stuff.
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:32.640]   Read the story, you will read it in new light.
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:35.680]   The gospel of John chapter six.
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:40.480]   It was nearly the time for the Jewish Passover celebration.
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:44.720]   And Jesus saw a big crowd of people
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.040]   coming to look for him.
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:51.680]   And then he said to Philip, one of his 12 disciples,
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:54.960]   "Where can we buy food for them?
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:58.480]   "How do we feed these people?"
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.200]   There's so many of them.
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.560]   So you know how the story goes,
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.280]   it's the five loaves and two fish.
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.920]   Five loaves and two fish.
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:10.920]   It's one of the most well-known Jesus miracles of all.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.840]   Because all four gospel, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John,
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:18.520]   talk about this story, five loaves and two fish.
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:20.320]   We think about this little story,
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:22.640]   five loaves and two fish, it's a very nice story,
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:25.100]   it's a very nice children's story, kid's story.
[00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:28.920]   I'm sure they all heard of it in our Sunday school.
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:32.160]   And we think about the provision of God,
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.960]   God provides and Jesus provides.
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:39.800]   But here, there's something very interesting.
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:44.640]   Sixth four, John at the statement,
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:49.440]   Matthew, Mark and Luke did not record the story
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:50.560]   the same way.
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:55.000]   John, at one special statement,
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.680]   it was the time of Passover.
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:59.720]   It was the time of Passover that the five loaves
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.400]   and two fish story happened.
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:05.220]   Now in the gospel of John, all the great deeds,
[00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:08.660]   all the great acts of Jesus are signs.
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:12.920]   John called them signs.
[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:13.920]   Now what is a sign?
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.120]   What is a sign?
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:19.160]   When you're driving on highway, for example,
[00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:22.040]   you drive on the highway and on the right side,
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:25.560]   you see a sign, Chicago, 21 miles.
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:29.320]   The sign is not Chicago.
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:32.920]   So you don't hit the sign.
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:36.920]   The sign is pointing you to the reality in the future.
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:41.520]   The sign is pointing you to something else
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:43.920]   because signs is always pointing beyond itself.
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:48.920]   So all the great acts of Jesus are actually signs
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:52.200]   and telling you there was some deeper meaning to it.
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:55.240]   There was some reality the sign is pointing to.
[00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:58.000]   You go to a restaurant, you pick up a menu,
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.640]   you see picture of fish.
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:02.960]   You don't eat the menu.
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:06.340]   You see the menu is the sign.
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:09.640]   The menu is the sign for the reality.
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.240]   You eat the fish that is cooked by the restaurant.
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:15.960]   The reality comes to your table and then you partake it.
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:18.600]   You take it, you take it in.
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:19.880]   Menu is set aside.
[00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:23.040]   Now this is what John is doing.
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:26.120]   John is recording this story in a special way
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:28.520]   to tell you what it means.
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:32.960]   So if you look at the entire chapter six of the gospel of
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:35.200]   John, it's a very long chapter.
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:38.080]   We're not going to study it verse by verse.
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.880]   But I'll give you the outline here.
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:42.760]   This is John six.
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:44.880]   There are a few things that you need to understand.
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.960]   There were a couple of stories.
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:51.200]   And then there were a bunch of things that recorded
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:54.680]   about the dialogues or the debate between the Jews
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:57.520]   and Jesus and then finally his disciples.
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:00.400]   Now what kind of stories are being recorded here?
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.960]   Of course the five loaves and two fish, right?
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.920]   Jesus feeds 5,000 people.
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.520]   Nice story.
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:11.840]   But following this story,
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:16.680]   John recorded that Jesus calms the sea of Galilee.
[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:18.480]   There was a storm story.
[00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:21.080]   Now why put it in such a way, you know, back,
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:23.680]   front and back, you know, together?
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:26.040]   Remember Exodus.
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:30.280]   Remember the Passover, the whole package.
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:33.560]   What kind of miracles are being recorded?
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:36.160]   The Red Sea miracle.
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:38.200]   God controlled the sea.
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:42.040]   God conquered the sea so that his people are safe.
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:42.880]   What a miracle.
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:45.920]   And then feeding the 5,000,
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.640]   feeding the people in wilderness.
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:50.960]   The Exodus story is all about, you know,
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:53.080]   raining down manna.
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:56.160]   God is going to provide for them in the wilderness.
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:59.320]   Even they complain about it, even they grumble about it.
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:03.080]   For 40 years, God is going to give them breath from heaven.
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:07.160]   So John's putting different things together.
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:11.680]   It's like a TV show producer, you know,
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:14.280]   orchestrate everything, different stories,
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:18.080]   pack it together so that you know who Jesus really is
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:20.240]   and what Jesus has done for you.
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:24.200]   The food miracle.
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.080]   And then the water miracle.
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:30.080]   So Jesus is doing something that the Jews,
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.960]   when they heard about this story,
[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:34.440]   they understand what it means.
[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:38.080]   There are different things here, feeding 5,000,
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:41.040]   the water miracle, people grumbling.
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:46.000]   Now, you can see part three, four, and five
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.800]   are all about talking.
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:50.680]   There's so much talking.
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:55.120]   You know, first time I confess, I read John 6.
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:57.800]   I just don't know what the heck are you talking about?
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:01.040]   They ask Jesus some questions,
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:02.760]   they debate about the meaning,
[00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:05.360]   and then Jesus taught them different things.
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:09.600]   You know, but the entire John 6
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.600]   is all about in the wilderness
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:14.280]   when people are grumbling, complaining.
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:17.760]   In fact, some of the Jews heard about what Jesus said,
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:19.040]   they left.
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.840]   Originally, they were disciples.
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:23.280]   They follow Jesus, but when they heard about
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:26.320]   some of the teachings of Jesus in chapter six of John,
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:28.840]   they didn't understand and they were confused.
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:31.800]   That's why at the end of the story, they left.
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:34.000]   They complained and then they left.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.160]   Then toward the end, Jesus round up the whole thing
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:39.080]   and asked the 12 disciples, "Are you gonna leave too?"
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:43.200]   Remember one of the disciples, Simon Peter?
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:46.960]   He said, "You have the eternal word of God.
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:49.960]   "Who shall we follow?
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:51.240]   "Who else shall we follow?
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:53.520]   "We're gonna follow you."
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:57.040]   Now, let's take a look at some of the verses
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:02.960]   and see what the story means about Jesus.
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.280]   627.
[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:09.800]   Now, when they're talking about the food,
[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:14.680]   remember the first story, Jesus fed 5,000.
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:16.360]   Some of the people are following,
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:17.840]   big crowd are following him.
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:21.720]   Try to use your imagination.
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:24.720]   If you're one of those who experienced
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:26.480]   the feeding of 5,000,
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:28.440]   what would be your immediate response?
[00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:32.640]   If you go to a restaurant with your friend
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:35.400]   and your friend pay for your dinner,
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:39.000]   he said, "It's gonna be free.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.200]   "I'm gonna pay for you."
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:43.240]   What would be your immediate response?
[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:46.720]   Wow, okay, wow.
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:49.120]   The next day, what would be your immediate response?
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:49.960]   You're gonna call your friend,
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:52.040]   "Hey, let's go out for dinner again."
[00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:52.920]   Yeah, right?
[00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:55.520]   'Cause every meal, you're gonna pay for it, right?
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:57.680]   So this is how the people react.
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:58.720]   So they were looking for Jesus
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:01.240]   after the 5,000 feeding miracle.
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:02.080]   They were looking for Jesus,
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:04.320]   just disappear and on the other side of the sea.
[00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:07.640]   So they ride on the boat and then they come to Jesus
[00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:10.240]   and say, "Hey, can you give me more?
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.480]   "Can you give me more?
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.120]   "'Cause you just gave me one day of the daily bread.
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:15.880]   "Okay, that's good, all right?
[00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:17.280]   "How about tomorrow's dinner?
[00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:20.360]   "Or the dinner's after tomorrow, right?"
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:22.440]   So Jesus was telling them,
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.560]   "Do not be so concerned
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:29.120]   "about perishable things like food.
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:33.320]   "Spend your energy seeking the eternal life
[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:36.120]   "the Son of Man can give you."
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:37.080]   Perishable food.
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:42.800]   Don't be so concerned about things that perish.
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.880]   Now think about the Exodus story.
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:47.840]   When man came, the first week,
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:51.400]   some of the ancient Israelites, as the story goes,
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:53.480]   they collect more than they need.
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:57.400]   And they put it back into their tent in their home.
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.240]   And then the next day, it mowed.
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:01.120]   It mowed.
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:04.480]   They didn't trust God.
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.560]   They didn't trust God enough for daily bread.
[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:09.320]   So they collect maybe two days, three days, right?
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:12.400]   Just like going out with your generous friend,
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:14.080]   you're gonna order more.
[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:18.560]   And then as we talk, you're gonna put it in your to-go box.
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:21.840]   But it mowed and it rot.
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:23.920]   Perishable things.
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:26.480]   Jesus said, "Don't be so concerned."
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.840]   Yes, you need to plan, you need to be responsible,
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:29.880]   you need to work.
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:34.760]   However, don't be so concerned about perishable things.
[00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:38.000]   Aren't we all do that?
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.200]   Aren't we all like that?
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:45.040]   We're too concerned about things that will perish, right?
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:50.480]   You're gonna store up your money, store up your food,
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:51.720]   because we worry, right?
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:55.880]   Many of us, Chinese heritage,
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:23:00.720]   food is so important to us, right?
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:03.360]   Food is too important for us.
[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:05.720]   Jesus says something is more important.
[00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:08.240]   Seek the life, seek the food
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:11.680]   that the Son of Man can give to us.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.840]   34, the crowd said to Jesus,
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:20.960]   "Sir, give us that bread."
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:22.640]   How about every day, all right?
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:24.520]   Pay for our dinner every day, all right?
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:26.120]   So we don't have to work for it.
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:30.080]   Thinking about Moses, opening the treasury.
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:32.360]   Hey, can you be that Moses?
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:34.800]   Can you just be that Moses,
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:38.560]   and every day we're gonna have bread on the field,
[00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:40.080]   we don't have to work for it.
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:42.040]   And Jesus said, "Don't be so concerned about it,
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:46.040]   "because I'm gonna give you food that will last,
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.960]   "that will not perish."
[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:52.840]   35, Jesus replied, "I am the bread of life.
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:55.880]   "Whoever comes to me will never be hungry again.
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:24:00.160]   "Whoever believes me will never be thirsty."
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:05.120]   Jesus is saying, "I'm not just giving you food."
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:07.720]   He said, "I am the food."
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:11.080]   That's kind of astonishing, right?
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.640]   When you have dinner with your friend,
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:16.280]   your generous friend,
[00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:20.120]   your generous friend, all of a sudden, if he say to you,
[00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:25.520]   "I am not the dish in front of you, I am the dish."
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:27.200]   You say, "This guy's nuts."
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:32.560]   Give you a plate of fish, I give you fish,
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:34.560]   however, I am the fish, man.
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:37.480]   What are you gonna say?
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:41.480]   You say, "Jesus, what are you talking about?"
[00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:44.240]   In fact, that's what the people react.
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.960]   They say, "That's crazy."
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:53.200]   Now, of course, the language is metaphor, right?
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:56.000]   When Jesus said, "I am the bread of life,
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.200]   "you believe in me, you will be safe,
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:00.440]   "you have eternal life."
[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:06.520]   It's metaphor, because we eat bread and we drink water.
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:11.600]   We don't believe in bread, we don't believe in water.
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:13.800]   It's metaphorical.
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:17.640]   The bread is Jesus himself, right?
[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:22.040]   As the story goes, 51, he said, "I am the bread of life."
[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:23.880]   Jesus said, "I am the bread of life
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:28.120]   "who came down from heaven, from the treasury of heaven.
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:30.600]   "I'm not just the one, I'm not like Moses
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:35.000]   "with the key open the depository in heaven,
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.800]   "treasure in heaven to rain down food for you.
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:40.560]   "I am the food, I'm the living bread,
[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:44.000]   "came down from heaven, anyone who eats this bread
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.640]   "will live forever."
[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:46.840]   Now, what is this bread?
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:48.960]   My flesh.
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:53.440]   We cannot take a bite of your arm or something.
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:56.840]   It's a metaphor.
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:00.520]   Now, people in the ancient days,
[00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:03.640]   especially in the agricultural world,
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:06.040]   where you have to farm and you have to harvest,
[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:07.360]   you get your food.
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:10.000]   People understand almost everything they eat
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   is something that has died, right?
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.160]   You think about it, even today,
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:23.160]   when you go to a fast food restaurant,
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:24.600]   you get a hamburger,
[00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:30.920]   you eat something that has died, right?
[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:35.400]   What has died in order to serve you the hamburger?
[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:40.960]   Wheat and barley made into flour,
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:43.440]   and flour baked into bread, right?
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:49.840]   The lettuce, tomato, pickles, the plants,
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:52.200]   somehow they die being harvested.
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:58.360]   Serve within the hamburger, the patty.
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:06.800]   The animal die so that you can protect the flesh,
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:10.160]   and you get the hamburger, right?
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:13.640]   Unless you're eating a hamburger totally engineered,
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:18.520]   you know, genetically, you know, like a McDonald, right?
[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:19.920]   Even the flies gonna eat it.
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:25.160]   Everything that we eat entails some death.
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:30.480]   Something has died in order to serve us food
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:35.480]   to keep us going, and people understood it.
[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:39.720]   If we continue to live, other living things need to die.
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:42.400]   If those things don't die, what will happen?
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:44.400]   You die.
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:48.280]   You gotta have something else die for you
[00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:49.680]   so that you can live, right?
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:52.840]   Jesus is using this metaphor.
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:54.680]   He said, "I am the Passover lamb.
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:57.440]   "I am the manna.
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:59.240]   "I am the water.
[00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:02.920]   "I die so that you can live."
[00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:09.600]   Our daily bread needs, you know, daily things to die.
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:15.920]   Eternal bread give us eternal life.
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:20.400]   It's not just daily life, eternal life.
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:22.320]   Jesus is the Passover.
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:24.360]   He died so that we can have life,
[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:30.080]   and that's why almost all the songs that we sing in worship
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:33.680]   have to do with the death of Jesus,
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:39.520]   His sacrifice, His sacrificial act, the Passover.
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:44.000]   He sacrificed Himself so that we can live.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.760]   He died on the cross, and He shed His blood
[00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:49.840]   so that we can live, we can have eternal life.
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:54.000]   Well, we're going to observe the communion today.
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:58.240]   I want you to understand all the things
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:00.760]   that we talk about about the Passover
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:06.880]   are signs pointing to the reality.
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:11.480]   The Son of God died on the cross because He loves you.
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:16.400]   He loves me so that we can be redeemed.
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:17.800]   We can live forever.
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:23.640]   As we take the cup and the bread, the communion,
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:28.080]   there are also signs pointing to the reality.
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:33.120]   If we partake it, if we take the bread,
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:36.080]   that means we're receiving Jesus, we believe in Jesus.
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:39.440]   We're going to have eternal life.
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:44.440]   That's going to change the whole world for you.
[00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:48.680]   Whatever we work for, wherever we are,
[00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:53.360]   we're going to change because our identity change.
[00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:57.280]   We are the sons and daughters of God.
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:58.960]   We belong to the kingdom.
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:01.520]   We belong to that big story,
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:03.000]   you know, from creation to redemption
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.280]   to all the way to new heaven and new earth.
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:07.000]   We are just a little story.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.840]   Be part of that big story.
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:14.360]   Partake Jesus, and we're going to enjoy
[00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:17.680]   the eternal relationship with our Father.
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:20.520]   Let us all pray together and prepare ourselves
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:23.200]   as we take the communion.
[00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:24.720]   All right.
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:29.720]   Father, we thank you for the death of your Son,
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:35.480]   for His sacrifice, for what He has done on the cross.
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:40.360]   Yes, because of His sacrifice,
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:42.000]   because of the Passover lamb,
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.720]   that we have the eternal life.
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:48.120]   And let us hear your word again.
[00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:51.560]   I am the bread of life.
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:57.120]   We will not go hungry eternally because we partake in you,
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:59.760]   because we believe in you.
[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:02.400]   And thank you for your sacrifice.
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:05.880]   Thank you for your grace that we can become your children.
[00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:11.120]   As we take the bread and take the cup,
[00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:13.880]   remind us our relationship with you.
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:18.800]   Remind us your so great of a salvation,
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:20.600]   the eternal life that we have.
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:24.640]   And help us orient ourselves toward you
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:28.640]   so that we are not too concerned about our daily bread,
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:33.240]   but we are more concerned about your kingdom,
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:35.000]   our relationship with you.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.160]   In Christ's name, pray.
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:40.680]   All right, if you're ready, you can go back, I guess, right?
