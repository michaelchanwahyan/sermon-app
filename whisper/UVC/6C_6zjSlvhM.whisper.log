[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.560]   Good morning, UV.
[00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.400]   It's good to be with you all again today
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.360]   and just opening up the word of God.
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.640]   Okay, cool.
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.280]   All right, so compared to the generations
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.520]   that come before us, I would say that we live
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.920]   in a world of extreme convenience, right?
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.060]   What do I mean by that, a world of extreme convenience?
[00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.000]   Well, if you have a question about something
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.920]   or you need information about a specific topic,
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.480]   you don't have to go through the hassle
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.560]   of figuring it out on your own right now.
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.200]   You can just pull out your phone, put out your computer,
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.280]   and just type the questions in Google or chat GPT now,
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.960]   and you can probably get your answers instantly as well.
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.000]   Or if you wake up in the morning and find out that,
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.840]   oh, I'm actually running out of my coffee beans,
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.800]   you can just put an order in Amazon
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.240]   and have it delivered overnight
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.400]   and sometimes even on the same day as well, right?
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.440]   So not only are we able to have a lot of information
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.380]   on our fingertips or get the things that we want
[00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.880]   as quickly as possible now,
[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.060]   but we can also get the things that we want
[00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.080]   any time of the day now.
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.000]   So as I was preparing for my sermon this week,
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.760]   I was curious about where this phrase 24/7 comes from.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.960]   And as a perfect example of living
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.240]   in this world of extreme convenience,
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.200]   obviously I did some quick research on Google.
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.360]   And guess what?
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.920]   This phrase actually originated in the United States
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.060]   in the late 20th century,
[00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.500]   originally in the world of sports.
[00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.920]   But since then, we see an increasing amount of businesses
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.760]   that is modeled after this idea of 24 hours a day,
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.360]   seven days a week, like 7-Eleven.
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.480]   Fast food restaurants like McDonald's
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.400]   or ride share business like Uber or Lyft.
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.480]   Or customer service hotlines,
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.080]   online businesses, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.000]   However, way before this idea of 24/7 gains popularity
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.480]   and became the norm of our society,
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.640]   there's actually a group of Christians called the Moravian
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.660]   who started a 24/7 prayer watch,
[00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.660]   not just for a day or a week or a month
[00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.040]   or a year or a decade.
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.600]   But on August 27, 1727,
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.520]   this group of 24 men and 24 women
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.040]   from this Moravian community of Hernhut in Saxony, Germany,
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.600]   they committed to pray in hourly shifts,
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.260]   covering each and every hours of the day continuously.
[00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.380]   And this around-the-clock prayer change
[00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.460]   actually lasted for more than 100 years,
[00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.220]   sparking a revival within this community
[00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.660]   and transforming this tiny village of Hernhut
[00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.140]   into one of the most important hubs
[00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.540]   for Protestant global mission movement in the 18th century.
[00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.020]   And they also laid the foundation
[00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.580]   for our current modern mission movement as well.
[00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.740]   So if you were at my previous sermon here,
[00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.340]   you might remember this question that I asked all of us.
[00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.620]   How is your relationship with the Lord
[00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.580]   when it comes to your prayer life?
[00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.520]   Of course, I know the history
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.940]   of the Moravian prayer movement is a unique case,
[00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.700]   and we have never seen anything like that since then
[00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.200]   in our church history.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.420]   However, like the prayers of the Moravians,
[00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.140]   which turned this community initially marked by conflict
[00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.300]   and division into a place of revival
[00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.740]   and a place for global missions,
[00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.780]   our prayer is also the field behind everything that we do
[00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.060]   in our personal walk with Jesus,
[00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.900]   as well as the things that we do for God's kingdom
[00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.440]   as followers of God.
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.380]   So personally, I am grateful to the people
[00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.580]   who have taught me and show me how to pray.
[00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.700]   Of course, there's my parents
[00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.020]   who taught me how to pray as a kid,
[00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.860]   and also my mom who continuously to show me
[00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.640]   what a faithful prayer life looks like right now.
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.460]   And there's also one of my pastor, Pastor Rafe,
[00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.900]   who modeled for me what it means
[00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.780]   to sit before the Lord in silence.
[00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.880]   We used to meet early in the morning in his office,
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.200]   and I'm usually the first thing in his work calendar.
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.200]   So before we talk about anything,
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.220]   he would just kneel down on the floor in his office
[00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.060]   and spend about five to 10 minutes just to listen,
[00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.500]   listen before the Lord, sitting still before the Lord.
[00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.300]   And every time he would invite me to join him as well
[00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.700]   in his silent prayers.
[00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.140]   I'm also thankful for my friend, Hailey,
[00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.260]   who always reminds me to turn to God first things first.
[00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.660]   A couple years ago, I was in the seasons of waiting
[00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.820]   and just a lot of uncertainties.
[00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.880]   And one time as I was catching up with her over a run
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.660]   and share about some of these things that I'm worried about,
[00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:09.780]   she just turned to me and say,
[00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.540]   "Hey, why don't we just pray right now?"
[00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:13.940]   So she ended up praying over me
[00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.020]   while we were running around in the park.
[00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.020]   And I'm also thankful for all the different community,
[00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.660]   the groups, my small groups,
[00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.740]   that I got to be a part of in the past.
[00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.560]   These people have shown me what it looks like
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.120]   to labor in prayers for one another,
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:36.060]   to celebrate together when our prayers are being answered,
[00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.180]   and to wrestle with the Lord
[00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.180]   when our prayers are not being answered.
[00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.540]   And sometimes to just sit in the unknown
[00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.420]   while waiting for God to respond to our prayer requests.
[00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:50.420]   So personally, I'm in debt to these people
[00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:51.800]   who have modeled for me
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.460]   what a vibrant prayer life looks like.
[00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.420]   But today we have the opportunity to learn
[00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:02.340]   how to pray from the master himself, Jesus.
[00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:03.740]   In some ways, our passage today
[00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.380]   is a glimpse into Jesus's own prayer life.
[00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.820]   All throughout Jesus's ministry,
[00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:12.140]   we always see that he would retreat to some quiet places
[00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.300]   to pray alone, but we don't have much information
[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.000]   about the actual content of his prayer.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.940]   So our passage today is sort of like
[00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:21.760]   a going behind the scenes
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.200]   and taking a peek into Jesus's own prayer life
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.920]   and how he communes with God the Father.
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.260]   So to better situate our passage today
[00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.860]   within the larger context of the Sermon on the Mount,
[00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.140]   this model prayer that Jesus taught his disciple
[00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.820]   comes right after he tells them how not to pray.
[00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:46.340]   So first, Jesus tells them not to pray like the hypocrites
[00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:48.700]   who love praying standing in the synagogues
[00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.860]   or on the street corner
[00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.780]   in order to be seen by other people.
[00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.540]   So Jesus warns again this kind of self-gratifying prayer,
[00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:59.500]   first and foremost.
[00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:03.900]   And second, Jesus teaches them not to pray like the pagan
[00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.660]   who just keep on babbling with words
[00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:09.260]   with the hope that one of the small letter,
[00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.540]   quote unquote, "gods" will share their prayer.
[00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:16.240]   So Jesus also warns again this kind of superstitious prayer.
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:20.300]   And coming right after these two negative examples
[00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:23.220]   of how not to pray in a self-gratifying
[00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.560]   and also in a superstitious way,
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:29.220]   Jesus continues in Matthew 6, verse 9.
[00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:33.020]   "This then is how you should pray."
[00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:36.700]   So let's look at this model prayer from Jesus together.
[00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:40.300]   And I'm sure a lot of you have probably memorized this
[00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:41.440]   before as a kid.
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.460]   So I want all of us to read this together
[00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.020]   as a church this morning.
[00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:47.480]   Can we do that?
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.900]   I have it on the screen as well.
[00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.060]   So let's begin.
[00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:54.020]   "This then is how you should pray.
[00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:56.000]   "Our Father in heaven,
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.920]   "hallowed be your name.
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.320]   "Your kingdom come,
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:03.920]   "your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.480]   "Give us today our daily bread
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.620]   "and forgive us our debts
[00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:12.340]   "as we also have forgiven our debtors.
[00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:15.320]   "And lead us not into temptation,
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.040]   "but deliver us from the evil."
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:23.960]   Okay, so notice how Jesus begins his prayer.
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.460]   "Our Father."
[00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:28.300]   He begins with these two words.
[00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.760]   So in contrast to the self-gratifying prayer
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:34.640]   of the hypocrites, which begins and ends
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.440]   with themself in mind,
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:39.520]   these prayers actually begins with God.
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.920]   And there's so much more theology
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:44.220]   that is just associated with these two words.
[00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:46.500]   "Our Father."
[00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.800]   However, I want to take some time
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.080]   just to highlight a few for us today.
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:56.520]   So Father is obviously a familial language, right?
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.120]   So what Jesus is teaching here
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.920]   is that the God of the universe,
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.960]   the creator of all things,
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.960]   the author of life,
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:07.660]   he is not just a father,
[00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:10.220]   but he is our father.
[00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:15.860]   This means that when we come before God in our prayer,
[00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:20.080]   this relationship is not just between a God and his people,
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.200]   but this relationship is between a father
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.960]   and his beloved children.
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:28.560]   Of course, I want to acknowledge
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.560]   that when it comes to our relationship
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.960]   with our earthly father,
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.320]   we all have different kind of experience, right?
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:38.160]   Some are good, some are bad,
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.160]   some might just be indifferent.
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.480]   And a lot of time,
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.120]   our experience with our earthly fathers
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:49.040]   will inevitably affect how we view our heavenly father.
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:52.880]   However, the good news that we know from the Bible
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:56.520]   is that if we read the Bible from cover to cover,
[00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.840]   we consistently see the loving
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.680]   and compassionate character of our father
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.520]   on full display throughout these pages,
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.200]   with the ultimate examples
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:09.500]   being God sending his own son into the world
[00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.460]   to die for a group of people who don't really deserve it.
[00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:17.360]   So regardless of how your relationship
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.840]   with your earthly father is or was,
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:22.600]   don't let that become a deterrent for you
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:25.380]   to come before your heavenly father in prayer.
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.360]   And when we begin our prayer with these words,
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.920]   our father in heaven,
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:35.960]   we pray knowing who God is, our father,
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:39.080]   and who we are in relationship to him,
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.560]   his beloved children.
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.920]   To put it another way,
[00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.480]   when we knock on heaven's door with our prayer,
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:50.480]   we hold our ID as co-heirs with Jesus himself.
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:54.200]   And every heavenly inheritance that is available to Jesus,
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.920]   we get to have a part of it as well.
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:59.860]   So our father in heaven.
[00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:03.200]   So after knowing who God is
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.800]   and who we are in relationship to him,
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:09.840]   we can bring our request and our petition before the Lord.
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:13.040]   So the next line, "Hallowed be your name."
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.880]   Hallowed, obviously, is an old English word, right?
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:18.880]   I don't think any one of us would use this word
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.440]   in our day to day anymore.
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:23.680]   But what it means is simply just to make holy
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.840]   or to set apart.
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.800]   So this is the first petition in the Lord's prayer,
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:33.640]   and it begins with worship and adoration towards God.
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:36.280]   May your name be kept holy.
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:39.020]   In other words, it is a God-oriented petition.
[00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:43.160]   How often in our prayer do we jump straight
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.680]   into lifting not the name of God,
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:49.080]   but other names and idols,
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:54.080]   such as success, wealth, comfort, security, or approval?
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:59.160]   However, right here,
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.060]   Jesus shows us a very different way to pray,
[00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:04.280]   one that begins with worship.
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:07.600]   Hallowed be your name, or may your name be kept holy.
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:11.080]   There are two implied subjects in this petition,
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:13.000]   the first one being us.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   May your name be kept holy and sacred by us as his people.
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:21.040]   So holiness is at the core of who God is,
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:23.960]   and as Jesus' disciple,
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.760]   his holiness should also be visible
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.720]   and evident in our day to day life.
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:32.860]   And the second implied subject here is God himself,
[00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:35.160]   that God himself will make the holiness
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.240]   that comes along with his name
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:40.060]   to be manifested throughout the entire world.
[00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:42.840]   And so when we pray,
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.460]   remember that hallowed be your name
[00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:49.060]   is an invitation for us to reorient the affections
[00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.900]   of our hearts towards God.
[00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:56.900]   And everything that comes in the Lord's prayer after this
[00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:00.100]   is an overflow of this kind of heart posture
[00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:04.960]   before the Lord, one of worship, one of adoration.
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.100]   So let's continue.
[00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.780]   May your kingdom come.
[00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:12.580]   So after we lift up our adoration towards God,
[00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:16.220]   we find this second God-oriented petition.
[00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:17.740]   May your kingdom come.
[00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:21.180]   This second petition calls for the fullness
[00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:22.940]   of God's kingdom to come,
[00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:25.000]   and it highlights the already,
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.200]   but not yet aspects of God's kingdom.
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:31.260]   Put it another way, this kingdom of heaven
[00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.620]   has already begun in the first coming of Jesus,
[00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:36.460]   hence the already part.
[00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:38.440]   But we can only experience the fullness
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:40.060]   of this heavenly kingdom
[00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.860]   when Jesus comes again in the future,
[00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:44.540]   hence the not yet part of it.
[00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:47.300]   And then Jesus continues.
[00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:49.820]   Your kingdom come, your will be done
[00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:52.480]   on earth as it is in heaven.
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:56.200]   So what is God's will?
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:02.500]   God's will is his divine purpose for each of his people
[00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:04.940]   and also for the rest of the world.
[00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:07.980]   And so this third petition, your will be done,
[00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:09.940]   calls for the fullness of God's will
[00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:13.460]   that is currently only present in the heaven
[00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:16.160]   to be fully manifested on earth as well.
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.220]   So a couple of years ago,
[00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:21.820]   I was in the seasons of waiting and uncertainties, right?
[00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:25.440]   And the Lord Prayers became one of my go-to prayer.
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:27.380]   But every time I came to this line,
[00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:30.580]   specifically, your will be done,
[00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:32.900]   my entire body would just tense up
[00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:34.480]   because I understand what it means
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.340]   to truly pray these words.
[00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:40.700]   If I pray for God's will to be done,
[00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:43.320]   what that means is that I would have to give up
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:47.980]   my own preference, my own plan, and also my own kingdom.
[00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:54.260]   However, if we truly want to see heaven meets earth,
[00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.820]   a posture of surrender is required
[00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:00.480]   in order for God's will to be done in our life,
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:05.260]   in our community, in our city, in our church,
[00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.100]   and also in the rest of the world.
[00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:12.580]   So prayer is the place where the heavenly realities
[00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:14.760]   began to invade on our earth.
[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:20.300]   In prayer, we call upon the peace and justice of God
[00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:23.000]   to push back against the darkness of our world.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:29.200]   In prayer, we reach for the heavenly resource
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.940]   and distribute them to places in our world
[00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:35.000]   that is being destroyed by sin and brokenness.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   So, on earth as it is in heaven is an intercessory prayer.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.920]   When we pray for his kingdom to come
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:50.880]   and for his will to be done on earth as it is in heaven,
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:53.720]   we are asking God himself to intercede
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.920]   in the realities of our broken world
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:57.600]   with his kingdom realities.
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:01.400]   So I love how this author put it.
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:03.840]   When we engage in intercessory prayer,
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:08.840]   we are loving others on the basis of heaven's resource.
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:12.300]   So, when we pray for the sick,
[00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:15.180]   we are reaching for God's divine power to heal.
[00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:19.260]   When we pray for wars and conflicts
[00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.760]   throughout our world right now,
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:24.540]   we are reaching for God's heavenly peace.
[00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:29.020]   And when we pray for the non-believers in our lives,
[00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:32.940]   we are reaching for the power of gospel to transform life.
[00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:37.660]   So, prayer is where heavens meets earth.
[00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:40.580]   And in the Lord's prayer, this line on earth
[00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:43.940]   as it is in prayer also functions as a link
[00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:45.540]   between the reality of God
[00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:47.540]   and also the reality of our world.
[00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:52.340]   If you pay attention, these first three petitions
[00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:55.500]   is all about God, right?
[00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:59.260]   Your name, your kingdom, and your will.
[00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:05.540]   And so remember, first, prayer begins with God and not us.
[00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:09.300]   It is only when we are able to give God the honor
[00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:11.660]   and the glory that is due to his name
[00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:16.380]   and also align our priorities in accordance to his will
[00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:18.980]   that we are able to know the right thing to ask for
[00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:20.700]   in our prayer.
[00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:22.900]   So heaven is the source of all power
[00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:25.100]   and earth is the place where this power
[00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:26.420]   is being made visible.
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:31.920]   So the following three petitions will finally be about us.
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:35.920]   Give us today our daily bread.
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:39.800]   So this is the first we or us-oriented petition
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.560]   and it is a prayer of dependence on God
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:44.500]   for our daily sustenance.
[00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:47.920]   For most of us, this daily bread prayer
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:50.040]   is probably something that we don't quite pray
[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:51.600]   as often nowadays, right?
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:56.280]   When you go to the grocery store or Costco,
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:59.480]   you don't just buy enough grocery to last you for a day,
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.760]   but I'm sure most of us will usually get enough
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:04.680]   to get through us for at least a week, right?
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.940]   But for most of Jesus' audience,
[00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:10.080]   they don't experience the same kind of abundance
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:12.700]   and wealth as we do today.
[00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:15.720]   Daily bread for them is not always guaranteed.
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:20.120]   However, because of our abundance,
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:22.800]   we slowly lose our dependence on God
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:25.860]   and become more and more reluctant to ask God
[00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:29.000]   for our basic day-to-day small requests.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.960]   And because of our abundance,
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:34.640]   we slowly lose our sense of gratitude
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:36.540]   and begin to take things for granted.
[00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:41.440]   The food on our table, the air that we breathe,
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:44.200]   or the roof that is over our head,
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.800]   and the list goes on and on.
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:48.880]   So back to the seasons of waiting
[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:51.120]   that I was in a couple years ago.
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:53.260]   One of the things that the Lord really revealed to me
[00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:55.700]   in that season was that I became so used
[00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:57.960]   to praying safe prayers.
[00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.320]   And what do I mean by that?
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:03.160]   There were things that I was not willing
[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:06.560]   to bring before the Lord because I decided for myself
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:09.800]   that God probably would not meet those needs.
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:14.120]   And so I would rather not pray about those things at all
[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:16.120]   than to bring them before the Lord
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:18.480]   and then have a chance to get disappointed by God
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:19.760]   when he didn't answer it.
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:23.520]   Or there would be other needs that I felt like
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:25.740]   they were just too insignificant to even bring
[00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:28.100]   before the God of the universe.
[00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:31.580]   So I would just resort to some vague or general prayers.
[00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:37.200]   But after that, I made an effort to pray more vulnerably
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:40.200]   and ask God for more specific things,
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:42.940]   allowing myself to either get surprised by God
[00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:45.120]   or get disappointed by God.
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:47.120]   I stopped filtering my own prayer
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:50.140]   and began to pray more freely and more boldly.
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:53.900]   And of course, I'm not going to pretend
[00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:56.780]   that everything went on smoothly after that.
[00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:58.000]   There were things in that season
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.860]   that I was really hoping for God to come true,
[00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:02.260]   but they never happened.
[00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:06.960]   But at the same time, when God show up
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:09.400]   in the exact way that I prayed for,
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:12.440]   I know for sure that it was God himself.
[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:15.460]   And because of this, my relationship with God
[00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:17.780]   actually becomes so much more intimate now.
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:23.920]   So church, daily bread prayer is an exercise of trust,
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:26.120]   trusting that the all-knowing,
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:28.880]   all-powerful God is in control
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:32.480]   and we can fully entrust our lives into his hand,
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:36.720]   down to the minute and trivial details of our lives.
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:38.980]   So don't be afraid to bring your ordinary,
[00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:40.880]   everyday requests before God,
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:43.380]   even if you feel like they're not important enough
[00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:44.600]   to even pray about.
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:49.600]   And from prayer for our daily bread,
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.640]   we move on to the next petition.
[00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:54.400]   And forgive us our debts,
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:57.560]   as we also have forgiven our debtors.
[00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:02.820]   So this is the second petition that is oriented towards us.
[00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:05.240]   And it shifts from our physical need
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:07.320]   now to our spiritual need.
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:10.440]   And when Jesus mentioned debts here,
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:13.600]   he's referring to our debts to God.
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.760]   And therefore, what he means is just
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:18.440]   forgiveness of our sins,
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:20.480]   the way that we have sins against God.
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:24.520]   And so when we pray, forgive us of our debts,
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:26.660]   this is a confessional prayer.
[00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:29.880]   Because before we can ask for forgiveness,
[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:33.120]   we need to be able to name our own sins.
[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:36.080]   First John 1, I say, if we confess our sins,
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:38.240]   he is faithful and just,
[00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:40.120]   and he will forgive us of our sins
[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:42.440]   and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:48.560]   But pay attention, Jesus doesn't just stop here.
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:51.080]   He says, forgive us our debts,
[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:54.600]   as we also have forgiven our debtors.
[00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:56.960]   Did you hear that?
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:03.280]   Because of our experience of divine forgiveness,
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:06.440]   it should allow us a greater willingness
[00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:09.760]   to forgive those who have sinned against us,
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:11.520]   or those who have hurt us.
[00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:16.000]   Later in Matthew 18, Jesus told of a parable
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.160]   of an unforgiving servant,
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:20.960]   who owe his master 10,000 talents.
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:25.200]   So a talent is almost 20 years worth of wages
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.920]   for a day laborer during Jesus' times.
[00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:33.600]   But the master forgave all 10,000 talents of debt
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:34.680]   for this servant.
[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:39.200]   But when this unforgiving servant got free,
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:41.160]   he saw one of his fellow servants
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.440]   who owe him 100 denarii,
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:46.480]   which is only about 100 days worth of wages.
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:48.920]   So you compare 100 days worth of wages
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:53.920]   to 20 times 10,000 days worth of wages, right?
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:57.520]   And yet this servant, he refused to cancel the debt
[00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:59.760]   and put his fellow servants into prison.
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:05.100]   And as you can imagine, when the master found out,
[00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:06.160]   he was furious.
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:10.360]   He summoned this unforgiving servant
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:12.360]   and called him a wicked servant,
[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:15.400]   because he refused to show mercy to his fellow servant,
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:19.160]   who owe him way less than the mercy
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:20.880]   that he has received himself.
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:24.760]   And this wicked servant ended up being put into jail himself
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:26.320]   because of that.
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.800]   And Jesus end this parable with this warning.
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:31.700]   This is what your heavenly father would do to you
[00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:34.400]   if you refuse to forgive your brothers and sister
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:35.440]   from your heart.
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:38.900]   And in fact, this is so important,
[00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:41.840]   that right after the Lord's prayer,
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:45.960]   in verse 14 and 15, Jesus added this remark.
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:49.520]   For if you forgive other people when they sin against you,
[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.680]   your heavenly father will also forgive you.
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:56.160]   But if you do not forgive others their sin,
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:59.100]   your father will not forgive your sins.
[00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:04.120]   So when we receive forgiveness from God,
[00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:06.360]   it should transform our heart
[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:10.260]   and enable us to forgive those who have sinned against us
[00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:13.380]   in a way lesser extent than we have sinned against God.
[00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:17.020]   This is because being a follower of Jesus
[00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:20.560]   is not just about our vertical relationship with him,
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:23.220]   but it is also about our horizontal relationship
[00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:25.660]   with other people made in the image of God.
[00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:31.860]   And then we have the final petition in this Lord's prayer.
[00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:34.420]   Lead us not into temptation,
[00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:37.140]   but deliver us from the evil one.
[00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:40.200]   This petition is one of deliverance,
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:42.200]   specifically from the evil one.
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:45.520]   And one of the realities of living in this fallen world
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:48.880]   is that temptation are just inevitable.
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:51.400]   But as God's children,
[00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:54.720]   he promised that he would not allow us to be tempted
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:57.080]   beyond what we can endure,
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:59.640]   and he would always provide a way out for us.
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:02.880]   And so a better way to understand this petition
[00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:05.420]   is I like how the NLT translate it.
[00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:08.280]   Do not let us yield into temptation.
[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:12.240]   So this last petition is not a request
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:16.500]   to be completely immune from all sorts of temptation,
[00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:20.140]   but it is a prayer to God to give us the strength
[00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:24.380]   to overcome them when we are faced with various temptation.
[00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:29.420]   So we've come to the end of the Lord's prayer,
[00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:32.760]   and this model prayer from Jesus is straightforward enough
[00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:37.400]   that even a child can memorize, can recite, can pray it.
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:41.400]   But at the same time, there is so much depth to it
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:44.500]   that we can spend a whole series just diving into it.
[00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:48.400]   So as I was preparing for my sermon this week,
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:52.460]   I went back and forth on how I want to end my sermon,
[00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:53.640]   because there is so much more
[00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:55.200]   that we didn't even touch upon.
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:59.440]   However, I feel like I would do a disservice to all of you
[00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:02.380]   if I didn't give all of you some extended time
[00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:04.820]   just to sit with this prayer,
[00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:08.240]   and to even spend some time praying through it yourself,
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:10.280]   because the best way to allow the Word of God
[00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:14.160]   to transform us is not just to sit and listen to a sermon,
[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:18.000]   but to actually live it out, to practice it.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.080]   So to give a little guide,
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:23.660]   I kind of created this framework
[00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:26.180]   based on the Lord's prayer that I hope will help
[00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:28.560]   all of us pray through the Lord's prayer
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:30.600]   in five different movement.
[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:34.000]   So there's worship, there's intercession,
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.640]   there is petition, there is confession and reconciliation,
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:41.160]   and there's also deliverance.
[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:44.360]   And during our time of reflection,
[00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:46.800]   pick one or maybe two of these areas
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:49.600]   which are most relevant in your personal life right now.
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:52.800]   Maybe for some of you,
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:55.480]   there are things that you need to bring before the Lord
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:57.000]   and confess before Him.
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:00.880]   And maybe for some of you,
[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:03.240]   there are sins and struggles in your life
[00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:06.780]   that you need to pray to God and ask for deliverance.
[00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:09.660]   And maybe for the rest of you,
[00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:12.320]   you just need some extended time to worship,
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:16.160]   to fix your eyes upon God's beauty and His glory.
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:20.120]   So I would encourage all of us just to take some time
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:21.960]   to listen to the Holy Spirit.
[00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:23.880]   I'll have Amanda out just to play
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:25.400]   some background music as well.
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:30.840]   And before you head out later,
[00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:34.200]   I actually also printed out a more extended version
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:37.920]   of each of these movements that you can take a copy home
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:40.360]   and spend some time this week to pray through it.
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:45.360]   Yeah, I will have, I think it is on the table
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:46.200]   right at the back.
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:48.460]   So on your way out, feel free to grab a copy.
[00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:51.940]   And my hope is that you will spend some time this week
[00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:54.000]   in your personal devotional time
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.700]   just to pray through them as well.
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:59.960]   And so as we spend some time in prayer and reflection,
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:03.080]   feel free to move around the room if you need to.
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:05.720]   If you would like a more private space,
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:07.840]   you can just get off your seat and go to a place
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:10.600]   that you feel like you're more comfortable praying in.
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:13.600]   Or if you come with someone else,
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:16.120]   you can also get into a group of two or three
[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:17.280]   and just pray together.
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:21.880]   Or husband and wife, feel free to also get together
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:23.920]   and pray as a couple.
[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:25.560]   Or if you know of people in the rooms
[00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:28.240]   that have a specific needs that you can pray for,
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:29.940]   feel free to go over to them,
[00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:32.640]   lay your hand over them and pray over them.
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:36.120]   Okay, so I want this time to be filled with prayer
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:38.660]   and no structure at all.
[00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:40.920]   And after a few moments, I will come up here
[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:43.320]   and end our time of prayer together.
[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:46.800]   So church, let's spend the next five minutes or so
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:47.640]   just praying.
[00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:50.220]   (gentle music)
[00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:53.640]   (gentle music continues)
[00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:57.060]   (gentle music continues)
[00:28:57.060 --> 00:29:00.480]   (gentle music continues)
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:03.900]   (gentle music continues)
[00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:07.320]   (gentle music continues)
[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:10.740]   (gentle music continues)
[00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:14.160]   (gentle music continues)
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:17.580]   (gentle music continues)
[00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:21.000]   (gentle music continues)
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.420]   (gentle music continues)
[00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:45.840]   (gentle music continues)
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:49.260]   (gentle music continues)
[00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:56.680]   (gentle music continues)
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:10.100]   (gentle music continues)
[00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:13.520]   (gentle music continues)
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:24.940]   (gentle music continues)
[00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:34.360]   (gentle music continues)
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:38.620]   (gentle music continues)
[00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:50.040]   (gentle music continues)
[00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:53.460]   (gentle music continues)
[00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:56.880]   (gentle music continues)
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:00.300]   (gentle music continues)
[00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:03.720]   (gentle music continues)
[00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:22.220]   (gentle music continues)

[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:25.180]   (gentle music continues)
[00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:49.640]   Church, let's pray together.
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:55.220]   Our Heavenly Father, we praise your holy name.
[00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:58.720]   Thank you for adopting us into your family
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:04.020]   and give us the honor to be called sons and daughters
[00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:06.320]   of God through Jesus Christ.
[00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:11.720]   May your kingdom come and your will be done
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:13.520]   on earth as it is in heaven,
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:16.860]   in urban voice as it is in heaven,
[00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:21.020]   in Chicago as it is in heaven.
[00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:23.260]   (gentle music continues)
[00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:26.900]   While we experience brokenness and suffering
[00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:28.440]   on this side of heaven,
[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:33.180]   we know that this is not what you intended in creation.
[00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:35.900]   And so we long for you to come again,
[00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:38.260]   to bring your perfect peace
[00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:40.100]   and your perfect wholeness to earth.
[00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:45.600]   Father, provide us with our daily needs,
[00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:47.300]   both big and small.
[00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:51.540]   Forgive us of our sins as we forgive those
[00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:53.140]   who sins against us.
[00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:57.460]   Help us to not yield to temptation
[00:33:57.460 --> 00:33:59.620]   because we know that we are not just fighting
[00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:02.260]   against flesh or blood,
[00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:04.220]   but we're fighting against evil rulers
[00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:06.880]   and authorities of the unseen world,
[00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:10.040]   against mighty power in this dark world
[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:12.920]   and against evil spirits in the heavenly places.
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:17.540]   So give us strength to overcome the evil ones.
[00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:22.660]   For yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory.
[00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:24.420]   Amen.
[00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:27.740]   All right, thank you all.
[00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:29.280]   Just a reminder on your way out,
