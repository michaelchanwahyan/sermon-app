1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,520
 Good morning, UV.

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,920
 I hope all of you are able to stay cool this past week.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,040
 I'm thankful for just the church here.

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,440
 Mark brought a portable AC on Monday,

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,200
 so it came in clutch for me this week.

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,340
 But before we get into the word, let's pray.

7
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,780
 Heavenly Father, we thank you

8
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:26,600
 that we are able to come together this morning

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,700
 and be here worshiping you and fellowship.

10
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,220
 We find another, I just ask that,

11
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,120
 as we're about to open up your word and study your word,

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,560
 I ask that your Holy Spirit will be with us,

13
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,600
 that your spirit will open up our heart

14
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,400
 so that we're able to receive what you have for us today.

15
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,440
 And I ask that your word will be transforming in our life

16
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,480
 and that it will, yeah, just make a change

17
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,280
 in the way that we live our life.

18
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,200
 And I also ask for your spirit will be with me as I preach

19
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,400
 and that you would take away anything

20
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,360
 that is not from you and that your word,

21
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,320
 and your word alone will be preached today.

22
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,020
 Pray this in the son's name, amen.

23
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:11,140
 Okay, so I've been at UV for about two months now,

24
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,660
 and usually on Sunday morning,

25
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:13,860
 right before the English service,

26
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,200
 you can find me serving over at the kids ministry.

27
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,740
 And one of the things that I noticed,

28
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,820
 especially with some of the younger kids,

29
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,860
 every time when they're being told to do something,

30
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:26,180
 they usually like to do the opposite.

31
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,360
 Wendy's right here so he can testify to that.

32
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,400
 And one of the prime example of this is,

33
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,960
 we have one song that is called "Jesus is Alive."

34
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,280
 So usually at the beginning of the song,

35
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,760
 they will ask them to like hop around,

36
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,000
 clap their hands, stomp their feet.

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,560
 And then right in the middle of the song,

38
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,880
 there'll be a part where it would say, "Everybody freeze."

39
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,640
 And this started off with just one kid,

40
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,960
 and then more and more kids just like follow along.

41
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,680
 So basically, every time when the song starts,

42
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,280
 them to clap their hands or like stomp their feet,

43
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,020
 they would just like stand there and like not move at all.

44
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,060
 When it comes to the part where the song told them to freeze,

45
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,460
 they would start like running around

46
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,540
 and then like clap their hands

47
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,000
 and basically just do the opposite

48
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,860
 of what they were being told.

49
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,940
 And while some of them think that they're funny

50
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,360
 and like sneaky, not trying to let the teachers recognize it,

51
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,620
 but when you do things in an opposite

52
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,180
 with like basically the rest of the room,

53
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,180
 it is not hard to notice about it.

54
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,660
 And so in the same ways, in the Greco-Roman world,

55
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:26,380
 one of the reason that Jesus causes such a huge stir

56
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,980
 during his time on earth

57
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,560
 is because his teaching and his lifestyle

58
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,380
 is actually completely opposite

59
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,640
 compared to the culture around him,

60
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,180
 that the people cannot help but notice it.

61
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:42,260
 So today we'll take a look at the Jesus Sermon on the Mount

62
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,160
 and what this upside down kingdom of God looks like.

63
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,220
 So every country in the world,

64
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,960
 in some ways there is certain guiding principles

65
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,940
 when it comes to the governance

66
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,820
 and the ruling of the country, right?

67
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,100
 So I have to look it up for the US constitution.

68
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,180
 These are some of the guiding principles,

69
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,980
 popular sovereignty, limited government,

70
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:06,180
 separation of powers, checks and balances and federalism.

71
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,800
 And so similarly in the kingdom of heaven,

72
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,640
 there are certain guiding principles

73
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,300
 that outline what life in God's kingdom looks like.

74
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,020
 And the place where this can be found

75
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:18,540
 is on Jesus's Sermon on the Mount.

76
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,100
 So starting off today,

77
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,140
 I will kick off a series on Jesus's Sermon on the Mount.

78
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,180
 And throughout this series,

79
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,020
 we will explore what life in the kingdom of God

80
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,060
 or kingdom of heaven.

81
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,300
 I will use this term interchangeably.

82
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,820
 So I hope you guys don't get confused.

83
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,900
 So kingdom of God, kingdom of heaven,

84
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,260
 in the book of Matthew, they refer to the same thing.

85
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,380
 So the Sermon on the Mount

86
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:42,320
 contains some of the most elaborate teachings of Jesus

87
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,180
 on how we are to live rightly in his kingdom.

88
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,020
 And some of you might ask,

89
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,980
 so Chi, you have been talking about God's kingdom

90
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,260
 of this kingdom of heaven for a while now,

91
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,460
 but what exactly is God's kingdom

92
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,900
 or this kingdom of heaven?

93
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,020
 So we can actually spend an entire sermon series

94
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,320
 just on this topic.

95
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,520
 But one of the important aspects of God's kingdom

96
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,780
 that I want to highlight today

97
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:06,020
 is that this kingdom of God is already, but not yet.

98
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,840
 It is already, but not yet.

99
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,680
 So some of you might already be familiar with this term,

100
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,400
 but the already of this kingdom refers to

101
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,380
 when Jesus died and rose again 2000 plus years ago.

102
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,780
 In some ways, he ushers in a new kingdom,

103
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:22,100
 a kingdom of heaven here on earth.

104
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,120
 And so what that means is that in some ways,

105
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,020
 we're actually living in this kingdom of heaven right now.

106
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:31,500
 However, this kingdom is not yet fully being realized.

107
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,280
 This is why we still see a lot of brokenness around us.

108
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:39,280
 This is why we still see sufferings and pain,

109
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,660
 those of the, those brokenness around us.

110
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,980
 So this is actually the not yet part of God's kingdom.

111
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,020
 And this will only come in full realization

112
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,420
 when Christ come again in the future.

113
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,540
 And what does this already, but not yet aspects

114
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,160
 of God's kingdom meant for us?

115
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,780
 As we continue to explore this series,

116
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,900
 I think it will be helpful to keep in mind

117
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,420
 that this counter-cultural way of living

118
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:04,100
 laid out by Jesus in his sermon on the mount

119
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,900
 is something that all believers, we should aim towards,

120
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,980
 we should work towards on this side of heaven.

121
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,880
 At the same time, we also have to understand

122
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,340
 that God's perfection can only be attained

123
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,220
 when Jesus comes again.

124
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:20,740
 So the sermon on the mount, even though there are,

125
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,040
 it can seems like a rules or set of regulation

126
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,120
 for us to follow.

127
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,780
 But I want to emphasize this,

128
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,380
 that this is not supposed to be a burden

129
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,620
 or a set of impossible rules that no one can live up to.

130
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,820
 But this is supposed to be an invitation

131
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,380
 to a way of life that will lead to blessings

132
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:39,300
 and a way of life that will lead to flourishing as well.

133
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,000
 So before I would get into a passage today,

134
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,740
 I just want to give an overview

135
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:47,260
 for the entire sermon on the mount as a whole.

136
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,820
 So Jesus' sermon on the mount

137
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,540
 span across three chapters,

138
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:54,780
 from Matthew 5 all the way to Matthew 7.

139
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,840
 And this is just not some random collections

140
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,900
 about Jesus that Matthew kind of like compiled

141
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:01,960
 and put it together.

142
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,100
 But it is actually a very carefully designed

143
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,140
 and structured section.

144
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,980
 And it follows right from Jesus' preaching

145
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:11,540
 about the kingdom of heaven in chapter four,

146
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,560
 especially in verse 17.

147
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,640
 So at the beginning of Matthew four,

148
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,520
 we see that Jesus,

149
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,880
 he was being tempted in the wilderness.

150
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,600
 And after he basically able to resist

151
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,320
 all the temptation from the devil,

152
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:30,720
 he basically began his ministry right after that.

153
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,160
 And the central message that Jesus preached

154
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,720
 in his ministry is this.

155
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,040
 So Matthew four, verse 17,

156
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,320
 "From that time on, Jesus began to preach,

157
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,120
 "repent for the kingdom of heaven has come near,

158
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,560
 "for the kingdom of heaven has come near."

159
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,380
 And so right following after that,

160
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,840
 beginning in Matthew five,

161
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,200
 the sermon on the mount is basically

162
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,320
 where Jesus explains what he meant

163
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,820
 when he said the kingdom of heaven has come near.

164
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:58,280
 And so I put together this,

165
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,640
 a slide about the structure

166
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,620
 on the sermon on the mount as a whole.

167
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,200
 So at the beginning and the end,

168
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,020
 there's the introductory narrative framework

169
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,040
 that basically set up the physical settings

170
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,000
 of this entire sermon on the mount.

171
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,520
 And then we get to the main part of it,

172
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,240
 where there's an introduction,

173
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,360
 a main body and a conclusion.

174
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,400
 So we'll be focusing on the introduction today.

175
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,600
 And then there's the main body,

176
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,240
 which can further divide into three parts as well.

177
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,520
 The first part talking about the relationship

178
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,000
 between the law, the Old Testament law,

179
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 to the new covenant of Jesus.

180
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,520
 And then the second part talks about religious hypocrisy,

181
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,320
 basically what true and false piety

182
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,920
 or being religious looks like.

183
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,900
 And then the third part talks about

184
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,900
 how are we to relate with one another,

185
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,480
 the kingdom ethics or kingdom perspective.

186
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,680
 And then this section's on sermon on the mount

187
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,700
 and with basically two different kind of ways,

188
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,660
 two different kind of fruits

189
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,000
 and two different kind of foundations.

190
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,560
 Jesus basically is giving his audience an options.

191
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,100
 You can either choose the way

192
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,500
 that will lead to fullness and blessings,

193
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,260
 or you can choose the way that leads to destruction.

194
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:08,440
 And so if you're more of a visual learner,

195
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,920
 this is a video from the Bible project

196
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,020
 that they put together and we'll take a look at it.

197
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,140
 Hopefully it will work.

198
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:34,980
 - Gospel of Matthew is one of the earliest accounts

199
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,460
 of Jesus of Nazareth.

200
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,260
 - And in chapters five through seven,

201
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:41,300
 we find a collection of Jesus's most well-known teachings

202
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,300
 often called the sermon on the mount.

203
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,900
 Here we learn what Jesus means when he announces

204
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,420
 that the kingdom of the skies has come near

205
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,220
 and what it looks like to participate in God's kingdom.

206
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:54,020
 The whole sermon has been given a three part shape.

207
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:57,740
 There's the introduction, then the large main body,

208
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,220
 and then the conclusion.

209
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,620
 The introduction announces the surprising

210
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,020
 counterintuitive identity of those

211
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,820
 who were part of God's kingdom.

212
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,360
 Then comes the main body of teaching

213
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,580
 where Jesus explores what he means

214
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:12,060
 when he calls his followers to be righteous.

215
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,180
 - What does he mean by righteousness?

216
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,980
 - Righteousness is about living in right relationship

217
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,900
 with God and with others.

218
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,220
 It's a character trait that creates justice

219
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,660
 and peace in the world.

220
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:26,020
 Then the body of the sermon is like Jesus's manifesto

221
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:29,300
 on righteousness examined from three angles

222
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,980
 and three big parts.

223
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,780
 How this righteousness relates to the Torah,

224
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,500
 how this righteousness relates to religious practices

225
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,240
 of his day, and how this righteousness is expressed

226
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,340
 in our relationships with God and with neighbor.

227
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:45,200
 Finally, Jesus concludes the sermon by calling people

228
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,960
 to make a choice about how they're going to respond.

229
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,800
 - Okay, I see it.

230
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,720
 Three main parts of this whole sermon

231
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,400
 and the middle part itself has three parts.

232
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,800
 - Right, and then every one of these parts

233
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,880
 itself has three parts.

234
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,280
 There is a lot of design in the structure

235
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,520
 of the sermon on the mount

236
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,420
 and we're gonna go over all of it.

237
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,360
 In the introduction, Jesus offers a surprise announcement

238
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,240
 to the people standing in front of him.

239
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,000
 They are invited to experience the good life

240
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,280
 of God's kingdom.

241
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,340
 He first offers nine sayings that redefine

242
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,600
 who is experiencing the good life,

243
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,680
 commonly called the Beatitudes.

244
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,120
 Here, we learn that those entering God's kingdom first

245
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,720
 are the lowly outsiders who hunger for righteousness

246
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,400
 and suffer as peacemakers.

247
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,800
 - Next, Jesus calls his followers salt of the land.

248
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,640
 What's this all about?

249
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,680
 - In the Hebrew scriptures, salt is a symbol

250
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,280
 of God's long-lasting covenant relationship with Israel.

251
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,840
 So Jesus is claiming that he and his followers

252
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,600
 are carrying Israel's covenant relationship

253
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,880
 to its fulfillment.

254
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,340
 - Next, Jesus calls them the light of the world

255
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,200
 and a city set up on a mountain.

256
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,320
 - Jesus is referencing here a promise from the prophet Isaiah

257
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,880
 that one day the inhabitants of Jerusalem

258
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,060
 would reflect God's light and peace and blessing

259
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,220
 out to all the world.

260
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,880
 - So Jesus is saying that he and his followers

261
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,640
 are fulfilling that promise.

262
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,480
 - Right, and how they go about doing that

263
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,560
 is what the rest of the Sermon on the Mount is all about.

264
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:17,640
 - Okay, so I hope that is a helpful way

265
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,440
 to kind of illustrate this whole entire Sermon on the Mount.

266
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,200
 So let's look at Matthew five together.

267
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,960
 And yeah, so Matthew five, verse one.

268
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,720
 Now, when Jesus saw the crowds,

269
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,720
 he went up on the mountainside and sat down.

270
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,200
 His disciples came to him and he began to teach them.

271
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,400
 So in this part, we basically find out the who

272
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,080
 and the where for this entire section

273
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,440
 on the Sermon on the Mount.

274
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,240
 So the who, of course, there is Jesus up there,

275
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,100
 but then there's two different kind of like distinct groups

276
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:54,100
 that Jesus differentiates, the crowds and the disciples.

277
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,720
 So the crowds are probably people

278
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,000
 that are on the outer circle of Jesus's life,

279
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,680
 and the disciples are in his inner circles.

280
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,520
 So Jesus began this by withdrawing from the crowds

281
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:08,200
 from the outer circle so that he can focus his time

282
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,420
 on his inner circle, the disciples.

283
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:14,520
 But the funny thing is at the concluding part

284
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,120
 of this entire Sermon on the Mount in chapter seven,

285
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,720
 we find that the crowd are present as well.

286
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,880
 They probably hear that Jesus is like teaching

287
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,220
 his disciples in the mountain,

288
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,120
 and they kind of like follow him along as well.

289
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,800
 So this is the who and the where.

290
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,400
 So Jesus, he went up on a mountainside

291
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,640
 and sat down.

292
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,600
 So this is pretty much where the Sermon on the Mount

293
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,100
 gets its name, because Jesus is basically preaching

294
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,440
 this entire sermon in the settings of a mountain.

295
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,880
 And for us in the 21st century America,

296
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,040
 this might not mean a lot to us,

297
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,900
 but for some of the early Jewish followers of Jesus,

298
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,440
 and even some of the early Christians

299
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,280
 who are familiar with the Old Testament,

300
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,840
 when they see this or when they hear this,

301
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,960
 they will probably immediately recall the event

302
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,280
 in Exodus at Mount Sinai,

303
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:07,680
 where the Lord basically gave the laws through Moses

304
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,040
 to the people of Israel.

305
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,320
 And so right here, Matthew is actually,

306
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,000
 in the way that he structure the Gospel of Matthew,

307
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,800
 he's very intentional in presenting Jesus

308
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,440
 as the faithful Israel,

309
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,560
 who is able to live out God's law perfectly.

310
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,600
 So I sort of like make a chart here

311
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,800
 that compare some of the parallel

312
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,120
 between the people of Israel in Exodus

313
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,680
 and also Jesus in the Book of Matthew.

314
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,320
 So in the Book of Exodus,

315
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,000
 we have the Exodus event, right?

316
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,160
 Where the people of Israel left Egypt.

317
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,160
 And in the Book of Matthew,

318
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,280
 he also presented these stories about Jesus's life.

319
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,620
 When Jesus was being born,

320
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:48,480
 like Herod is trying to basically kill all the babies.

321
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,360
 So to escape that, Jesus's parents have to

322
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,960
 basically bring him along

323
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,520
 and like live in Egypt for a little bit.

324
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,160
 And so once Herod,

325
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:01,560
 the Herod that is trying to kill all the babies was dead,

326
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,560
 Jesus and his family then moved out of Egypt

327
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,320
 and back to Jerusalem.

328
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,720
 And so this is kind of like the parallel event

329
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,280
 to the Exodus in the Book of Exodus.

330
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,960
 And right after the people of Israel left Egypt,

331
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,840
 they wander in the wilderness

332
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,080
 and they were being tempted for 40 years.

333
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,460
 And during this time,

334
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,680
 they make a lot of complaints to Moses.

335
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,360
 When they have no food, when they have no water,

336
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,160
 they basically came to Moses and asked him like,

337
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,400
 "Why do you even bring us out of Egypt,

338
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,780
 where we would like starve to death?

339
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,680
 We would rather be slave in Egypt

340
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,680
 than to like die here in the wilderness."

341
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,920
 And so Matthew, in some way, he also present Jesus.

342
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,860
 Jesus was being tempted after 40 days and 40 nights

343
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,600
 of like fasting and praying.

344
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,400
 He was being tempted at the end.

345
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:53,400
 And yet in contrast to the people of Israel,

346
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,700
 Jesus, he was able to resist the temptation every time.

347
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:02,160
 And so, and then after the wilderness wandering,

348
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,540
 we also find in Exodus,

349
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:08,640
 there is also the narrative about God gave the law,

350
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,280
 the Old Testament, the Torah at Mount Sinai

351
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,000
 to the people of Israel.

352
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,560
 And similarly in the Book of Matthew,

353
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,040
 here we find that Jesus preached

354
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,000
 about the kingdom of heaven on a mountain as well.

355
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,280
 So there's kind of like the parallel

356
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:24,360
 of giving the Old Testament Torah from a mountain

357
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,320
 and Jesus preaching about this kingdom of heaven

358
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,960
 from a mountain as well.

359
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,160
 So one thing to take note is that the Sermon on the Mount

360
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,400
 that Jesus gave, this is not a new set of Torah

361
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,020
 or new set of law that is supposed to replace

362
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,340
 the Old Testament law.

363
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,200
 But Jesus is actually bringing new light

364
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,940
 into this Old Testament law in light of his own coming.

365
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,560
 And his teaching is to become the ethical standards

366
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,800
 of righteousness for all the followers in this kingdom.

367
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:53,800
 So now we find out about the who and the where

368
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,040
 for this entire narrative and the following,

369
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,080
 we will find out about the what.

370
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,120
 So Jesus begins his sermon by telling the audience

371
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,080
 what a good and blessed life in his kingdom look like.

372
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,840
 So all these sayings begins with the word blessed.

373
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,960
 And blessed can just mean,

374
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,240
 simply just means having a good life

375
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,160
 or just having a happy life.

376
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,340
 But right here in the Sermon on the Mount,

377
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,760
 in the Beatitudes specifically,

378
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,320
 there's probably a nuance of someone

379
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,540
 that have God's favor upon them.

380
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:24,640
 So verse three, he say,

381
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,940
 blessed are the poor in spirit.

382
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:30,140
 If you have never heard of the Beatitudes before,

383
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,320
 or if you've never read this part of Matthew before,

384
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,120
 you might be like, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a second, Jesus.

385
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,940
 Who are the blessed one?

386
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,900
 The poor in spirit?

387
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:44,180
 I feel like this is a very surprising things

388
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,460
 if we listen to it in our,

389
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:49,320
 like in the current day and age that we live in, right?

390
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,860
 If we are to write our own Beatitudes,

391
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:55,360
 we will probably say, blessed are those who are wealthy,

392
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,380
 or blessed are those who have everything that they need.

393
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:03,320
 But for the first century Jewish audience of Jesus,

394
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:07,240
 living under the rule of the Roman Empire,

395
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,300
 this actually speaks directly to them,

396
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,760
 because this group of people,

397
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,480
 they're basically a group of outcasts

398
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,600
 and nobody in the society.

399
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,280
 And yet it is to these people,

400
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:20,160
 Jesus mentioned that they are the blessed one.

401
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,420
 And so what does it mean to be poor in spirits?

402
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:25,320
 Right here, it refers to a kind of humility

403
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,060
 that understands our own powerlessness.

404
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:32,160
 And in turn, this leads us to completely depend on the Lord.

405
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,880
 And it is to these people,

406
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:38,320
 Jesus has promised that for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

407
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,080
 So I'm gonna get a little nerdy right here.

408
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,680
 If you look at the verb that I highlight

409
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,600
 on the second part of the Beatitudes,

410
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,440
 for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

411
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,720
 And then the following is, for they will be comforted,

412
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,780
 they will inherit the earth.

413
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:56,080
 So we see the Beatitudes begin with this divine promise

414
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,600
 that is in the present tense,

415
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,720
 for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

416
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,200
 And it also, later in verse 10,

417
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,140
 it ends with the same promise,

418
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,520
 for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

419
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,720
 And then everything in between

420
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,400
 is actually in the future tense.

421
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,200
 So even right here, the Greek grammar

422
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,320
 is trying to present this kingdom of God,

423
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,360
 this kingdom of heaven, as something that is already,

424
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,740
 that we can already experience in the here and now.

425
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:22,080
 But also not yet, that some part of it

426
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,740
 we can only experience when Christ comes again.

427
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:27,520
 So in other words, as believers,

428
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,880
 we are part of God's kingdom now,

429
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,080
 but the fullness of life in this kingdom

430
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,560
 can only be experienced in the future.

431
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,800
 And then Jesus continues,

432
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,800
 blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.

433
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,000
 This is probably also surprising, right?

434
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,120
 Why are the mourning,

435
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,320
 why are the people that are sad or mourning,

436
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,580
 they are the blessed one?

437
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,920
 But right here, when Jesus talks about mourning,

438
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,560
 there's probably two different kind of causes

439
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,440
 that leads to this kind of mourning.

440
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,400
 The first is probably familiar with,

441
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,840
 that the first one is probably something

442
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,420
 that we're all familiar with.

443
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:04,480
 We're mourning because of suffering or hardships,

444
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,840
 or just things or life that are difficult.

445
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,440
 Things that are difficult in our life

446
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,560
 that causes us to mourn.

447
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,120
 But then there's a second kind of mourning

448
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,960
 that Jesus talks about here.

449
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,360
 This is the kind of mourning

450
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,860
 because of an awareness of our own sin.

451
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:23,200
 And we see this a lot in the Old Testament actually,

452
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,160
 when we will read that people will put on sackcloth

453
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,260
 and like put ashes on their head

454
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,760
 as a tangible expression of their mourning

455
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,620
 and also repentance from sin.

456
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:36,000
 So right here, Jesus basically promised that

457
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,560
 when we turn to God in the attitude of mourning

458
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,240
 and repentance because of our own sin,

459
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:45,220
 God himself, he will forgive us and he will comfort us.

460
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:48,440
 And then verse five continues.

461
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:52,240
 Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.

462
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,080
 And so similar to the first Beatitudes in verse three,

463
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,680
 the meek are those who have an awareness

464
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,340
 of their own circumstances.

465
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,960
 And instead of thinking of themselves more highly

466
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,220
 than they should be,

467
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:06,080
 they understand that ultimately their strength

468
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,960
 and their power comes from the Lord and the Lord alone.

469
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,360
 And besides the meek or the gentle,

470
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,280
 they are not just gentle towards themselves,

471
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,120
 but they're also gentle towards others as well.

472
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,720
 And when they see that there are some injustice

473
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,360
 or oppressions around them,

474
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,600
 they will want to bring the justice

475
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,120
 and the righteousness of God into those situation.

476
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,480
 And these are the people that God promised

477
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,520
 they will inherit the earth.

478
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,620
 And to inherit something basically means

479
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,340
 you assume some sort of authority

480
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,140
 or control over them, right?

481
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:41,560
 So to inherit the earth here means that the meek,

482
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,640
 one day when Christ comes again,

483
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,860
 these are the people that will rule in the new heaven

484
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,940
 and new earth alongside Christ.

485
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,780
 And this is the promise that God gave to those

486
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:55,620
 who are the meek or the gentle.

487
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,380
 And so this leads us to the next Beatitudes.

488
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:02,060
 Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,

489
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,980
 for they will be filled.

490
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,360
 And I'm sure we all have experienced

491
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,560
 some sort of hunger and thirst before, right?

492
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,980
 Maybe some of you sitting right here,

493
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,560
 you're already getting a little hungry

494
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,880
 and thinking about what will the lunch

495
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,140
 or the snacks be later.

496
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:17,700
 But how often do we actually hunger and thirst

497
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,600
 for godly thing?

498
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,820
 How often do we actually hunger and thirst for righteousness?

499
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,420
 Here Jesus say, blessed are those who hunger

500
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,420
 and thirst for righteousness.

501
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,140
 And to these people, Jesus promised

502
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:33,020
 that they will be satisfied, that they will be filled.

503
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:37,060
 So one of the first four Beatitudes that we just look at,

504
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:40,940
 it focused on, in some ways, a kind of attitude or mindset

505
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:44,900
 for those who completely depend on the Lord in their life.

506
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,100
 This next tree that we will look at,

507
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,580
 we'll actually focus on the actions of those

508
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:53,160
 who live for God as a result of the dependence on him.

509
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:58,300
 So verse seven, blessed are the merciful,

510
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,820
 for they will be shown mercy.

511
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,820
 And this is, again, pretty straightforward.

512
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,780
 When we show mercy to others' people,

513
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:07,840
 we will receive mercy from God as well.

514
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,580
 But the questions that, as I was preparing this,

515
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,340
 that I feel like God raised in my heart is this.

516
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:18,860
 Is our day-to-day life a good representation of the grace

517
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:22,020
 and the mercy that we have received from the Lord?

518
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,440
 I feel like, for me personally, this is,

519
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,900
 I don't think I can fully answer that question

520
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,660
 just because I feel like I have received a lot of grace

521
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:33,100
 and mercy from God, especially in this season.

522
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,960
 But if I honestly take a look at my life,

523
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,860
 a lot of times my life doesn't exemplifies that

524
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:41,840
 as someone that is merciful.

525
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,180
 And then verse eight, blessed are the pure in heart,

526
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,820
 for they will see God.

527
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:50,400
 And so the pure in heart are basically those who love God

528
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,500
 with all their heart, with all their mind,

529
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,440
 with all their strength, and with all their soul.

530
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,920
 And these people are basically the one that put Jesus

531
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,600
 as the center of their life,

532
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,920
 put Jesus as the priority in everything that they do.

533
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:07,640
 And Jesus say, these are the people that will see God

534
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,240
 in the new heaven and new earth.

535
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:14,520
 And then verse nine, blessed are the peacemaker,

536
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,960
 for they will be called children of God.

537
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,760
 And when it comes to peacemaker here,

538
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,920
 there's, again, two different kind of aspect

539
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,960
 to this peace that Jesus talks about.

540
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:29,560
 To make peace, there's the aspect of peace with God,

541
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,480
 which is kind of like the vertical relationship

542
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,660
 between us and God, and also peace between people.

543
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:39,300
 Basically means when we come together as people,

544
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:43,160
 are we able to maintain peace in our community,

545
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:47,200
 in our family, or in our country as a whole?

546
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,580
 Like, are we people that are actively pursuing peace

547
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,760
 in those situation?

548
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,480
 And these people, God promised that they will be called

549
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,080
 children of God.

550
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,320
 And in the Old Testament, to become part of God's family,

551
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,560
 or to become children of God,

552
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,760
 you actually have to physically come

553
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,760
 from the line of Abraham.

554
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,780
 But in the New Testament, through Jesus Christ,

555
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,720
 we are able to reconcile to God

556
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,360
 and become part of his new covenant family,

557
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,680
 through Christ at the cross.

558
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:19,320
 And as a result of experiencing this peace from God,

559
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,480
 the peacemaker then becomes agent of God's peace

560
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,080
 in the broken world around them.

561
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,440
 And Paul highlight this in 2 Corinthians,

562
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,580
 that in some ways, we as God's people,

563
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,100
 we are being reconciled to God,

564
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:36,480
 so that we can continue to become reconciler

565
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,360
 in our own life.

566
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,580
 So this is 2 Corinthians 5, 18 to 19.

567
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:43,720
 All this is from God, who reconcile us to himself,

568
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:48,040
 through Christ, and gave us the ministry of reconciliation.

569
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:51,720
 That God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ,

570
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,520
 not counting people's sin against them.

571
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:58,240
 And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation.

572
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,440
 So, if you have been following along,

573
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,240
 you can notice that there's a certain flow

574
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,240
 to these beatitudes, right?

575
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,280
 This part of the Sermon on the Mount.

576
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,000
 So we begin by focusing on the attitude,

577
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,820
 or the mindset of those people that depend on the Lord.

578
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:18,760
 And as we live in submission to the Lord,

579
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,560
 this should, in some ways, lead to a certain actions

580
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,160
 in our day-to-day life, right?

581
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,200
 Like bringing peace to the brokenness around us,

582
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,460
 or showing mercy to the people around us.

583
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,800
 And lastly, as we live for God,

584
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:36,360
 and become his agent of grace and peace in this broken world,

585
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,820
 Jesus also warned us that the world,

586
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:42,560
 we should expect a certain kind of reaction from the world.

587
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,560
 And in some ways, Jesus warned us that

588
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:48,040
 the world will actually be a hostile place for us.

589
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,440
 And we find this in Jesus' last film moments

590
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,200
 with his disciples during the Last Supper,

591
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,960
 when he basically say this to them.

592
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,560
 "If the world hates you, the disciples,

593
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:02,200
 "keep in mind that it hated me, Jesus first.

594
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,220
 "If you belong to the world, it would love you as its own.

595
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:08,940
 "As it is, you do not belong to the world,

596
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,860
 "but I have chosen you out of the world.

597
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,960
 "And that is why the world hates you."

598
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:18,280
 So, when we try to live this counter-cultural life

599
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,880
 that represents our kingdom's citizenships

600
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,160
 in God's upside-down kingdom,

601
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,580
 the world will not be a comfortable place for us.

602
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:27,780
 And this is the reality.

603
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:31,500
 But the good news is that Jesus promised,

604
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,320
 right here in verse 10,

605
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,280
 "Blessed are those who are persecuted

606
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,280
 "because of righteousness,

607
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,440
 "for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."

608
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,560
 So, if you remember,

609
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,880
 the Beatitudes opened with the same divine promise.

610
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,340
 "Blessed are the poor in spirit,

611
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,360
 "for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."

612
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,080
 And right here, it ends with, again, the same promise.

613
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,900
 "Blessed are those who are persecuted

614
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,520
 "because of righteousness,

615
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,760
 "for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."

616
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,600
 And so, this divine promise

617
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,600
 that the kingdom of heaven basically belongs to us

618
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,500
 is actually presently available

619
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:09,160
 to all people who follow Jesus.

620
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,600
 So, let's sit with that for a moment.

621
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:16,080
 What this means is that we can actually get a glimpse

622
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,860
 of life in the heaven, in the here and now,

623
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,260
 while we're still on earth.

624
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:24,340
 I think this is a privilege that we should not take lightly.

625
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:28,640
 And so, the next two verses then continues on

626
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,200
 to elaborate on this,

627
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,280
 but then it makes it even more personal.

628
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:35,080
 So, we can see the switch from the third-person pronoun,

629
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,840
 blessed are those, to a second-person pronoun,

630
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,380
 blessed are you.

631
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:43,540
 So, Jesus say, "Blessed are you when people insult you,

632
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:46,760
 "persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil

633
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,980
 "against you because of me.

634
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,980
 "Rejoice and be glad,

635
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:53,720
 "because great is your reward in heaven.

636
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,560
 "For in the same way,

637
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,120
 "they persecuted prophets who were before you."

638
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,480
 So, we just finished with the Beatitudes,

639
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:05,280
 with all the sayings that Jesus has taught.

640
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:09,200
 And Jesus has shown us what privilege and blessing it is

641
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,720
 to become a citizen of his upside-down kingdom.

642
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,580
 He then moved on to provide two metaphors,

643
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:18,400
 being the salt of the earth and the light of the world,

644
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,920
 to basically show us how citizens of his kingdom

645
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:25,760
 are supposed to be living on a mission for God.

646
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,440
 And just as any earthly citizenships that we have,

647
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,920
 our kingdom citizenships come with a certain privilege

648
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,800
 as well as responsibility.

649
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,000
 And this is a both-ends situation.

650
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,800
 We can't just enjoy the privilege

651
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,600
 of being part of God's family,

652
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,380
 of being part of God's kingdom,

653
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:46,320
 without actually carrying any responsibility with it.

654
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,080
 So, in other words, we are actually blessed by God

655
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,640
 so that we can continue to be a blessing

656
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,200
 to the world around us.

657
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,540
 So, Jesus continues,

658
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:58,000
 "You are the salt of the earth,

659
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,640
 "but if the salt loses its saltiness,

660
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,800
 "how can it be made salty again?

661
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,800
 "It is no longer good for anything

662
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,640
 "except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.

663
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,840
 "You are the light of the world.

664
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,700
 "A town built on a hill cannot be hidden.

665
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:16,660
 "Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl.

666
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,680
 "Instead, they put it on its stand

667
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:21,900
 "and it gives light to everyone in the house.

668
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,460
 "In the same way, let your light shine before others

669
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,300
 "that they may see your good deeds

670
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,580
 "and glorify your Father in heaven."

671
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:32,540
 So, right here, Jesus basically telling his disciples,

672
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:35,620
 "As salt and light, God has sent us on a mission

673
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:38,420
 "to show the world who Jesus is,

674
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,280
 "through the way we live our lives.

675
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,160
 "And just like the salt that loses its saltiness,

676
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,760
 "if we have no positive impact in the world

677
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,500
 "or in the community around us,

678
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,260
 "we're basically of no use to God's kingdom.

679
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:55,520
 "And on the other hand, as the light of the world,

680
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,780
 "our lives should actively point people to Jesus

681
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,400
 "through the way we live our life

682
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,000
 "and through the works that we have done."

683
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 And so, using these two metaphors,

684
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,640
 Jesus is trying to get this point across.

685
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,000
 "As a citizen of God's kingdom,

686
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,020
 "we must make a difference in the world.

687
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,160
 "And who we are and whose we are

688
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,180
 "should impact how we live our day-to-day life."

689
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:24,860
 So, we've come to the end to this whole introduction

690
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:27,060
 from Jesus' Sermon on the Mount, right?

691
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,780
 And the passage that we just looked through,

692
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,940
 this first 16 verse, in some ways,

693
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:33,100
 it is very straightforward, right?

694
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:37,060
 There's no sort of hidden meaning behind it

695
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:40,540
 or any part that is confusing or hard to understand.

696
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,700
 But I think the biggest challenge

697
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,580
 that comes with this passage

698
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,500
 is to be able to live it out, actually,

699
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,800
 in our day-to-day life.

700
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:51,220
 If we take a look at our own lives now,

701
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,960
 can we say that our lives fully exemplify

702
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:57,100
 these kingdom qualities or these kingdom characteristics?

703
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:00,220
 You know, one of the things that I like to do

704
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:02,180
 during my free time is to go on a run.

705
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,580
 And usually, on Saturday morning,

706
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,380
 I will go for a longer run.

707
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:07,340
 And so, these past two weeks,

708
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,900
 I've just been spending a lot of time

709
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,980
 just preparing this sermon,

710
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:14,760
 reading through Matthew, Chapter 5.

711
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,460
 And on one of my runs,

712
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:18,460
 so I was out there on Archer,

713
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:21,380
 and I came to the stoplight between Archer and Halstead.

714
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:24,940
 So, when the light turns green,

715
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:27,260
 when I was about ready to cross,

716
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,140
 'cause the pedestrian is green as well,

717
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:31,180
 so when I was about to cross the road,

718
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,340
 there's this one car basically just ignore

719
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,660
 the pedestrian light,

720
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,260
 and he just make a left turn right in front,

721
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,860
 right when I step on the road,

722
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,780
 he just turn right in front of me.

723
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,540
 And at that moment, I was pretty frustrated.

724
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,140
 I was like, "What are you doing?

725
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,840
 "You almost ran over me."

726
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:50,200
 And in my mind, I was thinking,

727
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,200
 "I am on the right here because I follow the rules.

728
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,300
 "The pedestrian light just turned green,

729
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:58,400
 "and you are a car you're supposed to give

730
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,780
 "the pedestrian the right of way, right?"

731
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,800
 So, at that moment, I was like,

732
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,540
 "Man, I am justified in my anger,

733
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:06,840
 "but this guy just doesn't follow the rule."

734
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,620
 So, as a reaction to it, I was like,

735
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,740
 I just do this as he drove past me,

736
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:13,580
 and then I stare at his car for a little bit.

737
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:16,240
 And right when I cross to the other side of the road,

738
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,420
 one of the Beatitudes just pop out in my mind.

739
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:23,740
 "Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth."

740
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,040
 And right at that moment, I was like,

741
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,300
 "Oh, man, Lord, I am about to preach this sermon

742
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:31,580
 "in less than two weeks, and yet what I just did

743
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,840
 "is something that doesn't represent

744
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,080
 "what God's people should look like."

745
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,980
 And for the rest of my run, I was basically like praying,

746
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:41,480
 like asking for forgiveness, and kind of like

747
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,120
 asking the Lord to change me, to change my life,

748
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,840
 so that I can live in a way

749
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,160
 that truly represent His kingdom.

750
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:52,560
 So, I'm sharing this not, yeah,

751
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,660
 just as a way of like being honest of like,

752
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:58,400
 these standards of righteousness that Jesus gave us

753
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,500
 is not easy, but this is actually an invitation

754
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:05,240
 to a way of life that will lead to flourishing

755
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,120
 and blessings, even though they might seem

756
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,040
 counter-cultural at times.

757
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,800
 We saw kind of like Jesus teach about,

758
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,480
 "Turn the other cheek when people hit you,"

759
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,840
 or like, "Walk the extra mile when people ask you

760
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,360
 "to walk like a mile with them."

761
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:21,300
 So, these are the ways that as God's people,

762
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:24,600
 as followers of Jesus, this is how we should live our life,

763
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,880
 because we are part of God's upside-down kingdom.

764
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:31,120
 So, what I want to leave you all with is this question,

765
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:35,440
 is some of these questions to reflect on for this week.

766
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,960
 So, do we live our day-to-day life in a way

767
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,320
 that actively brings glory to God?

768
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,320
 And to do it better, what are some of the things

769
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,520
 that we need to stop doing,

770
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,040
 and what are the things that we need to,

771
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,000
 oh, I put two stars there,

772
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,360
 but what are some of the things that we need to stop doing,

773
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,820
 and what are some of the things that we need to start doing,

774
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:58,860
 so that our lives can be more of a better representation

775
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:02,120
 of who we are as kingdom, as people,

776
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,320
 as citizens of God's kingdom?

777
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,580
 So, I hope you can take some time this week

778
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:09,800
 just to pray about it, and reflect on your own life,

779
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:13,080
 and see what God speaks to you.

780
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,780
 So, let's pray.

781
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:23,800
 Heavenly Father, we thank you that you show us

782
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:27,960
 the perfect examples of what it looked like

783
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,700
 to be a citizen in your kingdom through Jesus.

784
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:34,200
 We thank you that through Jesus,

785
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,560
 we are able to be part of your kingdom.

786
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,880
 And I just pray for us right here in this room

787
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,400
 that your Holy Spirit will be with us

788
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:46,000
 as we continue to live our day-to-day life.

789
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,360
 So, I ask that your Spirit will point out to us

790
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:51,680
 the areas in our life that doesn't represent who you are.

791
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:55,960
 I ask that your Holy Spirit will also be with us

792
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:59,440
 to give us the strength, to give us the ability

793
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,240
 to live in a way that truly exemplifies

794
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:06,320
 the God that we represent here on Earth.

795
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,920
 So, I just ask that you will remind us

796
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,560
 that we are part of your kingdom,

797
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,300
 and it is such a privilege and honor

798
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,120
 to be part of your kingdoms.

799
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:18,600
 And as your people, you have given us the mission

800
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,100
 to continue to bring your light

801
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:23,720
 to the darkness in the world around us.

802
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,200
 So, I just ask that your Holy Spirit

803
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,880
 will give us the power, give us the ability

804
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:31,480
 to live in a way that brings glory to you,

805
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:34,040
 that brings glory to your name.

806
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:37,040
 So, pray this in your Son's name, amen.

807
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,680
 Okay, so Mark is not here today,

808
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,320
 so I will be dismissing you all.

809
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,840
 But right before that, I just want to encourage you,

810
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,320
 we have some light refreshment outside.

811
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:50,240
 So, don't just leave right after the service.

812
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,120
 Stay back, talk to people, catch up with some people,

813
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,600
 fellowship, enjoy some good food.

814
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,880
 Okay, go in peace, you be your love.
