[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   Good morning brothers and sisters
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:10.700]   Shalom to all of you who are joining this worship through online urban voice members and all the other brothers and sisters in the world
[00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:18.020]   Yeah, peace to you. God cares for us. He knows us and he is with us today
[00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:25.720]   I'm gonna share God's Word from the book of Acts chapter 1 verse 12 to 14 and verse chapter 2 verse 1 to 4
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.880]   two short passages
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:36.200]   So please prepare your Bible again the book of Acts chapter 1 verse 12 to 14 and chapter 2 verse 1 to 4
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.840]   If you can read the passage with me together
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.160]   Then they returned to Jerusalem
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.940]   From from the hill called the Mount of Olives a Sabbath days walk from the city
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:59.160]   When they arrived they went upstairs to the room where they were staying those present were Peter John James
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.880]   Andrew Philip and Thomas Bethlehem you and Matthew James son of Alpheus and
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.440]   Simon the Zillah and Judas son of James
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.080]   They all joined together
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:19.780]   Constantly in prayer along with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus and with it with his brothers
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.800]   second passage
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.800]   chapter 2 verse 1 to 4
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.400]   When the day of Pentecost came they were all together in one place
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:38.920]   Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.160]   They saw what seemed to be tongues of the tongues of fire
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.020]   That separated and came to rest upon each of them
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:54.680]   All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.320]   Amen, this is the Word of God
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.840]   Thanks be to God
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.840]   Let me pray briefly
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.080]   Father God speak to us Lord. We need you Holy Spirit
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.720]   More than anything else what we now need is you Lord
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.680]   Convict our hearts do your mighty work upon our hearts. We are waiting for you
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.300]   Speak to us in Jesus name we pray
[00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.000]   Amen
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.760]   My dear brothers and sisters the title of today's message is
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.560]   pray
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:37.560]   Extraordinarily to be filled with a Holy Spirit one more time. The title is the title is pray
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.280]   Extraordinarily to be filled with the Holy Spirit
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.280]   Let me ask you this question
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.000]   What is the most extraordinary experience for you in your whole lifetime?
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.240]   As some of you may know my story the most extraordinary experience for me is that
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:05.320]   God gave me my wedding date when I was praying and also my wife's name when I was sleeping even
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.360]   Before I met her I didn't meet her yet
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.920]   So it was very extraordinary experience for me
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.840]   today's story in the book of Acts chapter 1 and 2 also talks about a
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:24.760]   Super extraordinary story that we cannot expect in our daily life easily
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.520]   It can happen but it's very extra ordinary
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.680]   today's story happened on the day called Pentecost or
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:40.520]   Woosungje in Mandarin meaning 50th day. It was the 50th day
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.960]   after the first day of the Passover festival
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.520]   the Jews in Jesus with Jesus days were
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:56.040]   Celebrating the day Pentecost is the day of celebrating their harvest and bringing God their first fruits
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:03.480]   So on Pentecost one of the top three most important Jewish festivals all the Jews who were
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:11.720]   Scattered around the whole world whole nations for centuries. They came to Jerusalem and they celebrated this festival together
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:19.960]   At the same time before this day of Pentecost as you can see on the screen you'll see a map
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.040]   Yes
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.360]   Jesus died on the cross and rose on the Sunday
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.720]   where when counting 50 days began
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.760]   Then Jesus for the following 40 days
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:42.480]   Jesus spent with his disciples and his where he went back to the heaven on the Mount of Olives
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.880]   Which lies just about a one kilometer away from Jerusalem
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.480]   Then Jesus 11 disciples
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:58.000]   Because Judas is carried out who had had a sold Jesus killed himself those 11 disciples and others
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.840]   Around 120 people in total they gathered at a place and they had even praying together
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:10.640]   Constantly for 10 days as in verse 14
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.000]   Okay
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.560]   So that was the 50th day after Jesus rose again
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:23.720]   Then the most extraordinary day for the disciples began in today's passage
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.120]   Actually these three things happen to them
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:32.640]   What is that number one a sound like the blowing of a violent wind?
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.640]   Came from heaven and filled the whole house
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:44.120]   Second thing they saw what seems to be the tongues of fire that separated and came to rest upon
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:52.120]   It's one of them Wow and the third thing all of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.880]   Other tongues actually in other languages as the Spirit enabled them
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.720]   But think about this
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:06.040]   Before the Holy Spirit came upon them who were the yes look at the screen that that's what happened to them
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.920]   Before the Holy Spirit came upon them who were the disciples?
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:16.360]   How were the disciples number one when Jesus went back to the heaven?
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:23.040]   They were very much afraid the Jewish religious leaders. They had killed Jesus at the same time
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:28.640]   They were still hating Jesus disciples. So they were afraid of losing their lives
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:36.640]   Number two, who are they? They had been following Jesus for more than three years and their teacher Jesus died
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:42.760]   Rose from death and went back to the heaven and that they didn't know what to do. They were at a loss
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.920]   They didn't know what to do number three
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:51.160]   They didn't have any power or wisdom to do a new thing in this situation
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:58.960]   In short, they were fearful not knowing what to do and powerless powerless
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.120]   Then
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:08.680]   Today after receiving the Holy Spirit into this passage, how did the disciples change?
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.920]   What does the change number one?
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:18.640]   They became so courageous and bold and they began to preach the goodness of Jesus even to the Jewish religious leaders
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.640]   Whom they were fearing
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.720]   number two the Holy Spirit
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:31.280]   Started the Christian Church on us on earth and the disciples were joining the most important work in human history
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:35.320]   In other words, they knew what they were doing
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:41.800]   Wow in the third change the disciples became also very wise and powerful
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:48.280]   Later when they opened their mouth and preached all the religious leaders and Jewish Jewish people
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:52.600]   They were surprised to see their wisdom and ability
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:57.640]   When the Holy Spirit comes upon a person what happens
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:06.400]   Yes a new heart driving away our fear and sadness and a new mind filled with wisdom and
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:11.080]   Good insight and a new life working with confidence
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:18.960]   Meaning direction and power. This is why Jesus says in Luke's gospel chapter 11 verses 13
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.960]   When you look at the screen, you can read it together
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:27.720]   If you then though you are evil know how to give good gifts to your children
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:34.640]   How much more will your father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:39.920]   You know brothers and sisters the best gift you can ever get from God
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:44.840]   The best gift your God can ever give you is the Holy Spirit
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.400]   Please remember this
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:48.480]   then
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:55.920]   How do we receive the Holy Spirit if he received this greatest and most powerful gift in our lives?
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:02.920]   You know what when we receive it most of the problems we have will be truly solved
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:04.960]   then
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:07.200]   How do we receive the gift of the Holy Spirit?
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.920]   the answer is
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:14.800]   Surprisingly simple why in today's space Caesar? What did they do?
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.680]   prayer prayer
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:23.320]   Prayer when Jesus talked about the Holy Spirit as the best gift God can ever give us
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:29.440]   Jesus was explaining how to pray in Luke's gospel chapter 11
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:34.080]   Okay, he was explaining about prayer life in this chapter
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:38.640]   Jesus tells a parable a story in the story
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:43.600]   There was a guy who had a friend visiting him from a far place
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:47.760]   But he didn't have anything to feed his friend at midnight
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:52.400]   so this guy he went over to one of his neighbor's house at
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:59.080]   Midnight and then bang bang bang. He pounded on the door of his neighbor's house
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:06.800]   I'm sorry. I have a friend visiting me now, but I don't have anything to give him
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:10.560]   please give me three loaves of bread and
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:13.960]   Jesus says
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:18.880]   The neighbor cannot give the bread because this guy is his friend
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:22.400]   but he gives the bread to this guy because of his
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:26.680]   Boldness, did you hear me because of his boldness?
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:32.200]   How did the man receive the bread? Yes, remember these two words?
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.520]   absolute
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:37.240]   desperateness absolute desperateness and
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:40.080]   complete wholeheartedness
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:48.680]   Complete whole heartedness. He went over to his neighbor's house and midnight and banged on the door and cried out to his neighbor
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:51.480]   Give me some bread
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.480]   Give me some bread
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:11:00.560]   My dear brothers and sisters actually this was the same attitude when the 120 people they were praying
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.480]   Constantly together for 10 days
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:10.440]   They were praying constantly for their receiving the Holy Spirit because Jesus promised it
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.920]   They were praying for it
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:19.880]   120 people praying together for 10 days day and night. That is the key
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.720]   How can you receive the Holy Spirit?
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.440]   You should show
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.440]   absolute desperateness or
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:31.360]   Complete wholeheartedness in your prayer
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:34.320]   Yes
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:40.480]   You need to make an extra ordinary effort in prayer. Have you ever prayed like that?
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:43.680]   Yes, you need to make an extra ordinary
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.560]   effort in prayer
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:53.680]   When you hear this part some of you may feel quite confused or just want to reject this teaching
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:56.160]   Because you have heard over and over again
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:00.960]   Our faith is all about grace
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:08.000]   Yes, I know. Yes, we were saved by grace. We live our daily life only by grace
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.880]   I know but why should we make any extra ordinary effort in?
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:17.320]   prayer apart from grace and
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:23.200]   This is the place you need to make a clear distinction between the two different notions
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.000]   one is in
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.080]   Dwelling of the Holy Spirit as you see on the screen in dwelling of the Holy Spirit
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:33.960]   The other one is in filling of the Holy Spirit, right?
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:40.000]   As you know very well the in dwelling of the Holy Spirit started
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:45.760]   When we repented of all of all our sins and accepted Jesus as our Savior and Lord
[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:50.040]   The Holy Spirit began to indwell us
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:58.200]   So if you are a true Christian the Holy Spirit actually lives in you now. Yes very well
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:04.560]   However, the in filling of the Holy Spirit is totally different dimension
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.800]   Think about this
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:12.000]   Think about this even before the day of Pentecost the disciples and all the other people
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.840]   120 people they were already saved and technically Christians
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:20.320]   Because they saw Jesus death and resurrection
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:23.880]   They believed in Jesus and they had been following Jesus
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:29.080]   So I believe that when they confessed their faith in Jesus with their mouth
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:33.120]   The Holy Spirit began to dwell in them
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:38.840]   They already had the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. Well, what's the matter?
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:43.040]   Even the Holy Spirit they began to dwell in them
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:49.240]   They were lacking in many ways as I shared in the above like what they were fearful
[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.400]   They didn't know what to do. They were powerless
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:59.400]   So what they needed was what they needed was at the moment was more of the Holy Spirit
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:06.480]   Not just the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, but in filling of the Holy Spirit and as in today's passage
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:10.240]   After 10 days of labor of prayer
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:14.760]   God literally filled them up with the Holy Spirit
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:22.760]   They were transformed by is this in filling of the Holy Spirit and they became powerful and super effective
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:25.480]   So let me summarize it here
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:33.360]   Indwelling of the Holy Spirit happens when we accept Jesus as our Savior and Lord and the Spirit begins to
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.520]   dwell in us
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:36.680]   then
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:44.040]   When does the infilling of the Holy Spirit happen if you are already a Christian what we now need is
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:51.320]   Yes, not the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, but the infilling of the Holy Spirit when we ask him
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:59.360]   When does the Holy Spirit empower us fill fill us up when we ask when we pray?
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:02.600]   Extraordinarily like those people
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:07.360]   My brothers and sisters
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:09.400]   Why do we need to have?
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:14.920]   Extraordinary prayer to receive the Holy Spirit the infilling of the Holy Spirit
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:19.240]   It is because the Holy Spirit is the most
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:24.560]   Extraordinary person. Did you hear me? Why should we pray like that?
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:31.080]   Because he is the most extraordinary person you can ever invite into your heart
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:34.960]   He's already in you, but you are inviting the empowerment
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:42.560]   Like what you cannot invite the president of the United States into your messy dirty and smelly room
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:44.480]   Right just like that
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:50.320]   If you want to invite the US president into a room you need to make proper preparation
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:53.280]   before that
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:58.320]   The Holy Spirit is triune God the Holy Spirit is God
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.840]   God is absolutely holy
[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:05.440]   Holy meaning totally different from all other creatures
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:09.760]   So inviting the Holy Spirit into our hearts needs our
[00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:18.280]   proper preparation and the extraordinary prayer is the best way of preparing ourselves for the gift of the
[00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:20.680]   infilling of the Holy Spirit
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:25.120]   Because of the following three reasons I'm going to talk about three reasons
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:28.520]   Number one. Why should we pray?
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:34.960]   Extraordinarily to receive the Holy Spirit to be empowered to be filled with the Holy Spirit
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:40.920]   First the Holy Spirit will fill your heart when you treat him as
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:48.840]   He is let me repeat the Holy Spirit will fill your heart when you treat him as he is
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:54.920]   Again, the Holy Spirit is God not your servant
[00:16:54.920 --> 00:17:01.340]   The Holy Spirit is the owner and the Lord of your life not your guest
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:05.160]   If you neglect the Holy Spirit in your heart and life
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:10.640]   The Holy Spirit already knows that if you neglect him, he knows that
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:16.240]   So if you are not ready to accept him as King and Savior and Lord
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:22.200]   He does not want to fill your heart fully and he cannot do any and it's something great
[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:24.920]   Showing his presence in you
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:31.440]   In other words you should desire and treat the Holy Spirit as a
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:38.640]   Number one person in your heart in your life. If not, the Holy Spirit cannot do anything
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:42.120]   Okay, do you know this? Have you thought about this?
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:46.060]   Have you ever used to the search engine Google?
[00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:52.380]   Alright, when you when you look at the screen Google search engine, how many times do you use a day?
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:57.400]   Here now I have Kelly. How many times do you look at look into Google a day?
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:00.880]   Uncountably
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:05.840]   Uncountably because Google is a number one search engine in America
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:10.920]   But my brothers and sisters have you ever used to talk to go?
[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:15.520]   What is that doctor go doctor go is one of the most used?
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:21.640]   Search engine in America number one Google number two being number three. Yeah
[00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:27.800]   Who number four doctor go but you never heard about the name doctor go because it is number four
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:32.160]   Number one and number four it has a whole whole a lot difference
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:37.280]   You never heard about it and you do not use it
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:40.880]   The same thing is happening in your spiritual life
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:47.280]   If you do not regard if you treat God as the number one person in your life
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:52.960]   You never heard about it. You didn't you never know him. You have nothing to do with him
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:55.520]   That's what is happening in your life
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:58.200]   so
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:04.000]   Until you make the Holy Spirit the number one person in your life. God cannot do anything
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.520]   So through your extra ordinary prayer
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:13.680]   you need to remove all the other idols and you love that you love more than God and
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:19.040]   Prepare your heart for the coming for the infilling of the Holy Spirit
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:26.560]   Second reason why should he pray extra ordinarily to receive the Holy Spirit?
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:34.800]   The Holy Spirit cannot fill your heart when it is too dirty or just a dirty when it is dirty
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:37.400]   The Holy Spirit cannot fill you up
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:40.080]   because God is
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:42.120]   incomparably holier than us
[00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:44.760]   Do you like the dirty smell?
[00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:49.960]   Till like the dirty odor we cannot endure it the dirty smell just like that
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:55.800]   God cannot endure our dirty sins. That is why in check at in the book of Acts
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:20:00.760]   Chapter 2 when people asked Peter, what shall we do Peter replied?
[00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:06.760]   Repent and be baptized and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:13.000]   Receiving the Holy Spirit and the infilling of the Holy Spirit is closely related to
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.240]   repentance
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:20.240]   Repentance does not mean mean just the easy your lips or words on your lips
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:24.160]   True true repentance should bring the true
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:26.760]   changes in your life
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:32.520]   If you have repented you should try not to commit the same sins again
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:35.480]   If you commit the same sin easily
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:39.640]   There is the reason God cannot enter your life
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:46.960]   Powerfully the Holy Spirit is not working in your life powerfully because you are repeating the same sins
[00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:51.480]   Again, and again so easily not honoring God and not fearing God
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:55.280]   My story
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:57.280]   before 2006
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:58.960]   Even though I love the Lord
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:04.680]   I was doing a lot of ministry in the church as a lay person and I was but I was easily
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:11.080]   Repeating the same sins. I didn't fear God and I was enjoying some sins in my life
[00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:15.200]   I was enjoying some sins, but to but from 2007
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:20.120]   2007 in my desperate prayer in my extraordinary prayer
[00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:26.640]   I began to hate my sinning and I began to fear God as if he were right beside me
[00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:31.160]   When I began to deal with my sins seriously like this
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:36.880]   Through prayer, you know what God gave me a new level of freedom and joy
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:43.000]   Through the extraordinary prayer God gave me a new level of freedom and joy
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:51.200]   That extraordinary prayer freed me from my habitual sins and I was literally I was literally
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:53.600]   filled with a Holy Spirit
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:58.160]   Last the third reason why should we pray?
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:01.000]   Extraordinarily to receive the Holy Spirit
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   because
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:10.400]   You can expect to be filled with the Spirit when you are literally again filled with him in your 24/7
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:12.600]   Do you get it?
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:18.400]   You can expect to be filled with the Holy Spirit when you are literally filled with him
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:21.480]   24/7 my brothers and sisters
[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:29.760]   Becoming a Christian is done when we confess our faith with our mouth believing in our hearts
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:34.400]   Believing living as a Christian is another dimension
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:41.200]   It requires our ongoing true commitment in our hearts in all of our actions
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:46.760]   In all of our actions in other words to live as true Christians
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:54.000]   You need to be trained in your life a lot of training like what how to think how to speak to others
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.600]   how to work how to spend your time how to spend your money and how to how to
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:08.400]   Fight against your old self. Our old self is the one which is really hard to kill and then how to spend how to
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:11.040]   resist the evil spirits
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:13.120]   temptations
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:20.520]   Actually, there are so many areas for which you need to train yourself and then it does not happen
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:25.080]   Automatically you need to spend your best quality time
[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:31.880]   How can you grow you spend your best quality time to grow yourself in faith and in godly?
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:37.480]   Lifestyle it requires your new heart and your new lifestyle
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:43.600]   So Timothy first Timothy chapter 4 second half of verse 7 says it says
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:47.120]   Train yourself to be godly
[00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:51.080]   Train yourself to be godly training
[00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:59.520]   However at the same time we all know that training ourselves in godliness is very hard
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:03.200]   This is not just a problem of spiritual matters
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:07.920]   Even think about this even taking of your body taking care of your body or
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:12.200]   Building a new set of a good habit is very difficult
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:16.840]   Just like now at the beginning of every year
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:20.720]   Sometimes you make very good plans very good goals
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:25.920]   But you know just a few days later or at most a few weeks later
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:31.520]   Many of us find ourselves not doing the good plan anymore
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:41.320]   So building a spiritually healthy habit is actually much harder than this physical habits
[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:45.440]   Why is it so difficult
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:52.160]   in the same verse first Timothy chapter 4 first half of verse 7 says
[00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:58.880]   Have nothing to do with godless myth and old wives tales. Let me repeat one more time
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:03.640]   Have nothing to do with godless myth and old wives tales
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:05.680]   What is that?
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:08.640]   Apostle Paul already two thousand two thousand years ago
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:15.320]   He clearly realized the true main reason why people were not growing spiritually
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:16.760]   Why?
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:23.520]   Because they were spending all their time in listening to godless myth and old wives tales
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:30.840]   Greek myth the godless myth Greek myth were great stories and many even many
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:34.360]   Greek myths were made into films even in our days
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:40.720]   So like what so Greek myths were like today's blockbuster film. Do you like blockbuster film?
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:47.200]   I did or like great movies and how about old wives tales old wives tales were
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.080]   superstition
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:50.520]   superstition or
[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:55.840]   Woman-centered stories which old woman told young women or children
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:26:01.520]   Repeatedly again and again. So like what like today's soap opera or
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:03.720]   dramas
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:08.160]   So my brothers and sisters, it's not a problem of our own own generation
[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:13.640]   2,000 years ago when there is no TV or internet or cell phone
[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:19.720]   People were already obsessed with the stories and they couldn't grow in their spiritual life
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:26.680]   Two forces are fighting right the story of the world and the story of God and
[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:31.280]   How much more than how much more difficult is it?
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:37.600]   Is it to live a truly spirit filled life in our own generation? Why?
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:40.320]   Today people are constantly
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:45.780]   Literally 24/7 connected to all kinds of media
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:50.200]   So God knows this
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:53.800]   The Bible commends us to be spirit filled
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:27:00.840]   Being filled with God's words God's thoughts God's minds and God's desire for our life
[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:08.680]   However, most of us are actually filled with the spirit of the world, especially through media
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:17.040]   Many of us are quite seriously addicted to all kinds of media and the small gods small gods of the world are
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:21.400]   Controlling you through media most of the time you need to know this
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:28.220]   The small gods of the world are controlling you through media most of the time
[00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:33.560]   That's why you feel quite empty in your heart empty and your life is disorderly
[00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:40.520]   You are busy with those media fidgeting all the time, but you feel that your life does not have any focus or
[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:42.480]   direction
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:46.440]   Because you are filled with the spirit of the world day and night
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:48.480]   my
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:50.720]   Dear brothers and sisters
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:53.320]   This is why we need to pray
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:28:00.480]   Extraordinarily to get out of this addiction addiction to the world and addiction to the spirit of this world
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:06.280]   If you pursue them like now if you are not freed from the spirit of the world
[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:12.000]   They will control you and drive you and they will drive you to meaningless and meaningless
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:19.640]   Moments and moments and your spirit and life will never grow. The problem is that you cannot grow
[00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:24.200]   Your relationship and your family life will not grow mature
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:29.520]   At the same time, you know this God has a special plan for each one of us
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:36.160]   But if you are addicted to the spirit of the world God cannot use you for his purpose
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:40.040]   Without being filled with the Holy Spirit God cannot use
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:42.560]   individuals or even a church
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:48.720]   We are all God's people whether it's an individual or a church. We need to be filled with a Holy Spirit
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:52.760]   My brothers and sisters, let me close
[00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:55.920]   In the beginning of every year
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:29:02.960]   When you are wondering how to bring true meaningful good changes in your life or how to be empowered
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:08.200]   To continuously practice those important necessary changes in your life
[00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:12.800]   Growing in prayer is the greatest solution
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:16.560]   When you pray extraordinarily as those
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:19.080]   120 people in today's passage
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:22.320]   God will fill you up with his spirit
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:29.000]   You know what and your life and your heart will surely experience the greatest change and the power
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.040]   That you cannot get through any other way
[00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:37.800]   Being filled with the Holy Spirit is the true cure for all our inner
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:45.920]   Brokenness, we are all broken and sick people and then all our sins and all our broken relationship
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:49.960]   Being filled with the Holy Spirit. That is the true cure
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:57.720]   So brothers and sisters make the Holy Spirit the number one person in your heart and in your desire
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:59.920]   the number one person

[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:28.760]   Brothers and sisters, let's pray together
[00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:34.640]   When you pray take a right posture, you can kneel down on your floor
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:38.520]   Please lower your lower your posture
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.240]   We are standing in front of the greatest King
[00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:46.080]   Who knows our hearts and desires and our life?
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:54.420]   Who understands the darkest problems in our hearts who understand the most serious problems in our life?
[00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:58.600]   So my brothers and sisters, let's pray together
[00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:02.200]   The prayer music is their prayer music
[00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:11.440]   Okay, let's pray in your heart first prayer as I shared this word brothers and sisters
[00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:19.840]   The reason God cannot empower us the reason we cannot be filled with the Holy Spirit is that we are
[00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:26.680]   Neglecting we do not honor him in many ways. There are so many other idols
[00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:34.000]   We are addicted by all kinds of media. You cannot spend the true quality time with God
[00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:38.360]   And then our heart is filled with all kinds of dirty things
[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:41.120]   If we are not holy enough
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:47.520]   God cannot intervene in our lives. If you do not welcome him the Holy Spirit cannot
[00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:55.920]   Intervene in your life. So my dear brothers and sisters now, let's pray with the right attitude and posture
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:58.280]   God come into my heart
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:04.080]   Remove all the dark and dirty sins and remove all the idols inside my heart
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:09.140]   Let's have this prayer of repentance together about our idols
[00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:15.600]   About our addictions to media and our dirty sins. Let's have this time of repentance
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:22.640]   Our heavenly Father have mercy on us Lord. We are broken people
[00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:29.160]   We are broken people Lord. Even we cannot keep our the best promises to you. Father God
[00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:33.800]   We are all broken people Lord and we do not have any vision in our eyes Lord
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:40.080]   Our life and our time is so disorderly Lord. We do not know how to honor you Lord
[00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:45.260]   We do not know how to love you Lord. Your eyes are all the time watching over us Lord
[00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:52.360]   But we are forgetting you in our lives Lord. So God would you do a new thing upon us Lord?
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:55.600]   Have mercy on us Lord. In this year Lord
[00:38:55.600 --> 00:39:02.240]   Oh Father God do a new thing in all of us Lord. All of the brothers and sisters in our life
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:07.720]   What we now need is your spirit Lord. Holy Spirit
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:12.120]   We need you Lord. We need you. Come to your people Lord.
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:16.480]   Come to your people and do a new thing in their lives Lord
[00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:22.680]   And my brothers and sisters
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:26.440]   Even for the most important thing
[00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:31.680]   Even for the really great things if you do not plan it
[00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:34.280]   If you do not make a good
[00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:37.000]   very clean plan about it
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.720]   You cannot do it
[00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:42.040]   So after this worship
[00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:46.000]   The Holy Spirit wants to bring the change into our lives. In other words
[00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:50.400]   He wants to lead you to the extraordinary prayer life
[00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:55.760]   So my brothers and sisters now when you pray make a decision in your heart
[00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:59.000]   God I want to pray more than ever before
