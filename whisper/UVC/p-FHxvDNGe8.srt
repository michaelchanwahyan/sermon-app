1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,640
 Good morning, everyone.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:13,840
 It's a frightening privilege to be here with you guys today.

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,040
 Before I begin, let's open in a word of prayer.

4
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:25,440
 Would you bow your heads with me as we pray?

5
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:31,880
 Heavenly Father, you have been so, so good to us.

6
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:38,040
 And sometimes, Lord, these words come out of us a little contrite.

7
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,040
 But God, you are the God, the creator of heaven and earth.

8
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,840
 From your word, there was light.

9
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,840
 And from your word, there was life in us.

10
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,320
 And so we come before you by the blood of your son, Jesus.

11
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,400
 Come humbly before your cross and ask that you would hear us, that you would know us

12
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:05,960
 and see us, that you would give us hearts that are softened to you.

13
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:14,120
 Ask that you would use this moment as we proceed to open our eyes to your word, to help us

14
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,120
 hear what it is that you have to say to us.

15
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:25,440
 For myself, Lord, I ask that you would guide my words, that you would help me speak good,

16
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:31,480
 sound doctrine, that you would protect the ears of my brothers and sisters from anything

17
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:35,680
 I say that is not of you.

18
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,680
 So we thank you, Lord.

19
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,680
 We praise you in Jesus' name.

20
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,680
 Amen.

21
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:49,880
 So for those of you who weren't here the last time I spoke, we are in the book of James,

22
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:55,960
 which is a letter from James to the Jewish Christians of the dispersion, which are the

23
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:01,640
 Jewish Christians scattered away from their homeland.

24
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:08,840
 And what we find in James are instructions, instructions given to these Jewish Christians

25
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,840
 on how they should be living.

26
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:18,240
 They're given so that James' brothers and sisters would live wise lives, lives that

27
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:24,100
 are reflective of the gospel that they have received.

28
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:33,000
 And what we find in James is that wisdom is not just knowing a lot about stuff, a lot

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,480
 about stuff that's about life, but rather wisdom must also include practical application

30
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,900
 of what we know about our God into every area of our lives.

31
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,280
 This is a theme that will come up again and again.

32
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:59,480
 James writes with this idea in mind, that followers of Christ can't just be hearers.

33
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,560
 No, not just hearers.

34
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,400
 They must also be doers of the word.

35
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,320
 So if you have your Bibles with you, I ask that you would open with me to the book of

36
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,000
 James.

37
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,200
 The passage is also going to be on the screen.

38
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,560
 I'll flip through the slides for you.

39
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:28,680
 Today we will be reading from James chapter 2, verses 1 to 13.

40
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:38,960
 Again, that is James chapter 2, verses 1 to 13.

41
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:45,960
 Let's read.

42
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:53,960
 My brothers and sisters, believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ must not show favoritism.

43
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:59,120
 Suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and fine clothes and a poor man

44
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,620
 in filthy old clothes also comes in.

45
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:07,280
 If you show special attention to the man wearing fine clothes and say, "Here's a good seat

46
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:13,440
 for you," but say to the poor man, "You stand there or sit on the floor by my feet," have

47
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,880
 you not discriminated amongst yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?

48
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:23,760
 Listen, my dear brothers and sisters, has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes

49
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:28,480
 of the world to be rich in faith and inherit the kingdom He promised to those who love

50
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,560
 Him?

51
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,760
 But you have dishonored the poor.

52
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,840
 Is it not the rich who are exploiting you?

53
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,640
 Are they not the ones who are dragging you into court?

54
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:41,520
 Are they not the ones who are blaspheming the noble name of Him to whom you belong?

55
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,640
 If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, love your neighbor as yourself,

56
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:50,120
 you are doing right.

57
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:55,160
 But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers.

58
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:00,720
 For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all

59
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,800
 of it.

60
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:07,120
 For he who said, "You shall not commit adultery," also said, "You shall not murder."

61
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,760
 If you do not commit adultery but do commit murder, you have become a lawbreaker.

62
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:16,440
 Speak and act as those who are going to be judged by the law that gives freedom because

63
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:21,480
 judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful.

64
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:30,760
 Mercy triumphs over judgment.

65
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:38,520
 Now the amazing thing about James is that his instructions are very, very straightforward.

66
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:44,880
 Now look, my brothers and sisters, believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ must not

67
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,400
 show favoritism.

68
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:54,120
 To his brothers and sisters, James says, "Since you believe in Jesus, you must not show favoritism."

69
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,120
 It's right there.

70
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:02,440
 If you are a believer in Jesus Christ, you have no business showing favoritism.

71
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,240
 So what is favoritism?

72
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,240
 Does anyone know?

73
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,360
 Can anyone give me a definition?

74
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,240
 Okay.

75
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,920
 Well, I'll give you one.

76
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:22,440
 Favoritism is this practice of special treatment, okay?

77
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:27,840
 Special treatment of valuing things or people differently.

78
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:34,600
 And what often comes along with this word is that favoritism is unfair.

79
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:44,520
 I think most of us here have experienced favoritism or even shown favoritism at some point in

80
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,520
 their life.

81
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,660
 You know, sometimes it's the small things.

82
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:58,460
 Maybe it looks like going...it might look like certain lunch suggestions being more

83
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:02,960
 acceptable and then you never get to go where you want to go.

84
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:09,540
 It might look like the favorite food of your brothers and sisters constantly being eaten

85
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:13,720
 night after night because your parents love them very, very much and so you're stuck eating

86
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,360
 that food.

87
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:24,420
 Other times, it might look like conversations that are cut short or even avoided so that

88
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:29,200
 you can spend more time talking to your closest friends.

89
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:34,560
 It might look like excess friendliness to the professor who grades your papers.

90
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:41,360
 It might look like friendliness towards the person who writes your paychecks.

91
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,840
 But let's let James show us what favoritism looks like.

92
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,800
 I realize now that I did not keep going with the slides so you can read along with me.

93
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,880
 But that's okay.

94
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,920
 We're going to look at James chapter two.

95
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,800
 We're going to look at what favoritism looks like.

96
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,460
 We're given this scenario in verses two to four, right?

97
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,460
 Look with me there.

98
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:12,040
 Two to four where we find two men joining believers in their place of meeting.

99
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:17,580
 For if a man wearing a gold ring and fine clothing comes into your assembly and a poor

100
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:22,240
 man in shabby clothing also comes in, and if you pay attention to the one who wears

101
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,760
 the fine clothing and say, "You sit here in a good place," while you say to the poor man,

102
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:31,520
 "You stand over there or sit down at my feet," have you not then made distinctions among

103
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,960
 yourselves and become judges of evil thoughts?

104
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,960
 There's one man.

105
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,600
 He's dressed in fine clothes.

106
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,480
 His fine clothes are bright and shining, right?

107
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,440
 That's the description that's given about him.

108
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,080
 He wears this gold ring that lets everybody know.

109
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,820
 It announces how high his socioeconomic status is.

110
00:08:53,820 --> 00:09:00,220
 The other is described as this poor man, a man in filthy old clothes.

111
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:05,360
 In contrast to the man in fine clothing, this man's unwashed, right?

112
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,180
 And his clothes are mismatched.

113
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:14,060
 It is easy to tell what rung of society he is on.

114
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:20,180
 Favoritism in this case looks like offering a good seat to the man wearing fine clothing

115
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:27,060
 while telling the poor man to stand there or sit where people are resting their feet.

116
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:35,380
 It's this honoring of the well-off man for his appearance, for his wealth, and this dishonoring

117
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:40,280
 of the poor man based on his lack.

118
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:47,880
 Doing this, James writes, is not only favoritism that believers must not show, it's also discrimination

119
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,640
 against yourself.

120
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:58,100
 And it makes you into a judge with evil thoughts, into a judge that judges poorly.

121
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:03,540
 Remember that the people James writes to are a scattered people.

122
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,000
 These are people who live in a foreign land.

123
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,440
 They are suffering under discrimination.

124
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,280
 They are greatly in need.

125
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:15,800
 And so the judgment that is being made towards the poor man and the treatment he's given

126
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:23,920
 in this what-if scenario is the very same treatment and judgment that they are receiving.

127
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:30,680
 This is important to remember because we're so quick to think, of course, favoritism is

128
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,680
 wrong.

129
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,840
 Anyone can tell you that.

130
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,640
 You should not discriminate.

131
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,640
 And you know what?

132
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,840
 It's not that difficult to avoid these things.

133
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:42,000
 We think about that so easily and so quickly.

134
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,680
 But think about these.

135
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:49,160
 Think about how helpful it would be to a poor group of people if someone with wealth and

136
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,980
 resources were to join them.

137
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:57,020
 Think about the extra burden that will be placed on this group of people just from having

138
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:02,340
 one more poor person join them, one more mouth to feed when you yourself have nothing and

139
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:06,120
 are struggling to feed yourself.

140
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,160
 You see, favoritism is tempting.

141
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,020
 Favoritism is very tempting.

142
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:16,520
 And James writes this to his brothers and sisters because this is a real and present

143
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,820
 problem.

144
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:25,820
 He talks about this because it's a real flaw in our character in Christians that keep us

145
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:32,280
 from being whole and complete in our entire being like Jesus.

146
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:36,460
 So then, how does James tackle this problem?

147
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:43,400
 If you look with me to verses 5 to 7, I'll actually turn the slide this time.

148
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,560
 It says, "Listen, my dear brothers and sisters.

149
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,180
 Has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and

150
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:55,540
 to inherit the kingdom He promised to those who love Him?

151
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,100
 But you have dishonored the poor.

152
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,100
 Is it not the rich who are exploiting you?

153
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,580
 Are they not the ones who are dragging you into court?

154
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:08,580
 Are they not the ones who are blaspheming the noble name of Him to whom you belong?"

155
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,900
 He starts to listen, right?

156
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:16,220
 "Listen," James says, "your attention right here, your attention on this," which is a

157
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:22,440
 rhetorical question, rhetorical meaning that this is a statement of truth that is disguised

158
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,580
 as a question, all right?

159
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:30,420
 "Has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith,

160
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,620
 to inherit the kingdom?"

161
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:39,780
 And reading this, the response of James' brothers and sisters is, "Yes, of course, God has chosen

162
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,740
 those who are poor in the eyes of the world."

163
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:47,020
 They can't say otherwise because, you see, these are Jewish Christians.

164
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:55,660
 The history of their people, of those who are tied to the line of Abraham is just filled

165
00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:00,300
 with God's concern for the lowly and the needy.

166
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:06,380
 The literature of Israel is filled with this theme of God's love for the poor, for the

167
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,100
 widowed.

168
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:15,100
 God's blessings are even promised to those who care for the poor, who see the poor and

169
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,140
 reach out to them.

170
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:22,060
 Furthermore, what's even more than that is that the brothers and sisters in James, the

171
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:30,220
 audience to whom he writes, they are living proof of God's doing.

172
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:35,380
 God has chosen them, even though they were poor in the eyes of the world, to be given

173
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:39,820
 faith and to be heirs of God's kingdom.

174
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:44,980
 Instead of treating them poorly based on external appearance, God's attitude towards the lowly

175
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:51,340
 and the needy is that of compassion, of mercy, and of love.

176
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,340
 So yes, it's true.

177
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:56,660
 God cares for the poor in the eyes of the world.

178
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:04,900
 So then, to dishonor the poor is to go against God's attitude, to go against the will of

179
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:09,780
 God, to represent the opposite of God's will.

180
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:15,580
 What we find here is that believers in Jesus must not show favoritism because God does

181
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:18,900
 not show favoritism.

182
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,780
 Believers must not show favoritism because God does not show favoritism.

183
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:26,780
 God does not make judgment based on outward appearance.

184
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:31,220
 He looks at the heart.

185
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:35,420
 And so, James reminds his brothers and sisters of God's attitude towards the lowly and the

186
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,420
 needy.

187
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:39,620
 He reminds them of God's attitude towards them.

188
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:44,780
 And by keeping this in mind and remembering God's compassion, believers can overcome this

189
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:48,300
 temptation to show favoritism.

190
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,500
 But James does not just leave it there.

191
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,500
 He doesn't just leave that be.

192
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:58,140
 The issue with favoritism isn't just that it fights against God's compassion.

193
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:03,620
 You see, favoritism is a sin.

194
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:10,980
 This is the second point that we find in James, that believers in Jesus must not show favoritism

195
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:15,860
 because favoritism is sin.

196
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,680
 Let's look at verses 8 to 11.

197
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:23,680
 If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, love your neighbor as yourself,

198
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,500
 you are doing right.

199
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:30,400
 But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers.

200
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:35,840
 For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all

201
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,840
 of it.

202
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,480
 All right?

203
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,440
 It's pretty straightforward.

204
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,200
 Believers that keep the royal law, right, they are doing right.

205
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,600
 They're doing well.

206
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,680
 But here's another question.

207
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,120
 What is this law?

208
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,320
 What is this law that he speaks of?

209
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,880
 This is the sovereign and royal law of God.

210
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:04,380
 It points to the law of Moses that is declared again by Jesus and fulfilled in Jesus.

211
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:10,520
 It points towards the commandments found in Leviticus chapter 19 of how God's people are

212
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:17,440
 to be holy, how they are to be set apart for him, and it points towards what Jesus declares

213
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:25,120
 to be the second most important of the commandments, to love your neighbor as yourself.

214
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:32,400
 In Leviticus 19, there is command after command given on how to treat those around you.

215
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:40,120
 Anyone and everyone you come into contact with in God's eyes is your neighbor.

216
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,760
 You see, favoritism is sin.

217
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:54,440
 Favoritism is transgression because both the poor man and the rich man are your neighbor.

218
00:16:54,440 --> 00:17:02,040
 It's not enough to just keep the commandments of God in some ways or even most ways.

219
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:09,200
 Under the law, it is not good enough to almost be good enough.

220
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:17,280
 To stumble at just one point, at just one point, is to be guilty of breaking all of

221
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,880
 the law.

222
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:26,040
 The law requires absolute perfection, and we're not perfect.

223
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:31,960
 Nobody here can say that they are a perfect keeper of the law.

224
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:37,240
 If you understand this, then you are on the same page as James.

225
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,600
 Nobody can get to heaven through their perfect law keeping.

226
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:45,720
 The statement of absolute requirement of the law is placed here to remind James' brothers

227
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:52,920
 and sisters of who they are because they're not people who have perfectly kept the law.

228
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:58,360
 They are people who have had the law perfectly kept for them.

229
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:02,200
 They're not people who are crushed under the judgment of the law that condemns.

230
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,200
 No.

231
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:12,360
 James' brothers and sisters are those that are under the law that liberates.

232
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:16,040
 What does James want his brothers and sisters to do?

233
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:27,160
 Well, we see in verses 12 to 13, 12 to 13, what not showing favoritism looks like.

234
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:32,360
 This is what not showing favoritism looks like.

235
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:37,480
 It looks like speaking and acting, not as someone who is under the law that condemns,

236
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:42,960
 but as someone who is under the law that gives freedom, as someone who is under grace.

237
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,680
 It's the same reason that was given before in verse 5, because Jesus Christ did not show

238
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,640
 favoritism.

239
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,160
 He did not judge you based on your outward appearance.

240
00:18:54,160 --> 00:19:00,160
 Instead, he saw you and he saw me in our helpless state.

241
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:06,300
 And in that moment where we expected judgment, where we deserved judgment, we were instead

242
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:12,960
 met with a deep and overwhelming compassion.

243
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,880
 Brothers and sisters, favoritism is such a poison to God's people.

244
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:26,480
 It damages relationships and it holds us back from spiritual growth without us even noticing.

245
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,520
 Because of the sin of favoritism, too many of God's people have found their church to

246
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:37,700
 be one of the loneliest, most disconnecting places they have ever been.

247
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:45,920
 To be surrounded by so many people while being unseen and unheard is just heartbreaking.

248
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,240
 And this cannot be allowed.

249
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:54,040
 We as believers of Jesus Christ cannot allow those who God has placed in our surroundings

250
00:19:54,040 --> 00:20:01,760
 as our neighbors to remain separated and disconnected from the body of Christ.

251
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,900
 Believers in Jesus Christ, you are under grace.

252
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,600
 You were shown mercy.

253
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,760
 Your sin was washed away once and for all.

254
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:17,640
 And not only that, your identity is now more than a worldly measurement of ability or accomplishment.

255
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:23,880
 You were chosen, you were elevated, and now exist as an heir to the kingdom of God.

256
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:31,520
 And having been freed by this law that liberates, live as a child of God, as an heir to the

257
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,640
 kingdom of God.

258
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:40,440
 Let your entire being be affected by the mercy of Christ and do not judge your neighbor by

259
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,360
 their outward appearance.

260
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,220
 Let's reflect on James' instruction.

261
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:50,420
 Do not show favoritism because Christ did not show favoritism.

262
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:54,640
 Do not show favoritism because favoritism is sin.

263
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,720
 Instead, show mercy and show compassion.

264
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:06,600
 See your neighbor the way Jesus sees them, the way that Jesus saw you, and approach your

265
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:13,560
 neighbor just as Jesus approached you in his compassion.

266
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,120
 Let me close us in a word of prayer.

267
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,800
 Would you bow your heads with me?

268
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:27,040
 Heavenly Father, again we are here before you because of your mercy and your grace.

269
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:34,040
 Because you reached out to us and you pulled us close to you.

270
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:39,640
 You decided for whatever reason in your mind that you wanted us.

271
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:48,360
 And so to an unlovable people, you loved us and you made us lovable.

272
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:53,280
 And so I pray in this moment, Lord, for my brothers and sisters here, that you would

273
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:58,720
 lay your hand on them and that you would remove the calluses that they have formed.

274
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,520
 You would remove the calluses from their hearts and that you would renew their hearts and

275
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:10,880
 their minds to give them new eyes and new ears, to renew them, Lord, to display before

276
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:18,640
 them the glory of your cross and to overwhelm them with your love so that they might in

277
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:26,080
 turn be representatives of who you are, that they might live as people who are under grace.

278
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:32,800
 And so help them find peace in you, Lord, help them find rest in you.

279
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:38,720
 And help them live every single part of their life affected by what you have done for them,

280
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,720
 Lord.

281
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,880
 We pray this in Jesus' name, amen.

282
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:53,880
