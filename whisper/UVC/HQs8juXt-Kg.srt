1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
 Pastor Mark.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,760
 (speaking in foreign language)

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,760
 - Hey everyone, good morning.

4
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:06,880
 (speaking in foreign language)

5
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,160
 I want to do something special today

6
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,160
 because I want to welcome everyone to be with us here

7
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,680
 and we want to appreciate your presence.

8
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,600
 (speaking in foreign language)

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,360
 Go ahead and stand up and find someone,

10
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,880
 find someone you have not said hi to today, okay?

11
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,120
 And go to that person and say, "It's good to see you."

12
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,040
 (speaking in foreign language)

13
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,200
 (audience chattering)

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,120
 (speaking in foreign language)

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,280
 (audience chattering)

16
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,200
 All right guys, well I know you have a lot to talk about.

17
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,600
 (speaking in foreign language)

18
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,120
 We will have time after the service, all right?

19
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,080
 (speaking in foreign language)

20
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,760
 Well, once again, I want to piggyback on Kelly,

21
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,560
 what she said about we need your help to build this church.

22
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,480
 (speaking in foreign language)

23
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:35,120
 And of course, we will appreciate the worship team

24
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,880
 for their music practice and their leading us today

25
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,480
 to worship God together.

26
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,080
 Let's, let's, let's move around our applause.

27
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,000
 (speaking in foreign language)

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,440
 And then of course, the backstage,

29
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,560
 we have some new system installed

30
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,040
 and so we are trying to work out the transition.

31
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,920
 So we want to appreciate each and every one of them

32
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,640
 inside the room, it's very hot in there.

33
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,560
 (speaking in foreign language)

34
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,480
 (speaking in foreign language)

35
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:12,640
 And of course, thank you for being with us today.

36
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,480
 (speaking in foreign language)

37
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,320
 And if you notice our title today,

38
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,560
 the sermon title is called Contagious Church.

39
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,480
 (speaking in foreign language)

40
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,560
 Now, as you see this title, I want you to think,

41
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,560
 are you a contagious Christian or are we a contagious church?

42
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,640
 (speaking in foreign language)

43
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:45,200
 Yeah, and a church full of contagious Christians

44
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,800
 is full of people who truly experience the grace of God.

45
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,720
 (speaking in foreign language)

46
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,960
 Now, let me give you two pictures to, you know,

47
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,680
 try to illustrate what it means to be contagious.

48
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,640
 (speaking in foreign language)

49
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,480
 And the first image I want to show you is a negative image.

50
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,520
 (speaking in foreign language)

51
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,840
 Now, you remember COVID-19, right?

52
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,400
 We could not hug each other, we cannot touch each other

53
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,880
 and we have to make sure we are people to people

54
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,920
 at least six feet apart.

55
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,840
 (speaking in foreign language)

56
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,480
 When you were in a room with other people,

57
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,520
 when you heard one cough and you got scared

58
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,520
 because the virus was spread, you know, fast and far

59
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,120
 and it would disrupt our relationship

60
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,120
 and actually it would disrupt our community.

61
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,040
 (speaking in foreign language)

62
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,920
 (speaking in foreign language)

63
00:03:50,920 --> 00:04:00,280
 And as you can tell, something can be contagious,

64
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,040
 something negative.

65
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,880
 Same thing happen when there's something wrong

66
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,720
 in our life like bitterness, it can be contagious.

67
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:14,720
 Cynicism can be contagious or lukewarm faith, you know,

68
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,240
 half-hearted faith or gossip or disunity.

69
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,280
 They're like, they're kind of like secondhand smoke

70
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,600
 and one person can change the whole environment.

71
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,520
 (speaking in foreign language)

72
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:40,920
 Now, that's the first image.

73
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,200
 I want to show you the second image though.

74
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,120
 (speaking in foreign language)

75
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,880
 So I want to ask you ever been in a room

76
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,280
 with a friend who laughs really loud?

77
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,400
 (speaking in foreign language)

78
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,440
 You know, when your friend laughs and you know,

79
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,800
 even you are kind of sad,

80
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,080
 but the laughter will change your spirit.

81
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:07,400
 (speaking in foreign language)

82
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,480
 So when you're around people who love God,

83
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,240
 who take God seriously,

84
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,800
 you should also eventually do the same thing

85
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,640
 because that is contagious.

86
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,320
 You know, our holiness, our full spirit life

87
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,640
 and our faith can be contagious.

88
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,560
 (speaking in foreign language)

89
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:33,480
 Now in Acts 2, we've been studying the book of Acts

90
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,280
 and we see that after the Holy Spirit comes

91
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:41,280
 and the whole community become a contagious church.

92
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,480
 (speaking in foreign language)

93
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:49,960
 And let me read this passage from 42 to 44.

94
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,880
 They, meaning the church in Jerusalem, the first church,

95
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,000
 they devote themselves to the apostles teaching

96
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 and to the fellowship and to breaking of bread

97
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,960
 and to prayer and everyone was filled with awe

98
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,520
 and many wonders, miraculous signs

99
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,600
 were done by the apostles.

100
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,600
 All the believers were together

101
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,000
 and had everything in common.

102
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,640
 They sell the possessions and goods

103
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,240
 and they gave to anyone who had need.

104
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,160
 (speaking in foreign language)

105
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,280
 Now, first, we need to know how to read the Bible.

106
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,160
 (speaking in foreign language)

107
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,920
 So when we read this passage,

108
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,920
 we should not think that we have to copycat

109
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,080
 or do exactly what they did.

110
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,000
 (speaking in foreign language)

111
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,520
 Because this kind of copycat, you know,

112
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,400
 reading and application is kind of too simplistic

113
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,800
 because the church in Jerusalem,

114
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,000
 they worship in a different way than we do

115
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,040
 and they worship in the temple court

116
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,640
 and they worship in the homes of other people

117
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,960
 and there were no place called church that they go to.

118
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,880
 Their homes are the church.

119
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,080
 So our context is different.

120
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:17,600
 So we cannot just copycat it and do exactly what they did.

121
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,560
 And we worship in a different way.

122
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,320
 We gather in a public place

123
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:26,320
 and we cannot simply just copy exactly what they do.

124
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,880
 (speaking in foreign language)

125
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,720
 So what the Bible describes

126
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,280
 is not necessarily what the Bible prescribes.

127
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,200
 (speaking in foreign language)

128
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,680
 But we can ask and we should ask,

129
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,040
 what kind of church were they

130
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,640
 in the first century Jerusalem context?

131
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:53,560
 (speaking in foreign language)

132
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,880
 And we should ask,

133
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,120
 what kind of church were they

134
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,200
 in the first century Jerusalem context?

135
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,240
 And how does their church,

136
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,760
 how does this church inspire us

137
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,160
 to be a church of Jesus today?

138
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,080
 (speaking in foreign language)

139
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:19,000
 So here in this passage,

140
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,600
 we see believers, ordinary folks,

141
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,520
 they live in a compelling way for the gospel

142
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,800
 and it was contagious

143
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,760
 and people were being drawn in and being attracted,

144
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,280
 not because the program

145
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,320
 or not because of their something,

146
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,400
 some of the activities that they did,

147
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,320
 it's the way they live in a compelling way

148
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,800
 to tell other that God is good.

149
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:46,640
 (speaking in foreign language)

150
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,960
 So let me suggest three things

151
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,560
 that we should pay attention to

152
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,480
 that will inspire us to live a contagious church life

153
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,120
 and Christian life.

154
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,120
 (speaking in foreign language)

155
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,720
 First and foremost,

156
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,240
 we should be a Christian.

157
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,160
 (speaking in foreign language)

158
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,480
 And second, we should be a Christian.

159
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,400
 (speaking in foreign language)

160
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,360
 First and foremost, be devoted.

161
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,720
 And secondly, they were generous.

162
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,280
 And third, they were alive in worship.

163
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:25,200
 (speaking in foreign language)

164
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,760
 Now, verse 42, it says,

165
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,040
 they were devoted themselves

166
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,200
 to the teachings of the apostle,

167
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,640
 to the teaching of the Bible.

168
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,760
 And you remember last week,

169
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,400
 I mentioned this point, be committed.

170
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,880
 I mentioned this point, be committed.

171
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,440
 We Christians need to be committed.

172
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,320
 Worship, coming together,

173
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,900
 are not occasional attendance.

174
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:56,200
 Never done in a way that is half-hearted.

175
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,240
 So they, if you pay attention,

176
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,000
 they were hungry for the word of God.

177
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,160
 And just like we are hungry,

178
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,720
 we want some food.

179
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,520
 But spiritually, they were hungry

180
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,200
 and they want to go for food,

181
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,560
 which is the spiritual food, the word of God.

182
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:17,280
 (speaking in foreign language)

183
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:34,400
 Like when you're hungry,

184
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,760
 you go to a happy lamb, right?

185
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,920
 (speaking in foreign language)

186
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,800
 And you want to devour the food.

187
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,320
 (speaking in foreign language)

188
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,760
 Now here, the church is hungry for the word of God.

189
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:51,240
 (speaking in foreign language)

190
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,840
 And brothers and sisters, I want to,

191
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,800
 you know, just want you to think about,

192
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,920
 you know, we do live in an age of distractions.

193
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:05,040
 (speaking in foreign language)

194
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,920
 Now everyone is busy, everyone is rushing,

195
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,440
 and we're trying to handle a lot of things

196
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,080
 more than we can handle.

197
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,960
 You know, sometimes spending time with God

198
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,960
 or studying the word of God with his people

199
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,920
 becomes optional.

200
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,840
 (speaking in foreign language)

201
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:31,200
 Now, when I was younger, much younger,

202
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,120
 when I was a young Christian in college,

203
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,040
 I didn't have a habit of reading the Bible

204
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,480
 or reading, you know, spiritual books,

205
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,440
 you know, but, you know, I observed myself.

206
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,680
 I started to spend more time with questions

207
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,040
 who take the word of God seriously,

208
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,560
 and I began to change.

209
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,520
 I began to, you know, cultivate the desire,

210
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,080
 or the desire to, you know, really taste

211
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,720
 and dig into the word of God

212
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,040
 and taste the goodness of knowing God himself.

213
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,960
 (speaking in foreign language)

214
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,320
 And let me ask you, what are you devoted to?

215
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:12,320
 Is there a hunger in your heart

216
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,440
 for prayer, for worship, for the word of God,

217
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,840
 for fellowship, for seeing people to come to Jesus?

218
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,360
 Now, if not, then we must change.

219
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,440
 We must realize that we are not the only people

220
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,760
 who are in the world.

221
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,360
 We are not the only people who are in the world.

222
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,640
 We are not the only people who are in the world.

223
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,960
 We must change, we must repent,

224
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:38,240
 and we need grace, the grace of God to have a fresh start.

225
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,480
 And because, you know, being a contagious church,

226
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,280
 being contagious Christians,

227
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:47,000
 we need to begin with a heart changed by the love of God.

228
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,920
 (speaking in foreign language)

229
00:12:50,920 --> 00:13:10,280
 Now, that's the first point, be devoted.

230
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:14,480
 The second point is be generous.

231
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,800
 (speaking in foreign language)

232
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,880
 44, 45, all the believers who are together

233
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,400
 and have everything in common,

234
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,000
 and they sell their possessions and goods

235
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,680
 and gave to anyone as he had need.

236
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,600
 (speaking in foreign language)

237
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:35,160
 Now, again, our context is different.

238
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,600
 There's no copycat here.

239
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,120
 We cannot do exactly what they did.

240
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,360
 But that is one of the most radical part

241
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,800
 of their commitment, is that people in need,

242
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,200
 when they saw it, they didn't say,

243
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,120
 let me just pray about it, or let me just wait for it.

244
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,200
 (speaking in foreign language)

245
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:10,400
 Don't get me wrong, prayers are good,

246
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,720
 and all this caring are good,

247
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,000
 but you see that all these believers

248
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,480
 in the first church of Jerusalem,

249
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,400
 they act together immediately,

250
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,880
 and they are generous, and they give.

251
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:25,560
 Now, this was not communism, okay?

252
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,240
 This was not communism, because it was not forced.

253
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,240
 It was not state-sponsored.

254
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,520
 It was moved by the spirit of God,

255
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,760
 moved by the love of God,

256
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,120
 because their lives are being transformed by Jesus,

257
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,400
 and they gave up everything,

258
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,760
 and be generous to help and to give to the church.

259
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,680
 (speaking in foreign language)

260
00:14:47,680 --> 00:15:05,760
 Now, if you know something about the Old Testament,

261
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,680
 you immediately would think of Deuteronomy 15,

262
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,760
 because there was a phrase

263
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,560
 that describes the first church of Jerusalem

264
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,840
 happens to be in Deuteronomy 15.

265
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,960
 Let me read that.

266
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,920
 There should be no poor among you,

267
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,360
 for in the land the Lord your God is giving you to possess,

268
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,840
 he will richly bless you.

269
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,640
 If only you fully obey the Lord your God

270
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,400
 and are careful to follow all these commandments,

271
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:39,400
 do not be hard-hearted or tight-fisted.

272
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,720
 Give generously without a grudging heart.

273
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,560
 Then, because of this,

274
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,480
 the Lord your God will bless you in all your work.

275
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:52,480
 (speaking in foreign language)

276
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,400
 (speaking in foreign language)

277
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:00,320
 (speaking in foreign language)

278
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,240
 (speaking in foreign language)

279
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:28,120
 Now, you see, in the Old Testament,

280
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,640
 God told his people Israel to be generous,

281
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:35,640
 and not only because there were needy people among them,

282
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:40,280
 mainly because that God will bless them.

283
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:44,080
 And now, in Acts 2, the Old Testament vision,

284
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,040
 this vision is becoming a reality,

285
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,880
 not through laws, but through love.

286
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,800
 (speaking in foreign language)

287
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,720
 (speaking in foreign language)

288
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:11,320
 You see, this is the logic of the kingdom of God.

289
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:16,320
 The way the world works is that when God bless me so much

290
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:20,000
 and I have extra, then I'll give a little.

291
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 That is the way of the world.

292
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,480
 (speaking in foreign language)

293
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,400
 (speaking in foreign language)

294
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:36,680
 See, God's way does not follow human logic.

295
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,880
 God said, "You be generous first.

296
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,800
 "You give in faith, then God will bless you richly.

297
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,840
 "And you practice generosity first,

298
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,240
 "and then you will experience the blessing of God."

299
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,160
 (speaking in foreign language)

300
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:57,080
 (speaking in foreign language)

301
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:07,600
 But as you know, our world is full of takers, not givers.

302
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,480
 You know, if there's food, I'll take as much as possible.

303
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,440
 If there are free things,

304
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,000
 I'll line up and get them all, right?

305
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,160
 You know, I drive by a food pantry

306
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,600
 on Ashland Avenue many times,

307
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,680
 and I see people line up for free things,

308
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,180
 and many of them are Chinese.

309
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:27,160
 And I do think there are needy people in the city.

310
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,040
 I do think we need to contribute.

311
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,600
 But, you know, I have observed many people line up,

312
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,080
 you know, they really don't need free food.

313
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,660
 They really don't need the free items,

314
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,920
 but they line up anyway.

315
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,240
 They take everything home anyway,

316
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,960
 and then, you know, there's so much food,

317
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:45,640
 and, you know, the food, the extra food got rotten

318
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,480
 and wasted.

319
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,320
 (speaking in foreign language)

320
00:18:51,320 --> 00:19:17,280
, and at times, you know, if you observe,

321
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,720
 even the church is full of takers.

322
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,680
 You know, the first thing people come to church is to take,

323
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:26,400
 is to get, to get something.

324
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,480
 And have you ever thought of, you know,

325
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,800
 the food in the cafe and the ministry?

326
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,840
 We need financial support.

327
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,760
 (speaking in foreign language)

328
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:51,280
 And a couple weeks ago, we had our annual core team retreat,

329
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,840
 and one of the most important items we discussed

330
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,000
 and pray about is our church finance.

331
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,720
 It's what we need to sustain and to operate our church.

332
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,960
 And as of the end of June this year,

333
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,920
 we lack almost 20,000,

334
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:11,920
 and we need more than 38,000 a month to operate,

335
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,840
 to pay the rent, and to, you know,

336
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,040
 pay the staff and support the ministries.

337
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,920
 And I think if you are practicing,

338
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,720
 tithes and offering regularly,

339
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,640
 and I wanna thank God for you,

340
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,760
 but if you are not,

341
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,760
 I think the Bible is challenging us to give regularly,

342
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,160
 and that is one of the things we take part

343
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,920
 in building the church together.

344
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:38,440
 (speaking in foreign language)

345
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:42,360
 (speaking in foreign language)

346
00:20:42,360 --> 00:21:05,520
 See, the word of God tells you

347
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,000
 that if you really wanna experience the love of God,

348
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,280
 the blessing of God, you must act first.

349
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:15,080
 You must act in faith, and not just our leftover,

350
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:19,000
 but our love, our response to the grace of God.

351
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,920
 (speaking in foreign language)

352
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:30,400
 Now, remember what Jesus said in Luke 16.

353
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,960
 He says, "No servant can serve two masters.

354
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,240
 "Either he will hate the one and love the other,

355
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,360
 "or he will be devoted to one and despise the other.

356
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,840
 "You cannot serve both God and money."

357
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,640
 (speaking in foreign language)

358
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:57,160
 For years, you know, walking with Christ,

359
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,080
 you know, for decades, you know,

360
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:03,320
 I experienced that if my heart for God is conditional,

361
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,360
 there's no way I can experience

362
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,720
 the unconditional grace of God.

363
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,880
 And I wanna remind you, you know,

364
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,960
 a contagious church is one that gives freely.

365
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,800
 It's one that we receive the great grace of God,

366
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,160
 and then we offer our best.

367
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:24,080
 (speaking in foreign language)

368
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,280
 Now, the third point here is be alive in worship.

369
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,720
 And it says, "Every day, they gathered together

370
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,640
 "in the temple courts, and they broke bread in their homes,

371
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,520
 "and ate together, and they were glad and with sincere hearts,

372
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,280
 "praising God and enjoying the favor of the people.

373
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:53,000
 "And the Lord added to the number daily

374
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 "who were being saved."

375
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,920
 (speaking in foreign language)

376
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,840
 And you see this community was alive,

377
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,560
 and their hearts were joyful,

378
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:08,000
 and they worshiped together with, you know, will, attitude,

379
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,840
 and they didn't worship God out of duty.

380
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,920
 They did it with joy.

381
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,840
 (speaking in foreign language)

382
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,840
 And the Lord said, "You know,

383
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,440
 "if you're going to worship God,

384
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,760
 "you're going to worship Him with joy."

385
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,920
 Duty, they did it with joy.

386
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:32,840
 (speaking in foreign language)

387
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:42,360
 Now, God does not look at your appearance.

388
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:46,560
 God is not so interested in your, on the outside,

389
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,240
 how you look on the outside.

390
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,440
 God sees your heart deep inside.

391
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,640
 You know, when you come to worship,

392
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,320
 you come to pray and reflect,

393
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,680
 and we should all do this,

394
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,800
 and pray that and prepare us,

395
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,800
 help me, God, to love you with all my heart.

396
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,720
 (speaking in foreign language)

397
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:22,000
 Now, as I reminded you last week,

398
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 we Christians, we the church, are always visible in public.

399
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,240
 (speaking in foreign language)

400
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:39,240
 Now, you imagine if we are all takers, you know,

401
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,720
 new visitors, you know, people come to our community,

402
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,320
 they will feel it.

403
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,240
 (speaking in foreign language)

404
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,520
 And you see, if we are all givers,

405
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,520
 then God will sense, people will sense the life in us,

406
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,680
 the life of God in us.

407
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:00,560
 And people will see, you know, how they eat together,

408
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,200
 how they spend time with each other,

409
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,600
 how they worship together, and they gave generously.

410
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,640
 And people will say, "You know what?

411
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,920
 "I want to be part of that.

412
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,160
 "I want that too."

413
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:13,240
 And, you know, just a reminder,

414
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,000
 you know, last week I told you, all Christians, all of us,

415
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,800
 we are living under the spotlight.

416
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,720
 (speaking in foreign language)

417
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,560
 We are living under the spotlight.

418
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:28,920
 (speaking in foreign language)

419
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:45,240
 So my conclusion will come to this question.

420
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,800
 Does your life make the gospel attractive?

421
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,200
 (speaking in foreign language)

422
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,240
 Now, when someone sees you,

423
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,480
 would that person want to follow Jesus

424
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,880
 after watching how you live?

425
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,800
 (speaking in foreign language)

426
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:10,720
 And a contagious Christian life is worshipful, joyful,

427
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,680
 and, you know, it's a sharing life.

428
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:18,600
 (speaking in foreign language)

429
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:24,600
 And that is the life of church this Holy Spirit creates.

430
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,640
 Well, it doesn't mean we are all perfect.

431
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,120
 We all have our flaws and we all have our shortcomings.

432
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,560
 But, you know, that's what the Spirit is trying to create,

433
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,080
 a new church, a new life.

434
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,600
 And it's not a private life and that's not personal life,

435
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,040
 but a visible life.

436
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:43,080
 It's not a strange life, but a generous life.

437
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:47,000
 (speaking in foreign language)

438
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,960
 See, you come to God today

439
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,760
 and God wants to do something for you.

440
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,200
 You know, God wants to transform your life.

441
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,960
 God wants your life and your heart and your home

442
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:59,960
 to be contagious with His love and grace and generosity.

443
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:05,320
 (speaking in foreign language)

444
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:08,240
 Just like people were drawn and being attracted

445
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,560
 to the community of Acts 2.

446
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:16,000
 (speaking in foreign language)

447
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,960
 And that's why we are here today.

448
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,880
 (speaking in foreign language)

449
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:28,400
 And that's why we are here today.

450
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:32,320
 (speaking in foreign language)

451
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,480
 So there are three important steps or simple steps

452
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,080
 I want to suggest to you today.

453
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:43,000
 (speaking in foreign language)

454
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,240
 First, starting today, read the Bible every day

455
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,080
 and connect with other Christians.

456
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:56,240
 (speaking in foreign language)

457
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,160
 And practice generosity.

458
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:02,080
 (speaking in foreign language)

459
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:06,520
 And we all need to give as much generously

460
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:10,040
 to support the ministry.

461
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:13,720
 And third is to worship God wholeheartedly.

462
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:17,640
 (speaking in foreign language)

463
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,800
 Now, remember last week, what happened?

464
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:24,200
 You know, each of you get a name, right?

465
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:28,440
 (speaking in foreign language)

466
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,040
 Did you learn that name?

467
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,640
 (speaking in foreign language)

468
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,000
 Did you pray for that person?

469
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,160
 (speaking in foreign language)

470
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,480
 You did, I see nodding heads.

471
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,880
 That's great, that's great.

472
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,920
 (speaking in foreign language)

473
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:41,440
 If you've forgotten, if you've forgotten about it,

474
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,680
 (speaking in foreign language)

475
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,520
 that's okay.

476
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,520
 (speaking in foreign language)

477
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,840
 You have one more week to go.

478
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,240
 (speaking in foreign language)

479
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,000
 So this coming week, remember that person, okay?

480
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,880
 (speaking in foreign language)

481
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,600
 And today, I know there are new faces among us.

482
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,720
 (speaking in foreign language)

483
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,320
 So I want you, after the service,

484
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:05,000
 to go to someone who's new to us.

485
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,920
 (speaking in foreign language)

486
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:14,160
 And learn that person's name.

487
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,320
 (speaking in foreign language)

488
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,440
 And then pray for that person.

489
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,520
 (speaking in foreign language)

490
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,520
 All right, so remember these three things.

491
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,720
 (speaking in foreign language)

492
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,480
 Okay, read the Bible every day and connect with others.

493
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,800
 (speaking in foreign language)

494
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,960
 And then practice generosity.

495
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,920
 (speaking in foreign language)

496
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,560
 And worship God wholeheartedly.

497
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,800
 (speaking in foreign language)

498
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:36,360
 And after the service, I want you to do a little more, okay?

499
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,440
 (speaking in foreign language)

500
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,680
 Remember you had the name from last week.

501
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,520
 (speaking in foreign language)

502
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,320
 Okay, after the service.

503
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,440
 (speaking in foreign language)

504
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,560
 Go to that person.

505
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,760
 (speaking in foreign language)

506
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,800
 And this is what you're gonna say.

507
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,400
 (speaking in foreign language)

508
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,880
 Thank you for worshiping with us today.

509
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,000
 (speaking in foreign language)

510
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,160
 Okay, can you do that?

511
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,000
 (speaking in foreign language)

512
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,960
 It's pretty easy, right?

513
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,080
 Secondly, okay, thank you for joining us in worship today.

514
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,320
 And secondly, you're gonna say,

515
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,560

516
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:12,840
 (speaking in foreign language)

517
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:17,320
 And third thing is I wanna worship you next week.

518
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,440
 Worship with you next week.

519
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,200
 (speaking in foreign language)

520
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,080
 Okay, first thing is what?

521
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:25,920
 (speaking in foreign language)

522
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,760
 Go to that person and say,

00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,200
 thank you for worshiping with us today.

524
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,680
 (speaking in foreign language)

525
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,840
 Secondly is how can I pray for you this week?

526
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,240
 (speaking in foreign language)

527
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,080
 Now don't talk too long, okay?

528
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,360
 (speaking in foreign language)

529
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,040
 Okay, it's very, very concise and tell them,

530
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:45,040
 you know, okay, this is how I can pray for you this week.

531
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,800
 (speaking in foreign language)

532
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:51,000
 And thirdly is I wanna see you next week.

533
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,680
 I wanna worship God with you next Sunday.

534

 (speaking in foreign language)

535
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,040
 Shall we do that?

536
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,640
 (speaking in foreign language)

537
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,360
 And remember, we have to build the church together.

538
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,080
 (speaking in foreign language)

539
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,800
 Every single one of us.

540
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,080
 (speaking in foreign language)

541
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,800
